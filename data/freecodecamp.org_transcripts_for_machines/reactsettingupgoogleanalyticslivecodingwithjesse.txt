hey everybody its Jesse and I hope everybody had a nice weekend I had a long weekend it was a holiday here in the US yesterday so that's why I didn't stream yesterday and I tried I tried really hard to take a break from coding since I've been a little bit burnout at the end of last week so I think I went to full day's without coding anything I did do some work on Saturday but Sunday and Monday I did nothing so it's been a really long time since I learned two full days without coding anything so that was that was kind of nice relaxing so today we're going to try to get Google Analytics working with this so there's we have Google Analytics already on there if you've been watching you might remember when we added that in but it's not working exactly the way we wanted to I knew this was going to happen I just didn't have time to deal with it before the launch and as I suspected we haven't really had very much traffic so it's not a big deal that the analytics aren't like a hundred percent what we want them to be but I'd like to get them up and running the right way as soon as I can so we can start getting the best data so let me show you what the problem is well Alex I'll tell you what it is and then I'll show it to you in case you're not sure what I'm talking about we're using clientside routing so when the page first loads Google Analytics loads like normal okay the tracks a page you but then after that when we click to another page in the site the analytics code doesn't do anything it doesn't register that a new that it changes has happened so no data gets that so I'll show you what's going on and let me pull this off for a second and I'll bring in the site okay so I'm going to I've got the the realtime analytics up right now and all this is showing is just who's on the site right now and what page they're on ok so right now I'm on the team page I'm going to hit refresh let's see if this will do it for us let's see if we refresh will trigger if I'm gonna have to completely open up a new there we go okay so refresh triggered this then I'm on the team page right now okay and that's registering should be on the map yep that's where I am so now when I go let's say to the about page nothing is nothing has happened it's not coming up that it's about I can go over here courses events none of these are registering and so we are getting like an accurate count of how many people are coming to view the site but we're not getting an accurate count of how many pages on the site they're visiting all right we only get that first page you and then if they happen to do a refresh a full page refresh to manually then we get that all right but it would be nice to know you know all the other pages that they go to so that's what we want to set up and normally I've set this up for single page apps before where you have client side riding without a page refresh and it's not really huge do you just modify the code but in this case we have to be careful we we don't want this to run on the server side and we don't want to in particular we don't want to look for let me show you the code so you know talking um what we're gonna do sorry I was just kind of rush getting ready so I got it I can't remember where my windows are okay so what we need to do is look up basically like the path name so it will be something like instead of we're going to get rid of this code actually and try something different but you know we would make basically make a page you mean you know when we get the path name so we would look at window dot location dot path theme well on the server there is no window objects right so I don't I don't know for sure if that would create an error and mess the site up or if it just wouldn't log anything but I don't want to take that risk and and try to run this so I'm not my first idea when earlier today was well you know let's just you know through this code you know edit this code a little bit and we'll throw it in on you know some point like component did mount or something like that and we'll see what happens but I thought no I don't really want to to risk you know messing anything up I I wish we would have had time to test this out more beforehand we don't so now at some point we're going to have to put this on the live site to see if we're really getting any reading and Google Analytics at some point I would like to set up maybe a parallel site so that I could you know do some testing on that but you just don't have it right now so here's what I'm thinking I went on to some using next Jas before I go any further I'm just going to check hey everybody I have some people in the live chat that said hi so I don't want to ignore him hey it was somebody from the Philippines awesome okay all right so we're using next Jas that's what so we are using react but next Jas is basically kind of like a way to scaffold your react app so it sets up a lot of stuff for you like serverside rendering and routing although we are doing some custom routing it it does handle a lot of a lot of those things that might be difficult especially if you're first starting out with react you know you don't really need to know how all that stuff works to be able to make something with reacts I could really bog you down from from being able to try it out so it's really good if you used create react app before it's they're comparable things they both let you get started with react quickly so normally in a react project we'd probably be using something like react router and then there are really specific instructions for how to get Google Analytics working with react router but with next I haven't been able to find specific instructions so what I did find is an issue about adding the script tag so I assumed other people had the same issue and that was correct assumption so a lot of people have also been dealing with this and some of the things like this this uses Google tag manager well we're not using Google tag manager so I'm not going to try that one obviously um there's some other solutions like down here it looks like this is working when you use react GA or GA so I decided to take a look at that I looked at how he implemented it here let me blow this up so far so you guys can can see it a little bit better uh this site that he's referring to the he built but it's pretty awesome and intricate but there's so much other stuff going on that it's hard for me to follow so it's not really a good example for me to use you know because this is this has a lot of other stuff built into the way it's doing things is so different so luckily recently within the last couple of weeks someone posted this so this is what we're going to try I'm not entirely sure exactly where all this stuff goes to be honest with you but hey that's that's how it is sometimes so this is going to be a little bit of I'm not really sure how this is going to work out but I want to get this working before I leave today and I'd like to leave early since I put in so much extra time the last few weeks so let's get started all right so I'm going to move this out of the way for a second so we can go over to the code and I'm going to bring this over um let's see lost my lost my window again sorry let me bring this I think I pulled it out so I would have it ready and I lost it here we go okay just to show you what we're going to use this is it so it's it's a package NPM package here that's specifically for using google analytics with react so we're not since we're using it in a specific way with next I don't really think a lot of this documentation is going to be that helpful for us I did skim a little bit honest I didn't I didn't really read the whole thing in a detailed way so we're going to install this and then we're going to apply try to apply it from that example that I showed you a second ago alright so let's pull over our command line so we can install this I was really trying to find a way to not have to install another package because that means I would have to install it on the server as well so that would be you know a few more seconds of downtime for the site when I update this I'd rather not have any downtime so until I get the setup where I can switch off between two versions of the site and have no downtime every time we do an update there's going to be is usually somewhere between 30 and 45 seconds of downtime if somebody's already on the site or has been on the site some of that's already cached since we're using that Service Worker so they may not realize the downtime or it may only be for a few seconds for them but I still would rather not have any all right so we're here in in our folder for our local version of this site and we're using yarn so we're not going to do an NPM install we're going to use yarn if you're not familiar with yarn I think I don't know if I liked it or not in the description but you can look up yarn it does the same thing as NPM but I think it's a little bit faster so I've been using yarn yarn so we're going to do yarn ad and we want react GA okay so that's done that's good now we can move this over and let me bring back and bring back this just to say this you can see it in case you're just you're just tuning in and you missed it I'll make this bigger well I was a lot bigger oh there so this is basically what we want to do we're going to import this this reactivated we just downloaded and we want basically these two functions okay so this we probably don't need to keep this this is just a chrome solo this will tell us it's working which is good we want to initialize this with our specific code so the each analytics property has its own code so we're going to put our own code in there and then this is what we'll actually log Paige you so remember I said we're going to look up we want the pathname alright so since it's not really a real page refresh all right we need to look up what the URL is manually and then we're going to set that as the page you instead of the default and then on component did mount we're going to initialize it and then log it so it's pretty straightforward pretty simple if you've worked with Google Analytics before and done any type of single page application with analytics like this is not new stuff I just haven't done this before with next so hopefully it all works I also haven't worked with react GA before so what I'm assuming happens like I said I didn't read thoroughly through everything what I assume happens is that there's something going on here that will make sure that this doesn't mess anything up when it we try to render on the server side so I I assume that simply because a lot of the discussion on that that thread on that issue and github was about that about this not running on the server so that's why I'm maybe it's not a safe assumption but we'll find out all right so I'm going to move this over so we can go over to our code what I do want to keep so let's let's just go to we want to go to one of these interior pages I guess I guess it doesn't matter we go to any of the pages but I'm just going to go to an interior page here and see how this works okay so I just pasted this in here hopefully actually not worked with like multiple exports here so this is what I'm a little bit not I'm not clear on and you guys are going to see my my inexperience here with this come out so if anybody is watching this and saying like where what are you doing dude just let me know let me know if I'm going wrong here because I'm not super confident what I'm doing and remember this this show is not about me being an expert at teaching people this is about giving everyone a glimpse into what I do as just one you know frontend developer daytoday and hopefully we both learn from each other when we do it but I can't guarantee that I'm always showing the best way to do things it's just the way that I'm using to get the job done I did have some people talking a lot yet I don't want to ignore it completely so I'm just going to take a few seconds just to check out what's going on here especially since I asked if anybody knew what was going on Oh awesome so humberto actually a bear to let me know should I pronounce the H at the front of your name or should it be more like Umberto like a silent H I can't I'm not sure so let me know I want to pronounce it correctly because I know I I know you you watch frequently but anyway Humberto said he's giving me a daily boost of confidence said what I'm doing is amazing on this site and to keep it up so I appreciate that that's stuff like that makes me want to keep doing this if it any point I think that this isn't really helpful for anybody then I probably won't do it but as long as somebody's getting some benefit from this ii'll keep doing it and I suppose as long as my boss is cool with it I'll keep doing it okay so he also says he's only used on that framework but it found ways to incorporate things that I'm doing so awesome and I went into listening look so that's cool yeah actually uh I've had I've had to work with dotnet stuff just like just a little bit like super minimal with.net stuff and I'm I'm just like I know enough to like edit little things on the site but I really don't know exactly what's going on when you talk that stuff so that's that's really cool maybe when I have to do some dotnet stuff then you could you could help me out and I'll definitely stream that Jimmy says please monetize so I can watch an ad haha okay when I help with this okay all right till Umberto says it is a silent age so I apologize for pronouncing the H before I will remember that and it from now on it will be unbearable and no age someone asked if I know how to work with laravel I do not know how to work with Laura Bell the only guy know about Laura Bell and hopefully this is right is that it's it's a PHP framework correct I have worked with PHP before but usually only in the context of WordPress or making like a little file uploader or something for for a small site so that's that's my extent of my PHP knowledge okay I'm going to go back to this and see so basically I just copy paste this into here I suspect there's a way that this can just be somehow in its own component and we can import this and not have to include this on every page but at least for the purposes of testing this a little bit let's just put it here and see if we can get maybe this console.log to come up when we test it all right so this is going to be here now we need the component did melt which we're not we're not calling that on this page yet so let's pull that in and we're going to put that inside this component here and the other thing we need I'm at might as well put this in now although it doesn't really matter when we're testing locally is I need that that code and like an idiot I look down at the bottom when my foot is and another component here it is alright so I'm going to grab this code hopefully this this works and we don't have to spend a whole lot of time troubleshooting it although it might be a more interesting video if it doesn't work all right so I'm going to save that and we'll go over to our site here and I'll bring up dev tools so I think I already have it up somewhere let's see here it is okay we're going to go over to our console and we're going to navigate to the about page and see if we get a pitch it should say something here in the console what are we looking for ga and knit we did not get it let me still and get it okay didn't get it so it did not work right off the bat so we also I mean we didn't get any crazy errors either in Quetta kinetics monstrance why are we getting this um we are getting a 404 error which is crazy haha all right so this is like I don't know if anybody caught the really dumb thing I just did but I tried to check it on the live site instead of on the test site so sorry about that little ASA time let's bring over the test site now so I'll have a lot of windows open I'm sure I'm sure somebody else can relate to having a million tabs open and windows open so here is the site we really want to test and I will open analytics here I do want to check why I'm still getting an error on on that because I think I was good yeah I got that error earlier and I fixed it so maybe it's just some caching stuff okay so we want to go to about I mean bring up analytics we want to check the console so again let's let's try this all right we got it okay so we did get this ga in it okay and that was obviously a clientside route and there one of the ways that we know that is none of this stuff left the console normally when you do a refresh unless you have it set to persist your console all this stuff will go away on a refresh what is of it okay all this stuff is coarse hairs going on for images so for some reason it's set on where these images are to not accept requests from localhost I guess so it doesn't really matter for testing right now all right so that's awesome so that's working let's put it on a couple of pages just to doublecheck and see that it in fact is still working and we're not messing anything out by including this stuff in the head I mean I'd rather have this separately but for now I want to get this up and running quickly and can always refactor and make it look nicer later on and I know I always say that and then sometimes I never get to it but at least we'll try to get to it all right so let's try the team page and what else do I have open index okay that'll be good three pages will be good now what we also need to do is put those functions and component did Malthus function calls so where's my is my original page so I know in index I already have component amount so I'm just going to copy the calls I I guess it doesn't really matter the order right now and I'm also calling it on the team okay and if you didn't watch the video on making jQuery work with react that will explain why I have these calls here to these functions this is to make the jQuery stuff work that I was already using on the site to make sure it works when we do clientside routing I it works already when you're doing a you know full page refresh okay so you got all those we have it on three pages so about the index page was the home page and then the team page so let's click around and see what happens so I scan go let's go to the home page alright we got it we have that in it console.log let's go to the team page alright great we got in it I don't know if you caught that but we before I got all this stuff we did get the anit I'm not gonna scroll but I saw it happen so let's go back to the about page okay and I'm just going to go back up alright great so we know we can we can go back and forth from pages this is firing again it's working again we're not getting any weird errors at least related to that we're getting a lot of other weird stuff going on with errors you can you can check the live site we're not getting all these errors in the live site so that's why I'm not worried about it alright so I think the next step here is let's put this on all the pages and let's push it to the live server and we'll give it a test and I have the link to the live site if if you want to check out the site I also have a link to the github repo if you want to follow along in the description for this video okay let me grab this part again and luckily we don't have that many pages so we can see one students who have only have like five five pages not bad for copy and paste let's throw that end and here and we're not actually using the single news page right now if you remember we didn't have content to fill this out so we just left it out the whole the whole news actually affect the news page and single nerves are completely left out but we ought to just put it in here while we remember what you know how we're doing this you never know I'm like when that finally does get added into the site where we get the content I might forget how I did this so I guess I could go back and watch this video and now I just want to pull I'm just going to pull these think a lot of these pages are more to use and component did mal okay yep let me just close some of these so we can see see what's going on okay you all right and I think that's all the pages so I'm going to push this to the server I'm going to save it I'm going to push it to github and then from github we're going to pull it to the server so if you've been watching you've probably seen me do this several times already at least so but if you haven't what then you're not sure how to do this part you're not familiar with git then I'll just go through it again so do get status it tells us everything that's changed so all our pages obviously but if you remember we added a new package that react GA package so that's why our yarn lock file which keeps track of package versions and things and that we never actually added this directly and then our package JSON file which we can edit directly but we don't often those also change so those are being included if you notice the package itself is not included and we don't upload our node modules to to get up that's pretty standard you don't have to upload them all because as long as you have this package JSON anybody yourself could you could load that on a different machine or anybody could load this and then just with that package JSON file be able to install all the dependencies so just a little a little tip I mean I'm sure you could push your node modules up if you wanted to but that would it would just be out of a waste of time all right so now we're going to commit and I'm just going to do one commit message for all of this since it's all basically the same same thing all right that that's not the most descriptive thing in the world but sometimes it's hard to come up with good commit messages or function names when I'm on the spot on YouTube so we're going to get push okay oh no what happened oh no this is awesome that this happened though okay because this is if this has never happened to you before if you haven't used it that much then you can you can learn from from my mistake from me alright so sorry I can see that there's post to the live chat sorry for ignoring this I will check it when we're done with this I'll go through I'll read everything so if you stick around if you can stick around I'll answer any questions that you put in there and if you can't stick around you can watch the recording and I'll answer it then so I had edited on Saturday I worked from home and I had made some changes to this site I pushed it to get up and then I pulled it into the server I forgot to pull those changes back down to my local copy here at work so what's going to happen now is it has to to merge okay so this is a pain when this happens and it could have been avoided because I think it's to maintain a good a good rule that I tried to have and I always forget is every day I should come in and start by doing a get pool even if I can't remember making changes I ought to just do get pool because maybe I did make changes and I didn't remember like like today so and then you avoid that and everything will be fresh so so now it's time to pull these changes down actually I can't believe it let me do maybe it didn't haha it didn't I didn't even notice it earlier sorry if I'm being a weird here I'm just I'm laughing at myself I try to make it get push um earlier and I didn't even realize that it got rejected because I didn't pull yet so earlier in this in the show when I I was looking at the live site and I was like why is that air there I fixed that well it's because it hadn't actually I actually went through the process I thought of pushing it and then pulling it into the server but I pulled in nothing to the server there are no changes because it never went up so sorry if you're not familiar with git and you have no idea what I'm talking about sorry for being confusing but let's do this properly now and let's do a merge okay so we'll go through just to let you know what this error message is okay so the remote has stuff that I don't have locally we don't want to you know we want to sort out what should actually be there in case there are conflicting changes we want to go through those and figure out what should should actually be the change so we're going to do a get pool and now it's going to bring up I have set as my default for this atom it might be different for you maybe it'll be Nano right in your text right in your editor or if you're using some other code editor maybe you're awesome and use them who knows so this this is you're just going to type a message here to explain why you're merging and I'm just going to say merging okay I mean that's pretty much exactly why so now I'm just going to save this and that should be X I can't do I need to say maybe I need no all right so I need to save and I need to close and then it should it should go through hopefully maybe not honestly I have messed this up before so I'm not super surprised okay so let's alright let's try this again hmm okay so it looks like we have some of the stuff here um let me do a log I haven't done this command before so just to explain git log will show us what we've had what we've done okay yeah so it didn't pick that up somebody saying Patrick saying I have to close Adam no I wish I I don't want to have to close completely close out Adam here um how do I get out of here thank you ski haha I can't figure out how to get out of I can't remember how to get out of log there we go cute that's it okay so maybe since I exit out of there let's let's just see if it makes me do it again local changes so the following files would be overwritten by merge please commit your changes our stash them before you merge all right everybody this is I'm just going to commit these changes I'm afraid it's going to overwrite what we did but since it's not a big deal and it's only those two pages I'm just going to do this please do not use this as an example of what to do use it as an example of what not to do you can see how much of a pain it is if you just don't pull first so I'm usually the only person working on projects so if you are used to working on teams you're probably looking at me like this guy's a noob I just always forget to pull because it's always usually me working on it and usually from one computer so this is something I don't even really need to do that often oh let's just say so I don't even remember exactly what I changed before okay your branch or dementia have diverged they have three and one different committees respectively you get pool okay now it's going to ask me to do this again okay um I don't even odds alright that's a horrible message but it's it's not descriptive at all but I just want to get through this at this point and let's say that and now I am going to close up this this tab let's see if that's enough to make it work yes it did all right so Patrick a good call on that the problem I had the first time was that I didn't actually close out so if you see like this tab open I should have closed out this whole tab it's that I just closed out this document and that wasn't enough so that was the problem so that that would have been the right thing to do in case you were wondering sorry if I confused you by by messing it all up all right so now we should be able to push actually before we push let's check our files and make sure that our stuff was still there we what did we have changes from pages events and resources so let's just look at one of those events all right we still have everything we need there and actually I remember what I changed so let me look in the events page I added a button with a link here okay we have that button now so everything that was changed is there just wanted to be sure let's make sure there we go all right so now that's there let's go to the server so we're going to have to do one extra step that we haven't done before on the server so I'm already logged in I just use SSH to get into the server I'm gonna nope nothing's coming up when I'm typing so maybe I did get logged up and it's just a little laggy I'm not not gonna realize it I'm going to give it a second if not I can always open up another tab and try to get in that way hmm there we go it probably worked on this one not too all right so I can close this up all right so let's login using SSH and then my user name and the IP address now we you normally use this command so let me bring this command over for you I'm going to copy and paste it this is the command we have been using and it's it's just chained together basically what we need right so we have a we're going to stop our server we're using p.m. 2 to manage that and then we're going to CD we're going to you know go into the react folder per project and then we're going to pull from github and then what we would normally do next is run the bill but since we pulled in another package we need to do something else we need another step in between there so I'm going to go back and we're going to do an NPM install and and then we're going to do the rest of it ok so we need that step otherwise that code we just added when we went to like here when we went to sorry I didn't make this bigger I apologize been doing this whole video and it was probably too small for so you see so we went in and we're called we're trying to import this but it's not going to find it unless we install that first so it's going to read our package JSON file and it's going to see hey at once and once this react GA but we don't have it yet so it's going to install then it's going to go in with the rest of it which is going to build the app again and then it's going to restart the server so let me hit enter and we can watch it work I've been I don't know how much time this MTM extol had hopefully not that much time and we can still be under a minute of of downtime okay so you can see now it's installing it's already done the pool there's the change in the package.json okay so the install went alright mornings are okay as long as you don't have an error the installs usually find that we're building the build process usually is like 30 seconds sometimes a little more and as soon as this gets up there we'll test it assuming that it works then I'll check out the live chat and I have another interview from syntax con this time a short interview from Emily Freeman that I'm going to show here hopefully in a few minutes because hopefully this works and if you haven't seen the previous interviews that I did some last week they're just kind of giving some advice to people who are just starting out in coding alright so this is on line if it says it's on line now let's test it out let me bring over the live site actually I think I closed that window that I had earlier so I'll just bring it up right here catechetical yes alright so it works I'm going to bring up the console if you remember we left that console login which at some point we'll probably take that out but we can see that part's working awesome okay so let me move this here because I want to see if this works so we came in at the home page right and we have here this last year this is the home page now I wish there weren't five users on it right now which it was just us that would give us a better test but basically we know that one of these is probably us so let's click about and if this works we'll see about show up here I guess I can make sure on the console we did get another console here yes and about did show so we have one about let's make sure it just wasn't somebody else coming on we'll click around we have a team we already have one team so it should switch to two here in a second yep to four team nobody's on courses right now so let's go to courses and see if it works here that's you all right awesome okay so there are courses so there we go so it works we now have a proper analytics coming in even when we're just doing clientside routing and there's no page refresh so just to wrap up we're using next js' okay which we've used to pull in you know react and build that out we're using the clientside routing there that comes built in with with next Jas and we've pulled in the package the NPM package react GA and we've just included that on every page just like this is super simple we've included it we have some functions we're initializing and then we're setting the page view to what that current path name is for that window and we're sending it with this function we're sending it to Google and then on component in mount we initialize we run these functions the init function and then with the sin so it actually ended up working exactly like like I thought it would work exactly like we talked about the beginning of the show and that's pretty awesome the biggest challenge was doing a git merge which is embarrassing for me so all right Umberto's says that user in washington is probably an oh cool all right so oh we get we got a couple people in washington it looks like Bellevue Seattle all right so one of these is umberto from from the live chat they're so cool yeah if you're on now you can see yourself your little dot Google Analytics is a huge time thing for me is it's cool to just check out all these maps and see what's going on everywhere so I try to stay away from it when I can otherwise I waste so much time in there oh nice Pat Patrick is this like on point today with with the great advice Patrick says um the little what's that called it's healed it the little Toyota will terminate a frozen SSH session so I'm going to try really hard to remember that because that will be useful for me thank you so let's let me go through some of the stuff in the live chat quickly and see if I can answer your questions before I do the I go to the interview and actually let me bring this up so that I don't forget to do the interview I'm just going to bring this up right now because I did forget previously you can actually kind of see me in the background here in that reflection so all right so let me go through any tips on how to make a nicelooking navbar um I personally I like the material design style and I think it's nice to be able to work from a set of this like established um kind of rules for design guidelines so I would check out a material design documentation on how they do nav bars if you type in material design it should be one of the first things that comes up the official one if you want to use a framework check out materialized as a framework it uses material design and it has nav bars I like to try to start with that and then change it as I need to fit the use case I find that to be a lot easier than trying to start from scratch it does depend on the site I'm going if I was going like a site for me like my own portfolio or something which my own portfolio site is super old I haven't worked like five years so if you go there be kind but if I were doing some site that I had like total artistic freedom with let's say and I could do something crazy maybe I would do something different but normally like on a site for a client or for the college where I work I would probably start with something that's kind of like tested proven like something that users generally expect so that they'll it'll provide them with a familiar user experience they don't have to learn how to use my navigation when they go to the site so hopefully that helped I know that wasn't like really technical if you have some code or something up on github send me a DM on Twitter or in the comments below or something below this video and I'll check it out and I could give you maybe some more detailed tips all right Vladimir says it's a really cool thing by streaming real work awesome I'm glad I'm glad you like it that was probably it's probably one of the few original ideas that I've had that you've seen is the idea to just stream me doing my regular work I don't I at least have never seen anybody out stream the regular work so maybe I'm just probably somebody else out there that was doing it before me but at least from my perspective I did come up with that idea on my own update the live site first I must have been it must have been one of the times where I messed something up and some of the other comments had update the live so first you're hitting a live set oh yeah haha yeah it looks like everybody else caught my mistake except for me and eventually I caught it okay I as who's saying sorry if I'm mispronouncing your first name says can you make a HS make a hoc and wrap the pages in if you don't know HS e is this higherorder component that's that's a good idea and i'ma tell you the only reason that I didn't use high ORAC components here is because I'm still learning about them and I'm not super confident with doing it yet so I've seen examples of other sites and kind of look checked out there the github repos and how they did it but I feel like I keep using this as an excuse but it's totally true because the timeline was so short I really had to stick with things that I like I knew we're going to work I don't like to do that I always do like to kind of push it and do new things but that's just how this worked out so the next project hopefully will have a much more reasonable timeline and I can try some things out maybe like some of your suggestions that you all are putting the live chats and and really kind of make it even better and just expand you know what I'm capable of doing but yeah in general from what I know and what I've seen of higherorder components that's that would have been a good way to go for some of this stuff but I'm like I just don't know enough to have used them confidently okay at least I'm better to saying he knows about the the conflicts in the in the pool stuff so I'm glad it's not just me I cry cronies I don't know how you should say your name but it's it looks like cronies with Tuesday's at the end I says well a oneman team I don't I'm not really sure what you're referring to I don't remember what I was doing at that point of the video so if you're still watching and you won't explain that I can I just I just can't remember what was going on there what that would be referring to Kishor says hello hey how's it going and okay Mossad said can you tell us what you did so far because I joined like five minutes ago so I did do a little recap at the end if you came in after that basically we're using we were using clientside routing so our Google Analytics wasn't picking up all those those jumps between like pages of the site so we just changed how we were loading Google Analytics to be able to pick up all those things so that's really simplified version but if that sounds like something you're interested in check out the replay which will be available about like just a few minutes after this stream ends okay Patrick I was wondering about Patrick says its twoday period not just tilde okay so he says there's there are other commands that work with tilde so good to know I wondered about that I saw the period at the end and I wasn't sure if I was included so if you want to terminate a frozen SSH session Patrick has a good advice here use t oday period and that will terminate it so all right let's say so Paul says cool to watch this live work I'm glad glad you're enjoying it it can be a bit overwhelming on just how much there is to learn for someone who is in a few a few months in I totally understand that yeah I am the only the best advice I could have use I don't worry about trying to learn everything at once you know just take it like whatever you need to know for a project you're working on you know learn that and eventually you'll get a better understanding of of what you need you don't need to know everything there's just way too much out there to know it all and you'll get a feel as you keep doing it you'll get a feel for what you like and what you're good at and that will kind of steer you in the direction of you know where you really want to learn to I think to be really good at something you have to rule out other things at some point because it's just too much to shy be awesome at everything so the more you're into the more you'll get a feel for that but just you know don't don't feel too overwhelmed I mean I don't think everybody knows notice at all you know we there there are people who are just really good at they're in little niche of what they do and they're probably some people who just know a little bit about a lot of things but yeah don't don't worry about it I know it's a lot to know but you know you'll look back in a couple months and think like man I I know so much more than I did and and it'll be an awesome feeling oh okay so we got an explanation about says well a oneman team he said that because I'm working alone okay awesome sorry I didn't get that at first yeah I guess there are perks to working alone but then also they're not so like there are a lot of sites right now that like let's say I went on vacation and something happened to the site there is no one else here at this university that could fix the site but me because sometimes maybe it's just an access thing or it would take somebody too long to try to figure it out so there's that's not a good thing um but hopefully that's going to change and I will have some other people that'll that'll know what's going on that's part of the reason why I think these videos are so good that somebody could look back on how I built this site and probably get a pretty good idea of what's going on you know from the github repo and from these videos they could piece together most of what they need to know to work on the site so I'm it's it's not really why I'm doing this like completely but it's an extra bonus included so that would be cool to work on a team I think it'd be awesome to have somebody else to learn from and to be able to look at my code and that's what I mean you all are kind of fulfilling that role that functioned for me you know you see what I'm doing and you are giving me so much so many umberto just said in code comments nuts nuts I I was thinking it in my mind when I said it like that's what comments are for yeah I definitely need to to level up my comment game in my code it's when you're the only person maintaining your code it's so easy to get lazy about comments and style I'm hopefully I'm going to try to get some of the computer science here involved in developing sites so some of them they may actually you know get paid to work um you know work for me and some of them might be interns at that point I'm going to have to really set like this is the style we use for CSS for JavaScript and this is these are the conventions we use and you got to comment everything and I'm going to have to get more disciplined at that point I'm gonna have to probably slow down at first but it probably it'll be better in the long run and if I'm more disciplined about that so so yeah thanks for calling me out on that Umberto it's totally true so that you're I need any better comments all right I think I got it let me read these last few comments I think we're through okay awesome chronic Ronnie's um says he's working on his portfolio he's been working with lamp stack in few j/s so yeah I'd be happy to take a look at your site and just let you know you know what I think also that's also be working on the UJS I hear a lot of good things about it I haven't worked with it yet but at some point I'll probably check it out if I get a chance I just I kind of like I'm torn like do I really want to learn another framework or don't want to just focus on react and try to get good work good with it but at some point I would still like to check out you okay awesome so I'm pretty sure I got through everything if you have a question and you didn't get to answer it put in the comments below if you don't want everybody in the world to be able to see it on YouTube then just send me a DM Twitter my link to my Twitter is in in the description also now that I launched this site I'm going to have a little bit extra time I'm going to start making short tutorial videos and putting it on my youtube channel so if you want to be alerted when those videos come out you can subscribe um I don't really care if you subscribe or not but I'll probably let you know too on on this channel when those videos come out so alright so I'm going to play this video that I've had up on the screen for a while and this is Emily Freeman and I filmed this at sentox con two weeks ago when I was there and she's going to give some advice to two new coders oops and I forgot I need to put the sound on it so hold on a second alright okay so you should be able to hear this now alright so wait what's I'm in like I ripped in for Colorado um here it's a text not giving it song what see doctor actually exam it won't on hope you dumped a me a story of DevOps gone wrong and then the doctor says can taxation and then what else you know from you doesn't uh to what we do with your yeah yeah I am a job in Melbourne I builds ApS services I have figured out a way to make that more in just a minute but yeah in Java for a small company and what's a new technology that you're excited about I don't know if it's like a new technology but I am excited to like just learn another language so I'm gonna jump from last year starting and remains my favorite but then I'm super interested in either picking up like a gun or an elixir something like a little different cool and what advice do you have for new programs just keep going I think it's really easy to get discouraged don't feel like you're the new person and never going to get it but you will be amazed at how much you are overtime and so it's very hard to kind of see your growth when you're in it and so that means finding a mentor or trust appear and to kind of remind you how awesome your arms just keep going you got it thank you yeah all right so oh cool thanks Paul says great interview yeah hopefully that the interview was helpful I have one more interview from syntax Khan to do and I'll probably do that tomorrow so it was great talking with you all there's a lot of good stuff in the in the live chat I'll be back tomorrow same time 200 p.m. Eastern Time and like I said let me know let me know if you had any other questions I think I already cover that right I don't repeat myself you know where to put the the questions okay actually I do want to mention this to this good advice Cronus says meetup.com is a great place for people to meet other developers so I haven't been there but I guess check it out and okay you're welcome guys Humberto is saying thanks so anyway I'll see you tomorrow I'm gonna try to head home and enjoy the nice weather that I'm having here so thanks for watching see you tomorrow
