hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to deploy a test version of our react project using now which is made by zeit and that's the same company that makes uh next js which is what we're using uh for our react site as well i'm going to go through the whole process we're going to start out by creating a subdomain with one of our urls pointing the subdomain to the proper place we're going to do it with a c name so there's a few different ways that you can do this and oh i'll get you all the links to the documentation uh that lays out i think there's three different ways we can do this we're going to use this the c name way which is is good if you don't want to use their name servers the site name servers which in this case we we don't want to use them so this will be almost like a test run for when we deploy this for real uh on our main domain it'll be slightly different when we do it for the you know the root domain but only only very very slightly uh just let's see just to catch everyone up we um let's see we're pretty much in terms of design the site is it's pretty much done there's a few like little tweaks here and there that i'd like to get to but the big thing that we've been working on and that i've been working on when i'm not streaming is just getting data moved over uh from our old server to our new server from an old database to a new database and then making sure that that data is able to get into react properly and that the urls match up with what the old site has so that's i don't know i feel like i'm doing the same thing every day with this site but i mean there's just a lot there's a lot of data to handle so you know that's how it is so not really fun to do all that but but necessary so i really do i want to get this test site up i want you all to be able to have a url you can go to at any time to check it out and i want you know other users here to be able to check it out and start pointing out to me things that aren't working because we're at almost exactly a month until the launch date uh so i definitely want to give as much time as possible for uh for testing not just for me to test but for other people to test all right okay we're starting to get a few more uh viewers so i guess we'll start up i do want to mention though uh next week next tuesday i will be at the google i o extension conference for pittsburgh so google the google i o conference is going to go on next week their main conference at their headquarters but then all over i believe it's all over the world they're going to have these extension conferences so especially in places that have a google office so pittsburgh has a branch of google there and i'll be there but the reason i want to bring it up is well number one to say i definitely won't be streaming that day but also if anybody plans on going if you're in the pittsburgh area let me know it'd be awesome to meet up if you want when when we're at the conference and uh i'll try to i'm not gonna try to do a youtube live stream from there i don't think i don't think there'll be an opportunity for that but i may do something on instagram uh just some updates and things so if you have instagram and you don't follow me uh you'll find me on instagram i think if you go to my youtube channel uh i have instagram linked from there so um if you're interested in that sort of thing you know find me on there and i'll uh i'll try to put some updates in and then of course i'll tell you all about it the next day when i when i do have a chance to stream let's see uh since we're talking about conferences i'll also be at the revolution conf in virginia beach that's i don't know in a couple weeks or something so anybody in in virginia or that general area uh if you're if you're going to be the conference awesome if you're not going to be the conference but you're in that area and like to meet up let me know and i'll be speaking at the pittsburgh tech fest in june as well so anyway just thought i'd like to let you all know it'd be really cool uh i'd i'd hate to be somewhere where maybe where you all are and then uh miss an opportunity to to meet up or something so all right enough of me talking um we do have a question uh nikki says is the material design version 2 getting unveiled at google i o or is that just a rumor i i don't know i mean i've been seeing headlines about this material design version 2 but i don't know for sure i would imagine if they're going to unveil it io is probably the place to do it that would be really cool so i'm definitely interested in that obviously since i use material design for most of my projects okay uh so let's start out let me share my screen so and then we're gonna start out with uh the domain name so let me i'm gonna do all my login stuff on my other screen and then move it over just so that i don't accidentally give away any important information and uh especially i believe we have this domain hosted with godaddy and i have quite a few godaddy accounts saved here so i don't want to give away like all seven of my godaddy usernames on the screen at once they're not all my accounts but they're accounts i have access to for clients and various accounts at the university okay let me see the university has several accounts and i can never remember which one has this uh this domain name so i may get the wrong one first i think all right i got the right one all right so i'm going to move this over there we go let me move this over now i'm going to do a little explanation as well because i'm just not sure how familiar you all are with handling domain names uh dns records and things like that it's not something you want to mess around with really um unless you know what you're doing so if you're using a domain that's not really linked up to anything then you know feel free to mess around as much as you want but if you're doing this for a client or for a live website you want to be very very careful because you can mess things up especially i mean not only with i mean really with any of the types of records you can mess it up but especially with mx records you can mess up somebody's entire email system which i've actually done before for a client years ago so it all got sorted out and you know but there were a few days there where emails weren't working so uh from experience i will tell you it's definitely a good idea to double check you know what you're doing uh you want to you know screenshot everything beforehand because if for some reason you lose all these ip addresses and would have to try to remember them or look them up to go back in it would take you much much longer to get these back where they're supposed to be so depending on where you host uh where you manage your domain from this panel is going to look different so the admin panels are are very different just depending on where you're at in terms of the style the design but what they should have is an area where it lists your types of records for right now these are all a records here you have a name your value and then um you know some seconds here the usually pretty standard i see is like 600 seconds um these correspond with subdomains right so right now we have quite a few subdomains here and the sub domains are pointed to an ip address right so for instance if you were to start up a digitalocean droplet it has an ip address right if you wanted that droplet if you wanted your sub domain to go to that droplet you would just take that ip address and you'd put it in here as an a record so if we wanted begin.franciscan.university to go to our droplet let's we just pop the ip address in right there right and now sometimes there's a delay it just it depends and i'm hoping that there's not too much delay when we do this otherwise we may not be able to see the result for a while but i wanted to do it with you instead of doing it beforehand so hopefully it'll all work out and i just remembered that i did not start my timer here's the timer all right let me start that up uh that way aft after 25 minutes is over i'm gonna take a break i'm gonna answer some questions there in the live chat so first thing we need to do is figure out what we want our um our sub domain to be for this so normally like test or dev is a reasonable one if this is going to be a test site so let's see if we have that already okay we do have test and we have test one let's check page two and page three just to be sure okay so what i'm gonna do is uh i'm gonna make a domain name called dev so it'll or a subdomain called dev so the url will be dev dot franciscan dot university uh so that i mean that's a reasonable uh domain name i think or a sub domain so what we're gonna do is select in this case a cname record and we're going to say dev points2 and this is where we need to get a value from now so let's go to the now documentation site now there we go and once i get to the right page i'll paste the link in the chat i see there's a lot of activity in the chat just hey everyone i'll definitely check out the chat here in a few minutes so we're gonna go to our documentation and assign a domain name and let me make this much bigger so you all can see and i'm going to copy this and paste it if anybody uses spotify the throwback thursday playlist is from the year 2000 which i was in high school in the year 2000 except my maybe middle school so maybe around 8th grade uh or my freshman year somewhere like that so if anybody shares similar nostalgia for the year 2000 check out the throwback thursday playlist on spotify um okay so the links pasted now in the chat if it doesn't work when you click it please try to copy and paste it and into your browser directly and then that should work so we're gonna try to do it with a cname right so these other options you're welcome to use those and they may be better for your use case but for our use case here really our only option is to use the the c name so we need to point it to alias zeit dot co and i believe it's alias outside oca yeah um now that i think about it i did this with another site recently this might be outdated we'll see if it is outdated then maybe we'll uh submit a pull request to update this but we'll find out in a minute so we we do need a terminal window open so let's see where this is all right i'm going to move this over so it's on the same screen with us here and let me just get a fresh new tab there we go we'll just start with a fresh one here and oops i forgot to put it in i'm skipping a step there we go we need to put that in here alias dot sight dot co and we'll drop this down to 600 right we want this to go as quickly as possible all right so now we have our cname record and so the subdomain dev should go here so if if you want your particular subdomain to point to a uh a url use a c name if you wanted to point to an ip address use an a record okay so that's kind of just a really basic difference between the two so let's let's see and i believe we'll find out really quickly whether or not that was the the way to go um i let's see if you know what i think we already have this yeah let's go ahead and just do it over here since this is already where we want it to be now let's let's make sure we're ready so um we'll do a get pool i just did one but i want to do it on on the stream so you always want to begin work with a get pool because you may have pushed something to github and you didn't remember or somebody else that's working on the same project may have so you definitely want to make sure you have the latest stuff so we do happen to have the latest stuff and now i want to let's just do a yarn um so i know that i didn't have any new packages but that's another step that you always want to take to make sure that you have the latest packages if you're not using yarn you can use npm install i believe just typing npm works now as well now the next thing we want to do is use our commands from our documentation here so what we're going to do is type now alias and we're going oops option http no we actually need to type need this first so let's run now there may be a way to combine some of these steps but since we're going through the first time i think it'd be better to do it separately anyway so what this is doing now that we've typed in now so i have installed now on my machine so that's another step you will have to take is just to install it if you go into the documentation for now then um you can figure there's there's several ways that you can download it on your machine so you can pick whichever way uh works best for you so we've been given this url here so basically a default now url is going to be the name of your project plus uh kind of a random string and then dot now dot sh it's it's nice but it's not really easy for a tester or user to type in right we we wouldn't want that to be our our actual url for our website so we'll let that go i mean it's this is taking uh all of our files and running them on a server so if i don't know how many of you were with me whenever we set up digitalocean servers but compare that process which if you're lucky and you do everything right you can set up a server to run react you know with ssl and everything maybe in an hour right but this isn't a matter of minutes and there's no maintenance so while that's happening i'm going to check the the chat let's check the time too all right 16 16 minutes let's see uh david said ask is this like heroku uh sort of yeah it's it's a way to deploy okay so we are successful so what it did uh which is kind of nice is it automatically save this url to the clipboard which is cool we don't we don't have to copy it so let's go over here and just visit it to verify that it is working and i'm going to click around a bit wonderful um let's see undergraduates great let's go back to the home page and let's make sure this is working wonderful looks like everything's working great so that was that was really fast right like this is our site running in a production environment it's fast it has an ssl i mean that's that's amazing i mean i if you've never gone through the process of setting up a server yourself in the sso and everything like it it may not seem like a lot but it's really really amazing i did see nikki had a question about does now also support separate deployments per branch i have deployed things uh different branches before as well so i have a deployment right now of the catechetical institute website that's just the upgrade branch so that's that's definitely a possibility you have a branch that's your your latest stuff you want to let your client see it uh before it goes live let's say on the main url you can make a test sub domain and just push that branch so all you would do is go into you know you do a get checkout on that branch and then once you're on that branch you run now from that branch so a great great question and it's definitely possible so now that we have this let's type in now alias we're going to paste this in so we want this url to go to dev dot franciscan dot university now it's not going to work this time but that's to be expected but we need to get some uh some info here because we're going to need to set up a text record as well to make this work and we're gonna get that record once this does its thing see all right cool so we have this now and you can see we have a few pieces of information so first it says you could uh set your name servers to this which we're not gonna do we're using the alternative way and that's we've we've already set our cname to use alias.co and now we need to make a text record that has this value so i'm definitely going to copy that value we're going to copy that and now let's make this record so we're going to go back to our domain we're going to add a text record and the host is going to be underscore now and then there's the value and we'll set this custom as well and let's save and we'll see we now have this text record and let's compare uh the text mentioned above the error message okay i remember now um this i remember which part of this i had thought about creating a pull request for so this screenshot is from an older version of of now so that's why it looks differently so i had thought of uh potentially replacing that um it was yeah so we're not going to do that now because it's it's not really a big deal because the newer version uh expl i think explains it better when you're running the command so now that we have that text record again we're going to run this command over again so there's that same command and when we run it this time it should work all right good so we have our success message here so now it's going to generate an ssl certificate and it's going to set that up so this may take a minute or so but once it's done we should be able to go to dev.franciscan.university and see our site oh wow that was really fast awesome so let's go over here and we'll go to dev oops dev dot university and you all can try this out as well dev dot franciscan whoops if i could spell it right let's try that again dev dot there we go yay it works so i'm gonna paste this into the chat and uh that way you all can can check it out you can see this definitely works we can click around to wherever we want and it runs and it's fast it's so fast this is why i i don't know you know the details of how things deployed on now end up being so fast i'm sure there's more details on the website i remember reading something before when it first came out but i'm not even gonna try to explain it uh it is just fast so i do want to i want to go over how you would keep this up right so this is great but what happens when you want to update it so obviously like your site's gonna change uh over time this site's gonna change it'll probably change you know today so how do we keep things uptodate easily uh so there is a way to make this whole process a bit easier in terms of updating and let's see where it's at i want to show you how to do this i may not be able to find it in the documentation you may just have to have to just do it guys hey this is all right i'll just do it i'm sure it's in the documentation somewhere but it's i still remember how to do this so here's what we're going to do we're going to add in a basically a new section into our package json that is going to have configuration for now now there's a lot of other options actually that let me find this in the in here because there we go okay here we are so we can put in this now option and we can put in an alias we can add in it should have yeah here we are so we have all these other these options of uh to configure now right there so um name alias uh we have like environment variables which is very useful uh scale which we're not going to worry about scaling now but whenever we actually launch the site the uh the live version of the site uh we're gonna do some stuff with scale so we'll explain it more then um this is like um well still scale stuff oh wait um so there's a lot of different things you could see i'm still scrolling you know still uh with this configuration but for now what we really need is uh is the alias so that's what we're gonna check out uh actually let me make sure i have time to do this before my timer runs out five minutes yeah we're good okay so what we want to do then is uh where am i gonna put this all right i'm just gonna put it here so we're gonna make this now and so this is right our package json it's just a json file so same format as normal we're going to write we're going to have an alias and and then for our alias we're going to put in our urls we're going to go dev dot franciscan dot university let me double check that i spelled it right this time there we go all right so that is spelled correctly all right awesome and that's all we're going to do right now to set this up so i guess we could just let's let's just test this out so i'm going to make an update now the update's really not going to do anything uh that a user can see on the site but let's go let's do git status we see we've updated that let's do git add and then we'll do yarn cm so this is how we've set up our custom way to set up to uh make pull requests um build yeah maybe maybe we'll put it under build i don't let's do it um alias okay so we'll let this run through all the tests and then we will try this out let's see uh oh i'm not running the server that's why let's do you aren't dev oh it looks like all right so i already have a server running here so let's stop this oops there we go we're going to stop that one so we can start this one up sorry about that you are in dev and it looks like we have it it came up with a message saying that there's a new version of next so suppose we're going to be doing an up update to the latest version of next sometime soon and when this is done now we'll try to run this again so we're going to do yarn cm but we're going to go with um uh retry is that what it is let's see him retry i think that's the command we want nope two of them there we go that's it so we don't have to type in our commit message and everything again when we use retry with the double hyphens so now it should work if you happen to be working on this project and you run into a similar issue just make sure that you're running the server before you try to commit because the test will try to run but they can't without the server so that did work so now we're going to do now right so you know what can we just run now alias we may be able to run now alias i i can't remember exactly see we i don't think we have a search i wonder if it says it down here hmm i don't remember exactly where it is so let's let's run now so now we're going to have another url a different one from the one we had before and so it'll be another instance the cool thing about now is like like right now i'm not on a paid plan i have a free plan i can start these instances up uh and it's it's entirely free uh we're eventually gonna move on to a paid plan which will i might work on that today buying things at a university usually involves paperwork and going through stuff so i'm going gonna consult with my colleague about what the best way to is to go about paying for an account i think my timer just ran out so i'm gonna scroll up and start answering questions and then once this is finished we'll run um the next command i should have changed something so that we could see what was happening in that website but it's too late now this will work john hanson says hey all summer like today iced coffee time yeah the weather's been really nice um i mean i'm in i'm near pittsburgh and uh in the united states and the weather is like 80 degrees uh super nice and i did get iced coffee what day was it tuesday tuesday i had dentist appointment and doctor's appointment and uh so i stopped and got an iced coffee between i just stopped at the dunkin donuts and i'm glad i did they had wifi and then one of my clients websites from a long time ago uh crashed and so they emailed me or like hey the site's down and uh so i checked it out and was made i managed to get it back up and running uh while during my stop at dunkin donuts uh in between my appointments so that worked out really well and i happened to have my laptop with me which was also very nice okay so now that we do this let's type now now alias and i believe yep there we go so here's here's what we've done if you can't see that i'm going to read through a little bit but it is assigning alias deb franciscan.university to the deployment franciscan university react and then mk jd whatever and that's the one we just did so it's not our old deployment that we just made like a half hour ago or something uh about then this is a new one so now what we're able to do every time we want to push our new updates to our test site we just type now followed by now alias you probably could do now and now it so like something like this now so you probably could do it like this if you want to do it all in one command which just would save time you could just do it and leave assuming that you're confident that no errors will will happen um but yeah so basically now all you have to do is just this command it will deploy your new changes to a new instance and then switch it so i mean think about like the the beauty of this is like we're talking about no downtime when we update it's amazing like normally let's say we have um a droplet on digitalocean or server somewhere and we only have one server you go in you go to update what do you need to do uh if you're using like git for deployment uh you need to do a get pool you need to build right and then you'll need to start that server again so that means there's going to be a period of downtime depending on how long your build is like how fast your servers there's going to be a little downtime it might not be that much but you don't want to deal with that what we've done here is we have our instance right so it's like we have a server that's running um like imagine on digitalocean you're running two servers right load balanced so you shut one down all the traffic goes to the other and then you do your updates and then you switch to the other one do your updates right but i'm but think about all the work that goes into that setting up two servers paying for two servers even if you go with five dollar servers it's still ten dollars a month to do the uh digital ocean load balancing that's twenty dollars a month for the load balancer so now you're up to 30 dollars a month and the process to update still if you haven't really automated anything it's still logging into a server uh doing your get pool doing a build starting it back up logging into another server repeating the same process right and that's only with two if you had multiple servers it could be even more involved process now we switch that to where we have an instance running and our domain name is pointing to that instance we get another instance up and running with all our changes and then when that one's ready we simply point the domain to the new one there's zero downtime right but we don't have to worry about the the old one is gone in terms of it for from the user's perspective i could still use that old really long url and get to it but it's just gonna get shut down right it's going to go to sleep um and it's not going to be active anymore and now we have a really fast way there's no logging into servers it's all right there for the command line i type in now and now alias and it's ready i mean it's there's definitely advantages to this way of deployment so okay i'm not getting paid to promote this or anything like that i'm just very impressed by it so i'm i'm gonna get to the questions now anna says hi michael says hi hey how's it going uh divest says does data rendering always happen through ajax call and react except for serverside rendering um yeah i mean you can use fetch uh instead of ajax i mean you're probably going to do fetch um but yeah i mean basically if you're going to do if you're going to get data on the fly client side that's that's the way to do it uh ch chanikya says hello hey how's it going thanks for watching oh michael said i'm already lost that didn't take long sorry uh christian says hi and how are you today um not not bad and also asked how my day is going so yeah day's not bad uh i was up early with the baby and um didn't really get anything done even though i was up early because i was trying to keep her entertained in a room and quiet so that she didn't wake up everyone else in the house uh so didn't get a chance to work out this morning definitely gonna try to work out when i get home though and uh so i i started i look i'm bringing this up because you asked how my day is so uh apologies to those who just want to know about the code but briefly to give you a little update on my life um so i you all know that i you know battled depression um and exercise definitely helps me a lot so i've been trying to exercise more and i've also added to that i'm on a diet now so i weighed myself on saturday and i weighed significantly more than i've ever weighed before in my life i weighed 190 pounds two years ago i weighed 150 pounds so it's a definitely a huge increase so i decided to go on a diet i mean i don't i don't look like i'm overweight but realistically 190 pounds is probably you know too much for someone who's five foot ten so decided to go on a diet really weird for me i've never really been on a lose weight diet before so i'm in the middle of that so my eating habits are different i'm it's not like a really uh complicated diet it's just uh taking you know less calories than than i um burn more calories than i take in right that's that's the plan uh but with that i'm trying to make sure that i maximize the amount of protein i eat and i'm trying to do do workouts so cardio workouts weights things like that as much as i can get in so that's where i'm at so so far i've lost five pounds since saturday which i think is good uh i haven't like i said i haven't really dieted that much so but i'm trying to feel it out so i think i'm probably taking in too few calories because uh my muscles aren't recovering as fast as they normally do so i might have to adjust it a bit but anyway so far i actually feel i feel good uh my depression is not bad at all so maybe maybe i've like accidentally stumbled on some other helpful thing of uh you know kind of eating healthier will also help my depression which now that i say it sounds like hey why didn't i think of that before but i realistically just never correlated my diet with my depression so anyway that's my mental health and personal life uh story for today let's see uh christian says uh you're not using webpack for this um well i mean webpack's involved in some of the process uh in terms of uh like the the build right so when we use next webpack is like preconfigured so there's a lot of web pack going on behind the scenes but we don't directly uh configure anything uh john hanson says uh they're talking about urls is there a way to write an anchor tag url href to search a string in the visitor's own default search engine and a new window hmm i've i've never tried that or even thought about doing that before yeah i'm not sure yeah i don't know about the user's default search engine i mean potentially you could have uh you could open a new window with a string that would uh like automatically put in whatever you want to search for like into a search query uh if if that's how that search engine works so then it would give you results it's like uh you know you can search for something on google and then copy and paste that url and then somebody else can see those results so i mean essentially you just need to build that url like that so i mean it's but i don't know how you would know what their default search engine is i don't i don't know of any um any like browser api that lets you know what their default search engine is not to say it doesn't exist i've just never heard of it rizwan says hello hey how's it going thanks for watching evo says hey hey how's it going uh evo says quick question are you using typescript with react if so how do you handle styling no i'm not using typescript with uh with react so i haven't really done that much with typescript i'm not against typescript i just just haven't really used it evo says just in general how do you handle styling and react without style components i've imported css files with classes into components but that just feels dirty for some reason yeah i mean there's a lot of different ways to do styles in react so as far as i know there's not one way that's like this is the best way you have to do it like this there's a lot of different ways generally you know having your css somewhere in the actual component uh that seems to me to be the best way to handle things because then your components become you know very modular and reusable so there are a variety of ways to accomplish that so whatever way works best with you and what your overall system i think is is fine phoenix is here phoenix says hello hey how's it going says you started early today i did i i started a little early for a time i was starting the streams at like 11 a.m eastern time which is even earlier than i did today uh i just kind of got off track with different meetings and things going on hey frankie's here says hey sensei hey how's it going let's see eric knows best says what do you recommend to learn react check out the react documentation the latest version of free code camp so the beta version uh has some react stuff in it as well i personally haven't gone through it yet so i don't i don't know uh if that's enough to really learn it i think google says react um code academy has react course yeah that's where i would go uh to do to do react and then of course there's there are plenty of youtube tutorials we have some on on the free code camp channel so i mean that pretty much has you covered you know between video text if you're gonna do the react documentation uh or like guided learning um in terms of the code academy course between those that should give you a really good introduction you know no matter what your learning style is all right nikki says it's immutable yeah new urls for each deploy and auto writing was already there that's awesome yeah for sure super super awesome um frankie says are you fasting um eric's is uh intermittent fast intermittent fasting is the best um yeah so i i'm not purposely doing intermittent fasting uh i in like practice though i have been uh holding off on eating till later in the day uh that's just kind of been like i've been waking up later than normal and they haven't had time to eat so i'm just like okay well i'll just wait uh so i'm not purposely doing it i i need to learn more about intermittent fasting uh because if i'm going to do it i want to do it the right way i i don't want to like mess up uh mess myself up so i'm not i'm not actually doing it i'm um i said i'm just tracking all my calories i'm tracking my protein and you know i'm just making sure that i i burn more calories than i take in at this point frankie says thanks for sharing your story with us oh yeah no no problem i just uh i always get nervous when i share because i i wonder how many people actually care about that kind of stuff uh and if you'd rather just do more coding so um yeah but i don't i don't mind sharing as long as you are somewhat interested i guess uh john says five pounds is often just water weight especially when eating more protein long term of comparison weights will tell more okay cool that that actually explains it more because i kind of thought like five pounds seems like a lot of weight right like how do i lose five pounds in what's five days and that's so that that makes more sense christian says thank thank you for sharing man what you do on this channel is awesome and it really helps me to learn react faster i'm new to react node.js and all that oh you're welcome i'm i'm really glad that this is uh is helpful to you michael says wouldn't the browser send them to default search page so this goes back to the question about the search well i don't i don't know because if you're going to put that search string in it's it's going to be a url to a particular search engine so you would there would have to be some way to find out what the default search page is so you can construct the proper url uh at least that's that's what i'm thinking uh maybe there's some other way that i'm missing harsh it's here hey harsha says i was unable to make it some work came up oh yeah no problem marsha um frankie says we care thanks i i appreciate that um john says homeostasis is that endorphin high while your body readjusts enjoy it while it lasts okay so cool so john john knows what's going on then so evidently i'm gonna have this uh this endorphin high while i'm i'm switching into my diet mode so it's actually good to know that it won't last so now i won't think something's wrong whenever i lose that feeling all right she says title on home page says my page still in devface does it still say my page oh yeah it does i gotta make sure i change that all right good good eye on there let me see does it change yeah it never changes all right definitely got to make sure that changes all right um well i've gotten to the end of all the questions on the chat we only did one pomodoro session of coding because i mean we got everything done in in one so we didn't really need it uh still ended up getting an hourlong stream in so um if if there are any more questions and you get them in here within the next minute or so i can get to them otherwise i think i'm gonna you know finish up the stream now phoenix says i've started 30 days 30 sites i now know i need to pick up my pace of development yeah wow so you're going to build 30 websites in 30 days that's crazy that's really crazy let me know how that goes phoenix that's that's interesting all right so uh christian is the whole page in javascript react and node.js yeah yeah i mean that's pretty much what we're using uh in terms of on i mean we got we got some other stuff going on on different servers in terms of content management database but on the react server i mean that's that's what it is um react with next js we have apollo for graphql and then we have node i mean we're running express with node but i mean basically yes it's all it's all javascript on those react servers all right well i think that's it for this stream thank you so much for watching this is one of the rare times when everything went right we didn't have any problems uh so i'm happy about that um let's see what's smart friday i'm gonna try to stream tomorrow i will be at home tomorrow so hopefully i can get a stream in uh still working on that stream quality so i can't guarantee anything but i'll try my best to stream and to give a good quality stream so hopefully i'll see you all tomorrow if not uh next week on monday and uh until then uh have a great day maybe a great weekend i'll see ya
