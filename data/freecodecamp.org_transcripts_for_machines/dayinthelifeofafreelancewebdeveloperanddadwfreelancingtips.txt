all right so very quickly let me explain this video i was thinking about taking you through a walkthrough of one of my days but the problem is every single day is different so whatever i'm doing on monday may not be truly representative of what i'm going to be doing on tuesday wednesday thursday or friday and being a freelance web developer you're going to find that you're going to be working at different hours during the day and sometimes overnight so i figured let me just try to throw into a video everything that i possibly try to do during a typical day and again there are no typical days so watch the video hopefully you enjoy it i'm going to show you some footage of what i do during various days again remember i'm married with three kids and i work from home so hopefully you enjoyed this video just see what time that says let's see if i can focus in on that 4 33 ass in the morning that's crazy that's what it looks like outside right now this is the time the champions get up how's your egg on is it good uh yes i pack everything mama i gotta show you what's in my bag in my bag i have um my little macbook air that way i can code whenever i have to on the go i have some diapers there's well some pullups because he's actually using pullups now because this one still needs it and of course we gotta have water and i got his water there too in the car we got the drone we got a moped here's moped the video camera and the dslr camera so you got a lot of stuff in the bag hello today we're learning what are we doing today today we're working right yes all right what's up everybody videos what's up everybody my name is joel i'm the creator of pixelmer.com and this is my son gavin he is my assistant he spends a lot of time with me whenever i'm coding whenever i'm building websites whenever i'm here working from home i'm a freelance web developer i create wordpress powered websites and i do it from the distraction field area called my house and what i always try to advocate that people try to get a dedicated environment where they could just strictly focus on the things they have to work on sometimes that's not possible so you have to be able to push through and just get the job done yes like that exactly right papa yes so this video is about a day in the life of a freelance web developer and in my case a wordpress developer you know every day is different no day is the same you know i get up at different times every day i go to sleep at different times every night some days i'm working from home some days i go outside and i work either from a coffee shop or i've actually tried working from the beach but that kind of doesn't work out especially since when it's so nice outside you just want to relax under the sun so that one may not actually be something that saw a good idea to do but working at a park is not a bad idea working at a coffee shop is awesome and being able to be mobile is ideal because you can work from home but you know sometimes you want to change up your environment you want to change things around a little bit of background i'm married i have three kids and i started coding later on in life it wasn't my first career i didn't start coding when i was in you know high school and become one of those prodigy type coders i learned based out of necessity and then out of desire i chose to change careers and i went from being a suit and tie type of guy to being a tshirt or a polo shirt and jeans type of guys thank you very much dana is new york city ready for the ufc and ever since making the transition i haven't looked back i get to spend a significant amount of time in my family which is very important to me make it exactly right and i get to spend time working on the projects that i want to work on yes yeah right this is my little assistant over here he's gonna end up creating something awesome in the future and he's gonna be a million times better coder than i am yeah i'm a big boy you're a big boy that's right high five all right so in preparation for making this video i tried to figure out what would be the best representation of a typical day and again that's very difficult to try to portray because every day is different every day is unique so i figured i just laid out on the table every day is different i get up at different times in the morning go to bed at different times tonight some days i'm working on clients websites some days i'm working on my themes that i sell on my website pixelmorph.com and i do both because you're not always going to have clients in the pipeline and that's something to realize you need to find a way to make some passive income so that's why i chose to besides working on client website and contract work i decided to create some wordpress themes that i sell on my website where people could buy them from i've also taken part in affiliate marketing and now creating videos on youtube so having the ability to make some passive revenue and also have some client work and contract work is vital to my workflow and going into workflow that's different for everybody i work on three different types of systems i work primarily in my workstation computer here which is a windows based uh computer and i built the computer myself so that way i can have a video editing rig and the triple monitor setup makes it a lot more productive for me but again this is the workstation that stays here i can't take this anywhere with me at least not easily so that's why i still also have my laptops i have a macbook pro a macbook air and i have a linux based uh laptop it was formerly a windows based laptop but i wiped out windows on that one and i just put up a linux mint on that laptop and that allows me to be mobile so whenever i'm working from home i'm most likely working on this computer and then whenever i'm outside i take one of the laptops with me most often i take the macbook air because that is the smallest one it's the 11 inch macbook air and this is one of the best laptops because it's so small so tiny and you can pretty much take it with you anywhere battery life on it is pretty good this is not a new one it's a 2012 but it's perfect for you know coating on the go so this definitely is always in my bag whenever i'm going outside and actually that's going to be a good video to create what's in my bag but that's for another time so this is the macbook air that's what i take when i'm on the go obviously i have breakfast lunch and dinner i drink coffee that's what keeps me up yeah i eat juice yeah gavin drinks juice and uh we're gonna actually break for some lunch now so we're gonna uh probably have what are we gonna have oh i made some chicken nuggets so i think it's ready so we're gonna start getting that now and then we're gonna jump on the computer and show you a little bit of what i do here we need to buy in the old mandela yeah yeah but we're not going to mcdonald's today um anyway so i'm gonna break for lunch right now and then i'm gonna take some footage of typically what i do on my computer i'll show some screenshots of what i do on my coding process i work with html see it says javascript php mysql and wordpress i use the visual studio code text editor and sometimes i use phpstorm as well i also have git as part of my workflow because it's a great version control and i use gulp as the task runner that's an important part of my workflow because it helps to take care of the lower level processes that uh would take a significant amount of time and again as i said you know i'm all over the place some days i'm working from home some days i'm working offsite and time is money especially if you're freelancers so you have to find every single way you can to try to save time so you can focus on the larger tasks at hand alright so right now gonna break for lunch uh uh all right so hopefully you found this video helpful i wanted to provide you with a little bit of insight of what a freelancer does during the day and again every single day is going to be different so to say there's going to be a typical day well that's not going to tell you the whole story because again one day you're going to be doing one project the next day you'll be working on another project so you have to be able to be adept if you have to be able to change your mindset and change your workflow of course it's good to have structure of course it's good to try to schedule your day and try to plan out what you're looking to accomplish but instead of giving yourself a schedule try to give yourself goals try to identify what needs to get done on any given day alright so hopefully you found the video helpful if you did give it a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe and if you're new to freelancing hopefully this helped and i'll see you next time take care uh
