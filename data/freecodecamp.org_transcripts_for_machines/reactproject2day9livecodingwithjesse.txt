hey everybody its Jessie and today we're gonna do some stuff with forms and react so if if any of you have built something with react where you needed to handle form data especially if you had to handle file uploads let me know what you like to use if you know if there's some some package or something that makes it easy that you think is awesome let me know and I'll check it out and I might use it otherwise I think I'll just start out by making some controlled components some controlled inputs and and we'll just go from there and see how much we can get done I have on the screen the URL for our server our end rocks server so you can check out everything that we're doing you know live and I'm gonna paste that into the live chat all right I see some people were saying hi in the live chat hey everyone hey thanks for watching okay and as usual we have the the secondary stream going on on on Instagram as well the links in the description so while we're waiting wait for everybody to join let me just briefly thank those of you who submitted pull requests so we had four or three three three for us yeah we had three pull requests since yesterday stream so thank you to Kevin and Sebastian for the pull request I merge these in this one eye closed just because Sebastian had already done the same thing in this pull request but this one this pull request had some other stuff that I wanted to merge so since I was gonna merge this anyway I just closed this one otherwise there would have been merged conflicts because the same lines were being changed in the files so but we have basically some additional testing and then now if you do clone the the repo and you try to commit something the tests will run on commit so it'll be a little little extra in your in your console you'll see that the test run and when we can I'm assuming that at some point during today's stream will commit something so you'll be able to see what that looks like in the terminal so that was awesome thanks Kevin and Sebastian did it he did a few things so he moved move the components into the proper folder a little bit of organization and made sure that it when we're where we were using that component the the path changed to reflect the new location and then also we have this you could you could see it if you're checking out the N drop link but I'll bring it over I kept on my other screen yeah let me bring this over so the upload button so we we ended the string yesterday talking about this file upload so what Sebastian did was took all these styles and some of the JavaScript for the file upload actually it converted the JavaScript that was being used by materialized framework into something that was better with react you know the more of the react way of doing things and got the file upload working so it looks good it looks almost exactly like what I had before which I'll I'll bring that on the screen to to compare I gotta open it again this it always loves me out of the system that this is in I always have to log back in but with the exception of the color and possibly the size you can see it looks pretty much exactly the same the only thing that I guess we don't have is this this text which i think is not necessary maybe the only reason I put that there was just to let people know that they could upload more than one file but that's implied by the use of the plural files here as well so I'm not even sure I'm gonna put that in here so thank thank you for that Sebastian and Kevin and you can see I've added in the the proper labels for a lot of these and down here actually this was way more tricky than I thought it would be so the default for checkbox is the material UI is that you can click anywhere on the label and it'll either select that checkbox or unselected so I tried to put a link in here and I did put the link in so you can I was able to pass in an element and I just wrapped this in a span and then put the link in but I couldn't click it every time I tried to click the link it actually you know made the checkbox become selected and unselected so this it's a little bit odd so the solution after I shot a few things the best solution was there was basically a div that was enclosing all of this and I just the div like I think 35 pixels wide so now the div stops you can see where it stops like right here so then that allows this link to work so a little bit of an odd thing but just thought I'd bring that up and in case in case anyone wondered if you looked at the code and saw the weird stuff I was going with this that's why I did it like that all right so we have the form and I mean with the exception of you know some minor minor things of you know the padding and things like that the names for these this is pretty much what the form is going to be also changed this a bit but what I want to do is have this form actually do something because right now nothing happens you can hit the submit button and nothing happens so we need we need to do something so let me let me explain what how I envisioned this working and then you all can let me know whether or not that's a good idea or if you have a better idea so what will happen basically is all these will be controlled let me bring up just so you all know in case you're not familiar with the idea of controlled input where did I have it I always have too many windows open to have it here oh I had it up here the whole time okay so controlled components if you go to just the the react Doc's Facebook github io / react slash Docs and you go to the forms page it talks about this so you can read up more on it but basically what we're gonna do is every time one of these changes so the value changes it's going to update the state for that component and then the value we get the value for that component from state so what ends up happening is that we don't change the value directly I mean sitting from a user's perspective it works the same way but what's happening behind the scenes is that we don't change the value directly when you we type in here the on change fires and then it changes the state and then since the state has changed it causes the render the rerender and then the value you get the value from state so everything kind of flows I guess differently normally it's just like directly changing the value when you type in there now why would we want to do it like that well one nice thing is it makes it easy to do validation so I don't know that I absolutely need a lot of validation for this but it leaves us open to that if we do it like this right away also all of our values then are going to be in the state and it's going to be really easy to pull those values and do whatever we need to with them so we're gonna do that we're gonna grab the at some point when the user click Submit we're gonna need to get all those values and what's probably gonna happen is they're gonna get sent to our server j/s which we may have to eject or create react app so as you know we used create react app to do this and if you notice we don't have a server ojs file here so we're probably going to need to eject it unless anyone else has a better idea we're going to need to eject that and then we're going to in our form data there and then handle everything there serverside that way you know we don't have to worry about exposing any API keys on the clientside which currently I am actually doing to make this work where it is now and the only reason I was comfortable doing that is because it was behind a password so no one could even see this page unless they were able to log in and only employees of the University could log in so I was I was ok with that because probably 99% of the employees would have no idea even how to find the key and if they found it they would wouldn't know what it did for any of the api's that we're gonna be using so now that it's not gonna be beyond the password definitely don't want to handle that stuff clientside so I want to do everything serverside and that's the plan so having said all that what do you think let me know in the live chat if you're watching this later on let me know in the comments if you're watching it way later on then I guess don't worry about because this project will probably already be completed but if you do have an opinion you can still let me know I'll read it later on it just won't get into this project maybe a future project so hey to everyone joining me in an Instagram I think okay it looks like I recognized the names in the Instagram so you all know what's going on I don't have to tell you where to see the code at all right so let me check the live chat since I said a lot of stuff and I want to hear what you all think all right so Don Xavier says four forms you can go with form Z react has some validation and other goodies and if you want material you I check out form Z material you I okay cool I'm gonna check that out let me bring that up on my other screen here I like that they already have something with mature UI all right some checking out the github page now let me bring this over so we had a suggestion you use form Z the form Z mature UI okay it seems pretty straightforward it's not not a whole lot in the readme if you see something to get home that has a short read me it's either really simple or there's there's just not a lot of directions they come with it so it could be really good or not really good but this looks pretty straightforward maybe we use that let me uh let me see what else what else you all think okay Sebastian Sebastian added something that should be showing up okay so let file value equals the state file input okay so basically Sebastian is saying here this is our service request form component that what should happen the file value should say select a file to upload if there's nothing in state four where's the file input so yeah I'm not really sure why that's not working let me refresh it was do that you refresh the page and see that's all I'm gonna check what the state is in dev tools it opened on the other screen there but okay that's odd maybe so it's showing an empty array for actually notes yeah for file input it's showing an empty array maybe I don't know maybe since it actually exists even though it's an empty array it's it's not triggering the the war side of that but that's cool since that's in there I can make that work and then that'll just be an easy way to have that text show up so thanks thanks for pointing that out Sebastian ok Roland says shouldn't the planning guy to open in a new tab that is a good idea so if you notice when I click planning guide it didn't open a new tab but you would except in a new tab especially actually I want to see if I type stuff in I want to see if it saves if I were to hit back no it actually cleared it out yes a good call on that definitely want this to open in a new tab otherwise it would be super frustrating for someone to fill all this out get to the bottom say I'd like to read the planning guide first and then have it all taken away so I think on the current version it doesn't take it away so it doesn't clear the fields so we'll have to see I was trying to think of a way where I could make it make everything stay there I mean the really the simplest solution is to make this open in a new tab so I will do that let me add that so I finally get the Trello board going a little bit so I can I'll send a link to this I'll share it and then put a link in the video if hopefully I'll remember later on to do it and then you all can check out this Trello board as as I'm working with it adding to it and that should not take very long so I'm going to put that down for a half of a pomodoro cycle all right so good stuff you all have great ideas for me already it's just at the beginning of the stream Andrew says hi Jesse just wanted to thank you so much for sharing your work as a beginner learning react this has been so helpful to me oh well thanks for saying that I'm glad that this is helpful to you and I really appreciate you saying that and then whenever anybody has some positive feedback for me I appreciate that I don't mind critical feedback either so occasionally I get feedback that's not so positive but there's always something that that can be helpful even in a negative feedback unless it's just completely crazy and somebody's really angry but usually there's something something helpful but the positive stuff keeps me going and it makes me really look forward to these dreams and I'm really happy that that I'm helping some of you out I know you all are helping me out I've learned so much from from you since I've started streaming I think this has been the fastest I've ever learned maybe since I've heard you know when you first start you fly through HTML and CSS and think you're awesome like and then you hit JavaScript and they're like can't do anything once you starts to do difficult things so aside from that first early time of rapid rapid learning this has been like amazing because when you all submit code to me I have to try to figure it out I don't want to just pull it in without understanding it so I've been learning quite a lot oh cool rollin said the the Instagram stream is synced with this one that's really cool I'm glad I never thought about it until now but I guess it would be really hard to watch if they were out of sync it would it would be weird so that's cool that it's it's all synced up okay bill said that he used formzee material you I and a react project recently and liked how easy it was to use awesome definitely think I might end up using that okay Sebastian said if I set the initial state to null then this text should show up so am i setting yeah here it is I'm setting state there all right let's check check that out yeah that works okay cool so yeah I'll probably end up changing the color which I was gonna change the color these anyway all of them so I'll just do it when I do that but cool so now the text does appear there and awesome cool thanks for that Sebastian sebastian what's up with the frowny face emoji did I say something that made you said I remember what I was saying Philips hit the Instagram people will be like question mark question mark yeah I've had people pop in on Instagram during the stream before and just type like WTF and then leave they wonder why I'm just here because all you see on the instagrams stream is just me talking not even looking at the stream most of the time I'm looking at my screen and just talking with headphones on so uh I imagine it is kind of weird all right cool aim highs in here and suicide hey how's it going how's the new job yeah let me know I haven't haven't heard from you in a while and also sometimes I call you by whatever your name is on on YouTube but I mean I know what your real names are a lot of times either from github or Twitter or something so if you have a preference if for some reason you don't want me to use your real name on my stream let me know because otherwise I'll probably end up doing it at some point it just reminded me because I always say aim high because that's his name in chat but I do know his real name from Twitter so so let me know if it doesn't matter to you that's cool and I'll just use whichever name and otherwise I don't want to I don't know if somebody's like in the witness protection program or something I don't want to mess things up for you so so let me know if you don't want me to say your name on the stream oh okay John had a good idea the planning guide could be a modal hmm alright I'm gonna think about that if the planning guy pops up as a modal then I don't have to worry about about anything happening to their their data in the form I'm yeah I'm gonna think about that I kind of like that idea especially since I'm gonna condense the planning guide a bit before the Planning guide was spread out over several pages so a modal wouldn't make quite as much sense it would be a lot of information for the modal but we'll see yeah that might that might work Hamza says the link here is is only bolded would it be hard for the user to distinguish between the basically to make to know that that is a link yeah it's possible that it could be difficult I could maybe make it a different color that would be more usually what I would I have done on other sites is the links not just bolded it's actually a completely different color whatever the the main accent color is that I'm using so maybe that would be better to go with a different color I really don't want to put in the the underline the standard default underlined under a link I just don't like how that looks to me if the underlined under the link just looks really really oldschool like the early internet and so I don't I don't like it although I I understand that people would immediately see like hey that's a link but if I if I don't if I can get away with not having that and people still understanding it's a link I'd rather do it like that but I do understand what you're saying okay so Kevin says I think you can get away without ejecting by just creating a server das file and changing the NPM start to do NPM run build and then nodes serve Jaso okay cool that's good to know I'd rather not eject if I don't have to so I will I will try that I'm actually I'm gonna copy what you just put in the live chat and paste it somewhere because in case the chat gets really long and that message gets deleted I want to have it so I'm gonna put it right in there cash cash yep says I'm lacking motivation to code I want to but I end up not doing it yeah that's tough I know I've been there I guess trying to think what I do to get motivated it's easier to get motivated now than before I guess when I was freelance because now like I have a boss that could potentially say like what are you doing get to work so that that helps I found when I like motivation usually I'm getting depressed so I need like exercise possibly caffeine but does anyone else have any good ideas for getting motivated you know go ahead and put them in the live chat if if you do okay Sebastian I finally understand why why Sebastian put the the frown emoji in the chat so I had missed the first time that he said gave the solution to to what was going on here so sorry you know sometimes it takes me about to see things in the chat so the chat is is very active right now so I'm gonna have to pull away from it and do some coding here in a minute because we're already a half hour in and I've done very little all right so let me let me do some coding I'll do my I'll set my timer so I'll come back to the live chat whenever my Pomodoro timer is up or if I need your help I'll come back to the live chat you know before it's up which the likelihood of me needing help is really high as as you all know but for now so don't worry if I didn't get you your comment or question and the lab chat I will get to it eventually let's see so actually you know what I want to try first just to see cuz this is this is going to be a big deal I'd like to try this because I'm really curious as to how I would do the custom server stuff yeah yeah let me see where's my package.json file so in case you're you're not familiar with what's going on here maybe if you're just joining or you're not familiar with react so we created this using create react app and that took care of a lot of the setup that goes into like setting up web pack and hot module reloading and a lot of stuff that can be a headache to set up at the beginning the project and you don't really need to know how to do all that if you just want to get started and do something basic with react but if you want to start doing custom things you can't do it by default with create react app because a lot of that stuff is kind of hidden away and that's what makes it so easy to get started with and use but it also makes it difficult to customize so they built in a feature called eject which lets you basically see all that customization stuff once you eject though you can't go back so I'd rather not eject if I don't have to if I'm not a ejected yet I can still update and take advantage of whatever new stuff is coming so it's it's definitely a tradeoff I've done it I've done projects where I never ejected and I've also done stuff where I have ejected so I guess it just really depends on what you what you need to do so right now I know that at some point I'm gonna want to do things in my server ojs file I was thinking that I might have to eject but I might maybe I won't have to eject so let's see I wonder I just had a thought could I make a branch in eject the branch and then just see what what happens just see how bad that is and then still have my master branch be not ejected right that could work right let's uh I kind of want to do it now that I've talked about it yeah let's do that actually I really want to show you all what its if you've never done it before seen it like so that you don't have to try to eject one of your own projects and you know potentially mess it up if you don't want to so let's do it on this because I haven't done a project that I've ejected for a long time so yeah let's try it and see what happens what do you think but Sebastian Sebastian recommended just make a copy of the folder the project is in so you don't mess up your get would that mess it up I mean could I would it mess it up that bad that I should completely have a different directory for my project because otherwise I kind of like okay yes it seems like a few people yeah that's what I was thinking Kevin says that worst case you could just delete the node modules and do an NPM install again yeah that's what I was thinking right I can that should work right although now that you all said that maybe it does make a lot of sense that I should that I should do this in a different directory so let me do that where's my where's my terminal that so if you join late and didn't see the link here's the link let me put that I pasted it in really early on like within the first minute so I'm gonna paste it in again just in case cuz you see there's not really a lot of connections open okay so let me go and she's gonna go to all right so I'm gonna pull the project into this folder and then eject it in there and then that way there's no chance that I will mess up what we're actually working on so this would be a good demo of how to pull down projects from get up as well so this might be a good day for beginners a little bit different than what I thought we were gonna do I just noticed today that github is like the first thing on my screen when I open a new tab and I was proud of that like I go to get up more frequently than anything else I was afraid it would be like Netflix or something and then but notice github so I've been working a lot let's see maybe I not CIA Resource Center okay so if you want to clone a repo which I'm sure you've heard me say that before so you go to github and then go to the repo that you want in this case this is what we want and we go to this clone or download button and copy now this depends on how you have it set up if you have your github account set up on your machine with SSH keys you can use this otherwise you can use HTTPS and I think that will prompt you to type in your github password so otherwise with SSH you don't need the password so but either one will work so I've copied that and I'm gonna now I'm in the directory that I want to be in for this and I'm gonna type git clone and I'm going to put that in now let's go Resource Center there you go so here's our files now once you've done that you want to either type in NPM install or Yarn depending on what you want to use if you have yarn and the file has a yarn lock then you probably just want to use yarn but that's entirely up to you so what you would you like to use for that and that's going to take all the stuff in package.json and it's going to install that so otherwise if you try to run this right now it may not work because you don't have actually there's no way it will work I'm pretty sure you have none of the node modules right now generally you don't want to sync your node modules to your github repo that's just kind of a waste since you have your package JSON everybody that downloads it knows what it they need so there's no reason to track your your node module folder okay so now let's type in your and I should have done this immediately so it was working while I was talking so now we're gonna type yourn I just realized that this is really tiny sorry about that and you make it bigger okay so yarn is now getting all the packages and dependencies that it needs and installing them so when yarn is finished we'll have everything we need to run this now what we're gonna do as soon as this finishes it's actually run eject and then we can compare since we'll have both versions open we can compare the file structure just to get an idea of what's different update yarn I get this message a lot I think sometimes either yarn gets updated a lot or I'm doing it wrong okay I'm gonna open this up in Adam and we see the package.json that we have here which is the same as the one we have on screen so pretty much the same or exactly the same here we go it's exactly the same so when I run it Jack then we can compare and see the differences so let me go back here and I'll run is it just eject yeah so using yarn or NPM or whatever you want I think you can just yarn eject I don't think you have to yarn run eject let's see if this works yep are you sure you want to eject its permanent yes I'm sure ejected successfully that was so fast okay so all this stuff should now be in our our package.json so let's check it out yep all right so now look at all this stuff so we couldn't see a lot of this before and now we can this was all still there behind the scenes it was just kind of hidden to make things a bit more simple okay so now we we actually have you know we have access to all of this what else do we have we have a scripts folder and this has some additional files some additional JavaScript files and we have a config folder so we got a lot of extra stuff we have our webpack configs which like there's a lot of stuff I mean there's a lot of stuff coming it out but there's there's still a lot of stuff in there so you can see it saves you a lot of time and effort configuring configuring all of this but that's what happens when you eject so there we go I'm now that I have ejected now I'm kind of like thinking I definitely don't want to eject if I don't have to because now I remember how crazy it gets when you eject and that all of a sudden there's all this stuff okay so definitely not going to commit that that change so for demonstration purposes we have ejected and now I actually have a another place where I could potentially just switch over and test what's going on you know see how how hard it would be to do it with it ejected so I guess it's beneficial to have that right now not hopefully I won't need to use it though and you can see why it just gets a lot more complex when you have all that they're just my package.json file alone got really big so it looks like how much time okay I'm being on time I'm not I see a lot happening in the live chat and I will check back on that just seen a few of the the comments here I see Patrick says ya know eject yeah you can see it's crazy when you eject it's definitely I'm I'm not I'm not at all an expert at web pack so you know all this kind of stuff I have not really sure what's going on okay so now now I think it's it's obvious to me I think I needed to see that just to know like how worth it is it for me to try to make this work without ejecting and now that I've seen all the extra stuff that happens when you eject like I said I've seen it before but it's been a really long time so I had forgotten but now that I've seen it I'm a little bit more motivated to try to make things work without having to eject so that was useful at least for me hopefully it was useful for you all to to see what what happens when you eject that so let's let's go in now and actually start working with our form okay so here's a question do I once do I want to make these controlled components if I'm gonna use a UI what was that the material UI camera what the name was form Z that was that I think it was form Z this one yeah form Z material you I would this then take care of some of that would I would I end up messing this up if I try to or just from what I'm seeing right here I guess not all right so I do want to kind of test this and read up on it so I'm not going to run this right now so I'm gonna move that off to the side I just don't want to spend a lot of time reading documentation while I'm livestreaming because that's not probably not really beneficial to anyone to stare at my screen while I read something all right so let's let's go where I lost my there it is okay so for our controlled components basically when it end up doing something like this so this is the section on handling multiple inputs which obviously is what we're doing we have a lot of inputs on that page so the way that they're doing it here in the documentation is their adding in in the state the name okay so they're taking the name of the input and then they're using that as the key and then obviously the value of the input is the value and then on their handle they have a handle input change event you can see basically it's kind of nice so they only have to say you know set state once everything else they just make it a Const and then they're able to grab what they need from that event so they can grab the value so you can see they even have you know check box which is great cuz we're gonna have a lot of check boxes so that's cool so I don't really have one I have to make a cost for every single one so hopefully there's a better way to do that because that would be a lot but that's better than having to have a totally different you know called a set state going on so I guess what I need to do is give a name to these inputs because I don't think they have names they don't have IDs or anything so we need to do that before we do anything else because we have no way to identify them so let me see I'm assuming that material UI just passes down the same thing yeah name okay we can just use name like Norma so just give it to a few of these okay so I'm just gonna do a couple just to make sure that this is working and then in our props I guess we'll have we don't really want any of these to have a beginning value right yeah cuz we're using our floating label basically so we don't we don't need a value to begin with so since that'll be a string I guess we'll start out with string what was the next one email okay subscribe this oops let me grab this as well sure you get that first we get semicolons so I'm not gonna manually get rid of the semicolons they'll be you gotten rid of when we commit okay so I think we have we need the on change and other than that I think we have everything let me change okay I misread this completely so I was very mistaken a few minutes ago so let me correct and I'm sure you've already corrected me in a live chat so I misread this so I apologize I was reading over this hastily before the stream was about to start so and I misread this somehow thinking that I would have to make a Const for each one which I thought seemed a bit ridiculous and in fact it was ridiculous because that's not even what they were doing so it looks like I won't have to do that so what's happening with these cost is so this is the target I don't know what I was thinking now it seems so obvious to me I guess that happens sometimes I didn't have any caffeine until just right when I started this dream so I'm gonna blame it on that I've got my G fuel no so now my brain is working okay so we're grabbing the event okay we're getting the target and we're saving that to a variable now we're using that to get the value so we can set that if it equals checkbox right then we're gonna get target checked otherwise else right we're gonna get target value okay and that's because for for the other inputs we can just grab the value and that'll give us the value of the input but for checkboxes it's different so we just there's we don't check the value of it we just want to know whether it's checked or not all right and that's gonna be a boolean so this makes a lot more sense now then we want to get the name and that's what we're using here so we're gonna get the name and the that makes so much sense sorry sorry for being such an idiot a few minutes ago so I'm sure those of you who know what you're doing with with you know with react knew immediately that I didn't know what I was talking about but I really apologize to those of you who are new I probably confuse you quite a bit I myself was confused so sorry about that so it seems like now we actually do have everything we'll need so let's just try it out and see see if we're actually gonna be able to change the state so I'm just gonna type in some nonsense here and then we're gonna check the state let me inspect this and then I'll bring over dev tools assuming it worked I'll bring it over and be impressive if it didn't work I'll just won't even show it but it did work okay so let me make it bigger okay so you can see here's the state for a component our service request component here's our state we have email we have and this is our the nonsense that I just typed in for all of them okay but we have email name phone number and that's exactly what need so we have all these values and let me see if I can let's do this in real time so you can see a change you can see the flash of kind of a green color under name as it changes so very cool so realtime you know on change it updates state awesome now I just realized that we in fact did not add the value like I said we are going to do so let me do that really quick value equals okay I should probably check the documentation to make sure I did that right but I'm pretty sure that's how it was let's make sure that still works okay cool now if I want to go I wonder if it will let me change the state right here in dev tools it'll be really cool if it does there we go okay let me see if I can change it cool all right so you say I change state here in dev tools and then it changed it here so we can see since I didn't set the value on this looks like the phone element it shouldn't change okay see so it doesn't change so that's what I was trying to explain at the beginning of the stream kind of the flow that it was gonna take was the value is gonna be set by the state and the state is set by what you type in here so hopefully that demonstrated that now my timer did go off a minute ago so I'm gonna go back to the live chat and all right and the it's been an hour of stream because my Instagram live stream just stopped because there's an hour limit so Wow I had 11 viewers so that's pretty good I mean not nowhere near what we get for the for the YouTube stream but I mean that says as I expected but that's cool I mean I I just kind of want to give people the opportunity to see what I look like in case they're interested sometimes we sometimes that's nice instead of just hearing someone's voice to be able to put a face with it and I don't know about you but it's always really hard for me to read like what somebody is is feeling if I can't see their face like are they being are they serious or they joking or happy like it's hard to tell so if you've if you can see their face it's kind of easier so I'll tell you I I'm actually smiling a lot when I do this dream so I really like doing this so that's normally my expression all right so I'm scrolling up in the live chat it looks like I can still read the stuff at the top so that's good so I won't miss anyone's anyone's questions or comments I just saw well earlier when I was saying I won't say your name on onair if you don't want me to and I've mentioned the witness protection program role and so that escalated quickly witness protection it did I mean I was I was just trying to think of some reason why someone wouldn't want me to say the real name that's the first thing that came to mind okay Sebastian says I need to remove exact in the link and check console so I guess I'm getting an error I have dev tools up now so let's check that out okay I'm gonna prop exact on the a tag this drop from the other man link okay never remove that I will remove that right now so don't forget yeah honor when I was doing this I couldn't I remembered that I had to put exact in somewhere when I was using reactor outer but I couldn't remember exactly where or how to put it in and I didn't bother looking it up and I put it in and at work so I just left it at that and I didn't even check the console so thanks for that Sebastian okay cool so Tiffany said when we were talking about the link and making sure that people knew that that really was a link so this this year this planning guide link which is this so Tiffany said a different color different color text triggers hey that's the link to so okay cool I agree thanks for the feedback okay it looks like Rohan agrees as well maybe use some other highlight color for the link okay cool oh man brah brian says yarn or NPM and why I'm knowledge I wonder wonder if any like a huge debate got started let me see it doesn't look like it oh man I was I was afraid there's gonna be this giant debate about your honor NPM it looks like there wasn't occasionally that's happened about code editors somebody mentions a code editor and then the live chat is just filled with people talking about their favorite editor or usually it's not even their favorite editor it's whatever editor they don't like and they talk about why it's bad so I actually like an answer to Brian's question I like yarn but I've heard that the newest version of NPM has some of the features that yarn has and it's also fast so I liked yarn because it has the yarn lock file and because it was faster than NPM but if that's not true anymore an NPM actually has a similar file and it's just as fast or faster then it probably makes more sense to just use NPM since you get you'd have it anyway instead of installing yarn in addition to that so maybe I'll I'll have to check out the newest version of NPM and see what I think about it and then I might actually switch away from yarn but for now I'm gonna stick with yarn until I get the time to check it out check out MTM again the newest version okay so we had a question earlier about you know how to stay motivated to code when you don't feel like coding umberto says I watch people create things or tutorial videos about stuff I'm interested in to get motivated so that's that's cool I don't even think about that it's a good idea I guess that would be motivating like just to remind remind yourself of the cool things that you can do yeah that is cool it is really amazing like coding is about you just get to create things like Withers there's nothing there and you just you start typing code and all things happen that's really cool and then you can you can just mess with it and start over completely and it doesn't matter if you break it does you it's just really cool there's not really a lot that you could do that's like that you could compare that to just the flexibility of it I say I said I listen to Johnny Cash to get motivated oh cool Don Xavier says motivated nothing like some nice tunes got to work with tunes and coffee okay cool yo so says he should get engaged with his peers okay yeah that's I do I agree with the music thing and the coffee thing as well but then also Joseph's comment about getting engaged with peers that can be really good I'm I I would I guess I don't have a lot of experience with having peers that also code because I mostly code by myself it's and I'm not like working with other people in project until now that I'm working with all of you so that actually is motivation for me that I know I'm gonna do the stream and so I wanna I want to get better and know more what I'm doing so I could be more helpful to you all but I know like when I I don't I don't often work out as much as I should nowadays but when I was younger I used to work out all the time and if you have a partner or some people that you work out with you're way less likely to skip a workout and I imagine it's probably the same thing if you have other people that you code with and you talk about coding with you're way less likely to stop coding because they will encourage you and call you out if you don't and you'll have like positive motivation to want to have new things to talk about when you see them so that's definitely a good idea let's see Hamza says why don't you use template strings man they're so better actually I'm not sure I can't remember what I was doing when that comment came up so Hamza I'm sorry I'm not sure what you're referring to with the template strings thing so normally I do use template strings or template literal syntax I use that almost all the time unless it's something really simple and then I just use sometimes I'll just use normal like string concatenation Tiffany says listen to upbeat music while you work suggestion to Door Cinema Club okay never heard that I'll have to check it out Phillip says try the Neo method electronic actually I I listened I listened to a lot of different music when I code so depending on the day I could be listening to anything it's the only music that I probably never listen to is country music so don't like country music but pretty much anything else I like but I K I do listen to electronic music today I listen to a lot of lecture music I don't know about anyone here but if I really want to get motivated I listen to music from the Rocky movies so I don't if you've ever seen any of the Rocky movies a lot of them came out I think they started coming out in the seventies some came out in the 80s and then they started making new ones within the last 10 years or so but the soundtracks always get me fired up I remember watching those movies when I was a kid and getting so pumped up so uhhuh so that that helps me maybe if there's some something like that that you have like strong emotions with when you hear it that could probably help you out alright Isaiah says how important is it to know graph QL for a react developer I don't know graph QL and the take the truth I never considered myself a react developer but maybe I should think about it because I'm building sites for my job and for clients on the side with react so I'm not really sure how you define react developer but I develop sites with react so maybe I am I don't I don't know but anyway that's not really the question honestly I do think graph QL is really cool from what I've read about it I do want to learn it and I think that it's going to be used more so like if I had to guess I would say a graph QL is going to be the thing that people use it seems like it makes a lot more sense I mean I like REST API as I love working with REST API so they're really easy to work with but a graph QL does seem like it makes more sense than the REST API is just in terms of like you can get exactly the data you want and less trips so it seems like there would be less waste in terms of getting data that you really don't need and making a lot of extra trips whereas with graph QL you could probably get exactly the data you need in one trip so I think graph QL is important is it necessary to know definitely not it's important I don't know I think it's pretty important I think right now you definitely don't need to know it but I think it's going to be more used more more and more as you come or more people adopt it and I don't know that's just my my guess but I mean who knows what's gonna happen something else better could come out in a week and then we'll forget about graph QL but I would I would say if you have the time to learn it and you want to learn it then go for it Rowen says by the way the upload file list is not scrollable might get people confuse okay cool I'm gonna move this over the other screen just in case I have like some topsecret files actually I just I don't have anything crazy but I do have files that are like the names of people who have applied to for the web developer job so I don't want to put their names on YouTube so I'm gonna open this on my other screen just in case okay I'm cool I just have I'll bring this back I just have my thumbnails for all my videos here so let's open this let me open a bunch of them and see what's going on here okay so you're saying it's not scrollable for this list okay yeah people might get confused I'm not I don't really know offhand how I would make this scrollable onna maybe I could do something with CSS with the overflow yeah maybe I could do something with the overflow property so I will add that to the list and I'm gonna give that a one Pomodoro cycle because in case my first idea doesn't work it might take a little bit longer alright cool thanks for that Rohan I'm actually really glad I finally like kind of set this up because it is a lot easier for me to just put something in here instead of forgetting about it okay let me see man I just look there's a lot of stuff going on the live chat I want to make sure I get to all of it but probably be a good idea to do a bit more with this let me think what I need actually you know what I'm kind of thinking there's not really anything that everything that I'm gonna do at this point for a while is just gonna be repetition so I'm just gonna be doing the same thing that I did with this to all of these and then at that point I would maybe start working on something else related to this so I think I'm kind of at the point where by the time I would get all this done I would want to end the stream anyway so instead of just repeating the exact same thing that I did which I don't think would be very helpful I think I'm gonna take the questions us simply because the there's so much in the live chat I'm only halfway through everything that was in there so I definitely want to get to the questions also I might I do kind of want to get out of work at a decent time because I think I need to go to the doctor's so I actually I hurt my wrist so I don't know you might have noticed if you watched on the Instagram feed that I was holding my wrist so told my right hand and I'm righthanded and maybe like a month ago I was like playing with my kids in the pool when I was throwing them and at some point like after I've been throwing them for a really long time and I was tired I lifted one of them up and I just felt something like it's pain in my wrist and I just tried to be tough and say like oh that's no big deal it'll be fine and I never did anything about it and it slowly gotten worse and worse every day to the point now where if I use my wrist at all it hurts and that's a problem because obviously like I I need to move my wrist around like even moving my wrist around to select things you know like on the screen you know to move the cursor around hurts so I think I probably ought to go to the doctor's just on the off chance that maybe something serious at least maybe should get like some sort of brace or something so that I can not move it as much because right now it's just really hard not to move it like I always some like picking up the baby you're doing something and I just keep making it worse anyway enough about that I'm sure no one watches this for my health updates let's see but I guess it is it is a good lesson if you're a developer you need your hands most likely to work so take care of them and don't put off getting them checked out if you've heard something alright so at this point if you are here for the code and you don't want to stick around for the question and answer session thank you so much for watching and you can you can safely tune out probably won't be doing any more coding and I'll be back tomorrow most likely at the same time otherwise if you can stick around for a little bit longer and have a question or want to help out and answering some questions then check out the live chat put your question in there if you're shy you can just direct message me on Twitter and I'll try to get you a question whenever I can or if you can't stick around to hear my answer you can either catch the answer later on if you watch the recording of this or you can message me some other way on Twitter or some other social media the link for my Twitter is in the description okay I hadn't said that in a while so I figured I may as well say it for anyone that's new and doesn't know how the stream kind of works so unofficially the stream is split up into two parts the code part and the question and answer part all right so we're still talking about in in regard to the motivation thing so well Mary says I have have a few things that help with motivate group coworking not so much teamwork but working around other people working so sharing that working energy oh that's cool yeah I could I can see that so maybe actually I have rarely done this but I see a lot of people especially like coders on Instagram always for posting pictures of them working at a cafe or something with other people so I don't do that a lot just because where I'm at there's not really a lot of cafes with good WiFi that you could go and work at this it's not not an option for me but I think that's kind of at least it seems popular from from what I see online so good advice thank you Yosef says by the way I'm learning Ajax and listen to your live coding in the background to help me to get motivated oh cool all right so I guess my live coding can be motivation as well I could definitely see my live coding being motivation for somebody saying like how how does this guy have a live stream on YouTube that people watch and like I'm better than him how does this okay I could see people being motivated by that but anyway I appreciate that appreciate you saying that well Patrick says the brain food Spotify playlist off to check that out I don't know if I've listened to the brain food playlist maybe I have at some point yeah definitely if you um if you like listening to music and you can spare the I don't know like ten dollars or less a month to get Spotify Premium I definitely recommend that and I this is not sponsored by Spotify this is my honest opinion my productivity went up when I got Spotify Premium because the commercials got so annoying for me it broke my train of thought and it really did help to get spotify premium so i think that's a legitimate business expense so if you don't have it try it out sometimes they have really good deals where you can get like three months for 99 cents a month or something like that so try it out whenever one of those deals happen that that really helped me out Rohan says working with a couple of people who are motivated enough can be a push for everyone but teams generally take motivation away okay that's interesting so yeah I can agree with that I guess it depends on who you're working with on your team I would say there there are some people and some personalities that are just a drain on the team but then sometimes there are people that are just so positive that it it does help I know there there used to be someone that worked in my department and she retired but even now when I see her every time I see her she tells me oh Jessie you're so smart you can do anything you're going places and she always says that I always laugh you know but that makes me feel so good about myself and she's she's not I mean she I think genuinely believes that and she would convince me like once I applied for a job that was way out of my league and it was partly because she convinced me and talked me up that I that I should do it that I would be great at it so people like that can help you be motivated really positive upbeat people I think are great for motivating you so if you have people like that in your life hang out around them more often or try to find somebody like that and make them your friend okay it looks like okay cool so Kevin is giving me some some links I'm gonna copy these and check these out after the stream okay all right I see this one definitely looks helpful is exactly what we want to do using create react app with react router and Express j/s this this is exactly what we're doing okay cool so thank you thank you Kevin definitely gonna check that out yeah Rowan says node modules isn't traced by get yeah actually so by it by default node modules can be traced but I get so you you do have to put it in your git ignore file so let me let me show you this actually because I do see this occasionally the people will have their node modules in their repo so it's really easy fix here within your get ignore file if you don't have this in your project like you can just copy it from somebody else's project that's similar to yours if you need to I never make these from scratch I always copy it from either a previous project of mine or a similar project I have someone else's and you want to say don't track node modules and then you know there's other stuff in here this one was created automatically when I did create react app but if you were doing the project from scratch then this wouldn't be there automatically so you would have to put it in if you happen to do your project and setup get and forget to do this first and then you want to ignore your files later on you got you have to run a few commands to get that to work so let me I actually just did this some someone wanted me to take a look at their project and so I I cloned it and the node modules were being tracked so I sent a pool request basically just uploading a GUID ignore I think I changed a few other things but one of the things I changed for them was I put this in so let me let me just show you how to do that quickly I guess I'm not well I'm not going to be able to show you because obviously I have it I have it set up the right way but let me show you where I guess I can at least give you the resource that I use because it's happened in the several times so it would be useful let's see I'm trying to tape on my other screen to show you this resource but I can't type today so all right there we go so what you want to do is get you want to do a git RM cache and then you can put the name of your file if it's just one file or like let's say you just you didn't have this at all and there's a bunch of stuff and now you upload your get ignore file or you create your get ignore file then you can just do like alright you want to do the die you want to do everything and then you can go ahead with adding your your other files so you can do a git status it'll show you everything and then you want to add and then push the changes so I'm pretty sure that's how I've done it before I just I was looking for that command so that's what you want to do to get everything back back in order and let me know I'm sure you'll let me know in the live chat if I've missed something here and someone has noticed that I'm missing something important but there's like there's a ton of Stack Overflow questions about that so I'm sure you'll you'll be able to find something you know if you need a little bit more instruction on that ok Dixie says I find watching Jesse's live streams give me gets me motivated seeing him go through the errors and everything is comforting to me at least a hug good food food and music can help too yeah I like that comment I've had a few times I've had people say like that they they like that I make mistakes and work through them and I really I like that comment because that was really my one of like the the main points of this was to show people that I make mistakes and because a lot of your tutorial videos like they edit out any mistakes right you know you want to keep the videos as short as possible and to the point so you edit out the mistakes so I wanted people to see the mistakes so you know they don't get the impression that if they're making mistakes somehow there's something wrong with them when in reality we all make mistakes all the time but it's always funny when I get that because I know people mean it as a compliment but in the back of my mind I'm thinking like like everybody likes just watching me mess up and I know that's not how you how you all mean it but it's just funny to me that in in a sense that's true right like the main draw of this live stream is the fact that I mess up and try to work through it so I don't know maybe it's just me but I think that's kind of that's kind of funny it's amusing but anyway Dixie thanks for saying that I'm glad that that that's comforting to you that's that that's definitely what I what I intend is you know for people to feel a little bit better when they make a mistake because they see me make so many John Hanson said you're gonna need some heavy metal music before going before you hit that Enter key to eject so yeah if I would have seen that I could have switched to some some heavy metal but I think I didn't see it in time so actually my Spotify stopped I made it through this big playlist and so just stops I just restarted it again Patrick says what is the point of using it if you can't feel confident that you can branch an experiment just use a branch you can always clone from github yeah that's what I thought that's what I thought too at first Patrick it was actually kind of cool the way I did it in another folder and then it was easier to compare them sidebyside I know I could have just switched back and forth from the branches but I'm I'm actually like a little bit interested in going in now to that where the the other directory where I each acted and just messing with things and possibly breaking it but I don't know to me now I like inadvertently have a little playground now that I can mess with all the configurations so I'm kind of I'm thinking if I get a little bit of time I can go mess around and maybe learn webpack a bit a bit better so anyway it turned out alright I definitely agree like I I had figured I could just make a branch and then I was kind of secondguessing myself there and just went with the entirely safe route but for future reference for anybody it should have been fine to just make a branch and do do the eject on the branch and I could have just switched back and or Kalandar so so I do I do great Patrick and Kevin looks like Kevin was agreeing with Patrick as well aha I mentioned earlier that when I open up a new tab its it's github its first and I said that I was I was proud of that I was afraid it would be Netflix rhoann says his Netflix I don't mean anything bad by that if you're if you tab who's Netflix that's I like Netflix to although my Netflix isn't hasn't been working I suspect that my wife canceled the Netflix account and didn't tell me I keep forgetting that to ask her about it but every time I try to watch Netflix for the last like few days it hasn't worked but anyway don't feel bad if yours is his Netflix on the merits this is my work computer by the way so maybe that would that would make a difference I never watch Netflix on this computer haha bill said is his local host haha that's awesome that's that's a that's really cool oh that's right okay so I see Kevin says you don't need a password not even a github account to clone just to push that's right thanks Kevin thank you for clarifying that anyway I don't know what I was thinking but when I went in when I when I showed you all how to clone from github I mistakenly said that if he went with the HTTPS you would have to put in your password but that was wrong you only need your password if you were to then try to push to a repo that you've cloned with the HTTPS so don't worry about you can clone and as as Kevin said in the live chat you don't even need to have a github account to clone using the HTTP link so forget what I said earlier that was a mistake hopefully hopefully I didn't mislead anyone there but yet only if you're going to push does the password come into play so sorry about that okay so aim high says have you finished your react nano degree course so that was asked a while ago so not sure if you're still around to get the answer but I haven't finished it yet so the way it the way it works is the courses don't start so like I started the first part I just wanna show you how this works basically the courses are split up and they have start dates so I finished the first part so the curriculum here I finished react the introduction and react fundamentals but the next section react and redux starts in six days 21 hours 22 minutes and 14 seconds so I can't take it now so I have been doing some of the extracurricular stuff so I started like the ex6 es6 things so these are just like you don't need to do these to complete the course but they're just in addition which i think is cool so they have stuff on here 6 asynchronous JavaScript getting github and then career feedback stuff so like helping you with your resume you get up profile LinkedIn so I'm gonna work on these when I have time until the next one gets up and running so this one is starts in six days and then the last one react native doesn't start to 441 days so I will not be through with this course anytime soon but anyway that's how it works so I was I was a little bit surprised cuz the other some of the other courses don't work like this this was this is different so not everything on Udacity works like this all right so me media mij a not sure how to pronounce that so I'm gonna say media but I'm pretty sure that's not right so let me know how you would like me to pronounce that but anyway the question is what is enjoy what is the enjoyable part of doing react app don don xavier says simplicity and decoupling for me at least and youth so yeah I guess I mean what am I like right I don't know I kind of like react there's some features of react that we're really useful to me so like serverside rendering so being able to do serverside rendering which is not a new thing right like you can serverside render and other link like PHP you know like but being able to service that render and then use the all the same stuff to do clientside clientside routing that's really cool and useful I like that I kind of I I thought it was weird at first to mix in JavaScript and HTML and CSS but now I think it's kind of cool to do it all in one place and have it all like all together for each component so that's that's really cool if I probably if I thought about it more I would think of some other things but just off the top of my head that's that's kind of what I like what's what's enjoyable for me about it and acts honestly this might sound bad but if I'm being totally honest react is just like the cool thing to do right now I mean this is not a good reason to choose something so I think react is good in itself but it is a little bit cool to be like doing the using the thing that everybody is talking about on Twitter and stuff right like I'm not saying that that's a good reason but I'm just saying that that's that's a bonus right whenever you know ever I can honestly say that like I'm using technology that's being used by some of the big tech companies and some of the latest like coolest things that are coming out I like being able to say that right that's that's nice that I don't I never like saying like yeah I'm building stuff with technology that's outdated right that's not I would never want to say that hey I would never say that with pride right but it's it's kind of cool to say like hey react is a somewhat new technology that is being adopted by a lot of like cuttingedge companies and I'm using that so that's really that's kind of cool too like I said not not the reason you'd never want to pick something just because you think it's cool or you know popular at the moment but it's a bonus if the thing that you like for other you know reasons also is cool okay me just said this looks like suffering but I support efforts yeah I guess it may look like suffering it sometimes but sometimes like stuff works and it works out well and it's really cool so yes it just depends depends on what you're doing all right don't Savior so seeing this for the first time it looks like a rollercoaster ride but once you delve into it it's simple yeah yeah I mean it does it gets a lot easier bill says I had to come back to react about three times before I finally click now it's my goto when doing any project to the point where if I sit down to write plain old HTML I stall for a minute yeah definitely Don Xavier says seen here me just says I hope it becomes funnier at some point more fun yeah yeah definitely react took me a while to get used to as well so I think things don't start to get fun until you really get the hang of it III think a lot of things are like that not just with programming so it's probably not gonna seem that fun at first but once you're comfortable with it it does get more fun like I I've found it to be more fun like I went back and redid one of my projects for free code camp and react that I had originally done with jQuery and I thought it was just it was more fun to make with react the second time around than it was with jQuery so I mean little comparisons like that definitely make me realize that I enjoy using react but I didn't always it was really frustrating at first Sebastian says arrow function and no need to bind okay cool let me so I remember exactly what I was doing at that point so let me show you just so we all know what we're talking about so I copied this from the documentation the react documentation basically I just copied it because I was I was thinking well I'm gonna copy everything over so I make sure this works but when I was copying it I kind of thought there's got to be a better way to do this and in fact there is if you use arrow functions then you don't have to do this because that that takes care of it so you definitely need to change this up but just just know that this line here is definitely not necessary let's see Don Xavier says when you start using es6 and Redux with it it's a whole lot of fun yeah for sure when you get to hanging up some of the stuff in es6 it is fun like I mean this is kind of simple but like template literals template literals changed my life alright so and me it made things so much more simple you know I at one point I was doing it seemed like everything I was doing required me to make these long like strings concatenate all these things together and then template literals you know like I learned about him and it was just like wow is this just save me so much time and then like you've been able to use let and const like it took me a while to get the hang of when I should use let and Const and what they are good for but now like it makes a lot of sense and that's not it's not there's a lot of other things in es6 that come in handy like like arrow functions right I don't know react would be so much harder without arrow functions so anyway that's that's cool I haven't done a lot with Redux yet but I've seen some things at like some presentations at conferences and on YouTube about Redux and it looks really cool so I'm looking forward to learning more about it da bill says I only have a few packets of G fuel left need to order a tub of powder soon yeah definitely so I as you probably heard me say before I drink g fuel for my caffeine often when I'm streaming and Bill chatted out as well so that's pretty cool I need to see if I get like some sort of an affiliate code or something so like I can give it out to you guys and you can get like a certain percent off and then I get some money or something or at least some free G fuel I should do that actually I had an idea this morning the I should try to get like all of my referral codes and things that I have from various things and then just put them on a website somewhere so that you all can get discounts like you know I have those codes sometimes where it's like if someone uses your discount code they get like $10 off or like $10 and credit and you do it would be cool to like have that and then that way if you are gonna use something anyway you might be able to get a discount and then as a bonus I might get something out of it that might be cool and then you guys could see what products I use I guess I mean especially with with tech stuff you might be interested in that so maybe I'll do that at some point not really high on my priority list right now but that might be a cool thing it might save you also money and if I were to do that it would have just been it would be me officially free code camp would not be endorsing any of the stuff that I put on there so I don't want to imply that at all let's see Kevin says by the way the syntax for name inside the object literal is a new thing from es6 it's called computed property names all right cool yeah actually thanks for pointing that out so I totally skipped over that and just didn't say anything but this is really cool so if you let me let me go to in the documentation they have so they explain this so here we go so that part is es6 computed property name so if you want to learn more about it check out you know this page and the react documentation the page on forms but in es5 you have to write all of this right so you'd have to have a variable for partial state which would be an object and then partial state name would be given the value and then this set state partial state right so a lot of stuff can be boiled down to just this really cool and thanks for for bringing it up I feel like you all are like catching so many things that I'm either like saying wrong or didn't explain so thank you you guys are helping you you all are helping this stream be so much better especially today Rud Rud rang shoe not sure about the name sorry if I'm messing it up says anyone know any good tutorials for Redux I always get lost when I see Redux I don't really know like I said I don't really know Redux that well so I can't help you I think the learn code Academy YouTube channel has some videos on redux I like vaguely remember watching them a while ago they're pretty old so I'm not sure how much if Redux has changed a lot but I think some of the basic ideas behind it are still the same so they might be helpful as an introduction other than that I'm about to take the Udacity course on Redux so I'll be able to let you know if it's good in about a month or so Goggin asks just being curious if you tried Gatsby Jas I have not tried Gatsby yet but I've had some some people recommend it to me so I'd like to try at some point but haven't tried it yet bill says the docs for Redux have some good examples beyond that udemy and Udacity are great resources okay cool okay wearing shoe is asking for if there's free ones you get me paid yeah so yeah definitely infinitely free ones well I mean the YouTube thing that I was talking about would obviously not be paid the Udacity is definitely paid udemy as well bill says free code camp has some lessons in beta or alpha right now can't recall yeah you could check out the beta free code camp curriculum and see what they have there it might be worth it you just skip ahead and do a couple of the the lessons in the beta curriculum the Philip says you are away nerdier than I thought what did I I don't know when was that that was like an hour ago he said that so I don't remember what I was talking about when I he said I was in their year so they let me know what I was talking about cuz I can't I don't disagree that I'm a nerdy person but I was just wondering what I said that was nerdy ok so west boss has a free Redux tutorial so Sarah Sarah says West's boss says free Redux tutorial awesome thank you for that egghead dot io / redux free tutorials as well cool I got some good resources here Scott Co has a resource this from from dawn Xavier and the great code adventure has one as well okay Joseph before I was using exact wrong with my link and Joseph says exact is used in nav like and route okay cool thanks for clarifying that for me Omar says fan from Egypt Jesse is this project has this project have a backend part not right now it may end up having some somewhat of a backend I haven't sided for sure yet I was actually checked I mean you can if you can read my tabs I was checking out MongoDB and CouchDB just to see if I wanted to try those out for this project it's not necessary but we are going to be collecting data and file uploads so I had considered maybe having some sort of a database to keep track of all that but it's not 100% necessary currently I'm keeping track of that by and in the live version of this that we're remaking the data gets sent out in emails it goes to a Google sheet and it goes to our project management system and that's all you know through api's but it's all done clientside which i don't want to do anymore so potentially I don't need another database since the data is already being stored but it does make me a bit nervous that I'm relying on like all this clientside API calls I'm just not a hundred percent like sure that that's the most reliable way to do things and I have had some instances where the the file uploads didn't go through so I know somebody try to upload a file because I got the file name but the actual file never went through so that worries me that it's like there's something slipping through the cracks and I don't know what the issue is yeah so anyway I'm thinking about it but I'm just not sure not sure exactly what I want to do about it I say it says do you think Linux or Mac is a better development environment for a web developer I I don't think I can answer that correctly because I so far I've only used Linux on servers I would like to use Linux I think my next laptop is probably gonna be Linux I'd really like to try it out I'm right now I develop almost yeah pretty much entirely on Mac I don't even remember the last time I used a PC to develop anything with but I I really like the experience that I have on a Mac for developing though like I said I I don't have anything to compare it to in terms of Linux all right Blake says or Windows versus Mac yeah honestly I I will have to say I've had a better experience developing on a Mac than I have on Windows and I developed exclusively on Windows for years before I switched to Mac and I didn't have a problem with it the only reason I switched is because the department I work in has all Macs so I thought ok I'll just use a Mac and instead of being the odd one out so I used the Mac and once after I got used to it I really really liked it I liked it enough that I ended up buying a macbook for myself because i've been using an imac at work so yeah I I prefer a Mac if we're talking Mac versus Windows I prefer Mac for development obviously though if we're talking about gaming I definitely go with Windows if if we're gonna do some gaming stuff but yeah so that's my opinion I know there's strong opinions either way on on that subject of operating system okay Patrick says did you use I'm trying to see like the empty quotes rather than and bsp for a reason I'm not sure where that was at I'm not okay I'm thinking I'm guessing you're talking about this here this gets added in automatically so I keep seeing these I'm assuming this is something that happens is when prettier runs on one commit so I I there's no reason why I'm putting these in cuz I'm not doing it it just is put in automatically so I'm not I'm not even sure why it doesn't really mess anything up that I've seen but I'm guessing that's what you were referring to brian says but yarn has neat icons when you run it until n PM has icons I'll stick with yarn and then a little winking emoji that's a that's legit reason that's the most compelling reason I've heard so far to use yarn I think so I'll go with that does it seem to me like yarn and NPM are so similar in what they do that I just I don't think it matters that much which one you use it's so I mean that the debate is good you know to try to figure out which one is the better thing to use but I don't think it really has impacted my development experience that much to use either yarn or NPM okay Rohan says you usually require extra tinkering to set up dev environment on Windows actually I I do that was true for me I don't know if it's different cuz I'm I set everything up on Windows 7 so maybe things are easier now I don't really know but at least on Windows 7 it's it did seem like it was more difficult to get everything running in terms of my dev environment but I will say that I was much less experienced when I did that so when I was setting everything up on a Mac I had already worked through everything on Windows twice before because I think I had my hard drive crash and I had to get a new one so I did it I didn't set it up twice so who knows maybe it was my inexperience that made it seem like it was more difficult but it definitely did seem like it just didn't run quite as smoothly Patrick says graph QL is the future yeah I agree Don Xavier says graph QL this is when we were I was talking a little while ago about someone had asked a question about whether or not they should learn graph graph QL if they were going to be a reactive so in regard to that Don Xavier says graph QL unless the client or boss asked for it otherwise simple REST API calls do the trick and more even if it becomes if until it becomes a standard when can I reuse rust api's ok not sure the end of that I was a little confused with but basically I think I get what you're saying is like REST API calls are fine now if graph QL does become a standard then you can always replace that though I kind of think that was it which I think that makes sense basically like I think at this point it's still safe to hold off on learning graph QL if you really aren't sure about it yet there's definitely be time to pick it up if in fact graph QL does really become the thing that replaces REST API Giordano says hey Jessie I have a question when the beta site will come online I'm assuming you're talking about the free code camp beta curriculum correct me if I'm wrong the answer I think officially is soon so check out I think Quincy has had like a forum post or blog post or something about it recently so but I think honestly it's like it's gonna come out when it's ready and we're not really sure when it will be ready I'm not actually working on it so I don't have you know any like inside knowledge about it or anything like that so officially I think there is no release date so I think they just don't want to release it until it's ready bill says I don't like right left scroll because I tend to accidentally swipe back and forth back and forward a page from a Mac yeah I do that patrick said refactor those into a map over the data like name phone email dot map okay cool off to see I have to check that out later on I'm gonna try wow the shames been going on for over two hours now so let me I'm gonna skip and just go to the questions in the live chat and just try to answer some of the questions especially if there's some from some new people okay Rohan asks how many people actually drop out after your end of coding announcement actually not a lot we're like it like 37 viewers now I think I think we'd better closer to 50 teachers I didn't really pay attention this time the most we had in the stream was 60 at one time just for today's stream and so now we're you know we're down to 37 so I usually don't drop too many I would say like never more than like 25% of people drop out okay cool Patrick says you can set up a global get ignore so you don't accidentally add node modules okay that's that's really really good advice I need to do that you know what I knew that at some point and then totally forgot about it that's a great idea so I'm not the strees been going on a long time so I'm not going to try to demonstrate this or anything but you can set it up globally so that for any project you're doing it'll automatically ignore node modules so definitely recommend doing that because I can't think of any reason off the top of my head why you would want to include your node modules in your git repo John Hanson says is it best there he asks is it best to have your project all set up to go before building anything before using it I don't know I sometimes I start building out my project before I start using it because there's a lot of basic stuff that I don't really like I know how it's gonna go I don't really need to use get other times I start getting immediately before I do anything I'm not really sure what the best thing would be to do I suppose like if you were working on a team right off the bat then get get up and running but otherwise if it's just you then I don't really see a problem in holding off if you're just going to do some basic setup so not sure I'm you know other people might have some different insight into that into that issue but that's I mean that's what I do okay almost to the bottom of the live chat John Henson says I've got Jesse to blame for getting me started thinking react though I went the react.js route instead of create react app yeah it it's harder it's definitely harder to try to do react from scratch and setup webpack and everything I tried to do that at first as well and and failed so sometimes it's better just to use create react app or next or something like that just to get kind of get started and get comfortable with it and then this learn the other stuff later on if you need to Dixie says with all the mistakes I make it's comforting to see you and be like hey if Jesse can get through it so can i thanks once again I'm very glad to be be comforting to you Jack Bennett asks what's a good language to learn first I'm just starting out it really depends on what you want to do if you want to get into web development then I definitely recommend JavaScript I really I can't really see any reason why or any good argument why a web developer would not want to learn JavaScript because you definitely need it if you're not so much interested in web development then you can pick it you know depending on what you want to do you can pick different things so if if you want to make I Oh s apps I think Swift is what they develop that in for Android is Java and now Kotlin if you just want to learn and you're not don't really sure what you want to do Python seems to be a pretty easy one for beginners yeah I think those are the ones people usually talk about for beginners I mean there's some other ones I know that get used in like beginning computer science courses but I don't know like like Harvard's computer science intro course uses I think it starts with C so not not really sure like if you're trying to teach yourself I'm not sure that's the best place to start bill says in regard to that you can take the concepts to any language so oh I'm sorry I was reading a second comment he said JavaScript with web development all right cool definitely agree with that but you can take the concepts to any language it's just syntax yeah that is true like if you learn one language that the concepts the core concepts can translate well into other languages so it would be easier to pick up another computer language like a programming language once you learn the first one so don't worry too much about what you're going to start out with isaiah's asks what are some good ideas for personal projects in reacts react and redux I don't know if you check out free code camp in some of their challenges I think those are good ideas like it if you're trying to find like a really unique idea to build something that nobody's built I'm not really sure I would say like ask ask friends and family and maybe they'll have some idea otherwise if you're just looking for ideas in general then check out the free code can't challenges and there's a lot of ideas for what to build with user stories and things that will give you some direction assuming you haven't done them already also there's great ok cool so in the live chat there's some some links to some medium article about things you can build ok cool so yeah there are places on the internet that have lists of just ideas for things to build so check that out it looks like the free code can't medium publication has has a post on that so kind of browse browse that and see Blake asks what framework should I use for html5 mobile apps and then Bill says have you thought of trying react native that would be my recommendation as well try out react native have I have not used it yet so I can't say for sure but I've I've heard a lot of good things about it alright I'm just scrolling through the last little bit here trying to see if there's any more questions and I am reading the comments too so if you've come in and I haven't missed that but I'm just kind of I'm not gonna read it out loud just because the video has been really long at this point okay cool I got through everything all right bill says he's gotta run see you later bill all right so I think I've gotten through all the questions really sorry if I missed something asked me again sometime and I'll do my best to answer thank you so much for for watching and for being in the live chat and contributing and for helping me out a lot thanks to Kevin and Sebastian for the pool requests they were awesome and I'll be back tomorrow so until then have a great day
