hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to be working with react and i'm trying to get this project ready that we've been working on for months and months since the beginning of the year and so i just have a bunch of things on my list that need finished up some of them are just minor changes other ones a little bit bigger we're just going to see how many we can get through today for those of you who are new to the stream this is me doing my daily work as a frontend developer so this is not rehearsed we're gonna make mistakes i don't always know what what i'm gonna do going in like today i'm not exactly sure how much we'll cover i do my best to try to explain things as i go along feel free to ask any questions if you have questions i split things up by pomodoro sessions so we'll do a 25 minute session of code where i won't really look at the live chat that much and then i'll take a five minute break i'll catch up on the chat answer a few questions and then we'll go back and forth between the 25 minutes of code and five minutes of questions uh until i feel like stopping and then i'll finish up with all the questions uh before we end the stream so let me explain very quickly what we're working on and what i hope to accomplish at least in the first pomodoro session so we are working on a react website it will be the main website for a small university that i work for and we are getting data from wordpress and we're pulling it into this react uh website with graphql and a rest api uh what else we doing that's that's good enough for now we're not really going to work with any back end stuff so i don't need to explain everything if you're interested in that you can check out some of the previous shows or ask me and i'll explain it later on but for today uh we're going to be working mainly just on the front end side of things with react some components some styles we are using material material ui it's a library of react components to give your app a material design style i did recently upgrade to the latest version of material ui so it's version three so this is all the the newest stuff and uh yeah let's get started so i'm gonna switch over so y'all can see what's on my screen and i'm gonna make this a bit bigger okay let me know if that font size needs to be larger than that i'll try to shrink down everything as much as possible all right so almost uh everything that you see on my screen is available in the github repo i did make just a few changes that i didn't push to github yet uh and that's simply right here you can see with this blue bar i added in uh some grid containers and a button so that's we're going to start out now we're going to add in a few more buttons make sure they link to the right place and that'll be the the starting point we're in the footer.js component so the link to the github repo is in the description if you'd like to follow along i can also start this ngrok server um let me start my pomodoro session and then i'll start ngrok oh i can't remember i started ngrok let's see if it's in there we go i can never remember the command because i always just have it ready so let's start that up now i'm going to copy and paste this link in the live chat if you click this link or copy and paste it into your browser you'll be able to see the website that we're working on as we're working on it one other big change that has happened since the last time i i streamed was that i tried out google app engine so i had a few phone calls with some representatives from google cloud and they kind of filled me in on some of the options that i had for hosting this and so i decided to try out app engine instead of using now for deployment and hosting i really like it it's very fast it'll consolidate all my billing into one place instead of having multiple companies so i think i'm going to go with that so i haven't switched over the url yet from now to app engine but that will be happening soon so i'll probably do i'll probably do some work with that on a live stream when it gets close to the time to launch which should be pretty soon i had a lot of meetings recently uh with changes to the website so um the launch will happen within the next few weeks unless i have more meetings and something else changes i suppose okay uh let me let me double check okay so that seems like it's working for you all and i want to show you on the for those of you who can't open that link i do want to show you on the screen what this is going to look like so we're working on the footer right now you see i had some lorem ipsum with so it's called bacon ipsum it's laura mipsum uh filler text with uh the names of various meats in there uh so i'm replacing that with this you see i've already put in the address and this is properly formatted right so according to what schema.org says so that that can get picked up by search engines and display properly all right so we've done that and now i just want to put in a few buttons uh to request info and then over here i'm just gonna put a very short list of some other links um probably links to like the privacy policy and things like that you know your standard stuff that most websites have in the footer that's what we're gonna have for now we'll have some different stuff in there after we launch most likely uh we're gonna maybe have a small contact form but for now this is what we're gonna go with for for launch so i need two other buttons it's going to mimic what we have here request info apply and visit and really i'm going to have the same setup here of request info being large and then these two buttons being half the width so we got request info in there it it just the button just has the appearance it's not linked up to anything yet so we'll have to put that in but for now let's just get everything in here and then we can work on the rest of it i'll probably want to center this inside of here otherwise it's going to look a little bit odd so let's get the buttons in there and then we can work on on centering things i also i've been developing things kind of in this view mobile first view so i'm probably going to stick with this although it may be hard to see on the stream so i am going to kind of toggle back and forth just so that i get an idea of how this will look uh on a mobile environment as well so for now i'm i'm going to just zoom in on this section so you all can see it but let's go in here and so we have this grid item in material ui it comes with this grid system these grid components right so we have this grid container for the footer and then within it we're splitting the footer up into three sections on a large screen on a small screen each section takes up the full width right so within that middle section of the three we've put another container and then we have another grid item this first one is going to take up the full width all the time but we're going to make two more that are going to take up the full width on a small screen but on a larger screen it's only going to take up half the width all right that's how we're going to get the buttons so it'll be one button on the top and then two buttons underneath we also want to make sure that we pass in the correct info so this is a component that we've created called this inverted button and that basically just gives us these styles material ui does have a button they didn't when we started this project but they now have a button called an outlined button uh it's a button variant on that the button component i i'm not i kind of like the style better maybe just because i'm used to it because i've been using it so their outline button is a little bit different so i've decided to just stick with our inverted button for now and at some point maybe we'll switch it up but this works for now we've already created this component so it'll be less work to just use this than to try to modify the styles of the material ui button um so let's go to that component just for a second to see what we need to pass in actually we can check here because we have these buttons yep here we are so we can pass in an href a title yep that works let's do that then i'm going to just grab these from here i'm sorry i need to change my uh my playlist here the throwback thursday playlist on spotify is playing me like all these slow jams and i've got nothing against slow jams but they're just not great to code to like i need energy right you know what i'm saying uh so let's let's switch it up okay so let me add these i want to add it here to this button because i'm going to copy and paste all this and the more complete this one is then the less i have to modify everything so i'm going to change this to just include this right because they're they're all going to have different different um values for these so let's just leave it like this for now and we're going to copy the whole grid at some point it might not be a bad idea to pull all this data in uh from from our api from wordpress but for now i'm just trying to get this launched i don't have a problem hardcoding this right now eventually it'd be great to have as much as possible be editable from within our cms but that that me that way if anything needs to change like for the text content we don't actually have to change our code which is a good thing uh that's a good goal to have but not necessary before launch all right so let me change these let me double check and see what we have here okay apply and then visit so this one's gonna say apply oops and this one will say visit and we're going to add in here so that on small screens let's have let's take up 6 right so six columns which would be half we'll see how this looks i think a small screen will be a good place to have this break point but if it's too narrow then we can always go up and say that that break will take place at the medium size and i'll leave out the titles and the ahrefs for now because we're just trying to get things uh to look right and that's just a matter of copying and pasting i can always do that later let's see all right that's good let's save that and then check it out two we have okay cool so we now have these buttons definitely need to make some adjustments though this doesn't look good at all right so let me double check how it looks on a small screen too yeah not great it doesn't look good so let's change this a bit and let's see you know what let's go in here first we'll try to make some changes in dev tools this will enable us to change things just a a bit more click quickly than we could with our code and we won't have to keep flipping back and forth between screens so i wanted to double check and make sure that this was set to display flex it is uh which i figured it was and let's see how we can do this so we can go with let's try flex let's see justify content and see what this is going to do for us no um align items okay that's not doing anything either um all right let's try this display flex line items huh there we go okay so usually i have to play with flexbox a little bit i'm still you know i'm not i don't use it enough and i'm not that good with it to just know exactly what i need at first so what we did here was we set this div which our is our container div for this button all right we set this div to be display flex and then we could use the flexbox positioning uh for this so we set justify content to center you see that move the button right into the center okay so let's do something similar with these but what we're going to do is i'm going to say display flex we're going to justify content and for this one we're going to say flex end and for this one oops yeah actually this one works as is we don't need to say anything all right but what we do need to say all right before i get too far ahead of myself let's go back and add these styles in in here so uh what i want to do is let me add in some some styles here so let's say am i actually using white i think i am yeah i am okay i will get rid of it then so let's just say um flex container we're going to create the style called flex container and this is just going to give it a display oops flex i need to put that okay so if you've never done styles like this with react basically these are um very similar to normal css but it's in the form of a javascript object so the syntax is going to look a little different we use camelcase right and then we have to put most of our values here in quotation marks but we can take this then this flex container class and add it onto our grids and i'm going to use my multiple cursors here to say we go class name and we're going to say classes dot flex container and let's save that and we should see let me refresh this to get rid of what we did over here hmm what did i do here okay i don't know why that was so slow but it should work now okay so if we inspect those containers they should all have display flex yep so this display flex on this one on this one and on this one and now we can add our other uh styles in here so what i want to do now is i'm we're gonna have this this class name but also i'm gonna use the style tag this is just gonna demonstrate another way you can do styles in react and basically it's an inline style but we're still gonna use that javascript object uh syntax here so we're going to say style we're going to put double curly brackets so the first curly bracket is means that hey we're going to do some javascript so we're telling react we're about to do some javascript and then that second bracket is object notation right it's going to say this is an object so within that object we're going to have key value pairs just like a normal object right and our our key in this case is going to be justify content and then our value is going to be center i think that's what we need center i'm going to copy and paste this down here to this grid as well and for this one we needed to say flex end okay now this should give us now our alignment that we had before hopefully there we are see so this gives us our alignment okay so normally uh so if i have a style that i want to apply to multiple components it makes sense to put it down here and add it as a class if i have a style that i'm going to use once and it's just one thing then i usually do it in line like this if i were to apply let's say two or three like three or more things to a component even if i'm only going to apply it to one one component or one element i'll probably make it a class as well it can get pretty messy if you start to put a lot of stuff in line like this so for me for the way i do things this makes sense if we end up adding in some other stuff we'll just move it down it's not a big deal it's you know copy and paste so this is how i like to work there's there's not really a consensus on what is the absolute best way to do styles in react right now so i use a variety of ways usually on the same project even within the same component and until there's some consensus about the best way which honestly may never happen i'm just going to keep trying out different ways and doing what works for my projects okay just want to let y'all know if you haven't put anything in the live chat and i haven't read it uh i'm i'm gonna check the live chat here in about six and a half minutes okay so uh just hang in there uh just a few more minutes okay so next step then is uh we don't want this still looks terrible right we don't want this so we need to put some space in here so we need some padding between there let's try 8 pixels and if that's too tight we'll jump we'll bump it up to 16 pixels and just see how that looks after that then we're gonna make it so that these buttons uh align properly uh with this top button so basically like the width of this top button should be the same as the width of both these buttons and the padding in between them all combine if that doesn't make sense right now it will once you see it so again let's just test this out here in dev tools first and make this a bit bigger might be too small um so in dev tools let's take this button here and let's add some let's go margin i'm just gonna add eight pixels in here and then down here let's add 8 pixels and we'll do the same thing for this button and we'll just see how it looks first then we'll adjust okay let's zoom out actually i i like that i like how that looks let's switch it up for a second and see how it looks here it's gonna be weird see so we're gonna have to put in a media query here and switch up how they're aligned but for now that the at least the spacing between them is acceptable okay all right so that looked good so i think if we go with just a standard eight pixels around all of our buttons that'll work and fortunately we already have a class on all our buttons right this inverted button dart class so i'm just going to add to that class a margin of 8 pixels remember our comma when we save that that should work i'm not going to check because it's i'm like 99 sure that'll work okay now we want to make sure that our buttons are all aligned like in terms of a width right so to do that i guess there's some different ways we could do it um let's see what this looks like let's just we'll play around a little bit see what this will look like so let's take this button and um let's just i don't think it's going to look good like this but i just want to try it right so uh let's go with with 100 oh that's huge okay too big too big hmm so we could go with a fixed width or a percentage with i guess it'll probably be easier if we go to fix with let's see what we have up here i mean we obviously achieved this up here i just don't remember how we did it um let's see okay so i did go with the fix with all right well let's just try that let's just let's try fix with so we can try with with 200 pixels okay actually that's that's not too bad uh in terms of this working here so if we had 200 pixels as the width here each one of these buttons would need to be 100 pixels but since we have 16 pixels of margin in here we'd have to subtract that so that would be eight off of each button so we want to make each button 92 pixels and that should that should work so let's do this then on our button itself let's go let's make sure i'm on the right button here on our buttons i'm going to do our multiple cursors again to select all of them at once and we're going to do style equals we're going to use our double brackets here and let's say width is going to equal 92 pixels so these two are going to stay 92 and for this one i'm going to switch it up and say 200. now when i save that hopefully it works well let's see did it work is that lined up yeah it is lined up cool that worked okay so we have all of our buttons here nice all lined up properly let's check it out for mobile it's going to look bad so this still looks bad so we need to switch it up for mobile which is going to be basically we're just going to work with some media queries here and what is this pixel 2 let's let's drop down i mean the pixel 2 is a pretty wide phone let's go to a very narrow phone because if it works for a very narrow phone we'll know that it'll work for a little bit of a wider phone if we're going to drop down here this is only 320 pixels uh and across in width and that's the s the narrowest phone that i know of right so i i don't know at least the last time i checked there was no other viewport that had it it was more narrow than that so if it works here it'll work for everything um so given that we may be able to do really what we could do is is keep the same alignment even on a on a phone that might be the easiest thing to do so that we would actually have that yeah um let's let's try that here my my timer just went off so i'm going to go back to the live chat in just a second but if we get rid of this did i mess that up extra small 12 oops yeah that was not what i wanted to do um what i want to do oops that's not gonna work i wanna make this six yeah and then get rid of this okay there we are there we go okay so now we have these buttons here there's still some issues i think with uh spacing between the sections but not bad not sure if i like it centered either but uh i i think it's it's okay for now it's it's decent okay let me put on my my five minute timer now i'm gonna go to the chat get through as many things as i can uh abdul rahman says hi jesse thank you for sharing your live video with us i get my motivation from your videos because you're showing us how to how a developer works and gets into some code issues and mistakes thanks oh you're welcome i'm i'm glad this is uh this is helpful for you and helps um helps motivate you see ahmed says what do i need to learn before starting in react html css javascript so at least the basics of those right the more you know about html css and javascript the easier react is going to be but you certainly don't need to be an expert first uh babashov says hi from azerbaijan sorry if i'm mispronouncing any of that uh but uh how's it going thanks for watching uh mun griffin says thank you i've been watching your videos oh you're welcome thanks for watching uh pose posey says only basic javascript then you can start react.js yeah yeah for sure just learn you know if you want to know the bare minimum to start react is just basics of javascript let's see uh ackee says what's free code camp uh free code camp is a nonprofit organization and our goal is to help people learn how to code for free so freecodecam.org has a bunch of lessons you can take to learn how to code online we have this youtube channel with a ton of content we have a medium publication which lots of blogs and tutorials there we have a forum where you can ask questions uh we also have a podcast and there are free code camp meetup groups all over the world so there are a lot of different ways that free code camp is is helping people to learn how to code and actually there's going to be a free code camp hackathon in san francisco at the end of october so uh you could check that out as well if you're in san francisco i think there's going to be an online portion of the hackathon so even if you're not there in san francisco you can still participate so check that out um i don't remember what the link is but if you look it up free code camp hackathon i'm sure it'll come up uh nilesh says do you have the correct folder structure for react i don't i don't really know as far as i know there's not a standard react folder structure maybe i'm wrong about this but it kind of depends on what you use to bootstrap your react application right so if i'm using next js like like i am uh usually we have this uh pages folder and you wouldn't normally have a pages folder if you let's say you use create react app you may have a folder that would say views instead of pages so you may not have it at all so um you know this is the structure that i use if i'm using next js let's see uh ab let's see abby just says thank you for this you're welcome you're welcome thanks for watching uh knitting says this channel changed my life uh can you say my name yeah nitin verma so hopefully i'm saying that correctly uh please let me know if i'm not and i'll try to say it correctly next time but i'm i'm really glad that this channel has helped you out hopefully it's changed your life for the better i'm assuming that andrew says i've really enjoyed using emotion for css and js i'd really love to help with some contributions on this project jesse but i'm a little intimidated by open source andrew um you know check out the issues on our github repo and see if there's an issue that maybe you think you could handle and if you have any questions just comment on that issue i'll do my best to help you through it and um you know see if you'd if you'd like to contribute and that goes for anybody else if if you see something on the project where you you'd like to work on just you know let me know uh yeah check out the github repo and you know i'll try to make it as easy as possible for you to contribute um delian says thank you for sharing that knowledge you're welcome brandon says first time tuning in for a stream have been going through some of the prerecorded videos this looks like a valuable experience to see the process in action oh cool well i i hope it is valuable uh for at least some of you uh so i appreciate you saying that uh so sofiane sorry if i'm mispronouncing that but it says what is your style syntax since it's not css um well this is jsx is the the syntax that we use in our react components and i'm not even sure what exactly the name is for doing css like this in jsx um is it cs i don't know if it's css and js or i don't really know to be honest with you if somebody knows how what the name of this is let me know i just i know how it works i just don't know what it's called let's see um ramen says sir i know a little more javascript can i learn react yeah if you know some javascript certainly you can you can start learning react um see groovy tuber says can you also upload a video on competitive programming um i don't have a video on competitive programming i don't really know that much about it but if if somebody out there has some good content on that um you know get in touch with uh somebody from our probably like quincy or beau from free code camp and let them know what your content is and maybe it can be put on our channel as well okay i'm gonna go back to the code now for let me check the time okay yeah let's do one more pomodoro session we might not even do a full pomodoro session um we're just going to try to finish this up a bit and then i'll answer some questions because really i actually have put in most most of the time i need to today in the office so i can go home soon uh let's see okay so for now this is okay looking i'm not 100 thrilled with it but like i said we want to launch soon so the goal isn't get things perfect the goal is get things acceptable right there are certain key places on the site that we really wanted to look very nice but then there are other areas that we can work on even after launch the footer is one of those areas where a lot of people are never even going to see it so this does not need to be perfect right now so we just have one more section left that doesn't have real content yet and that's this section of the footer so i would like to have this on another screen let me pull this so on the current site which is franciscan.edu the footer has links for contact us privacy policy directions nondiscrimination statement and consumer information so it probably wouldn't be a bad idea to put in those same links over here i do want to double check and see if we have any of those links here no we don't okay yeah so i think we definitely want to put those links in the footer i like legally those are some pretty important links so let me do this i think i'm just going to do a regular um unordered list i'm i'm not even going to try to check out the materialized components for this because i'm not trying to do anything fancy i just need a list so let's go to our code here in our footer and this section and let's put in a ul oops why didn't that automatically make there we go ul and let's make an li okay and then within our yeah there we go within our li we want i want to link you know we're probably going to use let's use link tags and i don't think i have the links here i don't let's import our link tag which i think i have in here i don't i need to find a place where i'm using this link tag maybe here now all right let's see i have it here there we are so we're going to import link from next link so what this is going to do huh just full i don't know why i imported this and then i'm not using it let me get rid of that then so what this is going to do by using this link tag is it's going to let us prefetch content that way if a user ends up clicking on this what is going on here oh i messed this up because i don't have the closing tag there we are so if a user ends up clicking on one of these links the load time is going to be pretty much instantaneous because the data will already be loaded in in the background so i like to use these link tags um whenever i can and let's also make sure we grab so we need an href is that all we need i actually think we'll need more than that so because of the way we're doing routing we we need more than just the href on our link tags for them to work properly so i'm going to go to this drawer item and see what else we need there we are so we need this stuff and let's add this in now link and then within the link we're going to put an a tag okay and we'll just give it some text uh let's just say what's that first one contact okay so one of these the ahref is going to be like what actually shows up in the url or in the in the url bar right the next thing is going to be when we say as that's going to be what actually gets um put into like the router like where are we going to get this data from so for ahref i'm gonna have to look contact okay so in this case the href it's really easy we just do contact right uh the contact page but let me go to let's go to this drawer menu let's pull this over so you can see the ads url is gonna look more like this right so let's just copy and paste that so under our page type we're going to say about pages and the id that we want to get for that content id is going to be contact i don't know if this is 100 correct right now but i'm just going to use it just as an example let's see how it looks and item is not defined what i leave in there oops and we don't want we just want to say prefect prefetch is true right so you don't necessarily have to say prefetch equals true you could just put prefetch but i believe for newer versions of react um you're gonna want to put equals true i can't remember the details i just vaguely remember learning somewhere along the line that this is the way we want to do it now so that's what i'm going to do all right so we have our contacts and it gives us it's giving us the wrong thing it is okay why is it doing this i have these backwards so let's switch these up so this needs to say as yeah this makes more sense so so we want to get this contact content but we wouldn't put it as this this url all right let's let's save that and then go back here and make sure we're getting the right yep now it'll say contact i don't know if this will work hey it works wonderful so i did get it right um let's check our console and see if it is actually you all cannot appear as a descendant of p okay let's get rid of this typography or at least yeah let's get rid of typography for here since that was causing an error and let's refresh that see what we get now div cannot appear as a descendant of p i guess we can get rid of our typography component or else here okay um let's see what we get now all right cool not too bad we don't have errors here let's check our network and see i want to try to see where that's weird usually i can see what pages are trying to be preloaded oh you know what we're on dev mode so it's not going to preload uh i can't test it out now um so on the versions of the site that i actually have like live at a url then i could see if this would work so i'm not going to check it now because i'd have to deploy this you can see some of our styles are messed up now but what we can do though is just put in so where i had this um footer sections and then footer sections footer text all right let's let's do that um actually i mean it'd be easier to copy and paste this so let's bring this back in just for a second so i can pull this class name out and then now let's see what i can get away with here if i put this on on the grid container let's see what it'll do if i get away with putting it that high up and it still works yeah it worked awesome okay let's see we still have some odd styling going on here because we have the a tag in the list so let's just add in a few more oops so these allies we're gonna copy and paste these and because we need let me see one two three four we need four more of these one two oops three four okay so we need four of those see how that looks let me check my time while i'm over here all right about 12 minutes okay all right there we are so here's our list and we need to change all right so on our ul let's go with uh style um list style none let's see if that works and they have to say list style type nope that works cool so we got rid of those little circles and then now we also need you know what let's see if this will work on the ul uh we may have to put it down lower like on the a tag but if we can get it to work on the ul that'll be great uh so let's go color and fff is going to be white let's see if that'll work for us look like it did not work let's inspect just to make sure yep so it's being overridden by by this okay so we are going to need to go back i guess it doesn't matter the footer is on every page now so let's get rid of that and instead on our a tags we're going to need to put our color there and actually since we have this color white i guess we could just use that so on all of our a tags let's drop down and put class class name now i would say this normally i wouldn't hard code a list like this out we'd probably just want to do a onetime map over um in an array that would give us all this information so like an array of objects and then only have this markup you know once right and it would map over but for now since there's not that many items i'm just going to do it like this all right eventually it will be mapped over data that we're getting from from our our graphql api no there we are okay so our class name and i don't i don't want those i want classes dot white there we are and that'll show up um better i mean it does show up better but it's definitely not great what's uh let's see what this is all right font size is okay but it looks like maybe it could use a bit bigger font weight so let's go with font weight 400 see what that gives us all right 400 is definitely more readable yeah let's go with 400. so here where we have our class name classes white we're also going to say style and we're going to say font weight and we're just going to say 400 we don't need to put that in quotation marks because it's just a number right so that that'll work um if it had let's say any type of string any type of characters uh that were letters we would have to put it in quotation marks all right now we'd close that out with our double brackets hit save there it is just to kind of get an idea i'm going to change a few of these so that it's not just contact because it looks weird right now privacy privies yeah that's how you spell privacy um directions all right just a few just to see okay all right not bad um there's too much padding on the top i do want to see why that's there it looks like that's on the ul itself so let's get rid of that and do we need it on the bottom two no we don't really need that on the bottom i think we're fine with the normal amount of padding oh what happened here okay something happened here let's fix that as well oh attack all right okay so we don't want it on there okay all right so for some reason footer sections so we've given this container div container grid that maybe that was a mistake good item yeah you know what this needs to be outside of here then see what it does now put it outside there we are okay yeah so we needed that to be outside of the main container div so if you didn't see what just happened we had a margin here because this section was actually inside of the container div for all these sections and that container div had a margin here 16 pixels so once we moved it outside of that container it was free to take up the full width right okay now let's get rid of that and it should be looking pretty good so on our ul let's just add one more style here and this is going to be margin zero and if that takes care of our problem great we're good okay so the margin is knocked off the bottom this is a lot thinner i probably would want to make this margin a bit bigger if i was like really trying to make this perfect i would want it to match this margin on the top but for now i'm okay with it yeah so that's pretty good uh what i would need to do here obviously is put in the correct text and all the correct info for the links for these things in the footer and i might think about maybe centering this uh but doing it in a way where it would still be straight along this edge right if that makes sense other than that that's fine for the footer maybe you could see like this needs to be up on the same line as the rest of this street address so the zip code needs to be up um yeah these links need the the right urls as well not bad okay cool um let me take all right about three minutes uh and this time i'm going to commit this and then push it to github so if you're not familiar with how that works in github then um i'll try to explain what i'm doing as we go along so we're going to get status just to see what's changed so as expected we've only changed this one component our footer.js component so we're going to do a git add and i'm just going to put in a period and that'll just add everything which in this case is just one one file you can actually put in the name of the file if you just want to add one among many files one or two or however many you want and then i'm going to say yarn cm actually first i'm going to do yarn unit u so i'm going to update our snapshots for our unit tests uh just to make sure that what we've changed isn't uh messing anything up so you can see the index.test.js has been updated because we have we're using this footer component in index so if we hadn't have updated it when we tried to run all of our tests to make sure that our changes didn't break anything it would have failed to test right so that's why we're running that first now i'm going to do another get ad because our snapshot has been updated so you can see here our snapshot for index.js has been updated now we can do yarn cm which is basically just like running a git commit with a a message but this is just gonna walk us through how to craft a really nice commit message so we're gonna say we're gonna add a new feature all right and i'm going to skip the scope we're only dealing with one component it's it's okay it'll be obvious what component was changed and now i'm going to say that we see add buttons and um link list to footer okay just basically describing what we did right we're going to say we're going to do this like present tense right so that's why we say add buttons a link list a footer let's hit enter i'm not going to put a longer description right now because it's not very complicated what we did if it was more complex it would be a good idea to put a long description there uh we didn't break anything so we're going to go no with that and we didn't have any issues as far as i remember that dealt with this footer so i'm going to say no to that as well if we did have an issue we would just reference that issue number and then it would automatically put a little note in that issue with a reference to this commit or if we had said fix and then put the issue number it would have automatically closed that issue for us which is pretty awesome so you can see that we passed all our our unit tests we also pass our end to end tests and now we can just do a get push and that's going to push all our changes up to our github repository so now you all can check out that repo and everything that we've done today will be there obviously need to perfect that a bit need to finish out adding in some data but the basic layout right the markup is going to remain the same okay so now i'm going to take the rest of the stream to answer questions and let me just show you i'm going to show you briefly i haven't showed it for a long time what i'm doing here so we're going to add content to footer i estimated that this will take me two pomodoro sessions and we just spent two pomodoro sessions on that so i'm going to say it took two out of two this is in my trello board right and now um actually be honest i'm gonna leave this in in progress since i still have a bit of content to put in there probably if i didn't do it live i could have got it all in but as i'm explaining things it does take a bit longer so this is going to be in my column of in progress right once we're done with it we can move it to completed if it needs testing i'll move it to testing first okay but this is my trello board and has all the stuff that needs to be done assigned to the people that need to do it my todo list my ready for dev stuff this is all stuff that i i really want to get done this week okay and then here's my completed list and each one of these that i'm working on has estimates for how long it will take and then once i'd actually do it i say here's how long it actually did take and these are broken down by pomodoro sessions okay and then not only that but then also here i have my project timesheet so we can see today's date uh august 30th which is uh my daughter gemma's birthday she just turned seven today and then i have my time which i'm a little bit behind my on how much time i've been spending but uh let's just say we took about 50 minutes right two pomodoro sessions for this and let's see footer add content to footer so i'm keeping track of every day how many how much time i spend now this doesn't take into account things like uh meetings which do take up a lot of time or any correspondence for the site and um so i'm not perfect with this so usually this is this estimate is less time than it really takes but so far on this project it's over 250 hours of work um like i said minus meetings and usually like some research time and stuff like that um so that's how i keep track of things for my projects i do this for all of my projects all right so let's go back to the live chat i'm going to scroll back up to where i left off so if you have any other questions right now feel free to put them in the live chat now and i'll try to get to everything uh this office says hi from india hey how's it going thanks for watching uh phillips says i know some view how different between viewing react react i haven't used view before so i don't really know how different view and react are so sorry has anybody used view and react and can give us a comparison of you know how how similar or different they are uh martial sorry if i'm pronouncing that wrong but says i was just checking how to contribute on open source but i couldn't find any videos for beginners you have any recommendations thanks um you know what off the top of my head i can't think of any videos i'm pretty sure i have seen some out there though on how to contribute um yeah there's got to be some i'm surprised there's not one on the free code camp youtube channel to be honest with you so if you haven't searched through free code camp uh try it try that conrad asks if i've tried styled components yes i have you styled components on a react native project that i was working on a few months ago uh i i kind of like styled components it's a little bit different so i'm not i'm not great with style components yet but it's something i would like to work more with uh fuzzy and says thanks for your helpful tips you're welcome uh thanks thanks for saying that thanks for watching uh ultravid says i'm totally new to coding but i want to learn more i know a little html all right cool well that's a good place to start i definitely recommend going to freecodecamp.org and checking out the lessons and it'll start you out with html move into css and then into javascript and and beyond um so if you want to learn more definitely check that out robert says uh would you make a video about redux in the future uh maybe maybe if we use redux i do have a video on my youtube channel uh so i believe there's a link to my youtube channel in the description uh it's i if you search jesse weigle on youtube you'll probably find it but i have a video and i think it's react native live coding is the title of the video is that what it is no you know what that's not it uh well that is a video on my channel but the one where i use redux is on the free code cam channel if you search react native and redux you should see one of my videos where we work with react native and redux so check that out i may do more in the future but for now you can check that out and i think it was maybe project three i think that's what it was let's see um so so sofiane says thank you has jsx style advantages um on css there are some advantages so if if what you're creating with the styles is just a javascript object like i'll go i'll show it again here on the screen then you can do javascript right so so any calculations you could normally do with javascript functions whatever you could do inside here and so you so you could do more than you could normally with with css more like dynamic things right um vishal says please upload a video about how to build programming logic i don't have a video about that the other thing is too um you know i'm one of many contributors to free code camp so a lot of this stuff like there may be videos about this already on free code camp that i don't even know about because we have so much content here on the youtube channel uh call your says please tell me which website is best for learning html css i'm new to coding and which language i have i first have to learn check out freecodecamp.org and go through their html and css lessons and see what you think uh robert also mentions codeacademy yeah that's that's also a good place to go i've i've done their lessons as well the latest music also recommends w3schools uh i i did use those back in the day i i prefer free code camp and codecademy over w3 schools to be honest with you the only advantage i saw with w3schools is uh their lessons seem to have a lot more reading at least they used to a lot more reading and less handson stuff so if you only have time to read and not to actually type or anything then there are things you could read there um i find that uh mozilla developer network has more detailed information which sometimes is overwhelming if you're starting out though but if you wanted more details check them out instead of schools um so according to you which programming language should i go with first um it for sure if you want to do anything with frontend web development go with javascript if you're not sure what you want to do go with javascript because it's so versatile and can be used really for nearly anything that you would want to use a programming programming language for if you know specifically what you want to do then there may be another programming language that is is better suited to that thing so for instance um data science seems to rely more on an r uh python same like machine learning relies a lot on python if you want to work with like dot net framework stuff maybe you want to try uh c sharp uh if you're into wordpress or drupal you want to go with php right so it depends on what you want to do but just in general uh javascript is a good thing to go with because you know if you're doing anything on the web you're probably going to need to know javascript at some point okay robert also reiterated that mdn is is a better resource than let's w3schools uh kyug says one more thing which programming language is good for app development it depends on what you want to do if you want to use react native to develop apps then javascript is great if you want to develop just ios apps then maybe you want to learn swift if you want to develop android apps then you could learn java or kotlin right um so there are a lot of options right i i like using javascript with react native for mobile apps because you just learn javascript and you can make apps for android or ios and that's especially good if you don't really know what you want to specialize in one or the other right you know basically you get you get to do more with learning only one language great vibe says how do you start how do you start learning programming i don't know if you're asking in general like how would you start learning programming or you want to know like my personal story so i'm gonna say like in general check out freecodecamp.org i know i keep saying that but it's a great resource um and that will get you a nice intro to programming you know if you want to do you could do udacity for their courses you could do codecademy for their stuff too uh free codecamp is not the only resource out there but it is free and i think it's quite good let's see uh and emery says you can also use solo learn okay so i haven't used solo learn but there's another i guess another recommended resource there for memory uh emory also is asking what the name of the software is and then later on says visual studio code it is visual studio code uh cali says html and css are both interlinked right yeah so um html is like your your markup for the page right so if you're building a house html is is like your frame the wood that you would use right the bricks for the house css would be like the paint right um the decorations in your house right so css makes html look nicer when it's rendered in the browser to the user right javascript would be like all the moving parts and things like the electricity in the house the thing that opens your garage door the lights you know the switches right that's what makes things move it makes things happen mishra says thank you for being live and teaching us about react yeah no problem thank you for watching uh calyuk says some websites only teach html while others only css where to get both at the same time uh yeah free code cam for sure you can get both at the same time it's going to start with html and then very quickly go into css as well which is the right way to go i mean you definitely want to learn html first otherwise css doesn't really make much sense because css is going to um do things it's going to build on your html right css targets html elements if you don't know what an html element is it's going to be difficult to understand what css is doing these um david asks what's the framework you're using for adding the git commit details like that uh it's called committed so i'll show you my package json here we go commit is in i'll paste that in in the live chat too let's see raul says what programming language is this it's javascript in particular it's a javascript library called react and the syntax is jsx see the nonjay says hey jesse how are you not bad uh pretty busy lately but uh not not too bad um so here's like a few minutes about me since dante asks how i'm doing and i haven't talked with you all for a while so me personally been pretty busy my my prolonged trip to utah and then to new york city threw me completely off my schedule so finally getting back on my schedule of getting good sleep and i'm back on my diet and i need to get back on my workout routine not quite back there yet my wrist is still healing from the surgery still hurts so i won't really be able to work out like a hundred percent um and then i'm going to uh try to get this website launched as fast as i can i guess assuming that nothing else happens like in terms of like changes or anything that get requested which keep up it keeps happening um yeah but that's what's going on with me thanks for asking how are you doing dinanji uh see brandon says what is your setup hardware was i'm looking into purchasing a new macbook air but i'm not sure if it will be powerful enough for web development and running windows 10 and parallels um the macbook air can definitely do web development but i have no idea about running windows 10 as well i don't really know about this my setup in my office at work is a an imac with 32 gigs of ram uh and it can handle two external monitors you know plus the imac one and streaming and it's fine i have a macbook pro that is also fine with two external monitors for web development but when i try to live stream as well it gets a little sluggish so but i i've never tried to also run windows 10 on either of these machines mammy says i've learned so much just watching then then i could do i really appreciate your help so much um so thank you oh you're welcome thank you so much for saying that um ilya says where do you live i live in the united states in ohio so i live in a a small city called steubenville ohio it's right on the eastern border of ohio and if you're familiar with pittsburgh which is a much bigger city that's like the closest big city to me i'm actually pretty close to uh to pittsburgh so if i drive maybe about a half hour drive i'm in pittsburgh so not sure if that helps you figure out where i'm at but that's that's where i am uh rohit says can we use python for android application development i've never heard of anybody using python for that but it maybe is possible i've i've never never really thought of it though usually for android if you're gonna do it like completely native then you are gonna use java or kotlin if you want to use javascript you could use something like ionic or react native dead zombie recommends checking out the net ninja on youtube uh for beginners uh stuff so i'm assuming like html javascript css okay danko says it is possible to use python for android application development um but it's it's not great not exactly what he said but or with with days he or she said i'm not sure um let's see joseph says hello hey joseph how's it going uh joseph s is that styled components or emotion uh neither i'm not using either one of those right now no least not on this project uh calyuk says you have cleared 99 of my doubts thanks brother god bless love from india oh thank you thank you i appreciate that i'm glad i could help uh world says how do you avoid getting bored of coding hmm i don't know i mean i like working on new things i like coding um other things too like there are some specific tasks that are really boring but coding in general i'm always excited about because i can always do um like new things you know i always try to use some new technique or new technology and every time i do a new project uh also like for boredom listening to good spotify playlists while i'm trying to do the really boring stuff helps caffeine helps um stuff like that so and i generally like i like coding if somebody really didn't like it i could definitely see boredom being um like a bigger issue really it says tell me about python i don't know that much about python i've only done limited stuff with it uh the thing about python that i remember most is that there's not a lot of special characters for the syntax like for instance with javascript you're using a lot of different brackets curly brackets you know regular brackets parentheses and things like that with python a lot of your syntax is determined by your indentation so you're not going to have a bunch of semicolons everywhere in python so that's it's kind of interesting i liked python when i did use it but i just don't have any need for it and most of the work that i get paid for uh this shawl says can you teach some advanced c and c plus plus concepts i'm not i'm not really qualified to teach c in c plus plus it's been so long since i've used either one of those languages and even when i did use them it was just very basic so um you know maybe somebody else on the free code camp channel has already done something about that or will do something but um i i'm afraid that i wouldn't be such a great teacher on those things gabriel says have you ever implemented authentication and authorization with graphql as you did um i guess not really normally on projects where we've had stuff like that with graphql um harshit who watches the stream and contributes frequently harshid has handled that so i can't really help with that i wish i could world says why did you go to utah seems kind of random okay so react rally is held in salt lake city utah so i was at the reactor rally conference in salt lake city and then went uh to right after that i went to new york city for a free code camp top contributor uh meetup uh that was held in in brooklyn in new york city so that's why i was i was gone it was the longest i've ever been away from uh from my family uh on my own and so that was a little bit weird it was a bit a bit lonely um but it was awesome to meet a lot of other developers and free code camp contributors it was cool to see like i'd never been to utah you know let alone salt lake city um so it was cool to see that area of the country much uh different even like the climate's different um just the the landscape the plants like everything's so different in utah from where i am i live and i haven't been in new york city in 13 years so going back to new york city was fun i'd actually never been to brooklyn i'd only been to manhattan before so uh that was cool it was really cool i walked i just spent a lot of time walking around i walked around a little bit in in salt lake city but i i just spent like a whole day at night just walking around new york just checking everything out uh it was cool um let's see uh meek x says if you use the cdn for react and only one js file for all the code how do you link all the navigation links to the different parts of that page hmm i don't know i mean i guess if within your one file you broke things out into different components right but it was within one file like you defined multiple components in the one file your navigation could probably call those different components right i'm not 100 sure but that's how i would go about it i i suppose uh nikhil says hi hey how's it going uh solrav says best books to learn coding uh if you're trying to learn javascript i would check out the you don't know js series which is available for free online or you could get the book and the eloquent javascript book which is also available for free online or you can pay for the print copy those those two books you don't know js is really a series of books but those two resources uh i've been impressed with and i've i've read through those i like them i don't know if i finished eloquent javascript though to be honest with you so or you don't know js to be honest with you i'm not sure if i finish either one of those those books other series of books but i really liked what i did read of them um let's see and nico also said best book for react i've never read any books about react so i i really don't know if anybody else has any recommendations please you know put them in the in the chat now or in the comments the video if you're watching this later on uh mammy says if you are bored you do not like it i do not get bored and can't do it it makes you think you ponder yeah that's true right if you really like something you're not going to get bored with it um i mean there there are some parts about coding that are kind of boring um but usually those are things that you could probably just write a function to do for you right so depending on how you approach it it may or may not be that that boring right uh robert says i think boredom comes from too much studying when people apply the knowledge they've obtained and try to to troubleshoot that's when you won't be bored anymore yeah that actually that makes a lot of sense like actually building something is usually like never boring like trying to just read through material and learn that can be boring so i do recommend learning programming mostly by actually building things and then only reading about something when you need to use it uh that seems to be the way you'll you'll learn a lot more quickly that way and you'll build cool stuff while you're doing it nikhil asks what's python used for uh robert says python used for basically everything yeah i mean but you can do a lot of different stuff with python in particular python does seem to be used for uh machine learning uh quite a bit but it yeah it's also i mean you could you could build any anything with python really like any background says what ide do you use for coding uh this is visual studio code uh nikhil says but why he said not for android well android so like certain platforms you use a certain language so like android uses java or kotlin um ios uses swift if you want to do a wordpress website it's built with php so like certain platforms have already been built around a certain programming language right um if you wanted to build an entirely new mobile operating system you could certainly build it in python right but since the android operating system is already built in a certain way then it only runs certain code right so there's probably some way to build an app for android in python and then have it converted to stuff that the android operating system can handle probably java right hopefully that makes sense all right and that's it that's the oops actually um this shawl says what is the spring framework i don't really know i've heard of it but i have no idea what it is i can't even remember where i've heard it now uh i am amin or amine i'm not sure how to pronounce that says thank you for everything jesse from morocco oh you're welcome thank you for uh for watching morocco is one of the places that i really would like to visit i've seen a lot of cool uh tv shows about like people taking trips to morocco and it seems like a really really cool place cool like culture and food and everything so anyway maybe one day i'll get a chance to go to morocco i've actually never been outside of my home country so we'll see see if i ever make it out uh rohit says how did you learn all this stuff online courses books any suggestions yeah mostly online online courses really and a lot of what i've learned has just been like i'll i'll get a job or a client and i need to do a thing and so i look up how to do it and i just any resources i can find i learn from those whatever i can do to make it work okabo says thanks so much jesse just making up my mind to learn react um react uh mac okawa from nigeria oh uh thank you for saying that up hey i'm glad maybe i had a little impact on on helping you uh decide uh if you want to learn react so um good luck uh nico says thanks to reply you're welcome all right okay i'm gonna um okay uh hor is it jorge from panama let me know if i'm pronouncing that wrong uh but hey how's it going all right yeah i'm gonna go now i'm starting to get really hungry and it's definitely uh been time for me to leave the office so i want to get home and um celebrate my uh my daughter gemma's birthday she i'm pretty sure she just turned seven today so um yeah i want to get home and hang out with her and um anyway i really liked hanging out with you all and doing some coding and i know it's been a while i'm going to try to be better about streaming more often this week's just been crazy with all the meetings and stuff uh so anyway hopefully this will probably be my last stream of this week hopefully next week i'll stream more i'm going to be off on monday it's it's a national holiday here so i won't be in the office working but i think i don't know it might be another week before i stream now that i think about it because of the holiday um yeah but i'll see you at some point next week and you know i'm always on all the different social media networks and stuff so uh you could reach out to me there or you know maybe you'll see some of my posts and stuff so i'm definitely active on twitter and on instagram the most uh i'm i'm on all the like a lot of the other like snapchat facebook all that other stuff i don't really post that much though but uh linkedin so if uh if you want to chat just find me somewhere and i'll do my best to get back to you as soon as i can um all right cool all right yeah so i'll see y'all next week sometime until then have a great rest of the week and weekend and thanks again for watching
