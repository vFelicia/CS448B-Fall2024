this week that two main Heroes es6 and react I'm watching the tutorial about web because this is not the time that I have to come back to it and I don't feel really uh secure in it so uh I'm trying to understand how to configure the next steps with web back in the recipe box project I'm watching es6 tutorial the recipe project I want to finish I want to write in es6 I want to learn more about es6 because I didn't do it last year I didn't use it last year now it's another tutorial for today and Tuesday was devoted to es6 the thought that comes to my mind is that we postpone learning new things very often very often it's like H it's not the time it will be too difficult looking at it it seems to be like changing writing to CSS to SAS so it's like going step further U making things easier uh writing less code and achieving the same results but the thing is that we are afraid and lazy sometimes we are looking for the excuses and we avoid learning something new just why because it's new or we think that's really difficult sure I'll have to devote sometime to introduce uh these es6 uh in my code and remember about them and for sure I will be rechecking it a few times but the things sometimes are really easy and we make them really difficult because we are lazy or we simply don't want to try it because it's new this was my case with es6 it's Wednesday I restructure a bit the project in order to keep the uh files that I produce separately from those that will go to the production server and today I'm finally starting working on um moving the components from layout uh into react components into changing on their display into react display do pap a BL ba n PA it's the end of the week and this is what I managed to do in this app this week I load the content right now with react so as you see in this create recipe uh I got a header component text component image component uh and they are totally buil uh with react right now so these Purple colors are react components let's see it in the code so I divided uh the content from HTML uh into components and Pages components right now are almost ready uh these are the smaller blocks and they use um the props and they are loaded dynamically they change dynamically I use props in majority of of them to pass the uh data because these components will be reusable so States uh weren't the best choice here in order to make the components reusable I had to make uh conditioning like in tax tax is the element here so depending on The View TXS are rendered um in a different way for for example if the TX are editable uh so they are in create or addition mode uh I add them the class tags which uh places them to the left but if they are in the homepage view or in the recipe view of the of the details where I look at the details of the recipe uh they have uh the alignment to the right the data is rendered dynamically it's added dynamically uh so this part is almost done I think but pages right now the top level Pages still needs to be done next week this is another level so pages with details addition and home view uh I use the component so I use this stuff uh however Pages uh at the top level needs uh much more logic and whack next week and I'm going to come back to it um I think that first I will do the routine in order to be able to move between pages and change the content dynamically and later I will come back to the logic and local storage because what also one of the requirements for this project it's here number eight all new recipes I add are saved in my browser loal storage if I refer the page the recipes will still be there so routing uh and the logic at the top level of pages so here uh and um local storage still uh needs to be done still needs to be dealt with next week I will continue with recipe box project just like you would on an actual D you give it a prop so now if I go to my header JS take your SN access this choose the best video for keep on doing and see you next week
