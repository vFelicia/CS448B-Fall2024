hello everyone and welcome to another episode of project Euler 100 in which we're going over the problems in the project Euler series I think we should call it series right so far we did problems from 1 to 23 and 25 last time we had some issues figuring out how to solve problem 24 which is a bummer but well I looked up some resources and hopefully today we can solve that and move on to the next month hello Laurent and welcome whoops I have drawn over later yeah I did I did have to run on less than T all right if you are in the chat if you support the free code camp community and become a subscriber on YouTube then you will be able to chat and help me figure out the solutions here because some of them will be pretty tough I've looked at the next one 26 and they're not getting easier that they could tell I don't know how long we will be able to go they're getting very mad heavy so yeah we'll see them now for the problem 24 let's go over again what we had to do and then eventually solve it hopefully this time we can like so lexicographic permutation this is a hard word to pronounce a permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects for example three one two four is one possible permutation of the digits 1 2 3 & 4 if all of the preparations are listed numerically or alphabetically we call it lexicographic order and the lexicographic permutations of 0 1 & 2 are these right you can see there go in order and what we have to do we need to see what is the nth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0 1 2 3 4 up to 9 so for that I think we need to get all the permutations order and that get the end one right okay now last time we looked at one algorithm which well I it's pretty much the same algorithm we have here I found this on Quora thanks to Daniel Shipman he solved this using this algorithm so I took a pic and I think I know now how to do it so basically we have four steps let's first create that array which will be the let's see so we could have an array of arrays or we could have an array of strings I'm thinking which one should be better let's start with an array of arrays so maybe let's see permutations and first one will be 0 1 2 3 let's start with the smaller one and see that we have it correct and afterwards I don't like this for some reason my raver that's Hartley oops I ran it maybe have initial and let's have it as a string I'm think this should okay let's look at the algorithm now so it's all about the indexes inside that array as you can see here we have an array of arrays so inside this array we have indexes index 0 1 2 now they are the same as the numbers we have in the array but they will change so look at what this says find the largest X such that P of X is less than P of X plus 1 if there are no such X then P is the last permutation so we go inside the array and we go over all of them up to the last one and we check is this index P of X is this number let's see less than the next one if it is then we save the index and we go that way does it make sense and I guess it will do when we write a code then the next step will be to find the largest Y so the index such that P of X is less than P of Y then we swap the two elements inside the array and then we reverse from P of X plus 1 up to the end of the array so let's copy this and have it here so we don't change the tab that match so this is 1 then this is 2 this is 3 and this is 4 ok so let's do that what we want to do should we have DeRay initially then push it somewhere I'm thinking okay or we could go over the string yeah let's start with initial to be a string actually zero one two and then permutations and we can even put them inside function here okay yeah I didn't check can you hear me well can you see everything well hopefully okay so we don't have any permutations now let's see how long do we want to do this this is the thing which will stop it right so we get a wild yeah it can do wild my freaking cam platform well complain about this I think there we can even find out how many permutations there might be and we can just loop until we have all the permutations that could be one solution to avoid wild through but yeah let's look for this now okay so one find the largest X such that P of X less than P of X plus one so for that we need a loop I 0 I less than initial I initial this will be changed yeah so let's call it current or array because we're going to work on this array and we're going to swap elements inside it and then we're going to push them here guess we can put the first one and then I'm going to push the next ones all right let's see how this goes so array that flanked minus one so we don't want to go up to this so we want to check this with this and then this one with the last one I plus plus if so we have here find the largest X such that P of X less than P of X plus one if array of I is less than array of I plus 1 then we want to store this index so let's call it with let let's call it X and B minus 1 by default as if we don't find it we will break out of the loop that's the base condition if there is no such X then P is the last fermentation ok and here so if we find this then X will be Y right so it will be the current let's see so find a large sector that yeah so we need that now this is the base so the let's call it the break break condition step one or let's just put one here this will be the break so if X is minus one so we don't find here then we just want to break out of the of the while loop all right if not then we want to go to the step two and here we need to find the largest Y such that P of X less than P of Y so again we need Y which will be minus one for left I is less than zero I I 0 I less than array that length I plus plus we can go up to the end of the right now so now if array of I is less than array of y to store that right yeah so Y will be high let's see so X is y yeah well X is I whites hi good so that should be doing that part and weapon to disappear and for the well the next one we want for three we want to swap the two elements now swapping elements for that if we swap the elements inside this array well first the nudes accounts so we can't really manipulate this array so for that let's create a new array so that new array which will be a copy of the old array right so we copy everything is inside here okay now issue is that I will still need this new array in the next loop so let's just work with this one then we're going to change this array on here okay so we want to swap to them how we're going to swap we need temporary file the temporary variable to store one of the items so maybe array index X then array index X will be array index Y and array index Y will be array will be tapped right so we store X array index X in the temp and we use it then later we swap the two elements here yeah let me write something here find largest largest X large X and next one is fine largest why find largest why okay and then we swap and at the end we want to reverse this array from X plus 1 up to the end so how we're going to do that reverse array let's see so we go up to that element would keep it like that then we take the rest of the array and we reverse it and put it back right so array will be arrey slice from zero to X we want to add this oaken cat or we could do something like well spread it inside this new array array dot slice X plus one and reverse so we take the first half we add it inside new array and then the second half from X plus one we reverse and then we add it in this array and now hopefully if we did it right let's add it to the permutations array so permutations that push the array which will basically be the new array in the loop and let's just return the permutation here so we can see them if we cancel that vlog all right let's see zero undefined 2 minus 1 1 okay that's not good what's happening here so permutations and then we push their way is there something counsel that loud permutations okay that's good I think we're messing with the array and doesn't like it all right facts yeah but then Oh so when we put here to Ray and we change the array you also change its place inside this array so let's then do something else let's just join this array I have a string and whenever we push with two just join again are that's that's a start you can see that we kind of have the pattern we just miss something let's see so slice from 0 to X alright and slice from X plus 1 and then reverse let's see these two values so we can see exactly what's happening so yes and console o'clock this any obviously that's not dad I'll put this here actually so 02 oops let's 0 & 2 mmm that's not what we want X minus 1 so in this instance I think so we want to swap these two shouldn't ah this shouldn't be reversed because it's the last one let's see do we have here an example suppose P is this number that represented file starting at the end we see for greater than to the native waited up for the nine greater than eight and finally three less than nine hence our X is five zero one two three four zero one two three four five why is five zero one oh one two three four five it's one it's not zero based I'll do that's why okay then starting from X plus one we can see that 3908 three less than four but really created until the last value that was still greater than three was four and its index was I eight one two three four five six seven eight okay so it's one the first slice would just reverse nothing because one item right yeah and we want that one item it shouldn't be reversed swapping py we obtained so we should swap three with four yeah that's what it does for three okay by reversing the part from X plus 1/2 then we're going to resolve the permutation so it should swap these yeah I got write logic so this will pose X and we need to swap all these now maybe the slice does here's something we don't want undefined undefined first half second half zero to undefined all right so some things going on there we have undefined at least now we have the correct length I guess console that plug let's see the array we have an undefined there which is not good zero undefined 2 minus 1 1 what is this let's break after one loop you that's definitely not what we want so X is minus one we go from 1 up 2 from 0 up to the right then I minus 1 and that's that let's see cuz of that log X logging here X is 1 okay good now why should be 2 so let's see console that log why this should be 2 all right that works on the swap the swap is maybe doing something tricky here array of xray also the clock temporary okay temporary is an array of one yeah yet then cancel the vlog array of X we're a of X is undefined why arrey of Y is one gets from tap but why it's ray of X undefined one and then afterwards undefined why what's array of why okay array of why very wise and find you also the fog array of yreal why I think here is undefined but why why is 2 y is minus 1 ok ok ok oh I think I know did console.log why and I can select the value it should be that's where didn't see all right so it's minus one so here we have an issue let's go with that look so find the largest Y such that P of X less than P of Y so P of X yeah so if P of X less than R a of i10 that's alright cut so that was the case we used the wrong indexes here my bad so now it should let me remove all these consoles oops okay maybe it's the slice now it's wrong we should have let see console that lava right here should be the correct yeah okay good good good good if we remove the break goodygoody almost so then this breaks Americans console that log array again all right so zeroone let me see these again what I'm doing here slice and the reverse and everything and let's see this before we actually do it so many console logs please break here so this is the array this is slice 0 X 0 X should be that included 0 2 and then the end would be dead okay so that's and slice goes up to up to but not included so then we go from 0 to X plus 1 which is not included so gets only up to X and then from X plus 1 we go up to the end if you don't specify the second one and goes to the end ok so now this should work let me move the console logs here you'll have one console.log here and one here oh that works alright finally finally finally finally finally after years of work a week we got it so now it should work with zero one two three should work with zero one two three four finally thank you let's see who wrote this although as so we saw this algorithm less than but I didn't know exactly how to take it thank you Michael and thank you daniel shipment for explaining it much better oh he kinda did think I am doing failed bunch of times and then eventually he got it right alright good so this is it now what we want to do is to put five six seven eight nine let's not console.log so witness not turn the permutations but rather permutations all right that will break let me remove this and it's long so it might break s of permutations of n right we are given the N and we want that although we can do one thing when the permutations has the length M then we can stop let's see will this work properly undefined that's one way rotations are nice yeah let's see will this be too much test timed out oops tests timed out tests timed out if this doesn't work then well I mean it could should work we just need more time it is an M factorial it's just then yes of this let's just do if permutations that length is equal equals 2n right and we just do permutations of n o if then break they should be faster it doesn't go up to the end should return number she returned oh I think it works we just returned our string because we have an array of strings not the number you hey I won't argue should return should to return return to get a number so something is still wrong here all right let's do what we did last time and run this on directing this code so that we can see exactly what's happening although it will take some time so permutations let's open this with vs code and the browser might be and their thing you might fail although it might tempt I'm not okay fermentations I'll just scrape the chess paste this in and yeah from tier seven Oh equals n plus one because we want from days of of n and permutations of n will be undefined right because it's zero based so here up to n plus one you no no that's what's happening we want to see yeah that when it is returned the number and for 909 we should get it oh yeah so it worked all right I didn't have to run it again that was the issue so we were we wanted permutations of n but we only went up to permutations n minus one because it's zero based all right good what we could put the link here from chora in case someone wants to take a big okay run the tests again it's slow but eventually it works we don't need this anymore so we can close it so is has some issues don't let the curve yeah that's what I want once it works now it might take timeout sometimes depending on yeah let's save these quickly submit and by go to the next one okay so we did this baby thank you in the name of freaky camp for becoming a supporter now you can join chat and help us so all this we finished 25% of 100 I honestly don't know how far I could personally go because they're getting met heavy really really met heavy you'll see the next one I took a look and like this area but it seems expensive yeah you all right so break water break yeah look at this and can't even really this is another map have you won what I'm going to do from now on is if I get stuck for a long time I'm just going to go to the next one maybe we can solve it I don't know if you were in the previous stream but this is what happens so we worked like an hour for this one we couldn't do it and then we solve this in like five minutes so yeah we might skip a few if we don't know we can research and find up ways to do it and we can come back later and solve it or yeah I honestly don't know if I can finish all the 100 project if it can then we're going to do something simpler maybe code words or other coding challenges depends on what you want sorry I feel free to let me know okay problem 26 Ritchie Procol cycles hopefully I pronounced this right a unit fraction contains one in the numerator the decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators two to ten are given so days when you divide one to two we'll get that what's up pop become a member just for you oh thank you you're great yeah we're solving these challenges or at least we're trying alright okay so we get all of this now the parentheses means that that number will repeat the infinite so yeah it's a recurring cycle it can be seen as one over seven has a six digit recurring cycle this one now what we need to do and I honestly don't think I know I don't think you know I don't know find the value of D less than n so we get and here we need to go over all the numbers for which 1 over D contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part so in this case the longest recurring cycle is 1 over 7 right right because it has 6 digits yeah it looks like fun although how we're going to do this so basically we need to do the division 1 over D while going over the numbers so let's do that let I will be to I less than n I plus plus and here we need to do the division so result will be I weight 1 over I or I guess let's call it D so then it will be easier to see so D we start with 2 and we go over that we get the result hairpin welcome so we get the result and now we should look inside the digits and see how many of recurring digits we have any ideas in the chat Lauren leave it upon anyone let's get the result let's see what we have here all right so we get something like this which we might be able to use or not how we're going to find out click the result into an array and then irate at full length I don't know and long division so I keep dividing but then how have a cycle so here we go three then with zero then we see three again we can kind of check these three again so this is the thing how can we find out when we have a recurring cycle look at this 285 whoop seven one four two eight five seven one four you can kind of see visually but for something like this the same number again then the division will give the same result so they cannot repeat okay okay something something I see something there again look at this here we have the 515 decks we have that three which will repeat and you know what about this where it will repeat infinite loop we can't find something to be repeated you can see this is repeating one seven eight five seven one four two eight five you eight five seven one four two eight five seven one four two these styles here yeah I don't know sick sick sick sick sick sick so and over yeah I don't know exactly I can find out it can kind of get the digits and maybe using the vision we get it you yeah I don't know maybe we should research this and then come back late yeah let's see what about the next one 26 oh this is Tennessee's if you do the long division you multiply by 10 and then and that is your new numerator yeah but when we need to multiply by the the length of the number so if we have five six seven then we multiply so we get a thousand we divide it in a thousand and Matti let's go to the next one quadratic primes this doesn't look well night if the numerator repeats then you are in elope when do you know it repeat Oh quadratic Prime's Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula and squared plus an plus 41 it returns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer values between 0 & 39 however when n is 40 is divisible 41 and certain one yeah okay so that doesn't work the incredible formula was discovered which produce 80 primes for the consecutive values the product of the coefficients 79 and yeah so methi consider quadratics of the form n square plus a n plus B where modulus of n that's the range and be less than I bet oiler will be terrible parties what else depends on the party it might be a cutting party so then it won't be a genius or a math party and modest modulus yeah good find the product of the coefficients a and B for the quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of prime for consecutive values of n starting with N equals zero oh boy this is not easy again one second you okay I might expire diagonals starting with the want to move into the right one two three so we kind of did something like this what is the sum of the numbers of diagonals oh so this should be doable finally finally some something doable what I see here is actually not that that so you can see there is a pattern so from in the inner circle we get one three five seven nine then we get plus 4 plus 4 plus 4 plus 4 they are all doable yeah but not by spirit what is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in an N by n spiral formed in the same way and by a what till 100 well so yeah we definitely won't have to draw the well how do you call it the matrix these took you two days have it have video rates far you you did all of them oh that's pretty good if you did then pitch yeah so I kind of see a pattern starts with one the next one are two bigger the next one are four bigger the next ones are probably six bigger so for that they want to just draw well write it 21 22 23 24 25 you got that one the one you mentioned zero seven zero eight zero nine ten nineteen six one two 1118 five or three twelve whoa eighteen 18 17 16 15 14 13 okay so what's next like that okay so here we go 26 27 28 29 thirty let me put some boilerplate here 31 32 33 that for I just want to write them down so that we can probably find a pattern 38 39 for time I mean visually and then we can kind of create some kind of formula 42 43 44 45 46 7 8 & 9 one thing you can notice that are they're all odd numbers okay so as I said these ones are like double plus 2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 2 then plus 4 plus 4 plus 4 plus 4 and if I'm right hopefully the next one should be plus 6 yeah 25 plus 6 plus 6 plus 6 plus 6 all right so then this is not that hard we start with 1 we add 2 4 times with 4 4 then and we just increase the number we adding by 2 see that should be I don't have the same where this Zoey's and and the previous one was so hard but maybe for some people it's the other way around all right so let's some will be one let add addition this will be the number one tread and for let's see let 0 I less than n I plus plus so if n is 1 we don't add and it's one we have 1 we have we start with sorry I is zero we don't want to do that with Annies right I'm losing my train of thoughts now so if n is one we yeah I can't get now if n is two we want to start doing the sum plus equals ad like that and we want to do it four times I guess we could do J equals zero J less than four J plus plus and we do that and here at the end we just do ad plus equals two turn the sir as fast cancel that plug that doesn't seem to work what is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals so what happened what time is let's see so for 101 Oh so the sum is not that number it's the sum plus the addition so we start with one and then we add 1 plus so some will be ok let me think again so the next number will be 3 so we increased some ok ok let's keep track of the current number number will be 1 the some old number and here the number will be plus equals E and then the sum will be plus equals very close so now it's one then is three then is five seven and nine right let's check cancel that log well first let me just this so we don't get a lot consular lock number okay if we do for three we get three five seven nine twenty five 25 why for Oh Oh okay 25 is there okay he's just the return of the Sun here so the Sun is dead all right so now yeah my bad my bad so the next numbers let's see 3 5 7 9 13 17 21 25 the next ones will be 31 37 43 49 cyborgs should start from 1 now it is apparently works maybe I just don't need to go up to n okay so it can be verified that as some of the numbers on the diagonals is 101 yeah so we have N equals three ok 4 4 will be one yeah we need to go up to n plus one or inconclusive and now if we do three here we should get 101 yes I was going one less than we should have so now this should work we don't need to cancel this we get 101 for 101 we should get that number that's yes now currently we're failing you what is the sum of numbers and diagrams in an N and M spiral formed the second starting with the number one and moving to the right in a clockwise direction five by five spiral is formed but we're not then maybe missing the last round yeah it was initially but wait so this is not three by three this is five by five so we're missing here the ends because for an N of went five by five we get this big number but actually we should only get 101 so maybe minus one we'll work now what for get 10 you get that three by three so this doesn't feel like being right we're going way further mmm and divided by two plus one I really don't know don't ask me why today yeah it works if n is three and you start with I equals two then you have only one look yeah you know there are two questions the programmer is asking it would it doesn't work why and then the second one is it works why so yeah I figured something somewhere so basically here we have a 5x5 but we only increase one two times right yeah say so we have a 5x5 grade but this goes one and two so then we have five divided by two which is two point five plus one is three point five so we go twice because we all have one in the ice two and then goes for is three yeah I the reason why I used / in my mind I think so I noticed that it's kind of half so I did / and then I saw that this number is just a bit smaller than this one and then oh well why not plus one and that worked [Laughter] yeah life of a programmer yeah let's download it this is this is one of a kind let's go to the next one there are so many numbers here again let's see consider so distinct powers consider all all integers combination of a B for to the less than equals a left includes five so a between two and five P between two and five dot a dot these ^ to the power three power four or five if there then sorry so if they are then placed in numerical order with any repeats removed we get the following sequence of 15 distinct herbs how many distinct terms are in a sequence generated by a ^ B for to less than so a between two N and B root into a net okay so basically be over this loop twice so from I or we could just a a from 2 to n be from 2 to n we get a to the power of B we get the numbers and then remove the duplicates and we check how many distinct numbers there right I think so let a let's use a this time to a less than equals the end a plus plus 4 let B equals to B s equals death and coups and B plus plus and then we need to do and a result will be mapped up how a ^ b you I'm thinking now we need to put them in an array we could do const array like that and do array that push result and then well we need to filter out the duplicates but let's see what we get here also that flog that we get all these numbers look at that go go go go so many numbers but you want not double gate number so we could convert this to an object and do object of res object of rest to be true and then here we have object which you'll have all the values and they will be unique so we can just do object that keys of object that white that works right so we have all the distinct numbers we put them in the subject and at the end we get the keys the length of the keys alright get this wasn't that part thinking to the ones we skipped don't like that we skipped em but there or so is it there so hard this was easy yeah by the way if you're watching and did you enjoy what you're saying and you want to support me cut camp if you learn don't freak out camp feel free to donate support the nonprofit organization and help others learn how to code for free alright digit and powers surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of four powers of their digit oh that's interesting so if you get a digit to the power of four you get that as one over four is then is not a sum it is oh it's not the sound so it's not included all right the sum of these numbers is that okay find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of n powers of their digits but days so all the numbers I mean what's the limit all the numbers like a gazillion do we need to go up to this zillion how do we check for that what's this top the breaking point I mean you can see that the power of four you can go up to 9000 you any idea so we could simply just well take a number break digits raise them to the power of n and do the sum so that's easy but then what's the stuff so where do we stop how many numbers do we check there must be a way we know that this is the last number you you there are only three numbers that can be written as a sum of fourth powers of their digit digit these numbers that find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of em powers of their digits if they would say find the sum of the all the numbers from up to n that can be written then that would have been yeah easy you yeah C sub 1 is too easy the next one is not too easy have no idea where to look what to think to be the stop condition I mean do I go up to 10,000 do I go up to 100,000 how can we find out there are no more I mean yeah this is surprising that it's only three because after nine here we go you can go 10 when something but yeah but after only three I'll trust them but how do they know did they check like all the numbers in the universe you you no idea honestly don't have any idea how to do that I mean only for passing the test I can kind of see that this goes up to probably 100,000 because we have a sum of numbers which go up too which will result in 443,000 right that won't be a good solution maybe brute force first yeah and have a like Burt stop you so we have zero look at this we have zero numbers which there DG ^ to equal the number zero numbers so then basically when you finish the vailable yeah that old timer thank you for becoming the supporter in the name of Wicca camp thank you very much for supporting the channel and another nonprofit organization yeah let's go to the next one at the end we're going to have like a lot of empty spots here coin sums this looks like a fun thing Koen sums in england the currencies made up of pound and pence and there are eight coins in general circulation 1101 pens to pen isn't finished I don't know in England coins all right it is possible to make two dollars in the following way one pound one times fifty pence all right how how many different ways can n pens be made using any number of points that does this feel like permutations again how many different ways this is definitely an algorithm somewhere I mean you can do okay first you can do it by having so n is 50 right you can do it by having 51 then that's I don't know how to pronounce that sorry and then you can do it by having 48 of one and one of two then you can have it 46 of one and two of to say where I'm going with this then you can have it 45 of one and 105 so that's a gazillion this is definitely an algorithm and unfortunately I don't know it so I won't spend a lot of time to to try to get it because I'd have no idea these are getting harder and harder so I don't know I could start to learn about algorithms more in depth but then I need to learn them in a wait so that I could teach it yeah it's come becoming complicated or we could switch we can put project order and pause it's very much happy this is why it's getting harder but I guess that's the idea then digital products we shall say that an end digit number is pandigital if it makes up if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once for example the five digit number 1 5 2 3 4 is 1 through 5 and digital the product 7 2 5 4 in his unit is unusual as the identity 3 9 times 1 8 6 equals the number contains multiple oh boy so fancy words words containing multiplicand multiplicand multiplied and product is 1 2 9 so you basically have all the numbers the sum of all products whose day things can be written as one through nine pen digital hint some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to own included ones in your son okay yeah we kind of hit and here Laurent what do you think are they getting harder and harder so we we can go over the numbers and find prod products find the sum of all products whose multiple multiplicand the multiplier product that it can be written as one through nine and we have it here so we basically we can just return that and with that don't do this this is just for fun then this you should fit you should solve it Guga let's learn together know where to start mazie clay we can get a number which does it have similar digits and then get two more numbers all of those digits should be available from one to nine and then somehow the multiplication of those numbers should end up to the third number all right I don't know keep trying he's this all we could do digit cancelling fraction digit factorials circular primes double bass palindromes strong capable primes numbers numbers numbers powers primes was it the same at the beginning number number yeah that was with numbers but it was like simple 32 is hard yeah aren't they all everything's hard if you don't know what to do let's say that x1 fractions again we need to find out everything exactly for nontrivial examples okay I think I hit my and here digit factorials one four five is a curious number as one factorial 5 4 factorial 5 factorial is the number and the numbers and the sum of the numbers which are equal to sum of the factorial of the digits you find the numbers and the sum of the numbers which are equal to the sum of the factors so again going over all the numbers I mean we can see here that we have only two numbers two curious numbers what I could just do it like go up to 100,000 right do that find factorials oh let me check something project Euler dotnet I want to see what what they want in this prize what's D requirements for where is it 34 find the server sorry finally some of our numbers which are equal to Samuel factorial of their digit same problem which we had before yeah all right I think I'm going to stop here unfortunately and yeah I don't want to keep you all here to see me not know how to do this and I'm going to look all of them see if we could find if we could solve them or other were other problems and if not we're going to start in another series yeah they are getting harder but oh well we did 27 so let's start someone with more knowledge of algorithms should be able to do more so I encourage you to try and you can rub it on my nose think that's the same right and yeah all right you yeah seem to discard thinker for doing sorry for yeah I don't want to just keep you here watching me fail that art I mean you won't learn much so I will look at them and when I found solutions the way I could probably explain we're going to get back and continue this thank you for watching thank you for being part I think this was the fifth or the sixth so we had a good run maybe one day we can continue but we need to learn so let's that NSE you the next step bye
