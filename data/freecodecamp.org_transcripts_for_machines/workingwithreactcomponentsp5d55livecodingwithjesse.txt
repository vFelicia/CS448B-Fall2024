hey everybody welcome to live coding with Jesse I'm Jesse and today's gonna be a short stream because I have somewhere to be in less than an hour so we're going to try to do one Pomodoro session of code and also my camera keeps cutting out so I may just switch to my screen and if the camera cuts out I'll just I'll let it cut out usually when this happens I can bring it back for a couple minutes but if I really want it to work for longer than a few minutes I have to completely restart my computer which I don't have time to do right now I do want to say I want to give you an update on this project very quickly first and then I'm gonna let you know what we're gonna do today then we'll start the timer well one Pomodoro session and and then new questions after that so the the project now officially has a deadline we have a launch date so this is not a hard launch date it's a selfimposed launch date so you know we're not gonna get in trouble if we don't you know hit the date but I'd like to go for June 4th so it's the first Monday in June I'd rather launch on Monday and then that way I have all week in case anything goes wrong to work on now we were gonna go for June first but that's a Friday and that's the worst day to try to launch something so so that gives us about seven weeks so there's gonna be other things that come up during that time so I can't spend you know every single you know day of those seven weeks I'm also gonna probably go to a conference at some point between now and then so that's gonna take a few days but I've broken things down and I haven't haven't typed these up yet there's just written on a Notepad so I'm gonna break it down really quickly I'd like to within the next week fix some things with the menu to include all the links and that's what we're gonna start doing today and then I'd like to take another week and connect the the search inputs and the a bar and in the side nav to the actual search function and then clean up that search with the few remaining things that we really we needed to do then for the next three weeks I just want to bring data over so that we have all the data there I'm not gonna work as much on making it look nice yet that's we're gonna save that for the end and then get all the routes working so that if you go to one of the old URLs it will take you to the new page and then whatever time is left when we need to set up the the WordPress installation I want to make sure that that's on a server that can handle the load that it's likely to get so that'll we'll do a week for that that get leaves us with about a week left for anything else that comes up so it's gonna be tight but I overestimated how long I think these things will take so realistically I'm expecting you know to have more than one week so we'll see how it goes but that's the timeline for right now and the bulk of that is transferring data over so that's I'm not going to do that on the stream because that's just boring it's just me going through spreadsheet doublechecking URLs I'm hoping to get some help from student workers and kind of going through data and cleaning things up so hopefully I can get some help with that and that should should help I want other people doublechecking that we've successfully migrated the content and then all the links still work also today I haven't McDonald's coffee so anybody from McDonald's if you're watching you could sponsor me with free coffee and then I'll tell everybody every day that I drink me Thomas coffee so let's see all right so let's switch over now and we'll get to it well let me show you what I want to do first obviously okay so here's what's gonna happen for this stream Rohit asked if that was the dollar size coffee yeah it is so like this is the large but the small medium and large coffees are all $1 so obviously I'm gonna buy the large right even if I don't really need that much coffee I'm gonna buy the large and just drink it anyway right now I'm really like I really love the McDonald's app and I keep trying to find the best deals so I try to figure out what combination of coupons will will get me the most food for the least amount of money so on this particular page we have this side menu so these menu items do not appear in our main menu up at the top which we've moved to the side nav all right so my my camera cut out I'm just gonna leave it out let's see so we need to put these somewhere so there are two places where we're going to put them so for both mobile and and desktop we're going to take let me bring this over I'll just open it up cuz I don't know where I put it so let's open up localhost and actually I can start anger out for this as well so let's start anger out and let me paste this for you all you can check out the project as we are working on it with this n growth link if the link doesn't work for you right away then try copying and pasting the link instead of clicking it and then that usually works alright so you know feel free to click around or you know do whatever inspect it so basically right now we have this menu here it's just like one level deep so we have these main categories and that's it you can't go any farther but really all of these options here have I shouldn't say all of them most of them have sub menus so what I'd like to do is make it possible for these items to also be opened up and have that sub menu items displayed it's gonna be a little tricky in terms of indentation because we're gonna start running out of space we'll see but we'll just see how it looks you know we could afford to make this this navigation menu a bit wider if we need to so that's what we're gonna do today we're gonna try to make these sub menu items have the possibility of having sub menus themselves also and this is we're probably not we're not gonna get to this today but what I'd also like to do is on certain pages so let's let's find one so like on desktop we'll make a floating nav here that just kind of Scrolls with the user that would have menu items we've done something similar to this and react with material UI on a previous project so we're gonna look at how we did that and this will probably be in a stream tomorrow or you know some other day this week so anyway so that'll just have like an extra for the desktop that we don't really have room for on mobile but I think it will be very helpful for a user to not have to go get into this menu anyway so that's the idea if anybody has any thoughts on that put them in the live chat I'm gonna start up the timer and let's get to work mmm oh yeah I have this okay drawer item is where you wanna be let me make sure that I have the most uptodate stuff all right cool so did it get pool it's up to date and let me make this a bit bigger all right that might be too big okay so here is beside this ok so right now we're just dealing with drawer item for now we're gonna need to edit some of the data so that we can support this this functionality so I think we already have everything that we need with the expansion and so okay yes so right now we're already doing the this expand items on click so what we need to do then mister Stane okay I do want to keep these as links so let's try so you have a list and then a link and then the list item inside of here okay and here's here's one of the problems that I'm thinking of so these are actually pages that they are linked so we want these to be clickable so and I'm open to suggestions on this do we want to have a little icon here that is separate so that if you click here it's still a link but if you click on this icon it actually drops down the menu or should we just make the first item in each submenu be the link in these themselves are not actually links let me know if you don't understand what I'm saying or what you think about this because we definitely need to we need to decide I think what would be will it make them in a sense I don't know I don't know what users will expect so I mean some of these won't have the links so it is gonna have the behavior that you can click it and it is a link so users will probably expect that all of them have that behavior so I'm thinking maybe like a clearlydefined button here with maybe a vertical border to separate it out but we're definitely going to need to change the way things work in here let me so many items with map all right so what we're gonna need then is a ternary to check to see if the submenu items have so many items but Erin says couldn't the submenus be drawers they they could be chores but I'm just wondering on mobile is there enough space for that originally I wanted them to be extra drawer that like came out on the side here and then I realized obviously that there's no space on mobile for that to happen we can at least start with the turn here because we're gonna need this no matter what really just trying to think what I want to call this the hardest part of code and figuring out what to what to name things so I guess some menu if item that's sub sub menu if item got sub menu then then we're gonna do whatever we're going to do here so for now I'll just put let me copy this let me do a dead first okay so what I will be doing here is just making two of these alright so here's what we have and I probably messed this up how to mess this up oh I'm returning things automatically and it should not be is that how do they if we have a sub menu item then we want to turn else we want to return that no why is my mind blanking we've done this on the stream so many times what am I missing let me do any parens it's okay so those in put a return before the condition okay actually do I need I return can I switch this back to what we had I should be able to switch it back to what we had now think about it I just have to go to another component and see how we did it my mind is blanking this is so silly I guess I didn't use that exactly in there okay I don't need that is that my program okay yeah yes I should still need this all right I mean my indentation is crazy for this and it's not Auto formatting probably because of the errors all right so where am i this should be fine do this link I just I'm not sure why why am I getting this there we go I was missing a paren all right cool does that ever happen anybody's like you go to do something you've done a million times before and then all you just can't remember the syntax okay so what we should get then is if our data I let me double check and make sure didn't break this first know it okay not broken excellent okay so right now none of our data has submenu so it's going to this which is what we've already had so it still looks the same which is exactly what we want so now we want to add in something extra if there is a submenu for that piece of data for that item so that we know this is actually working so for now I'm just gonna add in I don't know I'm gonna add this and this should be pretty ugly if we add it and oh yeah I know I have the data up here somewhere said pretty much never close it drawer menu yes here's the data we'll move it over here so we can see them both at the same time so let's grab let's just use this this first one it'll be easy so on the about menu is that our first one yeah under academically excellent we're going to add submenu and we'll just say true for an out if I could spell it you and that so submenu is true what we're gonna need to do is actually put a sub menu so sub menu itself is going to be in an object it's going to be an array of objects but for now we'll just do true and what this should do is make this messed up no maybe I'll refresh it just to be sure did I misspell it I did sub menu there we go there we are okay so all the rest of them work you know just like they should work and then now under academically excellent we have submenu right okay so this just proves that it works now we can actually create you know something a little icon or whatever we want at this point so let's work on s let's work on that okay yeah let's just let's work on getting that icon there for now oh this is the wrong project I'm looking at that like what is going on different projects okay so let's go in here and see I said let's go in and dev tools in Chrome first so I just want to see like what what's going on what kind of styles are already there so what would be the best way to modify this so what I'm gonna try to keep this clickable as a link and then add in something like this that is not part of the link so the actual a here which the a tag is let's see what it styles are you alright let's just mess around and give it see what we can can make it do maybe this is where I need to put it on this dead alright let's see No why's my foods let me shoot my time I think I'm running out of time if I can find my timer it's back here all right six minutes oops grab the wrong Oh y'all can't see me anyway I was I went to drink out of the wrong coffee cup okay what is going on in here that I can't put these in different actually I mean I guess I could use grid I could use the grid to make this happen I probably should do that I be better to just use what's builtin okay I mean I'm gonna have to import grid which I do we already have the grid imported here whoops another search there we go all right let's see how we did this good container great item so let's just grab this so we have it's yeah this should work so if we're gonna have submenu items we're gonna change this this div is gonna be our our grid container and then we'll have a grid item within there just our grid and this is the grid here and then we're gonna make another grid item for our our sub menu icon part so for this nine and three let's try 19 3 and now we may not have to do any custom alignment at all if this works guess I forgot to close something yep and the grid system that we're using comes with material UI so some of these components or components that we created and then other components or components that we've gotten from it's your UI alright cool so we we do have this this positioning here let me refresh just to make sure any styles that we had are gone ok so right now this is extending past here which is it's ok because we're not gonna have an actual word here is just gonna be one icon okay so I mean unfortunately this forces this onto two lines it's not the end of the world we could definitely mess with the indentation a bit to try to make this give us some more space the icon I think definitely I don't think it really needs that much space really so we could I think we have more padding than we need yeah let me just let's see what you want your supporter left let's go with two pixels solid and what are we gonna go with RGB a zero zero zero zero point five four I think actually I want this to be thinner and lighter let's go wonderful there we go okay so we'll probably have a divider here so that this is clickable and we'll also take away this padding padding right it's gonna be zero just make sure that that's a flood okay padding right zero and then that way when we hover over it will go directly up to here padding right zero now that extends down below I don't like that what if yeah you know what we're gonna have to make that border appear on on this div it's just gonna have to be within here otherwise it's gonna look weird when we hover okay so my timer is up but basically this is what this is what is gonna happen now in terms of style right it it'll basically be an icon like this over here and so they'll be divided but when you click on this icon there'll be another set of items that show up which will be may be slightly more indented probably the same color though I don't know that I can go that much lighter I could potentially go with a slightly thinner font and see how that works just to add like another visual indication of hierarchy and the menu items but that's we're going to going to do so the way we would do that then is add into our our data under submenu instead of true we would add an array of objects that would look exactly like this and that that's what would populate another submenu so in the same way that we're looping through that we're looping through submenu items here they were mapping over them we would we would have another map within this portion for a for a submenu so we would have a like a collapse right and then we have a whole other submenu so that's what needs to be done for this to be finished I may save this and finish it in a shame tomorrow I mean I do have a lot of data to be transferred over that I could do not on the stream so maybe I'll save it let me know in the chat if if you would like to see how we would finish this component and you know if if it's something you want to see then I'll definitely hold off on finishing it until the next live stream and if you're watching this later and you can't participate in the live chat let me know in the comments please alright so that's what we have so far let's just want to do a get okay normally I wouldn't I wouldn't commit at this point because it's slowly like half finished but I want this to be available to all of you to be able to check out what we've done so far so that's why I'm gonna commit this as is so the link to this repository is in the description it's available for you to you know take any of the code use it for whatever you need to use it for if you want to submit pull requests that's awesome as well let's see a new feature scope for this change to add submenus for so many layers okay no breaking changes and I don't believe we have any open issues dealing with this I may have them but I'm in a hurry right now so all right so I'm gonna scroll all the way up to the top of the live chat answer as many questions as I can I think based on what's in the live chat now I there shouldn't be a problem in getting to everyone's questions today all right great that worked passed all the tests awesome now we'll do a git push there we are Boston all right so now all this code is available to you all to to do whatever you want to do with all right so a lot of people saying hi hey everyone oh I'm she says you are the most starred get repo holders oh it really is the free code camp repo the most art that's awesome domain you cat says you really need the best deals with your salary yeah unfortunately I do um yeah I mean realistically you know if you save a few like let's say I can get the food for half of what it is so I don't know like instead of five dollars it would be two dollars and fifty cents you know that adds up I mean that's I don't go every day but let's say I go twice a week I save five dollars a week let's say there's four weeks in a month you know that's $20 a month that's over two hundred dollars a year and that's just for McDonald's so I mean you can see if I do the same thing at the grocery store or at other restaurants to everything you know that's yeah it doesn't sound like a lot I guess but still it's I mean that's money that go towards something for my kids or my wife or you know just say you know saving it for you know an emergency I mean I'm not saying that I'm poor or anything right I think I'm I can pay all my bills and so I'm thankful for that but I'm not at the point where I I can just say forget it I don't need qfo see some kid says can we use style components for styling all our components yeah I mean you can normally like for what we're doing in this project there are some situations that we we can't use it eventually though I would like it to get to the point where we we can use like react like in component styles for everything it's just going to take a while to get the data to the point where that's gonna you know be doable so that's the goal I think you know if we really work at it we could get there you know by the end of this year but I know already my boss is talking about the next like two projects that I'll be working on after this one so I think there's gonna be it's gonna be harder for me to justify keep working on this project when it's already launched especially if it launches well and there's no issues it's trying to make the argument that like a it'd be really cool if we could clean up this data it's gonna be a little tougher so I really do hope it happens but it's it's going to be something that happens just a little bit at a time California boy says because of the small screen on mobile you should have defined buttons I'm not sure where you what you mean I mean I'm assuming like we're getting you know we're gonna have buttons in terms of like an icon on the side therefore the menu items so I guess we you know we are doing that okay Youssef says maybe on mobile the new drawer could just replace the old drawer that's that's actually an option I haven't thought about that but that's that's a legitimate option if what we're gonna try to do now ends up just not looking good or being confusing then we may try to do that so I think that's a good idea Youssef thank you Oh answers you could show a menu history at the top yeah actually these are all really good ideas I'm definitely gonna have to consider these as an alternative Puyo says am I the only one who finds JavaScript frameworks like angular or react very difficult after how many years you started working with one I find them difficult at first I mean I've only been working with reactor II about a year maybe a year and a few months and I'm very comfortable with it now I mean I would not say I'm an expert at all but I don't find it difficult so but at first I did and when I first worked with angular I found it difficult now I didn't stick with angular so it's probably still difficult for me if I would try it but I think it's just you know like any new thing it's gonna be difficult at first and it you know some frameworks just take longer to get from within others I yeah I mean it's I think that's just the way it is with any new you know new framework it's actually we're doing the stream without the camera like on my face because now I'm like I don't have to think about it normally have to think that I don't do anything weird on camera but and I have to think like okay I need to make sure my face is actually in the camera but now like I can sit like really slaps down in my chair and lean back anyway let me keep going I'm almost through the live chat now you check the time okay good this is I'm gonna have to end things at like 10 minutes at the most let's see Ian oops sorry not Ian oh I see Ian was responding to my question so I asked if anyone else had the issue where you try to do something that you've done a million times before and like for some reason you just can't remember the syntax and so Ian sits all the time thanks thanks for that I'm glad I'm not the only one Jacob says Mac or Windows for programming use such as Mac or Linux honestly I really do like Mac for programming I haven't I haven't used a linux as an operating like a desktop operating system I haven't use Linux I've used it on servers though and I like it so I'm kind of used to Linux and Mac right now I used the program but for years I programmed on a Windows machine so there are pros and cons I think to everything but right now I I do really like programming on a Mac so I don't know that I could give a great answer for it Jacobs has been wanting to learn HTML CSS but I'm having a hard time self teaching myself watching to see any suggestions Youssef says watching tutorials makes it easy for me Jacob says anyone know of any teachers in person I don't want to wait for college yeah I am that's tough I mean I guess you could try so you don't have to wait for college so I'm assuming you're maybe in high school then it's gonna be tough so like normally you could go to a boot camp like in person but if you're in high school I mean maybe you could find a boot camp that's during like summer break from high school and I'd say that's that's probably you know the most likely way that you have of finding an inperson teacher yeah so I would say that unless you can find someone in your area like maybe like a meetup like a web developer meetup and see about getting like a mentor on anyone else have any other ideas for how Jacob can find like someone to help in person in learning HTML and CSS hey amenities here how's it going thanks for watching Carlos says check the free code camp website for learning oh yeah if you haven't already tried free code camp go to free cookie org and start in with some of those lessons I mean they it's still gonna be like you have to motivate yourself to do it but hmm sorry I won't but it is it has helped a lot of people to learn aim star asked what font we're using for menu items it's Roboto I believe that we were using a 400 font weight right here and the color is rgba 0 0 0.5 for which I mean you can see all that if you check out the repository all right Aaron asked if there's a stream or video to see what it did to get to this point there are actually a lot of streams this is the fiftyfifth stream for this project so you can go back through and check out all the streams that is it's gonna be a lot might not be a bad idea to do a recap video yeah maybe I'll have to think about doing a recap video because 55 streams is quite a lot especially since almost every stream is over an hour long I mean that's literally days of nonstop watching to get through it I do recommend watching old streams of on like faster than normal speed I usually talk like somewhat slowly so you can still understand me on to time speed let's see my mommy says last time you said you'll be live on Monday I know I know I've Monday yesterday I'm sorry I forgot to apologize for this I know I said I'd be live on Monday but yesterday just filled up with meetings so since I've been working from home a lot all my meetings have to fit into the like two days that I'm I'm at work this week I'm actually gonna be in three days but so then my days filled with meetings so I ended up like having several people over the weekend asked me for meetings so then my schedule just got full one meeting ended up getting canceled so I probably could have Street squeeze the stream in but it didn't and know that it got cancelled until it was like really close to the meeting time so I do I apologize for that it's just like I said it my schedule just filled up you know the day before so I mean sometimes that happens so I can't I can't you know say no I can't meet with you because of the live stream so try to be respectful about that so that I can keep doing the live stream on campus Andy says oh I never mind Andy was asking somebody else something in the chat in a asks is it hard to do a dev job without experience there's just a lot of learning involved so I mean yeah it's it's hard you know because starting on anything new is is hard oh you know what actually I think I misread that I think in a correct me if I'm wrong but I to get it oh I see later on you corrected it is it hard to get a dev job without experience yeah it can be a lot of places are looking for experience but don't be afraid to apply and try to make up for that lack of experience with a really good portfolio even if that portfolio is just side projects that you made on your own it really doesn't matter if their projects and their functional and their good projects you know then whoever's you're applying to you know they can see the quality they can see the code they can see the the project so that's that's how you would make up then for the lack of experience and then always try to get projects on the side even if even if you have to do volunteer stuff if you can afford to take some time to do volunteer things at least that's something you could put down you know that you build this website for this company alright you don't they don't need to know how much money you made off of it or if you made any money at all you know so that can that can help convince a company that even though you don't have a lot of experience you do know what you're doing so but I mean I don't want to mislead it is going to be hard it's definitely easier if you have that experience but it's not impossible you know you just have to kind of be creative and in building up that portfolio and presenting yourself you know in the right way of you know on your resume like really emphasize your projects where if somebody else might emphasize their work experience if they had a lot you know don't worry about that on your they you know put your projects up at the top and breasts impress them first and then once they get down to the bottom and see all there's not much work experience they're already gonna like you so they're gonna be way more likely to overlook the the lack of work experience right does that make sense let's see Andy asked how do you structure your react projects I mean what right now we're using next Jas so we really just use the folder structure that that's built out with next sometimes we use create react apps so we pretty much stick with that structure tech expert says hello I know CSS and JavaScript HTML CSS and JavaScript what should I learn next and your choice between PHP and nodejs right now I choose nodejs right now I'm not saying there's anything wrong with PHP but if you know JavaScript for frontend it's so much easier to just pick up node node can do so many different things the only disadvantage right now for node is that a lot of cheap hosting providers don't let you use node but they will let you use PHP so like if you're gonna go with GoDaddy share hosting or something you're not at least last time I checked you're not gonna be able to use node so that's that's really the only thing but you know the people that are using the cheap hosting providers like that they I don't that's probably not where you'd want to get if you're really into coding and want to develop like cool things with node or something like that like those are the clients that are gonna have the money to pay you for something like that anyway they're not the clients they're gonna be able to pay for a lot of custom stuff so it's not like you'd be doing a lot of custom PHP you probably be setting up a wordpress site but I I go with node I only do PHP when I really have to and I focus on learning node you know better so that would be my recommendation himemiya says I wonder why everyone is using rubato and Latino fonts we use Roboto because it's in the material design specification so I mean yeah that's that's just what we use I mean I think it's a good font I think the odds of people being familiar with it and like having a cache in the browser are pretty good as well so it's a free font Raphael asks a lovely name Raphael I name my oldest son Raphael so awesome name but Raphael s Jessie which Mac are you using right now I have an iMac and I'll bring up the specs for you here it's gonna be hard to see it's kind of small but it's the iMac retina 5k 27inch late 2014 I'm running four gigahertz intel core i7 and 32 gigabytes of RAM and I have two external monitors connected to it I have the 2k 27inch screen on one side and then I have a 1080p screen in vertical alignment on the other side you see FS about meteor J s I don't know that much about meteor I've seen some presentations where people do really cool things with meteor but I don't have personal experience with it so I guess all I know is that you can make really awesome things with me to your jazz and that's about the extent of my knowledge of meteor hey harsh it's here how's it going hard illnesses thank you for your answer you're welcome hopefully that that helped in and if you ever need help with like job trying to get a job or resume stuff or anything like just let me know you know send me a message through whatever social media and I'd be happy to like check out your portfolio or your resume and yes just just let me know Raphael says thanks Jesse yeah no problem mmm he says that's a lot of RAM I know is I had 16 to start out with in the the guy that works in the office next to me told me that he upgraded a 32 and then I was like all right I got upgraded 32 so I did but it I mean it helps I always have like a million tabs open in Chrome and in my computer is always fast so it's definitely it definitely helps see technics versus where to find cool projects to practice for web dev I mean you can check out the projects for free code camp and practice on those I mean those are some pretty cool projects like a weather app there are some games that you can make so I mean there's a lot of cool ideas for projects so you could either like following the instructions exactly on free code camp or you could just let it be inspiration for you for other things that you want to do that's free code camp org breakfast is awesome setup Thanks I love that more than three monitors because I used to run with four monitors but I you can't like by default you can't hook up a third monitor to an iMac I've read it there are some ways that you can make it work but it's not really easy the mummy says can I send you my resume yeah go ahead send it to me I guess well you can you can check in the description of this video there should be a link to my youtube channel and then from there I have all my different social media sites there so get in touch with me on whatever social media site and you know you can send me a resume like that let me give you all my my email all right so I just put my email on the live chat it's just Jessie why go gmail.com you send me something there probably through social media is more reliable because like it won't accidentally end up in the spam folder or something but if you want to email me that's I mean that's also an option so I can't guarantee that like I'll get back to you in a certain amount of time because I mean sometimes I'm just really busy but I will try to get back to everybody at some point if you've asked me something in the past and I didn't get back to you please remind me because sometimes I do get a lot of messages and things just kind of get forgotten and lost and it takes a long time to scroll back to where that message was so it's entirely possible that I have forgotten about answering some of you who may have asked me something and I really don't want to do that so so please remind me if if I have done that and if so I apologize okay so I've gone past the time that I had to be somewhere so now I am late so I'm gonna end now and thank you all for watching I should be able to stream tomorrow so hopefully I'll be back tomorrow and I guess we'll work on this probably we'll work on this component a little bit more yeah so until then have a wonderful day
