so today we are going to talk about um from selftaught programmer to job uh the reason why we are talking about that is because free code camp is actually the platform where people start to start learning to code but also to get a job in a completely new industry completely different industry that they are used to used to be or used to to work and we were asked many times to talk about our experience and we both came practically from nothing to a program a job and that's why we are talking about it today we will have a question and answer session afterwards so feel free to ask everything you'd like yes just a short roadmap what we're going to cover we will talk about our life before uh we will talk about the learning process we will talk about applying for jobs we will talk about working at the new company then this year explain the main qualities and actions to get a job actually and the last the last thing will be about motivation because people always ask how do you stay motivated on the on the way um so yeah let's let's start with our life before programming um how many of you guys actually started to program from a completely different field cool so like 50 something roughly very nice um yeah so so you guys know what it takes to like start with a completely new set of of rules and mindset in my case it was like i'm a student i'm a business law student uh i have worked in different uh business law firms tax advisory firm had different workshops and also had like entrepreneurial stuff but most of the time i was also like nonprofit worker so most of the time i was just student working and working here just working and studying my whole life so not really much programming i had no idea what html was nothing yes that's that's about me yeah and with his background in business and such i had a different background i grew up on a wet cold mountain in bergen i was raised by sheep farmers it was quite miserable at times but no that's not the real story but maybe i should control them yeah but i did grow up in or by wet mountains in bergen it's one of the rainiest cities in north and northern europe it has about 250 days of rain a year so it gets quite miserable but we strangely enough we cope and i didn't get raised by sheep farmers but we have national costumes in norway that are mainly made of wool and just pay special attention to the fact that these socks are purely made out of sheep's wool handcrafted and such so they're always a pain to put on for these occasions they go up until like here so that's nice my background back to childhood i was always the computer guy in class i always liked from the first chance i had with a dad or with a dad working in tech to uh you know bash at the keyboard or h5 or something from a commodore or macintosh or something i always found out they had or early on found out they had a love for computers i didn't take it further until then learning html making some websites i had two parents my father and my mother they got divorced whenever i was at my dad and i used to live mainly at my mom's place he had internet so i could get tutorials on how to learn html print them out go back to my you know regular home on a computer with no internet learn how to make stuff with html it was really cool but then a couple of years later i got a book java in 21 days and i was like yes but i was the kind of person who since i didn't understand why it's a system out clinton i must be a stupid guy because there can only be math geniuses understands this is esoteric type we're writing out and why it makes some stuff happen and there was no one there for me to tell me that take a step back you're not stupid this is the same for everyone in the beginning and it was the same for me also in school learning maths it was easy for me or all courses in school was easy for me up until the stage where we had sort of like equations algebra and stuff and i thought that hey up until that point i just had to be in class pay attention barely do homework i did fine but then once i had to memorize rules and just apply them i didn't understand that that was what you were going to do i thought i had to really understand what was going on because that's how it had worked for me up until that point so all this just to say that i really had enforced the myth that programming is for math geniuses only so i kind of ruled it out from that from that point on and then skipping ahead a little bit young adult life instead of going into computer school which i maybe let's just call it that which i maybe would have done if i would have not have this misconception i instead said hey let's try psychology studies didn't work out let's try to study philosophy didn't work out then i kind of prioritized student life and working instead of studying and at one point i panicked realized i couldn't really get a job as a philosopher so i went to ireland and i'm from norway but i went to ireland to work for multinational companies and eventually all this led to me having a bit of a burnout i worked in sales tech support public service public transport support and so on i didn't really work jobs i liked i just went there to earn money and i became a sad panda and i mean it literally because i became a sad panda life in ireland just working drinking eating whatever i wanted was not good for me cool yeah now let's let's go to the learning process um when you start to learn to code it's like like like this picture here my code isn't working and i don't know why and if the code is working i also don't know why so this was always like when i'm was working on something it was always like this and i guess it's for most of you like like that when you started out learning to code for me i captured my whole learning experience like in these three pictures here uh on the first you see like github contributions um on the second you see like cheesecake and coffee because that's like super important when you program a lot and down here that's actually one hour before the gym it's actually in the gym um but what i wanted to tell with that picture is that you have to are you yeah you have to fit in or use every every time you get when you are busy when you have family studying working you don't have time for learning to code your whole day so when you have time like an hour before the gym or whatever or when you're traveling on the bus on the train use the time for coding and as you as you can see here i was like that's only github i was like coding every day like there's the challenge like 100 days of code forming a habit so it gets into your body and that's actually the result and that's without the free code cam curriculum which also looked like that so many many hours many many contributions and a lot of coffee and studying and yeah just learning to code um that's also like from my article as i said before um this this this tool is like wacka time it's like a plugin for the editor it's it's for free so you can check how much time you actually spend on on projects on github and here what i've tracked like from mid what's it like from mid april april to mid july or in july like 250 hours i spent just coding so that that boils down to like an average of two hours per day so just to give you a perspective how much it can take to learn to program and to not be frustrated along the way just put in the hours and what you can see here also is like i put in or i created on codepen actually a small application homepage that actually counts the day i was uh yeah time spending coding and till this day it's like 380 days so that's pretty cool and what i also wanted to tell you with that is like to do your own projects always don't try to follow the curriculum or whatever tutorial try to make your own stuff happen and you will learn much quicker and better in general so to have it in a nutshell i put in many hours did a lot of research not only not only tutorials or videos or books or whatever try everything out see what works for you best and then go with it in my case it was just many contributions and own projects and always trust yourself but i'm going into that later on yeah yeah so going back to my uh my misconception that you had to be a math genius to learn to program to get out of this burnout and to get a better life i gradually tried to do that one project was me and a partner in norway we started a company to provide websites for businesses based on wordpress we never really took off we never scaled super high mainly because we didn't have enough sales but we had a few customers and at the point we were thinking i was thinking i was part of the technical part and my partner was part of the sales and i was thinking we're doing this stuff and we're just barely making any margin on offering shared host hosting for our customers what if we could host ourselves and i'd already been interested in linux for a while but you know how it can be with linux you try and you try and you fail and you try and you fail and you try and then eventually maybe you make a switch to linux which i have but it took a long while so in that process i knew it was possible to host yourself so i decided hey let's try this i tried some tutorials and i finally had a breakthrough when i um stumbled across linux academy and i took apart it was the first time i was using an online course to learn to train myself or to teach myself something and i managed to from knowing nothing about hosting servers just shared hosting to be able to set up a lamp stack linux or mysql and php and offer hosting for our customers professionally so that was a big hall for me but i was still thinking you have to be a math genius to learn programming figure that so this picture was to illustrate when i realized that hey i could learn stuff online then i thought let's try programming but it must be hard so let's try again i tried treehouse first just to brush up html and css kind of tasted a little bit on javascript i thought hey okay it's cool to learn about functions and variables and control statements and stuff but you know when does the real programming start so i kind of took a step back and it wasn't until i stumbled across free code camp about two years ago now um that i realized that all the stuff that i thought was just the basics in programming is programming and then you just have to iterate over the same things use them in different ways go a little bit more advanced into the language and design and other topics that are more like um on the architectural or um just get it in your fingers and be experienced and know what is the best choice for the for the job and so forth but the basics stay the same and when i realized that just imagine after about 30 years or you know i'm 33 now but i was probably around 30 done but after many years from a kid thinking that programming was not for me to finally bursting the bubble and thinking i can do this i was really motivated because i really wanted to do this and i saw it as a way out of my misery so then i stuck with frico camp as dalia said it can be challenging and you have to put in a lot of hours i put in a lot of work at first as many people do and then i fell out a little bit i wrote about it at my blog hello i love code.com and one of the things that helped me was to take a step back from free code camp read a book that is actually in the i saw it it's here eloquent javascript helped me personally to uh get a fresh look at free code at javascript not from free code camp but from another source i supplemented with other courses i like udemy because they have a lot of courses that you can buy on demand and keep for life and then i got back into the groove of record camp yeah so the book here is not an icon for something youtube started doing that's just because i also use books yeah and free code camp when we talk about motivation a little bit later it has been a constant part in this whole journey uh just knowing that i was organizing starting to organize the free local group here for the free code camp meant that i felt obligated to make sure i could tell the other people at the meet up that i had progresses the last time so this this social aspect was really helpful as well yeah so after learning a lot the next step is actually applying for a job and i think that's pretty interesting for us because our story stories are pretty yeah different actually for me just two pictures here one day from the interview from the day of the interview and another picture is also from the meetup here the reason why i'm putting up those pictures here just to give you an impression how how i looked when i was applying for the job but to summarize it i don't wanted to be an employee actually i started to go to become a freelancer and i was only focused on projects and meetups i wanted to get to know people and i wanted to build own projects and i tried to contribute as much as possible to anything code related and literally when i when i when i did realize there are meetups here in vienna it was my first meetup it was actually the web clerk's meetup here and i was going to everyone and like hi i'm daniel i'm a programmer beginner i don't know a lot but another little thing yeah do you have an open source project and if yes can i contribute and i was like going to everyone like hi i'm daniel can i contribute and then like you know everybody and then i met one guy actually benny and he said of course yeah i had i have an an open source project we can like work on it together and then we we met for weeks and months and like after i don't know four to five months he was like yeah my company is looking looking for a developer we have like a job offer do you want to work with me i was like yeah of course and that's actually it how i got the job of course there was like an interview and he was asking questions he was like yeah show me your project tell me a little bit about you tell me a little bit about your your your stack why do you want to do it that way et cetera but nothing really hard no hard questions and what i want to tell you here is for me up the absolute key here was to build a relationship to network and get into a job over a guy i already knew that's like super powerful because he can refer me and also like from the employer's side he's he's like okay he has already worked with one of my employees so he has to have something good and he trus the employer already trusts the other employee so that was like a big plus and that's actually for me it was actually pretty easy so on your side i wanted a little bit different route back to my work having a company in norway selling websites to companies i did that and i also supplemented with some freelance work mainly a very simple wordpress based task a lot of repetitive stuff didn't like it all so much but that was in the phase that i was starting to learn to code so as i learned to code i could do more code related stuff um one of the criterias for me is looking for a job i was in this freelance state but i wanted something fulltime because the freelance was sporadic or not stable enough income for me but i wanted to look for a fulltime job and it had to be englishspeaking because my german is not so good if they would allow german they would have to be really kind people and then i focused on continuing to organize the meetup that i had started here and i also organized uh now it must be last year maybe node school uh in the summer i contacted node.js speed up and said hey can we do something so i helped do that i also helped to hacker x which is speed dating for developers have their first two events in vienna so i was an ambassador for them and i'm also the ambassador for hacker econ for ambassador no what's it called uh angelhack even though they haven't had something here yet i hope they will come soon so all these things i could put on my resume and i was active and i was in the community and i liked to engage and it was also something i could benefit from when searching for jobs i didn't feel when i started to send applications around april that i had enough portfolio stuff and i really didn't i just had a couple of things from free code camp and i had something you know when you're forking stuff on github and you're just putting down some lines in a new idea thing and stuff so that it looked like it was busy but it wasn't really much on github either but i said hey let's just try to apply because i have to apply and get a get a job let's see how this goes um i just had the approach that i would just send as many applications as i as i could uh not super many but definitely over 50 applications in the span of april to august 50 50 50 50 but it doesn't have to be hard like you can go on sites i also included remote work so i can go on sites like weworkremotely.com and others for remote work find uh you know the ones that are looking go to their site you know copy paste into the form have a little bit of a application letter if you want to be personal and so on so it doesn't have to take so much time so i just try to make it a streamline as possible and of course apply if i really liked the job ad i also had a rule of it was if i was in doubt either if i liked the job or not or if the job said mid to senior and i was like ah or they had this list of requirements and i had like maybe 10 percent i'd be like okay you know what you can think as much as you want but if you don't apply you'll never know so i just made the rule i'll apply if i'm in doubt so a lot of applications um i had two rounds one round with a plain application black and white like i learned in school you should list your experience you should or you list your school experience and chronologically everything boring plain straightforward uh didn't work so well so i said okay let me rephrase things a little bit present myself as an already developer and not down sell myself so i changed some wording i presented myself better and i got a professionally looking template with a picture and some colors and stuff and really nice layout design and that really helps because after just the first few applications i got feedback it ended up that i got the job that was the first interview i went to but it took them probably two months or something to offer me the job so in the meantime i had i think four other interviews um and the interview also as daniel said for me it wasn't so technical it was more that they saw that i had the ability to learn that i could talk about the choices i'd made in terms of the frameworks and technologies i was using for my projects when i was learning that i was not just following along but was reflected about it and i really had found the passion of coding that i didn't know um i could do until recently so i think that yeah a short take on working at the new company that's very i want to keep that very short um because at first it is like it's too much this is too much this is literally how you look in the new company um because it's like of course of course you you will be overwhelmed um because there are like people more experienced in a field you have never worked in of course what we want to talk about here is like okay the company is different every company is different so there is no uh what one rule fits all uh solution here and what's also like important is to keep always the learning attitude because people are like way smarter than you probably or hopefully and you will have like failures and you you might not know a lot but with having a learning attitude everything will work out perfectly yeah and you can also lean on the stuff that you learned while learning to code which most program or hopefully all programmers do in their job which is googling if you don't know the answer you google and you try to figure it out you open 10 tabs you go through them you find the best answer you see if you learn something hopefully you don't copy paste everything from stack overflow but that is something that is good that you already have a habit of and definitely i was also overwhelmed i had the impostor syndrome i was like i'm not good enough for this i just they're gonna fire me after a month oh okay i'm here i'm here i'm still here in a month they're gonna fire me next month no i'm still here it's been a year now i'm still there so i must be doing something this must be doing something right uh yeah yeah i think that's mainly it about our experiences we're open for questions afterwards in terms of working at the new company but it has definitely been a challenging ride but joyful and learning experience and yeah yeah so now the takeaways i think this is the most important part of our presentation and it's also like the last part so feel free to be or to to pay attention to these points because it's like what we we decided is the most important thing when you start applying for job or getting in a new industry and for us it was like three free points actually it was like skills ability to learn and passion yeah yeah this is this is as he said condensing down of what we found to be the most important things uh obviously you have to have some programming skills you have to know uh the job that you're applying for if you can demonstrate that you have the ability to learn which is easier when you can back it up with the free code cam process of progress or something like that that's really helpful every employer is different some companies they don't really care so much about the ability to learn or the passion they want someone with years of experience dependable etc for every company it's different but in our experience we found that the companies that do accommodate and do focus on these three things are the ones that you're most likely to get a job at and passion as well is something i just want to touch on because i know that a lot of developers or people wanting to get into programming doesn't necessarily do it because they love to do it it's perfectly fine if you have have the idea that you want to change a career either for economic reasons or because you want to do something different and um you've seen that programming could be a locative field or you could have some freedom etc so you don't have to have the passion is what i'm going to get at um but we found that it helps and if you can communicate somehow some aspects of programming and development etc or the culture or whatever that you like and you can get it across in an interview it helps yeah so basically you have to find a balance between your skills and your ability to learn your passion so it has to be in balance or you have to provide something at least to convince the future employer yes what are the concrete actions that you can take to get a job and for or we concluded that the most important things here are portfolio network working and promoting yourself and actually showing up it's like that's like maybe it might be the hardest thing actually to do um so yeah you want to take on yeah um building a portfolio on github contributions i had a phone interview with the company and i was he tried this sounded like he had a little bit more expectations than what i had tried to give across in my resume so i was kind of like saying down playing it a little bit maybe i shouldn't have but i did and he was commenting oh yeah but you have so much stuff on your github profile i was like yeah yeah and i was thinking afterwards wow the power of just having something on your github profile i'm not saying you should just put something that is crap and just hope that it helps but if you have something on github that is your earnest effort to learn and you're active and you're contributing you're trying to change something in the readme of a big open source project that's also fine if you can like get a taste for the field all that helps also from reading articles or hearing experiences from others most hiring managers will not read your code they might skim a little bit and then they skip the rest because not everyone loves reading other people's code all day long as for the networking and promoting yourself there also is a point that is also supposed to cover the aspect of sending out your resumes so you don't have to network you don't have to go out there and say hey hey hey if you if you're not the person that want to don't feel comfortable doing that that's fine but then you make sure you send out resumes and applications the job of the application i found is to get yourself an interview so again just if in doubt just send out applications and they're the job of sending those applications is so you get invited to an interview so keep that in mind and in the interview it's the job of the prospective employer to decide whether or not you're a fit for the company yeah if i had to break it down to one single important feature it's like the portfolio because i've been asked about show me something not just from the employer future employer just friends whoever everybody just wants to see something and you should at least be able to show them something and as robert said before i totally agree on that like just showing that you're so that you did something at github is incredibly powerful it looks amazing and nobody nobody really dives into the code and says ah that's like that's not good so yeah that's it that's it for my side on the concrete actions yeah the last the last point here motivation because we've been asked many many times how to stay motivated and we summarize it in in three points here um ask yourself why develop a habit and trust yourself do you want to start uh yeah for me um the why was obvious i realized i had a passion for code and i didn't think i would ever be able to program so that was kind of just i got for free the habit was using free core camp with the points and the structure it's really nice to know that you have a progression towards something certificate or portfolio projects etc and it also helps as i mentioned earlier to come to um especially the free code camp meetup so i was you know had the social incentive to say hey okay i'm pushing myself a little bit further because i wanted to finish the calculator for example until the next meet up because if i talked about it at the previous meetup that i was working on it i should maybe have it finished by the next time i see the same people yeah and um yeah it's easy to adopt yourself but you kind of just have to uh push through it regardless for me with not feeling i had enough portfolio projects to apply i just applied anyways so you kind of have to push yourself a little bit to um to continue on yeah yeah i think it's incredibly important to ask yourself why and always remind yourself why you are on that path always because you will have failures you will have setbacks and then it's important to remind yourself why you actually on that path and just just look at the scene here right now we have like friday evening you could be at the bar drinking with friends we all have like other things to do but you're here everybody is here actually learning or connecting or networking so you already here and you know why you're here um and that's also like with the trust yourself part here it's it can be incredible difficult to try to start a new journey in a new industry people are doubting you you keep having rejection and failures as he said before like 50 times applying 50 times i in previous jobs i was also like applying 40 50 times that's normal but it's like or maybe it isn't normal i don't know but it's incredible hard it's like rejection people don't even read your your application and that can be really hard so don't be frustrated or don't give up on that because i know some people here are applying always and they're getting rejected and that's just part of the equation that's just the part don't be frustrated if that happens and yeah yeah like the guy here with the startup he's also here he's here he's motivated he has passion for his startup so that's that's my point on on motivation trust yourself and not only the progress or the process is incredible hard but also like people or family like people always telling you stay on your path stay on your like for me my family expected me to be a lawyer and my grandmother was like ah nice a liar and now i'm telling her like i'm programming and she was and she's like what is programming is it like game boy playing or what what is that she doesn't really see that that's difficult and that's opportunities here so that's also like incredible or it can be incredible tough so yeah just look out for that and yeah stay motivated on the way do you have anything to add no no i think you said it beautifully yeah yeah motivation is key is key um yeah if you have any questions feel free to ask um about motivation yeah we want to make sure that we have uh on record a big thanks to free code camp both the local group here which consists of everyone here that keep coming and also the new faces that maybe also want to keep coming and to quincy larson's work at starting freecodcamp.org a couple of years ago and how helpful it has been for us it's definitely not sure we would have had the same path to getting a job if we didn't have free coca absolutely totally agree on that very good platform yes so for to that um yeah this uh if you want to so almost thanks for us we have our contact details and we also have a quite a half of an announcement in the next slide but um you can contact daniel at twitter github and his website other places as well same goes for me and as for the announcement we are so inspired by our journey to becoming fulltime developers that we started a friend an organization to help others do the same it's really in the starting phases if you go to developer's racing i just put it up on a server today and it just says developer's rising there's nothing there and we have a gmail address but it will be changed eventually but for now uh keep us in mind i will also link it as since we are organizing through codecamp this local group will keep mentioning it if people are interested um the purpose is to support programmers in general and provide provide a platform of exchange it's actually what we have been doing for the last month and years even years but with a legal framework so and we are not like we are not tied to the free code camp brand so we can do much more yeah and we also want to explore more so you can expect many nice things to happen um yeah but and we also want to try and try out ways to help others go from learning to code to get a job so yeah we have some ideas and we'll play around with some stuff and if people want to get involved it's an organization you can become a member and yeah yeah also if you if you want to contribute and as you've seen before when we're talking about getting a job it's like contributing can be very uh can be very valuable um if you want to help out or something or contribute feel free to just get in touch and yeah we'll find something yes yes so thank you thank you thank you
