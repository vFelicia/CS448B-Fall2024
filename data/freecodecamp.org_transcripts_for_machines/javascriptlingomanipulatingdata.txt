all right let's talk a little bit about how you actually manipulate data so you've got an array of information but you need to do something with it in javascript we have something called methods which you should look up on the mozilla developer network methods are built into the language an example of methods would be split if you do something and you split it it takes whatever it is and it breaks up into a bunch of little pieces in an array you don't have to write that function that's already built into the language you can use a lot of these methods and put together your own functions if you have a specific way that you want to manipulate data but it's not already built in as a method you can create that function in your javascript the main point of this video isn't to memorize what methods and functions are i just want you to know that there is a way that you can manipulate data and that you should really be checking if there's a method that already does what you want to do
