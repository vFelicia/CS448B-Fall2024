while and do while loops are very similar they both allow you to repeat code the while loop i have an example of that right here the while loop creates a loop that executes a specified statement as long as the test condition evaluates to true and the condition is evaluated before executing the statement so while n is less than five while this is true it's going to run all these statements in in the curly braces and in the statements it's going to add one to n and it's going to console.log in equals n so the important thing to know about while and do while loops is that it's not automatically going to increment your counter like like what happens in a for loop so you have to make sure you do that right inside the loop the do while loop is extremely similar except this is going to create a loop that executes until this test condition evaluates to false so the condition is evaluated after executing the statement resulting in this these statements these are going to run at least one time so it's going to do this stuff right here while i is less than five and then when i not less than five anymore it will stop so one of the key differences is that this is always going to run at least once it's always going to do this whole thing here and then see if i is less than 5 and then if that is we'll stop here it's going to check if n is less than 5 at the beginning and if it is it's going to run this code in here so let me run that now so you can see what happens so you can see n equals 1 2 three four five i equals one two three four five now that looks exactly the same but now if i change this in to five so it's going to start at five um it's going to be while n is less than five oh n is already not less than five so it's not going to run this but here it's going to run this whole thing and then it's going to check if i is less than five and it's going to stop so let's see that see it just says i equals six which is we wouldn't even have i equal 6 last time but remember i is going to start at 5 it's going to increment go up 1 and then a console that's it's 6 and then we're going to stop because i is not less than 5. so while i is less than five well i is not less than five so it's going to stop so let's change this back to zero and i'll just show you a few more quick things you can also use break and continue so if you use continue if n equals three okay we have in if in equals equals three then continue the continue command means to not run any code after that command and just go to the next iteration of the loop so if you have continued it's going to skip anything below the continuous going to skip this it's just going to go back to the top and do another check if n is less than five and then it's going to increment in again so let's see that okay look right here n equals one equals two n does not equal three and equals four and equals five because it skipped and equals three if you use break here break is going to just jump out of the loop completely so it's not going to run any more iterations of the loop so let's see that okay right here with n equals 1 n equals 2 we don't have n equals 3 we don't have n equals four we don't have an equals five but it's broken out of the loop now here's a pro tip if you accidentally make a loop that goes forever and in your code and then you run the code your browser could freeze up this is called an infinite loop and it could crash your browser if you're using chrome the solution is to click window in the top bar and then go to the task manager and then end process and other browsers have a similar thing and then if you're using codepen like i'm doing the default setting is that the javascript runs automatically as soon as you go to the page and this could cause your browser to freeze up again if it runs the same infinite loop again so if you know your code is an infinite loop add the following to the end of the web address bar the question mark turn underscore off underscore js equals true and then if you add that to the end of the address bar it's not going to run automatically you may have to instead of putting a question mark here you may have to put an and sign if you already have a question mark in your address bar well that's while and do while loops thanks for watching my name is beau carnes don't forget to subscribe and remember use your code for good
