hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and the project that we've been working on for so long since at least january has finally launched uh so if you want to see the live version of the site it's at franciscan.edu which i'll type right now in the live chat so i'm gonna start out by telling you just a little bit about the launch and how things went and then we're gonna take a look at uh the trello board where i've been tracking you know everything really from all the extra features that i want to add and all the bugs that people have found and then i have found we're going to do a little triage all right which means we're going to figure out which things on the trello board which tasks are most important should be done first and then we're gonna try to get as many of those things done as we can in about an hour so i do have a meeting later on so we have a hard cap on how long this stream can go of course i will answer your questions as we go we'll use the pomodoro timer for those of you who are watching for the first time i am a fulltime frontend developer for a small university we have just built the main website for the university live over the course of a long time and you're getting a glimpse of my daytoday work i don't rehearse this uh this is what i'm actually doing uh for a living and so i will make mistakes and please call me out on it and i'll do my best to explain what i'm doing as i go along it's not really a tutorial though so don't feel bad if you get lost just you know ask questions uh it's totally fine let's see hey see a lot of people saying hi hey good to see you hey horchat's here good to see you um all right let me all right let me first just take i'm going to set a timer too i'm just going to take a few minutes and i'm going to tell you about how the launch went since i didn't stream it because it's a little bit crazy so basically this is how things went down last week at some point last week or the week before it was decided that we would try to launch on wednesday okay i was asked to give the earliest possible time that i thought we could launch and i said okay wednesday is good i knew i wouldn't be ready by monday um and i wanted to give myself a little buffer in case something went wrong so i said okay let's take tuesday and wednesday it is definitely didn't want to launch on a friday because things go wrong on a weekend then i have to go to work so wednesday we go for launch there was some issues uh where we had to verify that we own the domain with google but there were some issues with the it department and they were wondering to know well would how would the verification affect g suite and would that somehow give the website access to some g suite stuff so once we got all that sorted out on thursday i came into work and i went over with the the people in it we sat down we changed all the uh dns information and then over the course of that day slowly we saw uh the um all the dns stuff get updated because sometimes it takes a while got it all updated got everything running on google app engine and the site started to work and i started to get messages from people saying hey i found this link then it doesn't work or where's this piece of content i can't find it so it wasn't really that bad uh to be honest with you it was the response was uh overall like positive nobody nobody came talked to me directly or anything and said they don't like the website we did have some students well one student on facebook maybe a few students on facebook said that they didn't like certain parts of the site otherwise though not too bad um so overall really happy there were several people who actually came up to me that day and said congratulations and they love the site so that was really cool um no like major issues the site didn't crash nothing crazy like that just as some broken links and things so that's what mostly what i've been going through the only weird issue that i have that i haven't been able to figure out is that occasionally when i deployed a google app engine uh the build just the weird things break so the logos won't show up or certain pages uh will just cause an error and then if i just rebuild and redeploy it works um so what i'm done in instead and if anybody's interested i can show you how we've done this with app engine is i set up some some scripts in my pack package json to do a test build and deploy or it will deploy an instance to google app engine but it won't point the domain to that instance so i can go to just that custom url which it would it shows me whenever the build and deployment succeeds make sure everything works first and then do a real deploy with that same build okay so that's my deployment step now which is to be honest with you that's how it should be done i think that way there's this inbetween step of you know your development environment is local and then there's this test environment and then production so that's the flow now it was actually pretty simple once i found the documentation to figure out how to do that so i can i can show you that in a second but basically that's how everything went uh not too bad the only stressful thing is just trying to figure out what to do first because a lot of times i'll have multiple people messaging me and talking to me about we want this done or that done and uh just trying to like handle all those things coming in while i'm working on other things uh is not overwhelming but it's just you know um challenging right okay i see a lot of people saying hi i just want to say hey everybody i'm going to set a 25 minute timer at the end of that timer i'm going to go to the live chat and i'm going to answer your questions and and check out what you've been saying so um i see yeah somebody's son keeps saying hi a lot so i'm just going to say hi to you since you're really excited about that okay um let's see all right timer is set i'm going to share my screen now and let me show you first i'm going to show you that script since i just talked about it i'm going to show it to you i don't know if this would apply to anybody if you're not using google app engine i'd like to go through maybe on a stream one day or on a recorded video and kind of show you the flow of how everything's set up like a big overview uh but for now uh this is what i've done hopefully you can see that let me know if it's too small for now uh we have are our test deploy which actually runs the build first so it does our build step which is just next build right and then it does a oops here's your test deploy it does a gcloud app deploy with a no promote flag okay so that means it's not going to automatically point the url to the latest version which it normally would do right so the step would then be do this go to the url that it tells me it's it's launched this instance to make sure that it works and then i can run deploy right which is a g cloud app deploy if for some reason i needed to just do things really fast maybe an emergency change i could just run a build deploy which would build and deploy right to the live version immediately this is what i was doing at first and it didn't always work out so it wasn't like catastrophic but you know there was a time where i deployed something before i came into work when i was still at home and didn't realize that a certain section of the site wasn't working anymore and then when i got to work i realized it you know but there was i don't know maybe around an hour of time that a section of the site wasn't working so i'm definitely going to stick with this now and just hit those sections of the site that i know have been affected so mainly some things on the homepage and things on faculty list pages those are the only areas that i know have been affected so far uh okay all right so now let me show you our trello board and this will be the last thing we do before we actually get started so i'm going to try to zoom in and show you this is what i was working on right before i started the stream so i just finished the pomodoro session with this and um i'm just working on a a student here ran some some scans and found a bunch of links and stuff super helpful and i forwarded me all the info so i grabbed it all and just made a checklist of it and i'm just going through and checking some of these broken links a lot of them i had already fixed by fixing like previous issues so right now it's just a matter of checking these links making sure they work now and then checking them off so i'm almost through that one uh i don't know that that'll be that exciting for a stream or informative so let's check out some of the other things we have i mainly want to look at these two areas because i've already sorted through what i think are really important things and put them in here so we're just going to look at the ones that are assigned to me so they have my little my image right there we just looked at these links so the in progress column is going to be the most important things right now um make edits to grad education pages let's check out what's in here i don't even remember this uh looks like they're broken links got education okay you know what these edits i got these from um someone else that that works here at the university earlier today a lot of these are just uh text edits so that's not it's not really going to involve coding so we're gonna skip that for now uh this testing i've mainly been having my one of my student workers work on this and now there's there's a large list of things that need work done that might be a decent candidate uh let's see i do want to research using algolia for the search because i'm not satisfied with the way the search results are coming in right now so if anybody has experience with algolia let me know what you think of it uh if if you had a good experience bad experience if you have any advice for the best way to go about doing that please let me know i think it's worth it algolia is a paid service uh if you want to be able to use all the features wow i have a lot of viewers right now hey everybody uh please if anybody's a new viewer you're not sure what's going on please feel free to ask questions i may not get to it for a little while i'm running this timer but i imagine there's probably a lot of first time viewers right now uh so in about 20 minutes i'm going to do a little question and answer session so if you can stick around till then i'll answer any questions that you have okay so i'd rather not do research on the stream so that's probably out uh let's see just like search urls add new draw links all right you know what these are all not that exciting so here's what we'll do let me let me go through this really quick oops not this one this stuff and let's see if there'd be something a little bit more exciting in here when you go to the search tab without searching anything the top search option is unclickable all right let's check that out that's kind of a weird thing i'm not really sure what it means alright so my student worker reported this bug let's check out what the bug is and let's see uh if we can fix it right so let me i'm gonna start up my oh no there we go i'm going to start up ngrok uh this is going to let you check out the site as we're working on it you can see the site live now if you want but also you can click on the link i just pasted in there if it doesn't work when you click it copy and paste it in your browser and that should work but you'll be able to click around on the site inspect it with your dev tools you know whatever you want i'm gonna go to well first let's go to the site so i'm going to go to the local host version and see if we can replicate it here if not we'll go to the live version so let's go to the search page i'm not actually even sure how the my student worker got to the search page without clicking on a search but uh regardless okay so we're on the search page we haven't searched for anything and now let's try to click this um okay all right so this seems to be the issue that if you try to use the top search bar when you're on the search page a search does not occur okay what if all right let me share with you the couple of solutions that are going through my head right now okay um number one we could just take away the search option in the top if we're on the search page that's an option there's really no need to have more than one search on the search page you know what else i'm also going to assume that the search on the side here doesn't work let's check that out and that is the case okay so neither search option works on the search page so um we could try to get them to work or we could remove them now that there's two of them to remove i don't know if i want to remove two that might actually be more work than just fixing this so let's look into the code and see why this isn't working i think the reason is going to be because the the way these work depends on a route change and since no route change is happening right because we're already on the search page that's that's why this isn't working but uh there is something i actually wanted to implement so i'm kind of glad this came up i want to implement it so that the search will look here at the address bar you might not be able to see it uh small but it'll look at the search query here and automatically search so that if a person bookmarked a search they could come back and see the same search now all this may not even matter if we go with algolia but for now i don't know how soon we're gonna go with algolia if at all so i think it might be worth it to implement this let's see so we need to check out our search page and you know what let's see let's see where that card is for the search because i do i believe i had it on here let's look over here wow let me let me do it let's do a search for this uh add search euros test search page autofocus fix up so did i not do this hmm all right i'm not gonna keep looking for that i thought i already had a card for that i guess not it's possible i just made a github issue for it instead uh but i'm not gonna do that uh let's see i'm gonna i'm getting some feedback from you all about this so i'm just gonna go to the live chat now uh john hanson says the side search menu will fail for search term if if the search page route is there uh michael creole says why not make this search bar component so that no matter where it is it acts the same um that's not a bad idea i don't know if we'll do that right now uh i don't know if i'll have time for to do that but that's actually not a bad idea um first thing let's go to our search page and see what we have going on see how difficult this is gonna be uh to do okay all right so on our search page let's see our search term it's probably going to determine what we search right so we'll most likely need to grab what's in the url and put it into our state under search term so let's see uh component did mount create base search looks like we're already doing some things with search and we're already getting a new location search but are we already getting the search term interesting oh you know what i think i know what the problem is so this happens when a component did mount right um when we're here on the page already uh this this page component is already mounted so when we change this it doesn't change the state of that component so that component doesn't rerender we we don't get this doesn't run again so that's our problem right now hmm all right this is going to be it's going to be a little bit more difficult than i had hoped uh mostly because of where these components all live right uh right now like the easiest way to do this would just be to i don't know call call some of these functions whenever we change um the search components right on the side drawer and on the app bar but unfortunately these aren't shared so i'm gonna look harsh it's saying you could use to get snapshot before update or get derived state from props okay you know what i just got who said it michael creole says there's a learning experience i've been playing around with search trying to make it work with graphql still can't figure it out uh that actually gave me an idea what if all right let me talk through this you all let me know what you think what if we stored the search term in um i can't remember what it's called an apollo like like a universal store right for for the entire application so um i don't think we've done that yet with apollo though but potentially i think that could work uh let's see has anybody used that with basically um you use the capabilities that apollo has that act kind of like redux right john hanson says local storage yeah i mean not exactly local storage we could use local storage but i was thinking more of um what apollo has let's double check really quick um apollo let's go to apollo graphql to their docs and react there we go local state management link state that's what it's called oh harshit says since it happens on route change use nexjs route listeners okay i like that idea let's check this out multiple releases i just want to go to the github page there we go if you go to the next github page you can just do a control fine no event or i'm what was it route listeners say route well at least we have the route if you don't want to listen here we are here's how to properly listen for router event and around change router events on all right cool let's try to listen to this then and do we need to import yeah we'll probably need to import router so let's grab that first let's import router if i'm not already yeah i'm not already doing it so we're going to import router from next router let me zoom in a little bit so the idea here is if we could just use this to listen for a route change we can trigger what was already happening on componentdid mount but instead we're going to trigger the same thing on a route change okay so let's just copy what they have here all right so the way this will go is on the route change it's just going to call whatever function we give it and in this case it's handled route change but for in in our case we're probably just going to call something we already have so i'm going to put this i'm not sure where we need to put this let me double check where's this thing put this i guess we can put it right out here with with the rest of it i'm gonna try to put it closer to the component it's gonna call so hopefully it'll make more sense so let's put it up here router i thought we're importing router right i'm using it put it in component did mount all right so harsh it's saying put it in component did mount oh what did i just do there we go i think i accidentally copied the wrong thing all right let's try it again okay we'll put it in component did mount okay so that'll fire this off one component did mount and then we'll call um we can pass component amount to it interesting okay um okay i don't think i've ever tried to call component did mount this is gonna be interesting let's see if it works all right where are we at no property on of undefined router events hmm that's odd right because we this is exactly how it has it here i wonder if they have an example that we can look at usually they have examples um uh let's check out these examples i want that let's go to our pages uh let's see the index page maybe it'll have it on here nope uh let's try here no i just want to know where they have the router touch it there we are they use the next router here okay so they just have router events here okay all right let's just let's make a little switch here let's take it out of here and we'll put it up here and then let's do this because i kind of i like i kind of like this um we'll pass in url yeah let's just pull this whole thing for now so like how they're doing this so we're going to pass in i guess we don't really need to pass in the url right but we do need to i do want to call multiple things so we would call i guess these three and why again we have the weird squiggly line on router unless i see this needs to go outside of here there we go i'm not sure though if i'm going to be able to call these functions from outside here let's see what error we get still getting that same on air uh you know what harsh is saying maybe i need to update next js you know what you're right i think i'm not using the latest version all right let's see how much time we have oh okay almost time for question and answer so we'll do some questions and answers and then we'll decide whether or not we're going to try to update next js right now definitely going to make another branch let's do that right now get check out the um search update so i'm going to get checkout with a b flag so that will make a new branch and check out that new branch at the same time i'm going to call it search update okay that way uh anything we do now will not mess up our main master branch okay let's i'm gonna do a five minute timer and answer some questions so i'm gonna scroll up to the top try to get through as many questions as i can in this five minutes and then we'll do go back and do some coding okay uh someone's interested in python programming uh i personally don't do any python uh not on the stream or anything but there are definitely some other videos on uh this channel where i use all different types of programming languages so maybe just do a little search for python inside the free code camp channel and you know you'll probably find something let's see okay see a lot of you saying hi i'm not going to say all your names individually sorry but i just want to make sure we have enough time to get something done in this stream um love neet says is react good enough for a job uh yeah for sure there are a ton of react jobs out there i see uh reacting job listings all the time like almost every day i see a job listing for react i get them like sent to my email and on linkedin and everything so i see them all the time uh karante says much appreciated for the stream um thanks i i'm glad you said that always love to hear that um the stream is of value uh to you all um steven says howdy long time viewer first time poster oh awesome well thanks for watching and uh thanks for letting me know you're out there uh mike asks if i had have discord i do have discord my name is probably jesse weigle on discord it's pretty much the same everywhere um moosh mooshfeek says do you use php in frontend development do you have to use php in front of development no not at all php is not a front end thing if you want to do wordpress development it might not hurt to know some php but otherwise i really don't do much php at all andrew says hey if you're still in the market for a new keyboard i would recommend something mechanical if you give me a budget i could try to point you in the right direction okay cool so for those of you who follow me on instagram you might already know this but i'm looking for suggestions for keyboards i have a new setup at home that i'm working on and i'm gonna maybe i'll show you all my new setup on instagram uh if you want to follow me on there it's uh jesse.weigle i think is my name but um i have this old keyboard i really don't like how it feels so i'm looking for suggestions my budget right now is like i don't want to spend a lot on a keyboard i've never used a mechanical one so i'd like to get kind of like a lower priced keyboard um i don't know like for sure under 100 uh for a keyboard you know maybe like around 50 would be even better i know that's not a lot for mechanical keyboard but i don't want to invest a lot into one until i really get the experience of typing on one and get a feel for what i like and don't like about them uh let's see uh did um jamal i'm sorry i'm not sure how to pronounce that it's dg d j a m a l says are you contributing to react no i have not contributed to the you know react code base but it'd be awesome to do so i just don't have the time right now but i'd love to at some point since i've used react for so much it'd be great to give back uh love needs says how will i become like you as a react coder um i just just practice and um try to be better than me right um uh i'm not sure that i'm like any type of goal to aspire to but uh yeah just practice read documentation build things with react uh don't be afraid to just build things and don't worry so much is like is this the right way to do it just build uh you'll get better you can always go back and refactor things but the most important thing to get better at coding is is to code code and try to improve uh every every time you build something new try to expand what you can do and build more hey all right looks like i'm not going to get through all the questions right now but i will definitely try to get through them on my after we do a little bit more coding um let me see i'm going to write down where i leave off so i don't miss anyone's questions here's what we're going to do i'm going to start this timer for another pomodoro session but if we get finished before it ends i'm just going to go write the question so we have more time for questions okay um i think especially since we just made a new branch i'm gonna try to update next uh on on the air so i'm gonna go through all the steps that i normally do when i update like a major package that i'm using so first let's go to next and i'm gonna go up here to releases and let's find out which release area so we're gonna go to latest release so i'm not going to update to one of these canary releases they have all the latest features but they also have more bugs than a stable release so i'm going to go to latest release 6.1.2 and we're going to check out any release notes okay and it looks like there's not see like normally we would see they would say breaking changes here and there's no breaking changes so i think we're good to go and it'll tell you usually we could scroll down on most packages is it gonna say it usually it'll say what to type into to use this and actually hmm let's go to the docs just to see if we have this this ability and the latest stable release there we go okay so we we can listen for router events with the latest release on route change start oh you know what it has a different syntax okay you know what let's just try this now i still want to update next but let's see if this syntax works and if it does at least we'll have it working and then we can update next if we want to okay so i yeah we still need to import router but now instead of router events on we're going to go on route change start and we'll just copy and paste this stuff in here get rid of this one and see if this works now we'll go back to okay we didn't get an error this time which is nice and all right that was a good sign because it looked like it used what was up here and it automatically searched so let's let's change this um that was nice okay that that searching based on a url change which is awesome now here's the next test we'll go back and do a search for the okay and that didn't work so this is still not working it did update this but it updated it in in a way that didn't trigger oh accidentally clicked that so it didn't trigger that on route change start so let's look at how we're we're pushing that route uh so let's let's go to the drawer component since we we have it open already and let me see if i can find search i guess i could have searched for something better okay here's okay so we do a handle search let's look for that handle search okay so we're doing router push path name so we're doing a push so let's look at the routes and see if we could do this part in a different way so that it would cause cause the event to get registered right so as it gets picked up so we're gonna go back to our documentation and i guess we'll use this documentation although i really wish there were a dark theme for this you know it's killing my eyes uh routing okay routing with link that's not what we want to do not what we want to do where yet there we are so you want to use this router push that's right you may wish to listen to pop state react for the router does it print some forces or something refresh we could use push and replace a url all right i'm going to double check the chat to see if you all have have typed in some advice okay harsh it's saying yarn upgrade interactive latest might give you a heart attack after seeing how many packages are out of date i know i haven't updated any packages for two or three weeks because i knew launch was coming so i didn't want to break anything too bad before launch um but i do want to start getting things updated now because i don't like to go too long without updating okay let's see all right i don't see anything so let's just keep on going with this push in place props you're a push okay so maybe on before he's viruses for changing the browser's history well let's see if we're changing the browser history actually we are okay let's let's try this then uh let's try to listen for a change in browser history where am i at i can get rid of these two yeah i mean we could try to listen for this i i don't i don't really know if it's gonna work but it's worth a shot and it means we don't have to change that much okay all right so let's see this now let's um hmm okay so that didn't work either let me i'm gonna refresh just to be sure that i picked up that change although i'm pretty sure it did okay yeah so that's not picking it up either uh the history see okay all right what we could do we could force we could force a change so if we didn't use the router and we just used the normal like browser api we could potentially force a change right um we could try it let's see how much time we have all right so we could try to try that or we could try upgrading to the next version of next and see if we then could use some of the newer stuff actually you know we couldn't right so the documentation we read at first on github was for the canary release this documentation is for the latest release which is what we would be upgrading to so this is what we would be using so if we wanted to use the latest stuff we'd have to wait until that actually came into the latest stable release so here's what i want to try this will be the last thing i try uh before we do some questions because i don't wanna i don't wanna go too long with the coding and not be able to answer your questions okay so we're gonna go to we'll go to the drawer component for now and instead of using router push let's if the state search let's comment this out for now and instead let's do window dots location i'm doing this for memory let's see if this works i equals search search equals okay so here's what i'm doing uh i'm going to use the browsers api to change the window location and see if that'll trigger anything i'm going for memory here so i don't even know if this is the right way to say it um let's see search okay so i'm just using a template literal so that i can put javascript in the middle of this and grab this state so let's save that see if we get an error or anything okay nothing right off the bat we'll let this do its thing and then we'll try to search from that side drawer there which is what we just changed nice that worked alright cool i do want to verify that that changed the browser history it does awesome so now let's just take what we just did there and we can get rid of that and we'll just take this and use it in our app bar component so let's find our app bar and find the search there see if we have handle search here as well we do so we're going to remove this router push and put that in there we're going to save it and now oh try it yay it works all right cool let's also verify that this still works okay uh the one thing i would want to do and i don't know if we'll have time today to do that but you can see i just searched for biology here and i did get the biology results but it didn't change in the url it still has the url for the other uh type of search so what i would want to do then is make it so that when a search happens here it does actually change the url so actually you know what we can do for that let's do this router push okay we're going to do the router push but we're going to put it in the search so that when this happens um before you change i guess i could put this on get search try to figure out which which function to put this on um i guess we could put it on this fetch search term i definitely don't need a console of the search term anymore so let's just pop this in right here and see if that works whoops property node is undefined that's weird we didn't really change anything oops you know uh i think we didn't bring in router so we need to bring in router oops there we go uh okay we do have next router in there now so why is it not working oops i went to the wrong page and hey i found another error so academic words page does not work we'll have to write that down okay so let's do this hmm okay it didn't work what did i miss probably let's see let's put this somewhere else this set state where's the search term all right so i want to grab the search term after it's been set this is a search okay uh so right here we're setting the search term if the length we then we want to do debounced search all right so where's our dbound search let's see dbots there's the bouncers okay here's the bound search and that just does fetch search term which is what we were going for and get results so actually i mean this does seem like the right place to put it no let's put it back in here and make sure this state search you know what i was calling it search instead of search term that's that's the problem there we go there we go see it changed automatically awesome that was the problem i was trying to get it to give me something from state that didn't exist in state okay all right six minutes left all right and i'm while i'm answering the questions i'm just going to run do a commit run it through the tests make sure everything works check our status if that looks good we'll do a git add yarn cm that's just going to walk us through making a good commit message we're going to add a new feature and let's say um change url on all searches so we did we changed the url on all searches yeah that actually that's pretty much exactly what we did for the most part um no breaking changes as far as i know i don't know if it affects any issues i don't really want to check right now oh what happened router is defined but never used we never took router out from our drawer and we never took it out from our app bar let's make sure we save both of those now let's run it again we can run your rncm with a retry frag flagged right to your y and then that way we don't have to go through all that stuff that we just did we'll let that do its thing i'll check back in on in a minute in the meantime let me scroll up to where i left off for those of you who may be just joining us uh the coding portion of this is pretty much over we're going to do question answers if you have any questions please put them in the live chat now i'll do my best to answer all of them if i can onkit says in what language are you coding i'm using javascript in particular i'm using react in a syntax called jsx react as a javascript library so that's why it may look a little bit different from normal javascript okay we passed all our tests now i can push this git push origin search update this looks pretty good uh get master let's get checkout master we'll do a merge git merge search update awesome um let's do a a get push make sure that goes up there and then we'll do a test deploy uh let me double check what that is uh test deploy okay so let's run a yarn test deploy okay that's going to do a build and then it's going to do a test deployment it's going to give us a url we can check it out make sure it's working okay so that's going to take a little while let's see oh okay harshit says that so i earlier i was talking about a problem with builds not always working um or like it seems like they work but in reality they were not working r should say maybe it's due to lock files make sure using properly using yarn had a similar issue with netlify um is it the same kind of build environment sorry you know what sometimes i'm building on my laptop and sometimes i'm building here on this machine so it's possible that it is the the build environment off the double check whoa that's weird something happened g crowd crashed faculty.js not found or not accessible what is wrong with our faculty.js that's really weird it should be here looks good here all right let's run that again maybe there's something wrong with that build see what's happening uh mike says uh hey mate is there any chance i can add you on discord yeah yeah no problem um that's what i think it's jesse wago or jessie.weigle or something like that on discord uh mohawk says do you use brackets editor no i use visual studio code um cal young says how are you um good not bad i'm pretty i feel so much better now that i launched this site uh it was really kind of making me nervous so yeah pretty good actually i started getting back into working out on a more regular basis going like some more intense workouts so i'm feeling really good about that uh so anyway how you doing well it aired out again and he gave me a lot of info now interesting hmm all right i'm gonna have to check that out after the stream so i guess i'm not gonna do a test deploy right now which is fine because we got a lot of questions anyway uh kunal says how how do you do this um i i don't know i just have learned how to do it in practice uh practic says why react over angular um i guess at some point i wanted to learn react and so i started learning react and that's i mean that's pretty much why i worked with angular 1 back in the day and i had a hard time with it it was probably just my inexperience and didn't really have anything to do with angular but uh when i started working with react um for whatever reason i i picked it up more easily than i did angular and i really liked it so that's kind of why i've been sticking with react and i think you can build really cool things with with react harshit says i have a ton of experience with algolia but how are you going to index the item uh means you have a ton of stuff in wordpress spread around hardship that's exactly what my concern is is uh i i like algolia i've seen it in use i think it's awesome but i don't know how i'm gonna get it all the data that it needs but i need to implement something uh because the current search is i mean it's not what i think people would expect from search you know when they search in google it tries to predict what the most relevant search is going to be so i need something more like that uh and to be honest with you i'm not even sure if algolia is the right answer for that uh but i i've heard really good things about it so that's what i want to i want to try looking there first okay harsha says they have a great uh wordpress plugin um just make sure they support custom post types well if they have a wordpress plugin this might be a little bit easier so i do have on all the wordpress posts i i have the correct urls in there to handle the whole difference between what wordpress thinks the url is versus what the react url is so i already have that data in there that might make things easier uh space chiller says will you make a discord server uh i'm not gonna make a discord server right now um but there may already be one we have a lot of different places over you know the past year or so where we've tried to get some chat going um like slack uh trying to think where else we had a forum once i can't remember the other place where we had it so i don't know if we ever had discord or not if we already have something on discord and somebody remembers please let me know in the chat uh otherwise like i'm open to having a discord server for for the live stream stuff but i'm i'm not i just don't have a lot of time to make it right now uh galrav says i'm a first timer here do you have a github repo for this project yep the link to the repo is in the description uh adrian says hello how can i put that yellow line under the head function greetings from spain yellow line under the head function i'm i'm not sure what you mean uh so maybe clarify a little bit probably because it probably made sense when at that point but now i can't remember what i was doing when you asked that question so maybe explain a little bit more i'd be happy to let you know um daca is asking what language this is it's javascript react with javascript mysco says so lame i apologies for my lameness please let me know what i could do to make the stream less lame always trying to improve let's see says he sounds like joe budden lol i don't know who that is maybe i do sound like him i'm not really sure michael cruz says you take two weeks off and you've forgotten how to type i didn't take two weeks off i've been working really hard i just didn't stream for a long time i guess i forgot how to type and talk at the same time a hundred subscribers without a video challenge says love you i love you too thank you and good luck with your 100 subscribers without a video let's see sorry i'm skipping over some of the stuff that was about what we were working on earlier since we already got it to work i don't don't really need to read it all out um aniket says what's the current status um the site's launched now so it is live so everything we're doing now is like bug fixes or new features uh gaurav says you had dark mode on github how did you do that uh search for github dark on google or whatever search engine you like and it should be one of the first results yusuf says hi jesse it's good to see you again oh thanks for saying that and uh thanks for watching i did miss you all i i hadn't streamed for a while and things were just so crazy was trying to get it launched and back and forth between everybody that needed to be involved to make that happen so um i'm glad to be streaming again though um let's see eva says have do you have live coding streams about redux saga i've never done a stream about redux saga um so yeah i don't have any plans to use redux saga right now um if enough people were interested maybe i'd i'd try to do something a video about it or something like that but currently no i have used redux thunks before and i may have done a stream using redux thunk in the past i can't remember though uh it might be on my youtube channel so i have my own personal youtube channel it's uh jesse white jessie r weigle or jesse weigle something like that it might be linked in the description but i think maybe i've used it on that channel i don't really know um but anyway redux thunk is like usually seen as kind of an alternative to redux saga so it may be similar marcio says uh would you call this session a normal workday um yeah yeah this is pretty normal i guess um yeah i would say this is normal for like post launch right yeah and the fact that i'm trying to get it to work and i got to try a bunch of different things we go back and forth to documentation try it that's that's definitely how things normally work i mean sometimes i get on a roll and like things just work sometimes nothing works and i'm just stuck in reading documentation and trying things and going through error messages and then you know everything in between so i would say that's pretty pretty normal the stuff you don't see is like answering emails um going to meetings things like that i can't really put on the stream uh or it would be boring to put on the stream uh but when i'm actually getting to do code this is pretty much how it is also i do things like um assign tasks to other i like student workers and things like that so um occasionally i'll do little tutorial videos for them uh in instructions so i also do that as well uh to mania says did anyone have or catch jesse's instagram handle it is i believe it's jessie.yl oh okay michael creel typed it in the chat so you can see it in the chat jesse.weigle it's a jesse dot weigel so i mean like the little period not spelled out uh brian says how long have you been coding in this language in with javascript i think i've been doing javascript stuff for like five years react um two years somewhere around two years i think uh phoenix says hey jesse i thought that this would be done since we were launched websites are never done um especially when you work for a company and you're doing the sites if you're a contract worker like you're done when your contract's done so i mean that's i guess kind of nice but no the website is never done we're i mean we'll get to a point where we don't really have to do a lot with it and we move on to another project but uh for now we're gonna be working on updates to this for for a little while longer uh world boss says why don't you use angular um i because i know react i mean at this point i know a lot about react it would definitely be a step backwards for me in terms of productivity to try to learn angular i just i don't see the advantage of doing that even in the long run so if there's something about angular that would really help out um with my projects and my workflow and my efficiency then please let me know uh but at least from what i know you know react can fulfill all the requirements of what i need for my projects and since i've already been using it and can develop faster with it than i can with angular i'm just going to stick with react michael says okay just have a little conversation but i kind of like this this comment so i want to read it um it's just started looking for remote jobs but imposter syndrome is kicking in hard uh yeah so let me just comment on this because i i know a lot of people talk about imposter syndrome i definitely uh it it hits me sometimes as well not as much now as it used to um especially since i've been doing the stream because like when you all keep watching me even though i continue to mess up like it definitely uh builds up my confidence in the sense that like okay it doesn't really matter how bad i am like i'm still i'm still useful for something as a developer but when you're applying for jobs don't worry about thinking like am i good enough for this job that's not for you to decide the other people that are going to hire you are going to decide whether or not they want you okay your job is just to make yourself look as good as you can without lying and and get the info out there right if somebody's going to hire you for the job then they're gonna hire you if if they've hired you for some job and you're entirely like not qualified to do it and they don't provide you with the training and you fail that's their fault don't worry about it all right it's just uh this is how it works right you you are selling something and that's your abilities and your talent so you when you're selling something you make it look as good as you can without lying right the other person is going to make that decision based on a lot of reasons you may not even know about whether or not they want to buy what you're selling in this case your your services your ability your skills um don't worry about whether or not you're qualified or whatever you you just got to put it out there that you got something for sale okay so apply for as many many things as you can i've applied for jobs before where i didn't even meet the minimum requirements it's fine just and sometimes i've done that and i've been able to actually talk to people about the job you know i may never have gotten through to like the full interview step but it's still been a useful thing uh you know so i encourage you to just just apply right and uh don't don't worry about whether or not you think you can do it see phoenix says by the way jesse i've created my first blog site and made my first blog on it would you mind having a look at it on the stream we'd love to have feedback uh yeah phoenix send me since you can't do links on here haha you already sent it on twitter nice i was just gonna ask you to send it on twitter let's copy this link address and you know what let me let me get this ready and i will pull it over oh cool let me pull this over alright so this is phoenix's i lost my live chat where did you go okay wow i still had a live chat up from two weeks ago wow okay this is the correct one right wait is that still not the right one where is the right chat okay i thought for a second i closed out the wrong chat window but i i didn't alright so anyway this is phoenix's uh blog really cool really cool i like this where's my hmm this is really cool today i learned seriously really cool i like this that's cool thanks for sharing i think i like um let's see the thing i would say is in terms of feedback just from a design perspective since we're just looking at it is maybe uh if you're gonna have shadows you might maybe put a shadow on this as well uh to keep it consistent like that it seems like these are the same depth and then also i usually don't like to have a hover effect like how the shadow gets you know longer unless something's clickable so because it usually indicates to the user the thing is clickable you know not always but i think it's a common design pattern so you maybe might not want to have that hover shadow effect on this um if it's not going to be clickable um but other than that i think it's really cool and i kind of i really like you got a lot of code in there that's cool let me see what it looks like okay so this just goes down to the post nice cool uh gal rev says did you use any other boilerplate for react yeah this is the next next jf so it wasn't create react app so yeah it will be different uh prakar says i'm about to start learning react i just wanted to know uh what i should know about webpack es land babel because create react app contains everything bundled together yeah honestly if you want to start with react and use create react app you don't need to know anything about webpack es land babel none of that just worry about react down the road you may want to customize some of that stuff but you can definitely build awesome things without touching any of those things so i would just not worry about it at all right now let's see uh yoga says can you please share the code on github uh yeah there should be a link to this github repo in the description to the video kevin ward says versus js okay so let's talk about the errors we were getting um yeah that's that's a weird error yeah i'm not i'm not gonna have time to work this out on the stream i'll have to work it out later eventually says you look tired i'm a little bit tired i i woke up in the middle of the night last night so i didn't get like a good amount of uninterrupted sleep but not not too bad uh mammy says hello i missed classes my system crashed with the help of a hacker oh no i'm sorry to hear that i hope you get everything back up and running uh nikki says i've been listening to a lot of podcasts recently um headaches and not doing anything kind of forced me to catching up on lots of dead podcasts what are your favorites um i like actually i don't think i'm gonna be able to get to all the questions i'm gonna try to go through this fast so really quick i've been listening to the syntax uh podcast i think it's called syntax i like that one i like uh the free code camp podcast um it's not exactly developer one it's more of like a hacking one but dark net diaries is really cool i can't i know there's there's like three or four other ones i listen to and they're just slipping my mind right now so maybe i'll have to ask me again when i'm not running out of time maybe and i'll look on my uh list of podcasts and i'll tell you all the ones i'm listening to let's see michael says you have a chat window open for two weeks ago yes yes i do evidently i do um john hanson says server response time is very good for all the database calls is just because a specific header is sent to the server is just because the site's hosting on http version two uh i don't know really i don't i don't know why it's fast um it looks like i accidentally skipped some stuff um uh yeah it says new to react any suggestions for me uh just try to practice a little bit every day you know what let me check i'm double checking to make sure i have a meeting in a few minutes i don't want to cut the stream off if i'm not um okay harsha says we may have a discord server we had getter oh that's right we did have getter all right so it looks like the other people that are supposed to be on my meeting are in another meeting right now so it may have bought me a few minutes so i'm just going to keep streaming okay uh land rover says what's react used for for building web apps you can also use it for native apps and other things uh ventilis is where should i start learning coding uh free code camp let's see harsha says now i get that while you're getting build errors you're not you're not shutting down the next js development server so files are busy in the file system and messing things up ah okay let's see if this works then oh okay so phoenix says when the there are more posts you will have to click to expand so the hover effect all right that that's actually perfect so if that's going to be the case then i'd say yeah for sure keep the hover effect michael creo says how do you handle it when you get 200 likes on a tweet my phone is blowing up and it's getting annoying i don't know if i've ever had 200 likes on a tweet so i don't know how to handle it evan says just got here where do you go for daily code challenges i actually i don't sometimes i'll go to free code camp and do stuff looks like i'm still getting errors um otherwise i don't really do the daily code challenges jeju says hello change your theme um joe says can you make a project so we can learn um maybe maybe like on my channel i'll do something like that at some point if i get time gaurav says you can share the list of podcasts on twitter okay and maybe i'll do that joe says can you help me or else get a coding job with no degree yeah i'd say definitely try to go through the free coding camp free code camp lessons uh there are a lot of people that have gotten jobs like that harsha says what are you using for that meeting look up i'm not sure what you're saying i'm not sure what that refers to michael says that was a humble brag on my part all right cool i think yeah i definitely want to finish the chat up now um in case my meeting does start on time i don't want to be late for that because that's my boss and my boss's boss are both going to be in there um so yes i'm gonna finish up but thank you all so much for watching uh it looks like we had a lot of new people and uh so i hope you liked it if there's anything i can do to improve the streams please let me know definitely welcome criticism and um oh harshit wanted to know how i knew other people were meeting because i asked one of my uh coworkers on slack but yeah so anyway thanks again i'm gonna try to stream again this week if i can i want to try to get back into like regular times for streaming and yeah so hopefully i'll see you all soon until then have a great day
