what's going on my name is jay and in this video i want to show you how you can use a public api so let's see so for this video we're going to be using openweathermap.org they have a very very simple api they have a ton of data that we can use so if you go there and then you click api you will see all these options right here but the one that i want is this one the first one the current weather data that's the one that i want okay so click subscribe you will see all these options um the one that we're gonna use is the free version which is gonna work for this video and it works for like a personal website and stuff like that so click on the get api key and start so you need to sign up just like a normal website just your email and password and all that stuff and they're gonna give you an api key um so that way you can request all that data so let's test the api so let's see if it works i have here the url that they provide which is this one right here all right so now we need to add question mark q equals to whatever city and you can see that i have it already there so i live in orlando so it's orlando and then and app app id equals to whatever api key they gave you all right so that's mine don't try to use mine because it's not gonna work for you i'm gonna hit enter and here you go so i have all the data from the current weather in orlando which is great one thing that i want to do right now is because if you can see here on temperature that's uh it's a different unit we use a different unit so i'm just gonna put it right here after this and so it's going to be unit equals to imperial and then end and i'm going to leave the app id so i'm going to hit enter again and now we have whatever you use you can change it but this is what we use in the united states cool now that we have this url ready to go i'm just going to go to my text editor and start coding here i have an html file the only thing i have is i'm requesting jquery we're gonna we're gonna use it to request the data we have a script dot dis which is empty and we have a style dot css it's empty we're going to add some stuff in a minute so let's start by adding some html here so the first thing i'm gonna do i'm gonna add a container everything's gonna be inside that container so it can be like weather container okay and inside there we can do a paragraph and then we can add like a class of um this can be actually you know what first i'm gonna add an icon like if it's raining if it's raining we can do like a rain cloud with some drops or whatever if it's sunny we can add you know a sun or something like that so that's the icon let's put icon as a class this is going to be like the name so if it's raining it's going to be like rain if it's sunny it's going to be sunny so this is we can name it name it um i don't know whether whatever you can name it whatever you want so let's create another one and this one is going to be the temperature of course tank all right cool i think that's all we need for now i like if i want the weather i just want like you know whatever is happening in the and the temperature and then the icon is something cool you know that we'd like to see all right so that's it for the html i'm gonna save it and then for the javascript let's go here because we have jquery we can use something called get json and get json is going to get all this data for us because this is json this is json file so let's go back there and let's do dollar sign dot get json just like this and then we're gonna do inside here we're gonna do the url coma and then function sorry function just like that all right so we need to include that url here let's go back and get it where is it here it is copy and paste it right there all right so what i'm going to do i'm going to put here inside the function i'm going to put data all the data is going to be inside there so i can do something like console.log data so i'm going to save that and let's go back here so this is my page right now i'm gonna reload my page and here you go we can see all the data the same thing we have here we can see it we have it now available for us on the website everything is here all right cool now that that's working let's go back and here inside the function we're gonna do like let's create the variable of the icon so let's do variable icon and i have a url that they provided for everyone to get the icon so if we go here let's see if they have here on weather so you can see that um there is a icon here and there is like a number in the letter you don't understand how we're going to use this in a minute so they provided a url for that icon so let's see let's open here and let's go back and what was the code is what 11d let's copy and paste it dot png look at this so every single thing is a different thing depending on the weather the icon is going to change and it's going to be this url cool so let's go back to my code let's do oops that's not what i want i want the url which is this and then i'm going to do plus and we need to add um that code which is going to be data dot let's go here let's see so it's data dot weather 0 and then dot icon so it's data dot weather zero and this is because it's an array it's a list you can see that we have oops quit we have um zero one and it's an array so we need to do uh square bracket zero and then dot icon that's it now we're gonna have if we call icon we're gonna have this and then whatever code it is and actually i need to add the png file so the png format so let's go plus sign and dot png now that's gonna work there you go so now let me call the icon and see if it works console.log icon all right let's go back let's reload this page here it is just click on it and that's it we have the icon all right so let's go back here so that's working let's remove console.log we don't need it and now what i'm going to do is i want to add that icon inside this image so let's do dollar sign we can get that the icon class and then we're going to do attribute and then attribute is going to be the source and that source inside that source is going to be the icon which is all this all right cool let's save it let's see that works let's reload the page yay we have here it seems like he's like thunderstorms or something really bad is going on in here which is true like today is a very rainy day so yes um all right cool so we have the icon done so let's do the same thing with the temperature so let's create another variable let's call it temp equals two and it's going to be data dot i think is um weather dot temp yeah i think that's that's what it is and this is gonna give us that number so let's go back make sure make sure that that's true all right um no actually it's main so i have to fix that so it's a main dot temp so let's go back it's not weather is main all right cool now we do the same thing we're gonna go here and this is the dot the class temp but this time we're going to append that data and this was going to be temp let's save that and let's see what happens that's it here we go we have we have the temperature we have the icon the temperature and i think we're missing our whether um text like it's raining or it's not raining it's sunny what it is so let's go back and look let's do that let's do it right here in the middle that way we are like organize so variable we can create something called weather or weather name or i don't know whatever you want equals to data dot weather let's go back and see where it is so weather and then there's the arrays i'm gonna get the first one it's gonna be thunderstorm okay so there is thunderstorms so weather zero dot main we're going to go down here i'm going to do the same thing we're going to get the weather dot append let's append the data and it's going gonna be weather let's save it let's see what happens if it if it works yeah and there we go we have the cloud it says that we have thunderstorm and is 86. now i don't want to show this 0.49 and point 49 i just want to show 86 and there is a trick we can do it right here on the weather not actually on the temperature sorry we can do math dot floor and let's see if that helps whoops sorry is math like this let's go cool now we have only 86 all right so you don't have to do the math floor actually there's some other options um so i'm gonna put a link in the description if you want to play with this but i think that's it we just need to kind of make it a little prettier because right now it looks very very weird so let's go and let's add some css so let's say weather container let's do like a i don't know like a gray background uh let's you know what let's let's align everything to the center and we have the the weather text the one that sets thunderstorm right now let's do font size i'm like 22 pixels you know bigger and let's remove all the margin because i know paragraph have like margin uh we have a temp like the temperature we can do this one i wanted like pretty big so let's do like 60 pixels um same thing margin zero and oops and the font weight i want it to be bold all right let's save that i think that's that's good for now let's reload the page and here it is so you have the icon it says we have thunderstorm and it's 86. so let's see what happens if we change like orlando um to like new york for example let's go there let's go here let's say um you know what let's do something real quick right here so we can do that very easily so let's create a variable called city for example and right now is orlando and right now in the url what we can do is let's remove the name orlando we just close the url there we do plus sign cd plus sign and then we open the url again all right so now this is coming from this variable okay so let's save it let's see if it works yep same thing so now let's change this to like new york let's go there reload the page here it is so new york right now 75 clear seems like it's a beautiful day so that's how you do it um you can go very very complex and and use another api that gets the user specific user locations and then the cd variable will change depending on the location of the person and all that stuff it can get very complicated but this is a very very uh simple way to get started and understand how public api works not only weather but there is a bunch of other apis with other data that you can use in and you can use this you can use it just like this okay so that's it
