all right folks here it is day number 30 of css3 in 30 days if you've made it this far and you've coded a project or learned a little bit about css3 each day for the last 30 days congratulate yourself pat yourself on the back go do something exciting celebrate because this was a big accomplishment for you and i want to congratulate you now with all the sweet talk aside we're going to build one last project it's going to be exciting and let me show you what that looks like right here so here in day number 30 we're going to coat up a realistic looking illustration style css3 coffee cup the markup is really easy four or five divs the rest of it is css3 gradients and colors and shadows and transforms and positioning and all that sort of stuff to create this beauty right here look at that looks like a designer went and illustrated up a coffee cup in like illustrator or photoshop or something like that and we just plopped it on the screen but these are not images whatsoever it's not even an svg graphic this is straight up css three now just to show you what's going on we have the entire coffee cup right here so this circle is one element and we have a bunch of gradients going on to create this shadowed effect this bevel some highlights and then it gets darker as it goes deeper into the cup within here we have the actual coffee or the brew and this ring on the outside is the crema as a coffee snob i guess you could call me i i wanted to include this the crema is when you pull an espresso shot and there is that thick or thin layer of creamy coffee on the top it's this crema is what it is and it's a little bit bitter it's got a lot of flavor and it typically is a sign of a good espresso shot being pulled if you let it settle for a while the crema will settle around the edges revealing the coffee and under it so that is the outer ring of what is remaining of the crema this is a very subtle black to very very dark brown gradient going from top left to bottom right just to give it a little bit more depth because right here we have this ring this this light ring this reflection and that's as if the light were shining from the top right sorry the top left down that's why the coffee is darker here the shadow is being cast by the rim of the coffee cup and it gets a little bit lighter here as the as the light source reflects down into the cup and onto the coffee so there is this ring right here as that reflection giving it depth and a little bit of a gradient so those are the two elements there we have one more element right here and it's just simply a handle just to hold your coffee so let's jump into our code editor and see how simple or maybe difficult it is to come up with this sort of css3 all right over here in my code editor we have day number 30 css3 coffee go ahead and download that and fire it up in your code editor of choice we have the index sandbox and final of course final is there for your reference if you have any problems and you want to refer to something it should be down in there and sandbox at css is where you're going to code things up index is our basic html file this is the markup we're going to be using that is all the markup it takes to give us the base to build our css3 illustration style coffee cup so we have the coffee wrapping everything that div and then we have a div with a class of handle i did with the class of coffee cup and it did with the class of brew pretty selfexplanatory over in our sandbox let's get started first thing we're going to do is we're going to select the class of coffee and we're just going to give it position relative because we're going to be doing some absolute positioning within this now we're going to select the handle and let's just start off simple the handle is really easy to code and we just want to get that one out of the way so let's start off with a linear gradient well actually no let's start off with position absolute and we're going to go width 127 pixels height 50 pixels i've done these measurements before so i'm not just coming up with them off the top of my head and we're going to give it a border radius of 50 pixels so it's a bit rounded on the outside edge and then what we're gonna do is give it a box shadow of five pixels zero one pixel zero and then rgba we're gonna go 200 200 200 and then zero point eight just to give it a little bit of a subtle shadow on the far right uh hand side so this is five pixels on the xaxis so it's gonna go over five pixels zero on the y one pixel blur and then zero for the spread okay save that and let's see what we've got okay so we have a shape here but we have no i could just say uh maybe i give it a background white so you can see it so there we go we have the shape but we need that gradient to give it that uh kind of realistic style so this is where we're gonna go background image linear gradient and bear with me here we're gonna go 180 degrees that's the angle at which you want the the gradient to go and this is where we're going to add some values okay so we're going to say rgb this is going to be 200 200 200 and then at the five percent color stop we're gonna add another rgb here and this one is going to be 255 255 255 and that's at the 50 color stop now if i just stop there let's uh see what happens so we're gonna have a little bit of a dark up here it's gonna get lighter to this white right here 255 is white 200 is just a like kind of a light gray and then now we're going to keep going let's go down below this and we're going to say rgb we're going to add another 200 200 200 and that's going to be at the 95 color stop leave it at that that should give us oh sorry rgb not rgba save that leave it at that there we go we've got our shape now it's going to be over at the right side we'll worry about that once we get to that part so let's carry on now that we've got the handle complete let's style up the actual coffee cup so we're going to say coffee dash cup and we're going to say position relative we're going to go width it's going to be 462 pixels and the height will be the same 462 pixels we're going to give it a border radius of 50 so it gives us that perfect circle we're going to go z index 3 so it's above the handle and anything below the z index of three and now we're gonna give it a box shadow of 10 pixels 35 pixels 30 pixels 7 pixels and rgba i'll show you what this looks like in a sec it's going to be well it could be 50 but to be specific 49 49 49 that's the color i decided in photoshop okay save that okay so you see the outline here and then the shadow it's casting so you see that the that's the light source it's coming from that sort of angle so that's what we want to go for right there and now this is the fun part this is where we create a radial gradient this is going to be a fun one we're going to have to create the shadows and the outlines of the porcelain cup itself and then the the crema the ring the ring of crema is what we're going to be creating here all in one background image all right radial gradient first thing is going to be 50 and 50 that is basically center center we want the gradient to come from the center outwards is what we're doing here comma we're going to go down to the next line only for readability purposes here and we're going to say rgb it's going to be 14 7 and zero this color is going to be at the 65 color stop so 65 from the center towards the edge all right and let's add another line here rgb and that's going to be 185 144 and 18 and that is going to be at the 75 color stop let's see what this gives us okay so now you can start to see what's going on so we added our first color stop at 65 and it's uh near black it's kind of a dark dark brown this rgb color right here at the 65 color stop and then at 75 percent we're going to transition into this color which is that golden crema color so over here from the center and this is the full circle here so 65 percent of the way in so right there we got that dark brown and then from at the 75 color stop right here we have this golden color so in between is the transition so that's how that works now let's keep going because we do have more to add okay the next line is rgb and this color will be 129 129 and then also at the 75 color stop so it's going to be a hard line let's see what that gives us okay so now we're it's going to cut off right here at the 75 percent color stop hard because it's right at this there's no transition like this one from this color to this color it just stops right at the same spot so this is a gray and we're going to actually transition that into a white now so let's go back and we're going to say rgb and this one will be 255 255 255 which is just white and that's at the 95 color stop so that's going to transition let's see what that gives us okay now you can start to see how this is starting to take shape into a cup so now what i want to do for the last color at the 100 mark is just fade it back down a little bit to gray so it has that bevel i don't have a coffee cup on me but the the light source will also cast a shadow around the outside just to make it look like it's rounding back down on the outside of the porcelain cup or whatever material coffee cups are made of so one more here we're going to say rgb and that will be 161 and 161 at the 100 color stop and then just finish it off there like that and now you could see that it rounds it back out at the outside so now it's giving us that nice shape all right and now what we're going to do i think that's all for the coffee cup and the that base layer of coffee with the crema now what we want to do is actually have the brew so we have over here we're gonna say brew and this is the coffee itself it's gonna be really simple we're just gonna make it uh look a little bit more have a little bit more depth we're gonna give that coffee an actual gradient so this element is gonna be position absolute as well we're gonna say width is 316 pixels by the same in height the z index will be four we're going to say box shadow is five pixels on the x five pixels on the y zero is blur and zero is spread rgba this is 252 by 232 by 185 and 0.5 as in the alpha channel so save this i'm not sure you'll see it anywhere yet here it is so you can see just a square so this is going to give us that this is going to be that outline that um well you can see down here this outline it's going to be this but because it's a it's a rectangle we need to round that out so that's going to be quite simple all we need to do is say border radius and that's going to be 50 save that that will round it out you'll see it here and somewhere down where it shouldn't be so we're going to position that in the correct spot so let's say top 50 percent and then left well it's going to be about 70 pixels in save that okay so something is going on here uh okay so 50 i went 50 down so this is the element itself i went 50 down for that element which is here so the top of the top left of it will be somewhere around here okay so that means i'm going to actually use the transform property we did this a few times in this course we're going to do the translate y and just say negative 50 relative to that top position and it's going to bring it up 50 percent uh and match it perfectly in the spot where we want it to be like that now i'm looking at it here it's a little bit different than this one and okay i think what we're going to do now this might change a bit now once we add a color so i'm going to actually add a gradient in here so let's go and say background image we're going to do a linear gradient and this is going to look like this we're going to go 140 degrees so that angle top like top left to bottom right ish and now we're going to go like this we're going to say rgb this is going to be 0 0 0 and that's just flat black at the zero percent color stop we're going to add another line here rgb this is going to be 52 26 and zero be pretty dark it's that brown at the 100 color stop very very simple save it and there we go that's more like it so the problem was we didn't have a background image so if i were to remove this style altogether and then check out our crema it doesn't line up properly and that's because our circle wasn't filling out this area so if i put the background image back it actually cleans it up quite nice that's exactly what i'm looking for beautiful all right and one last thing is just put this handle back we need to put that handle back where it belongs and then we are done with our css3 coffee cup i hate to see it we are then after that we're done with the course but let's not talk about that right now i'm going to cry sounded a little bit like peter griffin peter griffin that was a pretty bad impression actually okay so now what we're going to do is put the handle in its correct position and that's going to be simple let's just say top 50 percent and write 40 pixels in from the right save that okay so it's a little bit too low because the top of this is at the fifth at fifty percent of its parents so we're actually going to bring that up to the perfect center and that's going to be using the transform translate y negative 50 percent and save that it's going to center it perfectly that looks amazing let's compare it to the final identical looking absolutely fantastic wow congratulations everybody on completing css3 in 30 days you just did 30 days of css3 building projects learning more about css3 and in general just leveling up your frontend web developer game congrats on that i loved that you hung out with me for this past month i hope you're not too sick of me because i certainly hope that this is just the beginning of our journey together if you found any value in this course share it with a friend share it with a family member heck share it with your grandmother or your dad it doesn't matter anyone you feel would get value from this course send them this way and let's see if we can't make a web developer out of them too again thank you so much you're the best have a great day and i will hopefully see you in another course on the flip side and as always happy coding bye now pete griffin peter griffin peter lucky there's a family guy lucky there's a man who positively can who laugh and cry he's a family guy [Laughter] all right i'm a crazy person
