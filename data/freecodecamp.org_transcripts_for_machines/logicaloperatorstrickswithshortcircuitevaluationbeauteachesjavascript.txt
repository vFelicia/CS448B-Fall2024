i'm going to be talking about logical operators and short circuit evaluation and then some cool tricks you can do with short circuit evaluation so first of all this is the logical and two ampersand signs and this is the logical or to pipe characters so if you have something like this nested if statement if num is more than 5 and then if num is less than 10 we're gonna console.log unicycle we can actually just use the logical and instead of this nested if statement so let's see that i'm going to get rid of this and this is going to give the same result if num is more than 5 and num is less than 10 console.log unicycles so just if the number is between 5 and 10 we can also replace this with the or sign or now it's if num is more than 5 or num is less than 10. so either of those things could be true to pre console.log unicycle and all numbers meet this criteria so we'll always have a unicycle you can never have too many unicycles okay now let's talk about short circuit evaluation short circuit evaluation happens when conditionals use and or or it means that the second argument is evaluated only if the first argument is not enough to determine the value of the expression when the first argument of the and function evaluates to false the overall value must be false so it doesn't have to evaluate the second argument when the first argument of the or function evaluates to true the overall value must be true so it doesn't evaluate the second argument for instance so it evaluated the first one 4 is more than 5 but it didn't even evaluate the second one once it found out that this was false it didn't need to even evaluate the second part of the conditional so that's short circuit evaluation it just skips that part completely you can actually use this for some interesting things in javascript for instance let me set something up for you i pasted this code in here so we're going to set test to true and then we're going to create a function is true function console.log this is true var is false is the function console.log this is false so it says if test is true well test is true so it's going to run that function so if test is true it runs the function so if we run that yep it's going to say test is true but there's a way this is the slow way to do it or the the more worried a way to do it with short circuit evaluation there's actually a better way to do it that's a little a little better let me show you so in this short circuit evaluation we just put test and and is true so if this is true it's going to run the next one if the first argument is true it automatically goes to the next argument which can be a function so if test is not true it won't run this function so let me comment this out i'm going to run that again but it's still going to say this is true in the console because of this so we could we made this whole if statement into one line without even using the word if just because of short circuit evaluation let me show you how you would do that with the or operator okay here's the code i just put in here test equals false if not test if test is false then run is false so if we run that we can see yep at the bottom says test is false however the short circuit way of doing it is like this you're going to put test or is false so if this is true it's not even going to bother going to this because it's the or operator and we're testing this or this but if this is false then it is going to go to the function over here so if we run that and you can see test is false test is false it had the first test falls from here and then the second test is false from there okay another way that short circuit evaluation can be used is to set a default value for a function argument look at this function function the same old foo and you're going to put in a name here so the name is going to equal name or the name is going to equal bar that basically means if you don't pass in a name there won't be anything to assign to name so this will this will be false and if this is false it's going to go to the next argument which is bar if it's true it's going to assign that to name so by putting or the two lines like that which means or and putting bar here you're setting a default value so let's run that and see what happens and you can see my best friend's name is bar my best friend's name is bo so first it used the default and then it uses what we assigned assigned here so those are just a few things that you can do with short circuit evaluation well thanks for watching my name is beau carnes don't forget to subscribe and remember use your code for good
