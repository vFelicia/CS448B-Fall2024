everybody welcome to live coding with Jesse today we're gonna keep working on that Salesforce form that's it's got a lot of a different stuff going on so it's in Salesforce but it's built by a company called Target X that was actually customized by a company called Jenzabar and really it was built with a combination of these visualforce apex components and angular so we got a lot going on here but today it's not that complicated because we're basically just doing CSS so we're gonna style this thing with CSS just an update on some of the other projects I have a new issue open in the react bulletin and I know the reactive Resource Center project because the head of my department uses Safari 9.1 on a Mac and the forms don't work so I did a little bit of research on it and some testing and I put some info on that issue so if anybody really likes trying to get older browsers to work with things then have at it otherwise I'm just going to keep working on it this week on our bulletin projects or react bulletin I've merged in two new pool requests so maybe we can go over those a little bit later on during the question and answer session if we have time I do have a meeting at 300 p.m. my time eastern time so that gives us an hour and a half till my meeting I would like to finish up in around an hour if possible to give me time to prep for my meeting but the meetings only about 20 feet away from where I'm sitting right now so it shouldn't take me that long to get there so if we go over at our 15 minutes that's fine too but sebastien and Harsha both submitted amazing pool requests so hopefully we have time to go over those otherwise you can check it out third thing I want to mention before we get started is that October fest is almost over so if you don't know what hack tober fest is let me just put this up briefly so you can check out Oktoberfest digitalocean comm you get a free tshirt if you sign up and then submit for pool requests before October 31st is over so I think you have today and tomorrow so check that out if you haven't already and if you haven't got your 4 and yet like me then check out some of the repos that we've been working on their stores some issues open and if you find something that I missed that needs work feel free to submit a pull request for that as well what I'd like to ask all of you is to let me know if there's something on one of your projects that you'd like for me to work on if there's something let me know either in the live chat or on Twitter or email or whatever social media you like if you can find my phone number you can call leave a message if you want but I just need to know the URL of your repository and what issue you you want me to fix so I've been looking for some good issues to use as my my fourth and final Oktoberfest pull request but I thought earlier today when I was looking through the list I thought you know what I would really much rather work on an issue that that you all need some help with since you all helped me so much with my projects I thought that would be cool so at least I want to give you all first dibs on my last PR and if I don't hear from any of you then I'll probably work on something tomorrow I will not be streaming tomorrow my wife has some testing that she needs to have done for some some health issues in the morning and so I'll be out all morning and I thought I don't really want to get ready and come into for a few hours in the afternoon if I could just work from home unfortunately as some of you already know my internet is not good enough at home to do a decent quality stream so I'll be off tomorrow so for those of you do be cell awaiting celebrating Halloween happy Halloween and I will be back Wednesday most likely unless something happens all right so enough enough with getting all of that out of the way okay not bad I only spent five minutes with the intro here so I've done worse all right so let's check out our Trello board first just to see what we were working on so for now we want to fix those button colors if you remember last week's stream the last stream on on Friday we're working with some weird things that were overriding our styles for our buttons and we tested out a few ways to make our styles override the the other styles that are in there and couldn't figure it out and I had said that I was going to try to look around and see if I could find something in Salesforce I ended up not having time to because the head of my department called me in to check out her computer because she couldn't submit anything through our Resource Center that we had launched last month at some point so I spent the rest of my day here trying to figure out what was wrong and then researching bugs for Safari 9 point I think it's nine point one so anyway I was not able to do what I wanted to do so I'm thinking for this string we may just have to resort to throwing in some importance and later on if I'm digging around in some files and I figure out where I can remove some of the styles that are currently being injected in there somewhere then we can always remove them later but if you'll notice there's two things we need to change just to in case you you weren't with us last week this blue shot this is actually a shadow underneath so we need our shadow to override that and then I do not want this button to transform like that and get shorter and wider other than that the button is not looking too bad so that's what we're going to work on first and then I think we'll probably switch over here to this side nap and we'll get this styled a little bit differently than it is now it's going to fit the university styles and we'll try to make it match as much as possible some of the the other side drawer side knives that we've been doing for our other sites all right so let's get to it let me move my timer somewhere up here let me put it up here now weights far away's I can get from my my face in the corner I won't cover it up like I normally do so I was doing a Pomodoro session before on another project so I'm just gonna restart that now and let's get over here to find our code I want to rearrange this order here there we go okay great so here's our app template we were putting our CSS in a separate file but I've given up on that it just added an extra step to the flow so I could always at some point just copy this style tag over into this file if I think it's useful so let me see I should have watched the last part of the stream on Friday I didn't have time and think about it to remind me of what we were editing I'm I'm pretty sure it wasn't that it would have been button styles which is down here there we go okay so we're already using important on the color let's try let's see alright let me see what's going on here with this transform first of all I want to see how they're doing this so that we can properly override it so which one this is the button correct it's interesting all right so we're gonna move this all the way over so that we can see our dev tools and our our button here okay yeah so that's what we want you want this one let's see what changes interesting all right so let's see trying to see any type of change happening here we could maybe check oops check the computed maybe we'll see it better there okay see nothing there let's yeah interesting okay with hmm I this is kind of odd I would kind of expect to see something changing right let's see and it since you seen so I just heard something beep on my computer I wanted to see what message I was getting do you ever have too many messenger things open at once and you you're not sure which one you're getting a message on that's that's how it is for me right now all right actually I haven't even checked the live chat at all yet let me let me check this and see if anyone has any ideas let me see okay I don't see anything yet also if you're new the way I do things is I wait until this 25 minute timer is up and then I go to the live chat and answer all your questions so please don't feel bad if I don't see or answer your question right away I will answer it on our question answer breaks or at the end of the stream I I stopped coding and I just go through the live chat and answer questions alright let's find out what this this is like the I think I mentioned last week I feel like a detective when I'm searching through some foreign CSS or this potentially could be some JavaScript stuff going on too but just searching through dev tools trying to figure out what's going on and how to how to change it that's that's a lot of what ends up happening when when I'm editing somebody else's stuff yes okay all right it's got to be this one I mean this has all the other styles there we go okay now I'm seeing something different well I don't know how I missed that before but uh here we have some hover some hover styles are those are styles and some of them yeah those are our styles let's see these are the styles that we're trying to override she's gotta be another hover style these are our styles again so the width isn't even you see in dev tools if you see a kind of grayed out a little bit then that's that's not directly getting the width from anything any styles on this particular component transitions it's not taking our borderradius too well let's do what we know we need to do we need to get that borderradius working in particular on this isn't even hover style let's go ahead and put it throw it important on that water radius and and see what else we need we can check let's take this hover off for a second just to see what else is being overwritten these are ours okay we could put important on our box shadow and just what I'm let's actually let's see how this looks now probably auto logged out of this yep I am okay to login login on another screen logs me out it's pretty fast log out for Salesforce I don't know if that's by default or if the admins for for my University set it like that just what we were working on no it wasn't that hmm all right I'm gonna have to go in and find I see it there it is all right so if you haven't seen us working on this the last three three streams this is not an ideal workflow of having to copy and paste things over but since I'm working in Salesforce this is what I have to work with right now I'm not aware of a different way to do it if there were some other way to integrate this better with my normal workflow I definitely would do that and fresh what's whoops forget a sign in here no I don't okay let's let me grab my password from the browser while I'm actually logged into my LastPass sorry about this I should have refreshed everything beforehand and got logged in oh okay not bad we still have that weird thing going on but at least we've taken care of everything else all right we just have to figure this up okay so let's see try turning off padding and hover say all right so we have some ideas here in the live chat about what to do let me read through these okay so John Hanson says some of the styles that are giving you problems may stem from higher up the Dom okay yeah I thought that but I didn't really check that much higher so I will double check that hard says check the padding okay cool I will check that and John says if the buttons inside a flex div its width will get determined by its alignment flex start okay let's let me check the padding first cuz I think that'll be the easiest thing to do since we're already on this component so let me go to computed and just see what padding we have 15 all around and now let's let's hover and let's check out the padding now oh yeah we have a different padding for sure okay cool let's switch it up bill 15 all around no matter what and see if that fixes it yep that looks good okay cool so we should be able to just set our padding hello I see I see what's happening it looks like our padding was being overridden on here but not when we did a hover okay that makes sense because when the the default CSS probably just put padding on the the button styles and then didn't bother putting it on the hover styles which you wouldn't normally do that that makes sense okay so this should fix it let's double check it and then we can move on to the next thing No all right we still have something else going on so it's no longer the padding because you see it's not it's not changing shape so we've solved one thing now is its line hide font size something like that let's see whoops however alright let's see make sure this is actually triggering it yep there we go alright so let's check our hover yeah let's check our computers who we have going on here trans okay so we have a text transform which should be fine because I think we are already doing that text size adjust where are we getting that from that's weird let's actually look to the font look bigger I think it does I think it might be the font size let me go back here and check our font size so we have font weights line Heights and font size that could probably all be okay so we have 14 here and that's not hovered I think hovered I think it was 16 right font 16 yeah alright so it looks like our font size is going from 14 to 16 I would like it to be 16 no matter what so let's add an important ear and this is the same thing that was happening with the padding right so the default styles have font size 14 so that was overriding our 16 but then it's hover state did not have a font size at all so our 16 was actually working so this should now work I thought earlier that the fontsize looked different but it was hard to tell with all the other things changing there we go perfect okay all right so check that out we've got a slight hover effect which I like much better than that what was happening before we're having just a huge change although now that I think about it it may not have had that large change by default we might have inadvertently caused that hover effect to happen by some of the styles that we had applied earlier before we even on this page so I think that that's that was probably the case all right let's get rid of this hover as well while we're here that's a hover we want to get rid of that color and the text decoration I think we already have a hover here yep so let's just put it in portent for these I want to give my disclaimer on using important so you've probably heard this before but just in case you don't normally want to use important if you're writing your own CSS for a project from scratch don't use important right because you have complete control you can just change how you have things set up and either through adding classes or changing the order in your CSS you should you should be able to make things work just through specificity and then keep everything cascading once you had important it breaks the Cascade so it doesn't matter like right now this is just an a right it's not specific at all I mean I guess we have an ahover in here right but somebody can make this super specific and put like HTML body div and it would still be overridden by this because we put important there so you see how it breaks somebody could put inline Styles on a specific a zag and it would still be broken and and overridden by this important so we're only using it in this case because we don't have access or control of much of what's going on in terms of the markup and what's going on in terms of the other styles that are being added to the page in various places so in this case we're stuck with important is one of our last options and that's what it should always be a last option all right I'm not even going to test that because that's very simple it should definitely work now let me check how much time we have okay so it's almost up for that session let's add in that extra Pomodoro session and Mark that is done and let's go inside of let's just go ahead and or next time one we'll do it we'll change the colors and as a part of that we'll probably do these together we're gonna change the indicator colors as well okay I'll be able to pull this over goodness I've got really what um wait how did we get it did we get logged out again it's possible I accidentally hit sign out when I was mousing over it okay let me grab my password again okay all right so we're logged in again and all we need to see now is the sidebar and my sessions almost up so I'm just gonna go ahead and break now do five minutes in the live chat so I'll be starting at the top and just working my way down answering as many questions as I can that's okay horseshit asked if I'd seen PR 54 which by now I've already said it I have seen its merch now Arshad says I saw an inspirational for loop so if if y'all can see this in the live chat will probably make more sense but for age equals 0 a when age is greater than or if age is greater than or equal to life dot length knowledge plus plus that's cool I like that okay so John Hanson says please implement styled components you will save yourself a lot of grief you can use an imported theme as a wrapper and still be able to cleanly style components as standalone components okay yeah and hard shipments and styled components are specific to react yeah so I mean obviously we can't use them with Salesforce but we can start using them on our other react projects okay haha Irish it says that button took a long time to debug yes it did John Hanson says I usually shed it's here if I'm forced to use important yeah it feels a little bit like giving up like oh yeah yeah there's got to be a better way but I just don't want to do it so let's just put important in there yeah I I find myself using important a lot less than I used to today I probably used an important so far in the half hour we've been streaming I've used important more than I've probably used it in the last month or two I it depends on the project though if it's something like this where I have to deal with already existing code I tend to use it a lot more alright all right I think I actually there's not that much in the live chat so I think I've gotten to the bottom of it so that's cool so I shouldn't go over my time here Harshit says she checked NXT shared CEO Diane her was that the one that you built the chat thing yeah okay cool yeah I definitely check that out that is really cool so if you haven't already checked it out harsh I built this really cool chat site and it's NXT share dot Co dot I n so yeah it was really cool I checked that out Friday that's Friday yeah I was really impressed by that all right well since I'm out of stuff on the live chat I may as well start the next next session so yeah let's get started on this so if you ask anything after this point I will get through it after this next session this will be our last code session and then we'll just do all questionandanswer and I got a question in there right at the end says how's the weather today it's a little bit cold and rainy where I'm at it's about 40 degrees it was in the upper 30s this morning but I think it's in the mid 40s now and it's it's rainy so it's appropriate weather for this time of year all right I actually don't mind that 40s or 50s and rain I think it's kind of nice I'm not sure why but boys I've always liked it when it's dark outside and about 50 degrees and slightly raining I don't know if I would say it's my favorite but it's pretty close to it okay I'm just playing around a little bit just to think about what colors I want here we will probably end up going with a lot of white like we normally do now I'm thinking about how far I want to take this now let's let's see first we'll stick with the colors but just to let you know what I'm thinking right now I'm wondering how far could we change this to look like what we normally do I I do kind of like that it has this year that's that that's not bad that's a nice indicator so I don't want to change that but whenever it is actually open I think it might be nicer if it did look closer to what we normally do well we'll see once we get in here and see some of the markup it'll be pretty obvious how difficult it would be to try to make this look exactly like our other side now sir as close as possible oops and actually we forgot to change this color too did was that on another one change I'll change the icon colors as another another to do so I wondered why I didn't didn't do that one all right so let's change the background color first and we'll have to change the font color as well because we won't be able to read anything so let's go up so we get the container div where the color supplied there we go yep that's where the colors applied so let's switch that up all right let's go with white and let's see I'm gonna make this whoops black wanna make that I'm gonna have to go down lower okay well at first we can at least put this background color on target apps next application sidebar this for really change when not expand it yeah we want to put it on that base style so it applies to both forms of the sidebar okay so si bar let's put this below the nav bar and put it right in here and sidebar and okay and then let's see where the colors up being applied color that's weird to share it again oh okay inherit all right and see that's the first time okay on so we're gonna have to do an h1 and then let's go down to the vowels and then a okay h2 why well would you have an h2 inside of an a tag inside of an li anyway I can I kind of see what they're doing here but really it wouldn't it be better to just leave the headers as this and not have them repeated as H tags I gotta check this now because if these aren't H tags then I'm gonna be upset okay at least they are H tags okay so I have enough to do this where we add sidebar okay so let's go target X application sidebar oops and we want to get the H ones and then sidebar h2s and the color let me grab me grab our dark color from somewhere else hmm I don't see it let's just make it I'm always I never want to type out the rgba colors by my myself I just I always want to do it like this I don't know why a father would have been faster in that case you just type it out myself all right now let's put this here and I do want to see what this looks like before we go on okay well some of what we did worked and some did not so we may just have to put important on that and move on let's check it out for a second yeah yeah same same reason it was being overridden with our button styles so oh they're okay we actually need to change the font as well so it's good to know all right so let's add and pour it here and let's go up and grab our font and actually let's try to do it important up here I don't think there's anywhere where we wouldn't want to use this font so John Hanson I just saw your your comment had the little devil emoji with important oh there we go all right yeah it works okay well not for everything so our h1 it did not work that's wait a second displaynone why do we have oh this is weird our button color is now not working all right let's move this button color back to testing and we'll look at that in a little bit but right now this is what we're working on so in each one did we not have text there am i looking at the wrong element maybe I'm looking the wrong thing I am sorry about that I was looking at the wrong place okay and this is not an h1 it's a span so let's change this first of all let's make sure they're not setting the color they are okay but they're setting it on this so we should be fine to put that here and these are yeah let's go ahead and just do both of these now actually we're not gonna you're not gonna want to do them together we want them to be different colors but I'll just copy them copy the classes over okay uh I didn't copy okay let's try this again I'll get the right stuff yeah and let's see let's try to nest this and see if we can override things through nesting well it's not really necessary I'm thinking in sass terms like normally I would nest this is that's not really what you would say and CSS alright so for this we're gonna go with that green color that Franciscan University green and for this one we'll use this same color that we have up here which actually if we're going to do that we should just do it here okay really we're gonna have to use important oh that's why backgroundcolor sector certification backgroundcolor that's why and then for this that's just putting Fortin here I'm not sure how many more videos we'll have on this I I wanted to do enough videos to be able to make a playlist out of this that would be reasonable so we're at four videos for this this may be the last one I may do one more I don't really want to spend a ton of time I haven't really been getting a lot of views for this kind of thing so I just don't think there's that many people that are interested and this kind of stuff I think there's more interest in the react stuff that we've been doing so I'd like to switch back I didn't really want to just stop right in the middle of it I'd like to get it to some point of completion before we stop that's okay not bad I mean color wise it's that we can at least see everything now I really don't know about this this change here I mean I don't I don't mind this crossing to make it an X but I don't really like this size change so I think I want to get rid of that so let me add that as another to do that falls outside of our scope of changing colors is it a hover effect as an AFF ECT or a hover effect like EF Fe CT I can never remember I always ask my wife because she's an English teacher and she actually teaches English at the college that I work at and she always knows okay and we've changed the colors for the side nav I guess the one thing we could change the colors of these dividers do we want actually a masseuse do we even want to have those dividers there anymore is that necessary we don't normally do dividers between every menu item do we like let's check we don't want to hear no we don't we have them between different you know categories of not in this sense but like different sections of our menu but this isn't necessarily a different section these these all play the same role you know for now I'm not gonna do anything with them what I probably wouldn't add is you know this this hover behind let's do that let's let's add a hover behind now this is where it might get a little weird are we even going to be able to do that same hover because you know where did where is this extent oh actually we need a we need a shadow on this as well this looks really weird so we need a shadow and we can we can definitely shorten this there's no reason that it has to be that long so let's add these and we're going to okay and let me we want to change this color there we go I like that better and yeah let me we do have shadows on here correct no we don't we know we don't have a shadow let's let's find one where we we bring that out so okay all right so maybe we don't have a shadow normally but it just graze everything out so we have this overlay but in this case we don't really want the overlay right because you can I don't know it does automatically close okay well then we probably should add an overlay this will do what will either hover or overlay I don't want to do the border because you can see we really only do the border if we have it fixed let's let's shrink this up don't see what we actually have on yeah we don't have the border or at least it's not obvious but that there is a border there yeah so let's let's keep stick with that and so that's what we'll do so we'll either do an overlay or a shadow actually you know what we're gonna add a shadow' no matter what because when it's no I'm gonna do that hey we got back to that screen I don't know if you remember but I think of the first day we worked on this we got to this screen and it looked terrible and I didn't I couldn't figure out how to get back to it okay that's cool well now we know how to get back to it I just have to hit this button okay so we'll need something here maybe here this would be a good place to have a border I may have to think about this so we're gonna add maybe add the shadow here I'll just add some notes maybe an overlay we're closed okay all right so I have to mess around with a couple of these couple options that we have here and that's about it for this so let's um let's see colors yeah so we've we've changed the colors I think we're safe to mark that off where we don't really need to do anything else with colors for the side now and yep all right not bad so we only got two to do stun but we came in well with the exception in this one where it took twice as long as we thought the colors were right on target in terms of time so not bad I may have to just end up by default putting important on everything because it seems like no matter how much I try to not have to use important I have to use it on almost every element so our new strategy might just be use important oh man and I just got a message on slack that there is food in the kitchen free food so I definitely have to end this before my meeting so that I can stop in and get free food I have one of my coworkers always lets me know if there's free food so I joke with her and say that's actually in a job description that she has to do that but I appreciate it she knows how much I enjoy free food that's kind of pretty much the the one benefit I can see the coming into work instead of working from home that I would miss it's getting the free food that is frequently here at work okay let me scroll up and now at this point I'm gonna do Question and Answer so if you have any questions please put them in the live chat now even if you don't have a question appreciate it if you if you can if you'd stick around and help answer some of the questions because I certainly don't have all the answers to everything and I appreciate having different opinions on things as well but if you got to take off thanks for watching I should be back on Wednesday and I will not be back tomorrow but if you need to send me a message or something on social media or whatever I'll I'll be online I'll just be working from home okay let's trying to find where I left off okay sciences go bucs yeah oh okay harsh it says will you be running post CSS autoprefixer at the end of your CSS that's a great idea I actually I really like to run that but normally I have it set up to run automatically and in this case we don't have any type of build tools running so I probably would have forgot about that if you hadn't mentioned it so thank you so let's autoprefixer awesome thank you Harshit that is a wonderful idea okay John says I think most builds include post CSS though when you do dev tools in the browser much of what is added gets crossed out anyhow yeah let's see Anna says what's the hardest you've ever worth I think maybe I'll give two answers from that one will be code related and one non code related so I worked well actually some of you all may remember when it was right around the time to launch the catechetical Institute website which was project one that we worked on I worked some crazy hours for at least the last two weeks of that project I worked almost double my normal amount of hours so we're talking like 70 to 80 hours a week that was pretty crazy I think I worked for like 14 hours one day that was wild I think I streamed for five hours one day I think I streamed and then took a break and it streamed again so that was pretty crazy I have done I've done like and where I've worked pretty much all day and then as late as I could stay up at night went to sleep for couple hours woke up again and started working on a project so in terms of code that's the hardest just trying to put out as much code as I possibly can and stay up as late as I can but in terms of in general how what's the hardest I've ever worked I don't know I've had some jobs that were that were tough physically I used to work for for a city in West Virginia called Weirton so I worked for the city of Wooten which that's the city I grew up in and I did that for about six years but it was on it was seasonal so I didn't always they didn't have enough for me to do during the wintertime usually but that job was a lot of like eight hours a day pushing a lawn mower doing maintenance work generally like lifting things working on whatever needed fixed whatever needed cleaned so like that was somewhat physically demanding is like you're just on your feet every day that matter how hot it is how cold it is like you're working so but I was young I mean this was when I was a teenager and so it it wasn't that bad then I think back to it now I think man I'd be sore if I tried to do that now that was tough and I'll tell you what I used to be a manager an assistant manager at a Burger King restaurant it's a fastfood restaurant that was really tough because that would work these shifts and sometimes I'd work ten hours straight and we'd be so busy that I just couldn't stop like I literally could not take a minute break because we always had people in there and we are always understaffed so I couldn't just manage it was like you're making sandwiches you got a headset on you're taking orders you're running the cash register all at the same time that you're trying to make sure everybody else was doing their job that was wild that was just like exhausting and you work a shift like that and close up and like on the weekend you'd close up at 200 a.m. during the week you close up at midnight and then if you work the next shift the next stiff shift started at 400 a.m. so you couldn't get full amount of sleep so anyway I'm sure y'all don't care about how to manage a fastfood restaurant but that was that was really wild just in terms of like working that much without a break all right let's see how cool John Hanson said time for dictionary.com to see how that affects or affects things okay John says the the hover behind sounds good so we're talking about on a hover behind these items I'd also add a shadow' to help define its needed for the Seidman yeah it's definitely needed now that it's the same color I mean I could see why they didn't have it before it wasn't exactly necessary the shadow could just show when the side I was out yeah that's true I mean really I guess when you think about like in terms of material design of everything's on like a different level the side nav is actually on a higher level unless I'm remembering this wrong the side nav is on a higher level than the the paper like the you know the normal level so be like Niazi zero right if we're thinking zindex so it would make sense that there would be a shadow no matter what since since we have the partially open state and the open fully open state we don't really have a closed state so if there should be a shadow yeah okay we have this sub I guess we can keep this sub header here I'm not a huge fan because you all know I don't really like thick headers and this makes it really thick but yeah I mean this side nav realistically should probably be at the same level I'm gonna have to doublecheck the material design Docs to make sure that the app bar which is what this is called in the in the docs and the side drawer I think it's called side drawer are supposed to be at the same level of the zindex level so I shouldn't say see index I don't want you to get confused with CSSA index I mean that the Z height level surface was XYZ coordinates right we have our x and y coordinate is it is X this way yeah I think X Y trying to remember back to high school math class and then your Z coordinate would be like depth right or height however you want to think about it so that's what I'm talking about oh cool innocence thanks for the stream you're welcome thank you so much for watching and for asking questions in the in the live chat I appreciate it alright John Hansen says react equals mystery I figured how this array dot fine and change state to the array but to use the new array as a parameter and then using this state state dot arrayed key value is confusing that sounds confusing reading it I probably I'd have to think about that you see the code to understand really understand that there are some weird confusing things about react I really like react but I've definitely been confused at times and thought what why isn't this working so usually whenever it finally works it makes sense why it works and why it didn't work the other way but getting to that point of realizing what the right way to do it is is can be a challenge sometimes luckily I have you all to let me know and it usually doesn't take that long when when you're watching to let me know what the right way is but it can definitely take a while sometimes let's see Rohini says hello from India hey how's it going thanks for watching from India I know it's late what is it well 45 right in the morning right now or at night however you want to think about it John answer says it works and it is logical to react but Wow yeah yeah that's what what is this angle I seen this on different social media but it's stuff like react makes complicated things simple and simple things complicated some something like that yeah but that's I would agree with that statement right there's just there's some things that I used to do with jQuery you know back when back a year ago when I used to be into jQuery I don't wanna don't to make it sound like it's been that long time but you do so much a query it would be the simplest thing in the world just so easy and then with react it's like how can I do this exact same thing and it seems so much more complex but some things are really easy with reactant and I remember that them being just super difficult with jQuery and I just had all the spaghetti code when I tried to do it so for me at least the the transition from jQuery based stuff to react stuff has had more benefits than drawbacks it definitely took me longer to build the same fun action ality when I first started but I think now I'm at the level where I faster with reacts not only that but everything's more reliable with react and I think it's a heck of a lot easier to other people for other people to read the code and contribute to it I still like dread going back to some of my old applications that I built with with jQuery so like we've read on it like the Resource Center that we redid in react I'm so glad that I never have to go back to the original and look at it again I didn't delete the code it's it's still on git and github as a private room faucet honey I'll probably never make it public but anyway and then now the bulletin that we're working on when that finally launches then the I won't have to look back at the other code and that will the jQuery version will also remain a Friday treat actually I don't really care if you all would look at that if you really wanted to I make it public but the only thing I'm worried about is making sure I don't have any any keys or anything that I shouldn't have in there because since it was a private repo I never bothered removing any keys so I'd have to double check on that okay John says it sounds LOL sounds like my thoughts on jquery yes it's a different hat one has to wear even from JavaScript yeah for sure alright John says love to see it alright cool I'll have to yeah I'll see about making it public I'm pretty sure the Resource Center one I can make public I think the only like keys that I had was the I was storing data in Google sheets so I had like the URL to store things in a Google sheet but I'm no longer using those sheets so I can just shut it off so that you can't use that anymore and that that should be fine the the bullets in one we'll see yeah aha I may have to do some things before I can make the bullets in one public we may have to may I be after I launch the newer version of it the react version but I'm pretty sure I could also make that public as well so so you can see it it might off to doublecheck everything but I'm pretty sure I will be able to make in public all right almost to the bottom of the live shot here Blake says I'm working on like three projects what do I do I want to do them all at the same time well I'm kind of in the same situation right now so I have this project we're still working on the bulletin and I'm trying to sort out some bugs on the Resource Center I just finished up that react native projects for the Udacity nano degree which I'm still going to make that video for the nanodegree I have not forgotten about that so yeah so anyway when I have lots of projects to do I make sure that I take notes so I don't get confused and I do i do Trello boards and I make sure I write down notes on the cards so I can jump back and forth I have a lot more windows open on my on my computer when it's like that but it's definitely doable it also helps if the projects are somewhat related then it's nice because you can use what you learn on one project on the other project it's kind of like like when I was in college it was nice when I took classes that overlapped in content so that you've already learned it in one class and then maybe a few weeks later you're tested on it in another class and so it's like you don't really have to spend as much work because because you took the classes at the same time you're learning the same material and it cuts down on the amount of time you have to study projects are the same if you can do similar projects at the same time you can just recycle code from one project to another and complete both of the projects faster than it would take you if you only did one so it can work it can definitely be more beneficial to work on multiple things at once it just depends on what projects they are oh cool so Rohini says visiting this channel after three months dude super cool series of tutorials from free code camp excellent job guys mission target frontend JavaScript and design Jessie will watch all your tutorials ah that's that's awesome that's really awesome I'm glad you glad you like it I think we've come a long way in the last in the last three months I think I certainly have come a long way with with all of your help in my understanding of react and I think maybe it like into my skills as a live streamer I don't know you all let me know but I feel like I'm able to better balance questions in code now for a while there I would get off track way too easily and I feel sorry for everybody that was watching those earlier streams but I think we got a decent system now and it seems seems to be working I get less complaints that I talk too much now I use I used to get comments on the videos and in the live chat like stop talking more code which I thought was funny and I agreed with okay and after saying that it really is time for me to stop talking because I have six minutes before my meeting starts so let me hurry up and see the last few things that were in here to see Jessie please upload previous tutorials on github trying to think I think everything that we've done in the videos is on github so some of the stuff that I'll upload stuff that I've done but I haven't done videos on it so you can certainly check it out and ask me questions about it if you want but some of my earlier stuff will be better examples of what not to do and what to do because we've since you know learn better ways to do it or at least I've learned better ways to do it so but I still will put them up there as well I'm not I'm not embarrassed by it because it's my old work everybody has their old work that they can improve one so let's see all right so thank you so much for joining me I'll be back like I said Wednesday not tomorrow so have a happy Halloween tomorrow and also let me know if anybody has any issues on github or once we do submit a pull request let me know because I need to submit one before the end of the day tomorrow so I'd love to help one of you all out instead of just finding some random repo somewhere so send me a message somewhere on Twitter or something and I'm happy to help all right cool I thanks John John says take care hope all goes well tomorrow thank you I do too hopefully if any of you are the praying type please play for my wife she's having a lot of a lot of health issues and we're trying to figure out what's wrong so hopefully we'll have some answers tomorrow it's my my button to stop the stream okay have a great day I'll be back on Wednesday
