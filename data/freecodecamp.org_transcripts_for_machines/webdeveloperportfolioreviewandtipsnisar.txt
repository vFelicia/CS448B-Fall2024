hey guys benjamin's back here thanks for tuning in uh so i'm just doing a quick portfolio review for uh nasir i believe is how you pronounce it i'm gonna do just the desktop and the mobile version of it uh just give my first impressions on the overall responsiveness some of the animations the font the layout etc etc um i think i'm also going to go ahead and reviews his social media presence as well just as a little added bonus um you know hopefully he appreciates that uh but yeah he had reached out to me on twitter i introduced him to the uh codecareer.org discord community which you can just get to by going to codecareer.org discord and uh in there he got some decent feedback from one of our admins alex and he'll also be getting a little bit of feedback from me so anyway without further ado let's go to dive in so at first right off the bat he has a nice introduction says hi i'm the seer uh let's see okay dig that um i love performance as much as expert and i try to be my best to create ux rich performance websites and web apps okay um i suppose the only thing i see here is if um if you're gonna if nasir is going to do um you know capital case where like each letter um of each word is capitalized then i would ideally apply that rule to anything that's four letters or more so it would capitalize much and capitalize create personally though i think i would prefer in on my own website just to have everything uh you know a standard case so you just have like the eyes capitalized and then all of the other letters under here are lowercase i feel like that adds a better contrast between the header here and then the the subheader or description because this is quite a bit of text i would kind of regard it as a description um so i just kind of like to see that contrast personally but um overall good cool and it looks like you have a nice nifty animation here when you go ahead and hover over that dig that and it looks like it comes as a popup all right i like the popup the font is nice the overall layout here is great i like the separation of colors dig that animation that's good uh let's see grab my cv find out more about me all right just take a quick look at this okay cool uh okay going back um one thing i might recommend is keep well that's excuse me on second thought i do actually like the color difference of the footer here and the the button because it does cause the button to stay up or stand out i was initially going to recommend keeping these the same color but i like what you did there um i think the one thing i would recommend is maybe changing this font playing with it just a little bit maybe making it a little bit brighter you know a little bit more of like a whitish color just to make your key details stand out but at the same time i also understand that you want your core focus to be the user clicking on the download button so i don't know i think there's there's a balance there and you did strike the balance pretty well um yeah i suppose whichever way you're leaning like if you if you want to make that information more apparent then i would make it a brighter color if you want to make it a little bit less distracting and really focus in on the download button then it would make the font there uh down here a little bit smaller maybe keep it the same color you know just then that way it's not as predominant it's not pulling as much attention away from the download button excuse me if that's the key focus that you want to have but overall dig it alright so let's close that out now this is a nice large out excuse me a nice large chunk of text can't speak tonight um personally i kind of like to break things up a little bit so if you have like say three maybe four sentences um i would break that up into separate paragraphs or personally i'm a fan of one to two sentences per paragraph uh just because for readability people love to kind of skim things and it just it makes it easier on the eye uh you know there's much less reader fatigue but overall looks good um i think again on this it would follow the you know a very similar uh capitalized case as your description or subheader here you know try to keep this capital case so each letter of a larger word is capitalized and then keep this lowercase with the exception of the start of every sentence um yeah because it's just it looks really weird to the eye um to the eye to see uh you know like you looking web developer capitalized but then there's uh like this is lowercase that's lowercase that's lowercase um but then it comes back to these being uppercase um just looks a little strange at first glance so that's one thing i think i would address um again love the animation though let me go ahead and click that cool and that brings you right to twitter alright and your skill set again probably the same feedback in terms of uh you know breaking this out making it look a little bit more readable um one to two sentences per paragraph again same thing with the text um you know staying consistent with the the capital case uh setup that you have or lowercase setup um another thing you could do i do actually like the overall readability of this like just peppering in or or putting in your skill sets in in text i like that i like the the dotting that you use for the underlining maybe though i would write like a paragraph or so about your skills like right here and then kind of like list some of your skills so like one to you know like um under that so i have like a skill here and a skill here and just kind of break it up so that they're like separate you know words um and you know maybe even add a an icon to some of these skills like css sas babel redux reacts those all have their own uh logos and icons for those but um yeah overall looks good let's take a look at your work okay so that just scrolls down to there at the bottom okay i'm just gonna scroll back up to the about me um yeah same thing i recommended with previous text see now this this looks okay to the eye because uh you know this is a couple of sentences i think that looks decent and it looks like you were consistent about the um the capitalization on this as well so this you have as capital case unless you have this lower case that looks good um front end to back ends cool like the graphics uh would probably try to rewrite this a little bit just to make it a little bit shorter try to bring it down to maybe this much text same thing with this keep them relatively the same consistent length and i like that you write their skewb center rely on a lot of your text but i personally feel like you would best benefit from just having this as the center aligns to make it kind of stylistic and draw the eye down to the hire me button but then when it comes to to this text i would probably make it left aligned just so that it's easier to read same thing with skill set about me um and probably these blocks of code here maybe i would leave this uh center aligns just again because it's kind of a stylistic um you know like starting point but yeah that's just kind of personal preference uh let's see then you also have my work cool click on both of those um okay and the sections will work in progress so i'm not gonna um you know really dig too deeply into that i imagine you're probably going to have like a couple of uh twitter like cards or you know like a couple of blocks here for your different projects so that's cool um okay and these are a couple of projects that you just created that i'm checking out um okay so yeah i imagine you'd probably use something like that down here i love this really nice drop shadow on these items and same thing with this okay so you develop some some decent uis and overall your user experience is really good biggest thing honestly that i can see is just the the text throughout other than that it's a great portfolio good use of color good use fonts and good use of color contrast and overall layout all right so let's bring this up okay and i think this is just a a one pager so it's just going to bring you to each section i love that animation by the way okay that just brings that up and of course we have contact cool i'm gonna just go ahead and hit f12 on my keyboard ensure that this is set to uh iphone and just scroll back up to the top cool and it looks like it is a mobile first design um yep everything looks consistent here uh you probably did mobile first so i can see why you would want to center align that um but i would probably still go with left aligned on that uh now skill set this is definitely where it would come i think in handy to have like i said one of the two sentences and then kind of separate out some of your skills into icons or something of that nature just so it's not like a huge wall of text i know on desktop not only desktop but on mobile when i'm scrolling through things i don't want to have to read a giant wall of text uh same thing with that but again overall great job um cool well hey nice job man i uh really appreciate you sharing this portfolio with me i'm just going to go ahead and hit f12 again and to add a little bit more value to you because this is only running at about 12 minutes it's going to bring up a couple of your social profiles probably won't uh take a look at facebook just because i don't have a facebook account uh come on twitter cool looks like you're doing uh you know decent social social engagement you're posting things that are you know good saying so that's a great way to market yourself um i think for these one thing that i would do though is look for relevant hashtags that you can start using because that's really going to help you get additional exposure exposure excuse me for each one of these so see for example you you paste or excuse me post something like this on a monday i believe the 31st was on monday let me see yep excuse me so you could do something like motivation monday on that or um let's see today was wednesday so you could do like a wednesday wisdom on some of these other posts in addition to you know a bunch of other things like maybe quotes hashtag quote or what have you and um that'll help get you a little bit more exposure on twitter you typically want to strike a balance between the amount of hashtags and the the overall the size the content that you have but since these are images you can pretty much get away with using i would say close to 10 hashtags and it wouldn't really look too spammy just because the content is large again if you were just doing pretty much plain text without an image or you know doing like a video that only has like a little display link on it and then you would want to kind of shorten the amount of hashtags you use to uh something more conservative i would say like four maybe five just as a rule of thumb but uh yeah overall looks like you're retweeting people engaging and this is just kind of a surface level analysis but um yeah so far it looks pretty good so let me go ahead and pop over to your linkedin okay um would definitely recommend connecting with more people um i would definitely recommend using a personalized photo um and not listing unemployed um maybe a list uh freelancer or apprentice or something of that nature just showing that you're making progress um on whatever you're interested in in pursuing um now in terms of you know like selftaught um again i would probably elaborate on that you know if you've done things like free code camp or codecademy go ahead and list those they actually do have those as educational institutions on linkedin um and now perhaps i'm not being i'm not able to see your whole profile uh just because of some of the settings that you have because we're not connected on linkedin so that is a possibility as well um but yeah i would definitely recommend if you haven't done it to again set those institutions um maybe put in some volunteer work uh put in some other projects that you've worked on uh perhaps start writing some blog posts or articles that you can include in here and also include uh you know what you've been working on uh because you would mention that you're doing full stack rails and react um which is fantastic i mean if you've been doing that then definitely include some projects and uh some of those additional tools that i saw on your portfolio site in here um while linkedin isn't the best to land a job directly with someone it is fantastic to connect you with recruiters you know that's typically how i would say i probably get uh maybe a fifth of my job requests it's just through linkedin you know technical recruiters through linkedin so just a consideration but not something you have to focus on but um yeah i just want to say it was a pleasure thanks again for sharing your portfolio with me i'm excited to have the opportunity and um if you're watching and you like this video and you'd like a portfolio or resume review please feel free to check out the link in the description would be happy to provide that to you for free with the little uh caveat of uh you know i'm able to post it on my youtube channel i'm able to repost it on free code camp and other code instructional youtube channels as well just so i can provide more value to people but i also do have a private option if you want to go ahead and do that i can do it privately for you however i do charge for that well once again this is benjamin's back just want to say thanks for watching and hopefully i'll see you in another video
