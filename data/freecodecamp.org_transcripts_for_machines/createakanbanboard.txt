what does a developer do daytoday well one thing i think you need to learn about is a compound board i discussed them in my previous two videos but we're finally gonna get into the details stay tuned for more up okay so i do start my day by checking my emails in slack but if those two things do not reveal any pertinent pressing issues then i go straight to the kanban board a kanban board is a workflow visualization tool it helps you see the flow of where the application is at the current moment so i did not get permission to show you my works con my board but i do have two tools that i want to share with you to help you create your own kanban board with user stories for your personal projects or to help you get started and learn about kanban boards before your first job so we're going to create a kanban board for sniffs and wolves an application for dogs to meet other dogs in their city now for the first tool i want to show you is trello trello can be used for your everyday life to help you organize different todo lists and tasks that you have or it can be used for a kanban board to help you organize your own application now the syntax for combat board is simple and at its basics is just a todo list you do to do doing and done and those are your columns that are going to house your user stories okay so a common board is like a big todo list it helps you visualize that workflow and takes a user story from beginning to completed so we're going to create a kanban board of our own we're going to create it for sniffs and wolves oops i want it to be public so that somebody else can join and we're just going to do the basis of bases that you need for any kanban board and that is to do doing and done that's it simple right so then we're going to add user stories but for the sake of this example i'm just going to do something like epics so maybe you want to have somebody design the homepage you want to create that homepage maybe you want to have sign up or sign in page and then from our last video we talked about having a profile page all right so those are your user stories now in trello i know that you can share with other users the share tab is here and that helps you collaborate with other people so say i had other users and maybe amanda was my designer and she decided to design the homepage she would move that car to the doing lane because she is officially working on that user story and maybe i'm the developer and i'm going to go ahead and create that home page you do not need to have the designs to create the initial homepage you just want to have like the initial text and maybe the links that actually go to different places so we're working on those say two weeks or so goes by and um i've finished creating the home page and she's still working on the design so maybe i'm done with that part but i may need to create another user story to apply those designs to the home page so that's part of agile you want these user doors to be flexible so that you can go back and make sense of what you have and make sure that you have everything in order okay so that is the basics of the basics of a combine board you can create it easily and trello for any of your projects and will help you visualize that workflow for you and any teammates that you might have on your project now i do want to point out that trailer does have some cool features you can do what's called power ups aka addons so say you wanted to add on slack also there are developer tools so you can add github features and i see that you can also add some readme or markdown features which is a part of a developer's world so it you can add a lot of different things to help you through organizing your own projects and this is a great way to get started before you get your first job or just for any project that you may have so this is making sense for you so far go ahead and put coding like a boss in the comments below if not hopefully i will help you hash out those issues with the next tool that i want to talk about and that tool is github okay so trello had a lot of great features it was simple easy and it can be used for any project that you might have as well as any life goals that you need to organize but specifically for developers i think github is a great place to house everything from your code to also using their kanban board feature so we're going to go through that now so i'm going to go ahead and create a project called sniffs and hmm and wolves so it's an app that lets your pets meet other pets in the neighborhood i can't smell guys neighborhood it is public i want to initialize it with remy and we are going to create that repository so if you're not familiar with github github allows you to save snapshots of all your code and allows you to go back in time if you make any errors you can go back to a previous version and use that version instead of the one that's messed up that's the simple explanation of github so github also has a way for you to make a kanban board you'll go up here to projects and then you will plan your project no we're going to short task and we're going to create a project sniffs and wolves i'm not going to have a description because i feel like i've already described it we're going to add a column so this column is going to be to do just like before and then we're going to have doing and finally done so this is just like trello simple and easy and then you're going to go ahead and create the same user stories so we're going to create a design we're going to create the home page um we're also going to create sign in page and finally we're going to create the profile page i want to point out that your kanban board can get very big for example at my job every application has to be 508 compliant that means that every application has to be accessible to people with disabilities and it needs to be able to be read by screen readers or any other tools that somebody with a disability might be using in order to view that application so i'm going to add that here it's going to go between doing and done so we're going to say ready for 508 you can easily move any columns wherever you need them to be and then we're going to add a doing 508 we're going to add a pass and one last one oops sorry i'm going to add fail now this is what i would see on my board uh we have different kinds of views because we have columns that can be within columns so the main header would be 508 and then within that big column you would see ready doing pass or fail so this is part of the workflow because i will work on the user story and then i will pass it on to the 508 team and those 508 team will have to go through the same process of doing to do doing pass or fail and then once it goes from there it will go to a whole nother team it will go to the user acceptance testing and those people will make sure that that user test passes the criteria that you gave it so remember when i said that that last part of the user story is to help you test that um that task that is for not only the developer not only the 508 people but for the users to test that user store to make sure that it follows the requirements that they need okay so i just wanted to point out a few other features that might help you out on your journey so we're just gonna go through it in just a little bit say that someone came in and they're still working on creating designs say i came in and mine went through 508 or it's ready for 508 and let's just say another user passed 508 and they decided to move their card over to the dumb lane also this done lane can be interpreted to ready for production so you're ready to push up that code to your production environment also i just want to point out that you can have some interesting features so like creating a checklist so maybe this is redundant because it's already a big old todo list but maybe you want to make sure that you talk to the product owner and that's going to create a check box so that you can check it just as if it were a todo list in a todo list also i created an issue just for this and you can add those issues directly to your board so you would go to add a card and you'll see this issue right here and you can sorry about that add a card and add this to your board there we go so now you know how to use the basics of github for kanban board purposes and you can house all that workflow into one place okay so i really encourage you to get to know trello or github combine boards in more detail and start using it for your projects this will help you prepare for your first job or just have a better workflow for the project that you're working on be it real life any goals that you may have or specifically a project or an application that you're building on your own time so if you like this video if you enjoyed it and you want to come back for more go ahead and hit that subscribe button below i'd love to see more of you and also i'd love to see you on twitter and or instagram so if you enjoy this video go ahead take some pictures of your kanban board some of your user stories and add me or hashtag codinglikeabos alright i'll see you later bye
