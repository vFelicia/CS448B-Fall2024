all right in this video we are going to talk about the sources tab so I'm going to command option I which is my favorite way to open up Dev tools and it's already on sources here so the sources tab is pretty interesting it from the sound of it it's where you go to look at each of the sources you can look at each of the public documents that the page has loaded and that's true but when you're going to use it is when you're really trying to debug something the bigger your program gets the harder it is to find what's broken if something stops working that can be a huge time sucker but the sources tab is an awesome tool for helping with just that so what we're going to do here is we can set something called Break points looks like there's already some set up I was messing around on here a little bit earlier so I'll say um I want line 18 I just clicked it over here and now it's over here when I refresh the page it's going to stop at each of these places it says it's paus and when that happens I can go to any of these other tabs and see exactly what's going on that's a big deal because it allows you to really go step by step in your code and look at the big picture at a very specific moment in your codes run you can set your breakpoints based on a JavaScript event excuse me based on a specific line of code based on something to do with the Dom and manipulating n which we'll get to in other videos it is a really versatile tool and what I want you to remember about the sources tab is it is really helpful in debugging your code
