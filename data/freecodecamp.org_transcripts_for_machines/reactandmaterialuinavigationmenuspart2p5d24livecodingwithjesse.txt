hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to continue on with what we were doing yesterday and once we start coding i'll give a little recap of what we did yesterday in case you missed it you can always go back and watch the recording of the stream they're all available on the free code camp youtube channel everything's in the live coding with jesse playlist probably gonna break those out into some some other playlists but we'll always keep keep the one big playlist so it's easy to find everything i just wanna say i wanna explain a little bit about the technical difficulties that have been going on in the last few streams because i think we finally figured it out so harshit and rook both pointed out to me that one of the extensions that i was using in visual studio code was taking up a lot of resources so i hadn't even thought about that i kept looking at all the programs that i had open not even for whatever reason it just didn't cross my mind at all to check out visual studio code but i think that's the problem right now the stream seems to be going fine let me know if it if it's not working for you but i've the plugin is called uh what was it import cost display yeah the plugin is called import cost so you may have the plugin and not even realize it uh i know i've recommended in the past to download uh the react food truck extension i'm sorry i keep calling it plugins but in visual studio code they're called extensions so if you have the react food truck extension for visual studio code it may have automatically downloaded the import cost extension as well so if you're having issues with your computer being sluggish and it just started you know recently after you've you know downloaded that check it out you know try disabling it that seemed to be my problem so hopefully we have everything figured out now that was a really cool extension but it wasn't it wasn't necessary i could see maybe turning it on just to check everything once or twice and then turning it back off definitely not something that i need on all the time uh so not really a big deal but i just want to let everybody know since i feel kind of bad because i recommended that and it may be crashing computers out there okay rook mentions in the live chat that rook went searching for uh issues with that plugin after harsha mentioned it so thanks for giving credit where it is due harshit is the one that first thought of it and then rook helped out by sending me some links to uh some github issues about it so it's it definitely wasn't just just me or just harsh it a lot of other people had to notice the same same issues with that extension all right we're going to get started i'm going to briefly check the live chat see if there's anything that i should address right now once we get started i'm gonna take a little while about 25 minutes to do some coding and then i'll take a break and go back to the live chat and do some coding again after so just be patient if you ask something in the live chat i may not see it right away but i will get to it eventually also i'm i have a cough i'm a little congested and have a cough so if i sound weird and i cough a lot that's that's why i apologize i'll try not to do it too much and i'm a little out of it um i hope i'm not getting sick again i've just been sick way too much lately um but i'm gonna do my best and i'm sure you all keep me on track if i do something weird uh uh we do have one one question that i'd like to address um deboprio says i cloned the project from github into a folder and inside it i open git bash and the and run the npm install command so that it installs the dependencies it's giving me errors i can't npm start it um diproprio how the deboprio sorry i'm trying really hard to get that right i'm not sure if i'm pronouncing it right but uh what version of node are you running um sometimes we run some stuff that requires a later version of node i don't think we are on this project but i'm not 100 sure so that could be it if you are running like the latest version of node then that's probably fine maybe uh if you could let me know specifically what some of the errors are i could try to try to figure them out uh let's see all right i'm gonna it looks like there's some other stuff in live chat but i'll get to that after we do some coding so let's get started and let me switch my screens there we are so i i left this sidebar up just to show you again it's the import cost uh plugin so if you have this and it's causing problems you can just disable it and you should be alright after that and we'll find out does when i start doing things if the stream gets really laggy and drops frames and stuff then uh the really good news though is i don't think there's anything wrong with my network i was afraid that something happened and i didn't have the same network speed as i did normally and that would have been a disaster because if i'm trying to stream every day like i need a good network so it seems like it's okay i did a network speed test i can actually stream at a much higher resolution than i am now i could probably stream 4k if i wanted to and as long as my machine could handle it so basically my network's amazing i just i'm limited by my computer's capabilities maybe one day i'll try to stream really high quality there's no reason to but it might just be cool to see if it could work i wouldn't experiment like that on the free code cam channel though i'll probably do it on my own that way if i mess it up it's not that many people will be affected by it all right let me start angry so i'm going to about to paste the link into the live chat if you click that link you'll be able to see the project as we're working on it you can inspect it uh in devtools and it'll be a lot easier for you all to really kind of see what's going on uh for yourself and i haven't said this for a while but i do want to thank um the the guy who made ngrok which i can't remember his name right now but his twitter handle is uh at incontrivable so you can see it right there who's um letting us use ngrok for free at a level that you know normally you'd have to pay money for for this many connections at once i don't even know if it's a set plan yeah even to have this many connections so very very generous and so if if you get a chance and you're in a position to use the paid version of ngrok sometime highly recommended um like i said the guy who who works on it who made it is uh seems to be a really good guy from um from the interaction that i've had with him all right let's get our pomodoro timer started and let me bring over i i said i was gonna go over what i did earlier or what we did yesterday so i'll do that so basically yesterday all we did doesn't seem like much but it did take a while um we just made each one of these inboxes i'm really sorry um each one of these menu items that you can open and close the submenu is now a component it's it's an instance of this one component and they each have their own state and that's working fine we stopped there but here's the goal for today what we want to happen is when i click on one of these so let's say i clicked on this about uh menu item i want the side nav the side drawer to open and i would like the corresponding so let's say that this inbox was really about i want it to be opened as well so first step is let's get this side drawer to open when we click on one of these we'll get that working and then we'll tackle the the final piece and i like to break it down in this way because you can take little steps test the steps and you know make commits uh that are kind of like logical little chunks and it just makes it seem less overwhelming in general all right so here's our drawer item that's the component that we made yesterday we're going to leave this alone for now we'll come back to it later hopefully if we have time and i can get this other stuff worked out here's our layout component our layout component is the parent component of our our top nav our app bar and our drawer so if we need to be able to share uh state between these between the drawer and the app bar then we ought to have something living here in the layout.js component all right so let's see we did do some work yesterday so let me try to remember what we did so we can just build on that so we already have state here and that's the drawer so i guess a drawer is if it's false it's not open if it's true it is open we already have this toggle drawer here which is wonderful that's what we want we also have this expand item function here which we're not using yet but eventually we we're going to go back to this so for right now all we're worried about is this toggle drawer and let's see our drawer component and we're passing down this state drawer so open true or false which is great and then we also are passing down this toggle drawer function and now you can see in in the drawer we have we should have a click or is it open on close it's awkward okay so we're calling toggle drawer here we're passing it down as a prop and we also should have there's the button oh you know what it's in it's in app bar we're passing down toggle drawer into app bar great okay so we're already passing in to app bar what we need so this will be not that hard then let's get app bar out here right it looks like we have some stuff going on here comment it out move to go back to that probably not in today's stream but i have to go back to that and see what what we were doing here all right so these are all just styles we've done the styles as a javascript object that's one way you can do things in react we're not going to mess with styles too much today but we have in some previous streams if you're interested all right so we're bringing in toggle drawer here as uh props so normally you have to do like this props and then whatever you want but we are doing so we're passing props in here uh so we don't need this and then here i believe this is destructuring correct me if i'm wrong this is called object destructuring i think and and we're saying it equals props so now we can just use toggle drawer inside of this function and it'll it'll work just save some space it's not really worth it if you're only using it like once or twice but if you're using it more than that like we're using classes it really cleans things up a lot but it can be confusing if you haven't seen it before so just wanted to point that out all right so we i need to find the menu items this component's pretty cluttered right now uh we're gonna refactor this but there's no sense in refactoring until we really have it built out the way we want we may end up doing some unnecessary refractoring otherwise and we just don't really have time to do all that we have a tight deadline so this this thing needs to be done in a month like ready to go live i'm feeling a little pressure right now because i do have some other sites that i need to work on as well i'm expecting i'm gonna be working late um february is gonna be is gonna be rough let's see typography about there we go all right so this is this is what we want let's put an on click you know what we already put on click handler down here now i remember we we did this we did this recently so we don't want yeah we don't want this we don't need this open side drawer we need um what did we call it toggle toggle drawer yeah toggle drawer let's make sure all right okay um now i added this in here we don't need obviously we don't need to pass this in right if we go to our our layout where we have toggle drawer we're not we don't need to use anything but i'm going to keep it in for right now because this is one potential way that we may end up doing the next step and expanding that menu item so i'm going to leave it in there for now it shouldn't mess anything up but we'll see and all right so that saves and which one all right so if we click the faith and life link we should open all right awesome that was way easier than i thought we had pretty much had everything already written everything done so i'm clicking on this and it works wonderful now would be a great time i think to refactor a bit and take these out and make them their own component and that should clean up should clean up a decent amount in here and while this is all still fresh in our minds i think it would be good because we can pass down this toggle drawer again another level you can see we're starting to get a little complicated with passing things down maybe i might want to start thinking about using something else to manage state other than just like component state left to think about it i'm not ready to switch quite yet i'm still okay with this uh but i'm right on the edge if we go like another level of having to pass things down i'm i'm not comfortable with that it'll start to get too complicated uh okay so let's make another component and let's just copy and paste a lot of what we did here save some time and we'll remove let's see we don't need reason classes let's grab the whole li yeah we'll grab the whole li let's copy that and then inside of here we'll replace this div with what we have here oops let me save this so we can get our syntax highlighting we're in components and let's call this should we call this menu item yeah that's what it is i i usually like shorter names but that describes things accurately so we'll stay with that let's fix our indentation a bit get rid of all those lines and it's we're not importing typography so i think that's why we're getting this yep but it's not defined so let's make sure we define that and let's see if we can just grab it no i just like to copy and paste when i can here we are so let's import typography and we don't need either one of these i think are we using no no we don't need any of that we don't need collapse or the expand there we are and let's see what styles we do need so we need classes list li and classes ul link so let's find it over here i'm going to leave them in here for now and before i i need to double check to make sure these aren't being used elsewhere in this component before i get rid of them so let's add this in here we can get rid of nested because we're not using that and remember this object is just our styles think about this just like your c your style sheet and we did have all these styles in this component but now since we're moving our markup right if this were just html we're basically moving our html from one html file over to another one so if we want the styles to be applied we have to move the styles over as well and the ul link is the other one that we need so i know these styles look a little different than you're used to if you you're just using css or sass but really it's not that hard just imagine everywhere where you normally put a hyphen instead you camel case things it's basically the same as that for the most part you need to put quotation marks around a lot of your values but other than that it's very very similar to normal css all right so now we should have all the styles that we need we need to change the name here because we're using we don't want it to be drawer item so let's change it now to app bar menu item save that and all right we need to pass down some information right because we don't want all of them to say the same thing and link to the same thing so first let's let's import this so let's import let's see app bar menu item from app bar menu item so now we can use this it's red because we haven't used it yet but now we can use this down here so let's go back to where we had all these and we'll replace each one with our new component and that should shorten things up quite a bit so here we are here's our component so we're gonna make within this ul right remember because we have our lis over here in our new component we're gonna make four of these new components eventually we'll actually store we'll probably store a lot of the data separately pull it in and just map over the data so we can make the markup you know even shorter but for now we only have four it's it's not really a big deal to actually have four components here i see a lot of activity in the live chat as well uh just hang in there if you if you have a question in about 10 minutes i'm going to go back to the live chat and answer some questions so let's make our menu item let's use our what was it at bar menu item and we need to pass some things down as props so we definitely need toggle drawer and we're just gonna say toggle drawer and i i think we can do it like that because we've destructed it up here let me double check though yes we have so we can do toggle drawer and let me clarify as well that that's how we've done it here yep all right so we can add we'll add toggle drawer and then we also need to add a title an id and our text here and if we use the id here as well if we just make it the same then i think we could save ourselves from having to pass in two different props for that so let's let's do that all right so here's our first i'm gonna write it like this since we're gonna have a few props here it'll be easier to to see so we'll need an id um let's let's see um we'll do link id i don't want it to be confused i don't want there to be any confusion about you know what we're using here so that's why i'm putting link id instead of just normal id and in this case we're going to put let's go i'm just going to say faith in life and now let's see we can add these here to destructure so we can still use and actually i never double checked to make sure destruction was the right word hopefully i'm using that correctly all right good object destruction good thank you rook for clarifying that for me i just don't want to mess people up and say the wrong thing and um i'd hate to have somebody something happen and they'd mess something up just because i can't remember the right words uh all right so we have link id right so we called it yeah link id and now we'll use title and let's do faith and life act let's let's change that up let's say content faith in life and we can reuse that for the title as well all right now let's change things over here so that we can use this so here we're going to bring in link id and we're also going to use our link id here link id do i have to we'll see if that works let me know though do i need to put link id in here i always forget when i'm using um arrow functions uh in in here let me know we'll find out as soon as i save this and see if i get an error all right the href you know what we we need the eight do we need the ahref no we really don't because we're not actually linking to anything all right we don't need to worry about that we may even be able to take this out completely let's try to take the href out and all right for our title i'm just going to add content and we're also going to use it down here so down here right this is just the interior content of this component and we're going to add our curly brackets that means we can put javascript inside of there so i can just say content oops this has to be inside and that'll pull in whatever value we pass in which in this case is going to be faith and life and this looks good oops we can get rid of this so we don't actually need this and we could uh refactor this to a stateless functional component i'm not going to do it right now so i want to make sure we have time to actually get things working but you can see right now we we really aren't doing much of anything in here so we could shorten this up a bit and make it a functional component all right so i'm going to save that and this component should be ready i don't uh unless i mess something up this should be done now let's copy this and paste it a few times one two three and now we're just going to change the names and this one will be about and i believe the next one is academics whoops lowercase and admissions admissions now let's delete all of these whoa too far there we go all right wonderful so here's our four links what did i mess up here what's this trailing space is not allowed there we are all right let's save that and see what we have all right no errors excellent and since i removed that href you can see i don't automatically have the little cursor pointer that makes it look like it's clickable we can add that in i think i'd rather not have the hr in fact let me remove this uh the little pound sign the hashtag there and let's see great that works that works that works that works wonderful okay they all work so i said the last thing i want to move in is this ul link i want to add cursor pointer so if you ever want something to have that cursor you know normally on a web page when you have an a tag you have a link you hover over it the cursor changes if you want that to happen on some other element you could just add cursor pointer in the css so let's save that and see if it worked and if it did see so now we have that little hand icon wonderful all right so we only have about just over 30 seconds left until the break so i'm just going to go in to the live chat right now and answer a few questions actually you know what it'll be a good idea to commit let's just do a git status so we've added a component here or we've we've modified app bar and then we've actually added this at bar menu item component so let's do a git add right and i could do the little period that adds everything and then we need to do a git commit and with our when we commit i'll do the m flag then i can put my commit message in line create create component for apple or menu items all right that works now it's going to go through all its tests it's going to auto format our code according to the coding standards that we're using and it also links everything so it checks all of our code now it's going to do testing it actually opens up our page some of our pages in a browser make sure that certain elements are there on the page and we've passed all the tests now we can push so we're going to do a get push now i know yesterday we found out uh from rook that you can actually just type in git push but there are some caveats to that it doesn't work in every situation so i'm not gonna do that because i don't wanna confuse anyone who's new with git if they try to do it like that and can't understand why it's it's not working because you know potentially they may not have seen when we did that and i don't want to have to repeat the caveats every time so i'm just going to stick with git push origin and hit enter oh and i need the passphrase so thankfully lastpass is working this time yesterday it didn't work so i can get the password for this much more quickly let's paste that in and then i'm going to do ssh add and paste it again and then that way i won't have to enter it again as long as i don't restart my computer now all this code is in our github repo on the master branch so if you want to check out anything that we've done check it out now if you already have the code everything uh cloned uh then you can do a get pool to get it if you fork the repo first actually i don't there's another step right if you forked it and then downloaded it you need to update your fork correct um but basically the code's all up to date on this repository on the master branch now so let me set the five minute timer and i'm gonna go to the live chat let me scroll up a bit uh blake asks uh how you how's your day been um actually not not too bad i i felt like i said i felt congested at a sore throat when i woke up but i actually i woke up and i got in a little workout which was so this is day four that i've worked out every day for four days which probably sounds like not that impressive but for me it's super impressive because i my workout schedule has been so off i can't even remember the last time i worked out four days in a row so i think that's been contributing to me being sick so much if you watch the streams a lot i think you may have noticed that i've been sick i don't know it seems like way more than a normal person should be sick i think part of it may be because i haven't been exercising so anyway i got in a workout but i still i feel really tired and um i had a meeting this morning which it was hard to stay awake during the meeting but i got through that and uh everything's going all right the only thing that i the only thing i can complain about is somebody like was not very nice to my wife in the comment section of a blog post and that made me upset but my wife responded she can handle herself she's tough uh but other than that i'm okay that kind of made me a little bit angry um and my my bitcoin and litecoin and ether investments are going up today kind of had a little dip yesterday so that makes me happy i don't really have that much money in it i just can't have a little bit to play around in so not sure if you wanted the whole recap of my day but there it is uh rook says that that extension we were talking about earlier should perform better with the latest update so i maybe i'll try that like i said earlier i don't really think that uh what was that plugin called i import cost i don't really think the import cost plugin is necessary for my work so i probably won't turn it on again for a while like if at all uh but it's good to know that they're working on the performance improvements vivek asked what language we're going to code in uh mostly javascript react style javascript hardship says westboss recently uh released a cool free css grid course that's cool yeah i saw some people on instagram and on twitter where were posting about that so uh yeah check that out if you want an intro to css grid i haven't really done any of the west boss courses but so many other developers say that they're really good so if i get some time one day i'm definitely going to check that out okay harsha's going to do the course today harsh please let me know how it is if it's uh if you think it would be helpful because i definitely need to learn more about css grid uh harshit says the the url is css grid dot io deboprio says he's running 8.9.4 for his node version yeah that should work that should be fine so it's definitely not your version oh harshit you got it all right so um deboprio says running npm start causes errors and harshit says npm start is for production we have to run uh was it run dev is that what we use i get confused with that because uh where's our package json file depending on the project we sometimes have different commands for starting the servers for development in production there it is yeah you want to go with npm dev or yarn dev or npm run dev or whatever you want to do and that that should work let me know if that doesn't work uh peter as says what peripherals do you use with your mac um i use this thing the touchpad whatever they call it the magic something i don't know all this stuff with mac is called magic whatever it's not really magic it's just technology right i don't know but i really love this thing this is the best touch pad that i've ever used it was weird to get used to it at first but mostly all like the hand gestures are my favorite thing so there are some things that it's easier to do with the mouse but i've i've gotten used to this and i kind of like it and then my keyboard is just the normal uh standard mac keyboard so i've thought about getting a different keyboard everybody talks about these mechanical keyboards i might get one one day but um for now this this works fine all right let me get back to the code and all right so i know i didn't get through everything in the live chat uh so sorry if i didn't get to your question or comment yet i would definitely get to it before i end the stream so just hang in there if you can if you have to go that's cool uh you can always check out the stream later on when the recording's available and you can listen in for my answer to your question then all right so let's go to all right next step start our timer here's our next step so now we have this opens when we click it but we want more we want it to not only open but also open this side menu the appropriate one so we're gonna first thing we're gonna do is let's make four sections here and let's name them we'll give them the proper names to match these it'll be easier to just think about it and see if it's working so that'll be an easy first step to get us started pretty sure we can do that and there won't be any issues let's get rid of our package json i don't need that anymore and our drawer item component this is where we need to go so our drawer item component when we made it yesterday we never took the step to pass down props we have values hard coded so we need to do that so we just did it with the app bar menu we're going to do the same thing again so this will be good if you're kind of new to this you may be a little confused by what we're doing with our props we're going to do it again um let's see where we our drawer so let's go to our drawer and we can see here's where we're bringing in this dry item so we have our drawer item here but we need a few more things we need this primary text and what else do we need yeah we're going to need primary text for sure i'm thinking i might want to call it something different but i don't know what so i'll stick with primary text for right now and in this case our primary text is going to be um what was the first one about so it'll be about and let's add this all right that looks good for that level let's add something else this is our sub menu items and what we're going to need to do for sub menu items is have an array of objects so for now i'm just going to do some stuff as a demo we're obviously not going to want to have this all right here where we're going to put in the component this is going to be elsewhere either in this component or preferably in a in a data file and then we'll pull it in and when we get to that part probably not going to get to today but later on uh we'll get to it and if i refactor it you know when i'm not streaming and you want to know how it works you can always check out the code and you could ask me on a stream and i'll kind of walk through it so we put our curly braces here so that that means hey we're going into javascript land so anything we put in here will be javascript and now we have an array and we're going to have an array of objects right so we need more curly braces and we're going to have uh we'll have key value pairs so we'll have a text and in this case you know i'm going to bring up on my other screen i'm going to bring up the current site as it is just to give get a few um you know forget it i'm not going to do that let's just do let's keep it simple link one and text link one and then we we're going to need a um link url which is going to be for now let's just give it a hash all right but you can see how this is going to work out so let me copy this we're going to paste it a few times all right so we'll have three items underneath that's good let me clean this up a bit so it'll be a little easier uh just to see what's going on whoa what is going on here all right i was attempting to format this properly but it's just not it's not working um let's see there we go just wanted you able to see the structure here of what we have of uh key value pairs now for for some of you this is going to be uh you know an easier concept but there's could potentially be confusing if you haven't kind of seen this before so hopefully this is a little bit easier i'll be i can't keep it in this format but it would then these would just be too huge but you can see our sub menu items so we're going to have link one we'll change this to link two and link three and the reason we're doing this as an array of objects is that now when we pass this over we'll be able to use map on these and just go through everything and keep making this collapsible we're not the collapse these list items here we can just go down through and just add in as many list items as we want and we can pass in a different array for each drawer item here so it if it's not all making sense to you now if you're if you worked with react and seen some of our previous projects hopefully you can kind of visualize what's going to happen here if it doesn't make sense now it will make a lot more sense once we get some real data in here uh but now that we have this let's i'm going to copy and paste let me verify that i don't need anything else for this all right not bad if we do want these to be links we're going to have to add something else in here but for right now this this will just work we're not really trying to to demonstrate the links because we don't even have most of these pages built out all right so let's get rid of these we have one two three four great so we'll just change the names up here so about academics admissions and academic admissions faith in life okay let's save it and now we need to bring these in so let's use our our destructuring our object destruction again save us some space save us some typing so we'll have our primary text and we'll also have our sub menu items so menu items great uh where are we at here this is going to be a primary text and then down here this is going to be a little bit more complicated so within our collapse and our list we have all these list items so we want to do here is go into some javascript right and let's say oh yeah what did we call it submenu submenuitems.map what is this function accessory arguments the map method combat cool it gives me a little explanation of this awesome all right so we're going to say item and so what just happened let's let's make this a little bit easier to read some menu items so menu items.map um so each each thing is going to be called item and then within there we want to bring in this list item so let's copy that and paste it in whoa i've got a lot of red right now all trailing spaces what is this missing key prop yeah yeah we'll be fine a lot of this red will go away as we go so it's true we do need a key prop and we will use as uh let's clean this up a bit make it a little easier as a key we're going to use the um let's use no we can't use the url it will be different we'll just use the text for now oops it'll be item dot text right so we're gonna have access to this text and url for each item so think of it like a loop if you're not familiar with map like imagine that we're looping through each one of these objects in this array and so each one of those objects if it would be the same as if we did like item and then in brackets you know zero so it's the first item and the next time it will be item one item two right but we don't have to do that with map so item.txt is our key for now probably won't be the key forever hardship i see you just said use index i'm maybe i don't i usually uh would like to use something else other than index um but not usually as you know it's a string like that for right now this will work key and we need to insert here item dot text and we'll add in just so that we have it here somewhere we're going to add in link url equals link url oops item dot link url okay um now let's see everything indentation indentation i think these are all indentation things which are okay all right not worried about that let's get rid of this and i'm just gonna glance through this again one more time all right looks good looks good all right let's save let's make sure we save this let's go back here no errors excellent let's check over here all right we have about we have link one two three link one two three one two three excellent all right and as we click these right nothing happens which is to be expected right now but we have successfully pulled these out put them in in another component so each one of these is its own component and each one can take an array of objects to make as many links underneath as we want which is great doesn't seem like a big deal now but when we end up wanting to put all these links in it's going to be a really nice feature to be able to just pass in uh in an array all right okay now here's the hard the part that i've been wondering about and i'm still not exactly sure how we're going to do it i should commit this though right now before we do that all right get your item oh you know what we already made it i was just confused because it says we just modified it i forgot that we actually made this component yesterday we just didn't really finish making it to be fully functional all right gets all right so i'm going to do a git commit with the am flag which means i'm adding it and sending the message at the same time as i'm committing and we'll say um it's okay that works we're gonna run through all our tests do our auto formatting uh if you notice here look all of our red lines are already gone it's formatted everything properly for us which is awesome it saves us time for having to go through and try to fix those lines great we passed and now we'll do a git push origin right and now that's up on github all right let's let's think for a second about how we're going to do this let's go back out here so again uh the desired functionality is that we click on about the side nav opens which we've already covered that but i also want this to be expanded so first step is let's figure out what makes this expand or not expand and then we can try to figure out how to influence that so we'll go to our component that's draw item component and let's see here's our component that's the collapse component okay this is probably for our icon so we're not worried about that so what we are worried about is this i believe i believe it's this one this in state open items so if our value for collapse in is true it's open if it's false it's closed i think that's what's going on here correct me if i'm wrong so we need somehow to be able to modify this when a click occurs okay all right and this is where i wish like i wasn't i wasn't kind of sick because i really want my whole brain to be on this one all right all right so my original idea was just to have this state live in layout which is the parent component but the problem became if the state lives in layout then when we click one of these all of them would open or close so that's why we move state here and we move these to a component so it makes sense for this component to be able to control whether it's open or close another thought potentially could be i just keep going back to redux and thinking about oh i would do it like this in redux uh really that is what we need if we were to bring the state up to layout uh what we would need is a separate state for each item in that menu right now we could hard code that and that would be fine but that wouldn't work as well if we were going to have lots of menu items now the realistically we're um we're not going to have a lot of menu items uh it's probably only going to be four that have the expansion we're going to add maybe a few more that won't be expandable harsh it does say that apollo has a link state and because apollo has the um redux replacement all right so harsha did write a blog post on that maybe i'll check that out uh let me let me work through this i tell you what i want to let's try to do this just with component state then harshit i'll read your blog post on that and um maybe we'll go back and refactor it and the only reason i'm even comfortable doing this with component state is because those links will most likely never change those main links they've never changed on the website for years and my boss wants to keep them as is so i guess i'm okay with this normally i wouldn't just normally it would not ever make sense to hard code stuff like that in like the the links but let me show you a way we could possibly do this if you weren't if you didn't want to use redux or apollo's uh redux like thing that's that they have now so in our layout component under state let's go with um see hold on let me see i'll have here under state let's have drawer items let's see if we can do this about false academics false missions um faith in life false all right all right oops i need a comma all right let's save that hopefully y'all can see where i'm going with this um and then we need to pass these values down i'm not exactly sure if i can even do this in here um why did i make this an array you don't need that okay um so drawer items is an object that has key value pairs for each of the kind of drop down things that we want tell you what my timer went off my timer went off let me uh take five minutes here go to the live chat i'm gonna answer some more questions and then we'll come back and finish off this uh my point my my goal is just to get the functionality that we want it may not be the best way to do it but we can always refactor that's generally the way i like to go about things is get it to work first then worry about refactoring then that's especially how i like to do things when something needs to be done quickly because if worse comes to worse we can always use the way that works but it's not ideal and then go back to it you know at some later point let me scroll back up to where i left off all right so andrew says hey jesse congratulations on finishing the nanodegree i really enjoyed your review and thank you again for letting us get a peek into your daytoday work oh you're welcome and i'm glad glad you liked the video uh sorry about being so late on that i know i had said that i was going to make a video for a long time i finished my nano degree way back at like the end of october or something beginning in november and it took me you know this long till january to get the video made uh so it's finally out there if you haven't seen it yet and you're interested uh there's a link to my youtube channel in the description of this video check it out it's the latest video on there it's it's my review of my experience with the react nanodegree um if you don't have time the video is only a few minutes long but if you don't have time my overall assessment is i think it was a good use of my time and money to do the nanodegree program i learned a lot so if you're in a situation where it makes sense for you i would recommend it peter asks how do you jump back the indentation so yeah uh it's shift tab so if you want to you can highlight within your code editor you can highlight a block of of text and then tab to go forward shift tab to go backward uh let's see john hanson says you can pass down on click events and even reuse on toggle drawer though it can get messy unless you control bubbling and capturing event dot stop propagation fixes many issues okay uh good to know rook says how do you do pseudo selectors or media queries and that inline css support it no inline css does not support media queries so if you want to do media queries you you you can't do it inline as far as i know last time i checked if anything changed then i sorry let me know but yeah you can't do that and pseudo selectors yeah so if you want to do a pseudo selector like before or after uh that doesn't work in line either so you are you can only use a subset of css if you want to go strictly inline rook says when you see a squiggly line and want to see the error you can press f8 or just hover over it okay that's good to know sometimes it's hard to get a hover on it if it's a tiny squiggly line so f8 cool i learned so many useful things from you all i really appreciate that peter says all those tests and stuff when you commit to are they default or do you have to add them um it says i'm a total get noob oh don't worry about it we're all noobs at something i'm sure there's just way too much going on and even within uh web development there's way too many things to be an expert at everything so um peter uh we did have to make those tests and by we i mean harshit he made the test um so yeah they don't come by default uh you can you know get take a look at some of the code maybe we'll do a stream where we maybe write some tests that might be that might be a good thing to do i need myself to learn more about tests so maybe we'll try to do that depending on the time though that might be something that we do a stream about after we launch the site because that's not usually a good idea but un unfortunately we just don't have a lot of time to get it launched uh vivek says hello uh hey vivek thanks for joining us evo's here hey evo how's it going um let's see oh horseshit said we have instructions for the fork and the contributing file so i did mention before about cloning and forking the repo so check out our contributing file contributing.md that's in the repository it'll give you a lot more info about that thank you for bringing that up portion um vivek asks what language i use javascript let's see uh excel says git add dot is for add all uh to state like dash a um i guess i didn't i never used dash a for all so yeah the dot the little period after git add uh that means all so you just add everything uh to be ready i think they call it it's staged when you do that so you stage everything to be committed all right i'll come right back to where i left off in the live stream after we finish this this next coding session so here's what i'm going to do we're going to try to make this work in the next session if the next session ends before it works i'm still going to finish and we'll just i'll work on it later hopefully we'll get it done if i can get it done before the session's over then i'll just go straight to the questions so right now i've added in a parent component layout.js i've added this draw items in the state and i have key value pairs for each of our items each of our main uh links that'll have the you know collapsible so now we want to be able to pass this down so the first thing i think we should do is try to pass these down to our to our drawer items and see if we can control them being open or closed just by kind of changing them here in our file so we need to pass it down to the drawer first so in drawer let's go with um drawer items equals this dot drawer the state dot drawer excuse me draw items and that's probably just a space yeah indentation thing all right so we're passing drawer items good we shouldn't have any errors yet excellent now from drawer let's go into our drawer and let's pass down and this is going to be a little bit weird that we're doing it like this for now we wouldn't want to keep it like this but we are just for now um so we're going to say let's see open is open and the is open value we're going to give it is going to be this props drawer item dot about does this make sense oh thank you rick said uh bless you because i sneezed thank you right and normally we wouldn't do this like copy and paste at all we would be mapping over these things just like we did uh in our our draw item component which is what we're going to go to next we would we would do um did we do a map here yeah right here is our map so eventually we'll refactor and do that uh so let's see about academics admissions and then here if you remember i had hyphens so we can't keep the hyphens in there so we're gonna have to use our bracket syntaxes or bracket notation instead of dot notation so that we can do this so i saw um someone said in there it'd be better to use john said it'd be better to use faith in life altogether leave out the hyphens which we could do that it's true um but this is a cool opportunity just to show a different a different way to do it um all right let's save that to verify we don't have errors oh we do cannot reproperty about of undefined okay so we have something that's undefined here let's see what's going on this props drones let's go back to our layout drawer items this state draw items to our items all right let's see this props oops i messed it up i added a um well yeah i really messed that up alright did i get them all i never mind uh let's change this all right so i just totally messed up on spelling so we're going to draw items and capitalization lowercase all right let's see if we get rid of that yay okay we got rid of that let's verify these still work great they still work okay so now that we're passing this down let's go to our drawer item component and we should have access to the drawer item property so is open so open items let's see if this works so open items equals this props is no no we don't want to do it like that we can can we make this a stateless function yeah we're going to be able to eventually make this a stateless functional component so let's remove this for now and we're going to change this in just a minute but for now we can change this part this collapse part it's going to be this props is open okay let's save that hopefully we don't get an error yay so everything should be oops cannot read open items of gnaw where are we using open items at uh open items uh okay i have to change it here as well let's make sure it's not being used elsewhere props is open let's save that all right so we click it now when i click this nothing should happen well actually we we get a an error which is fine that's what should happen because when we try to run this it's not finding open items now this is the test that should tell us whether or not this is going to be able to work here if we change let's change about to be true and save when we go here about should be open yeah it's open awesome now let's close it say false and then let's try to open admissions yay admissions opens all right great so we can now control whether or not these are open and closed by modifying the state of layout the parent component wonderful so step two is now finished we can control the state step three we need to be able to click it right so we need to change this we need to use this expand item modify it a bit to work with our new system here and then pass it down to our component instead of having it right here okay so let's do that now so we need to make this our expand item we can keep the name that's great and we need to make this be open items or a drawer item so this is going to be drawer item but what we're going to do is get the previous state um all right to be open we want it to be true or false draw items oops sorry drawer items and what we want to do all right this would be tough so we're going to send we're going to send up that function um we're going to send in the name the id and then all right i think i think we got it i think i have it uh let's find let's do this um it's been a little while since i've used this you um this will need to be item id m id animal solutions all right i'm probably messing this up a lot um but here's what i'm trying to do uh i think i'm just getting syntax wrong basically what i'm trying to do is whatever the state of drawer items is i want to keep it the same and only change the item that's just happened for the click so you know some of them are already open i want to keep it like that so let me look up uh what is this object that's this is it the spread spread syntax yeah all right so i'm gonna check ndm mdn for lead objects on objects i know we've done this before your items your updated key value okay so rooks um i just saw leonardo says uh jesse you demand thank you i appreciate that um all right so rex type in some stuff in for me presta drawer items dot your updated key value okay um that's what i was i was missing items and then that syntax expected token do i need that no i think i have too many parentheses no no that was the right amount what am i missing i need another one of these okay no messing something up here all right consistent spacing is that what i'm messing up oh so works all right rick's saying remove that and then then we're going to do item id it's gonna be here we go all right harshit has some stuff here uh try down sure previously all right let's see uh let me copy and paste what harsh it has all right so let's all right it's it's cool um let's see okay so drawer items um all right so previous state for item item id previously for it i might have a minute great okay cool thank you horoshit this was what i was attempting to do as you can see i was kind of stumbling through it so let me see i have something wrong here what is wrong uh do i need all of these i think maybe i don't need that one um oops spelling yeah thank you rook items and what am i doing here unexpected token all right so let me go through these so i need this one to close that one and one two good this is closed here and then this one is closed here all right great it should be fine appreciate what it is what is wrong all right i can't see where this is going wrong i'm missing oh thanks harshit i'm missing a parenthesis there no did i get it wrong requires a space before what the heck oh is this what they want all right all right so now previous state is not defined oh prestate that's what i had prestate there we go all right so at this point hey see you rook thanks for watching and thanks for all the help i really appreciate it okay so we're close now so next step is pass this function down through props all the way down to our drawer item so we gotta pass it to drawer and then from drawer to drawer item and then call this function on click so let's find drawer and what are we going to do this is this uh let's call it expand item right expand item equals this dot expand item right harshit says you definitely need format on save i know i thought i said it to format on save but i guess i didn't i have to go back and check check my settings again all right so now we're passing this down to drawer let's do the same here and now i'm really wishing i didn't just copy and paste all these drawer items but let's do expand item equals this props span item and now i'll just do this here actually let me do it like this a little messy but we're going to change all this anyway so now we're passing it from drawer down to drawer item so it should be available for drawer item we can get rid of this and since we've already called it expand item that'll be one less thing we have to worry about so any place where we have this dot expand item which should be once good just once we can do this dot props dot expand item but we what we want to do is give it more than just this prop so we're going to do a little arrow function and we're going to pass it our id so what do we call that uh primary text oh did we not given an id yet all right we need to give it an id uh so i'm gonna call this uh item id that's uh yeah item id and i'm actually gonna take away this props because we're gonna we're gonna destructure it uh so let's do is open and um what did we call this expand item and then now this would work and then anywhere we're doing this props is open we can change it to just is open wonderful all right so we're going to do this and we're going to pass it item id so let's add item id in here and then let's pass an id into here so we'll go with oh yeah all right we're going to say item id equals and we're just going to give the id of first about so we have about and academics that makes admissions and faith and life wonderful all right so now we're passing down the proper id which will be used to send up on a click great save that and save that and let's see what happens hey no errors always a good sign yay look at that it works it works so when we do this what's really happening is the click is calling this expand item function that's been passed down from layout to drawer to draw item so now it's the click and the data from the click which is our id is being passed up through drawer into layout once it gets to layout the expand item takes that item id and it uses it to change the state and set whatever that id is to the opposite of what it previously was so either true or false once the state changes then that triggers a rerender and then that's why we see the change here so that that's how react works that's cool this was really a cool exercise about state so here's the thing my timer went off but the last step is now going to be pretty easy because all we'll have to do is this app bar menu item is we're gonna pass down that same expand item function we'll pass it all the way down to here and then we'll have an on click our on click that's toggle drawer uh let's see so we need we need more of the toggle we need soggle drawer where are you passing in link id so maybe we don't need that let's go up to drawer let's see if this works where's our toggle drawer it's in layout isn't it all right this is probably not the best way to do it but it's the fastest way to get it working before i end um let's see her should send he would have stuck for a half hour if i'd not written that snippet i don't know about a half hour i gave it five to ten minutes because i already had like half of it typed out um let's see we have our toggle drawer we're gonna pass in item id this stage for our toggle drawer wonderful and then what we also want to do is um id and we want to do this start expand item item id all right so here's what i'm doing um harsha says that's hyperbole well it's not it's it's close enough to being accurate that i don't know that it's really hyper because i mean i'm we've we've all seen me take a really long time to do something um all right let's see okay so here's what i'm trying to do so when toggle drawer is clicked or if there's an item id it's going to expand that item um but if not it's not going to expand it right so but it's still going to toggle the drawer no matter what we got to do it like this because sometimes we're going to toggle the drawer with the the button for toggle and we're not going to want something to expand automatically so let's see if it works the reason i said i don't want to do it like this because it just seems like my components are way too intertwined in different ways right now and it would be a pain to split them apart and reuse them that's why i keep saying something like redux comes in handy because it would let us keep our components way cleaner and more uh like contained and reusable this solution works and it might even work forever for this site but it's it's definitely not ideal it's not the best way but this should work so let's first try this great so we're not getting an error saying like hey you didn't pass an item id wonderful now let's click about yay and now we've clicked about and it's expanded great academics expanded uh probably what we want to do though we wouldn't want to keep everything expanded we would want to close everything else so the only thing i would add to this is maybe something that would if there is an item id it would close everything so it would set everything to false and then run this this function so that's the only difference other than that this works yay so we can open we can close we open it's the right one wonderful let's open it again oh ah here's a bug right if we open it and then close and then try to open again hey it's it's done so what we want to do then is i suppose we don't want that to be a toggle so that's another thing we'll have to work on uh we want it yeah we we want to change how that behaves so my timer is up so i'm not going to work on that now because basically it works there's just one little bug that we've encountered but wow okay so we got the functionality that we wanted let me go back up in the live chat to where we left off and i'm going to answer everything in the live chat and then uh we'll wrap things up let's see what time did i stop also if you need me to go over anything that i just did please let me know in the live chat i'd be happy to go back over it's possible that i skipped through something really fast that wasn't straightforward sometimes i tend to do that if i start to get into it that was actually pretty good i i didn't say i won't say i was in like flow state because it's hard to do when i'm doing a stream but it's pretty close i haven't gotten into that flow state in so long i i need to get i need to get some work done all right evo says quick question what are your opinions on server side react like next.js for example what could be better and what are its strong sides um i really like server side react the server side rendering is nice um i think it's strong the strong side point is um you can your content is available to search engines which is awesome you can do caching of the markup on the server side which lets you serve it up really quickly so i think that's cool i like that as far as what could be better i really like the way next does it it makes it easy um i suppose it does require you to use node on on your server which otherwise you don't necessarily need to use node with react not a really problem for me i i like using node but uh not everybody uh you know might be able to use it um the other downside i don't know i don't know that's kind of for me i'm sure there are other things i just can't think of any right now um vivec says what is react is react like netbeans or something andrew says reacts to javascript library for building user interfaces um yeah yeah that's a really good answer so yeah check it out if vivec check out the react documentation it'll explain a lot more about what react is uh evo says it's a library developed by facebook which allows you to create browser applications in javascript yeah definitely it can actually do even more than that but just for like a simple explanation then keep it like that vvx says oh like google developed angularjs exactly i know um they're not exactly in the same class like angular and react but for the purposes of this question if you kind of think of them and being in a similar category then that's that's right that that's a good way to think of it andrew says i've seen some people refer to react as a framework but i i think since it's only a view library a view libraries more accurate i do see those terms used interchangeably though andrew i think you're right on with that uh it's really easy to use them interchangeably i do it um sometimes accidentally but you're right uh technically i believe react is a library and not a framework and for the very reason that you said it's only the view so your traditional mvc model model view controller or some people say mv star however you want to do it react is really only the v the view part in that model whereas something like angular you could do the entire mvc just with angular evo says um oh okay in regard to it being like angular he says it's not really like anger there are some differences you should look into them and pick one you like yeah yeah there are definitely well kind of we just explained some of the differences there uh it's uh conda says react that's crazy start starting learning this week uh it's hard hoping to understand better big ups uh jesse oh thanks yeah hopefully that this stream helps a bit um and feel free to ask me any questions there are some other videos on this channel that are more like a beginner tutorial on react so check those out if you get a chance evo says jesse a mechanical keyboard is god like i have a cherry mx blue and i love to sit there all day and type random things oh man i really think i might have to get a mechanical keyboard um hey maybe if my uh crypto investments take off then i'll get a mechanical keyboard how about that um yeah but evo you you make it sound so enticing i want to try one now um bilikaya says thank you for doing this with two thumbs up you're welcome i really appreciate it thanks for watching uh peter says i would highly recommend the magic trackpad 2 it charges with a lightning cable and has forced touch functionality and it looks slick af if you know what af means then you know otherwise i'm not going to explain it um all right cool i'm going to have to look into that i i may i could probably get my work to pay for that i haven't had any work related expenses for a while so i think it would be it'd be okay i wonder if i get him to pay for a mechanical keyboard i bet i could i'll i'll try um let's see uh jacob was saying i need to wrap the list item with parens in the arrow function i believe that was for the map obviously i guess you don't need the parens yeah let's check that out for a second um where's our in our drawer item for a map uh with an arrow function did we wrap it in parents i guess we ended up doing it in parents didn't we you know what i think it auto formatted to do it in parens but technically you don't need paren so uh yeah i think you don't need parens what is it if it's all on the one can be on one line i forget exactly which situation you need it in which you don't but i don't think it's required although based on our our rules for our javascript style it we do automatically put those in i usually don't do it when i'm actually typing it out but i don't mind if they get added in it can make things a bit more readable uh actually that i should definitely commit this get status double check all right get add our git commit a.m um let's see open new feature open expand um github has a did you get over i think it's udacity has a guide for the way they do commits and this is one of the ways they do it i'm not 100 sure i want to enforce a guide for commit messages just yet but it does come in handy here to categorize things so that's one of the things i'm considering if you all know of another guide for commit messages that you like uh i'm happy to check it out it would be probably a good idea at some point to enforce some type of formatting of commit messages and we'll do get push origin cool now everything we've done is is now available on our repo so you can check that out and you know clone it play with it and um improve it if you'd like and submit a pull request okay so rook has something from the react docs we were talking about what to use as the key earlier when we were mapping through and it says from react docs we don't recommend using indexes for keys if the order of items may change this can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state so it works but performance all right cool um so yeah the order doesn't change here so it's probably okay to use i usually never use it unless i really can't think of anything else but so just in general i i don't but i guess it it's acceptable in in circumstances where the order won't change sanjay says how do you handle responsive design with material ui uh does it have grids or do you write custom flexbox uh it comes with its own grid uh components and that handles a lot of that so a lot of it's kind of built in if you use their components properly uh let's see random random says what is the theme variable in the styles method and how do components get access to it all right so to get more info on that check out the material ui documentation for the beta version but essentially uh we have like this with styles um down here we're importing it up here as well and that ties it all together so i don't really i haven't read the documentation on that for a while and i think harshit might have set it up for this one so i don't feel comfortable going into it right now i don't think i could explain it properly but inside the component that's how it is uh if you want to check out how to set that up in the root then i would check out the documentation or check out the repo and see you know kind of what we're doing in the root component let's see let's see rook says capitalization spelling is the main cause of errors for me glad to see i'm not alone yeah for sure that's always a cause of errors rook says things like that changing the false to true makes me really happy for some reason and seeing it work afterwards of course yeah it is satisfying um all right all right should i see what you're saying uh to change the printer es lin integration to true and editor format on safe to true i will do that not right now but i will do that stephen says hey jesse went ahead and applied a couple ui ux entry web development jobs applied too sorry i missed the two to a couple of ui ux entry web development jobs to see what happens i live in austin texas which currently currently has a ton of openings thanks for the support oh yeah no problem and uh congratulations on applying i hope you get some interviews and and get a job uh so yeah that's awesome and um you know applying to as many places as you can definitely helps your odds of getting a job so i would say even apply to places that maybe you think you're a little bit not you know under qualified for uh you never know you know you might you might get a job so you never know what candidates they're gonna get but please let me know how it goes let me know if you get an interview and stuff and you know uh good job good job flying let's see all right harsh it's saying change the previous to true and it will fix the bug uh at the last line well here's the thing though i i don't think it will it'll fix the bug but it'll cause another one right because we're using this same thing for our clicks for this so then what would happen is every time we clicked it would just keep saying true so we could open but we wouldn't be able to close so we needed to do something we need to do something about that so like i said that solution will fix one thing and then uh cause another bug unless i'm misunderstanding the solution uh bruce says hey jesse mind if i ask you a question about a project i'm doing yeah no problem uh ask away uh harshad said without node there is no serverside rendered react yeah as far as i know that is definitely the case evo says a mechanical keyboard is really cool you have four different main types brown black red and blue and you need to research the differences a class a classmate of mine invests in crypto it crashed last week and it was so sad to see also by the way with cherry mx blue i was referring to the switch style usually color coded the brand itself uh is a ducky one good keyboard keycaps could be better all right so yeah i'll definitely i'll do my research on the key keyboards when i'm ready uh to purchase one yeah the crypto thing is um i'm no expert in crypto but i'll just say it's it's funny to me seeing the headlines because like i i get the headlines you know on my phone about things going on in crypto and they're always so behind so like the headlines will say like ah the crypto market crashed but then if you look at the actual prices they already recovered it it moves so fast it's hard for the news to keep up uh that's just it's kind of funny to me the market's crazy like if you invest anything in cryptocurrency right now it better be money that you can afford to just lose because do i think it's going to crash to nothing no but there's really no guarantee it's just really wild right now so it's kind of fun i think i don't think it's a gamble i think it's a little bit better odds than a gamble if you if you do it right but it's not a safe investment at all so i don't want anybody like taking saying that i'm endorsing it or thinking you should put all your money in it right now if you have a little bit of extra money that you wouldn't mind losing then i think crypto is a cool place to put it you might get lucky on that um steven says how do you how do teams accept you when you are under qualified positions i don't want to go to a job to fail kind of worries me are most most teams supportive of teaching i don't really know it would just it would depend on the team to be honest with you i've heard people talk about going into teams and feeling like they don't know what they're doing and they're not being supported sometimes they work through that it's okay sometimes they don't uh it really just depends on the team to be honest with you so you hopefully in your interview process you'd be able to get some sort of feel for that uh but you know some places just kind of expect you to learn on your own some places do a really good job of mentoring it's just hard to know if if you can talk to people that already work at a place that's probably your best way of finding out uh debo prio says hey jesse when i click on about and open academics then the about section remains open can you make the about section to not remain open similarly for the others yeah for sure yeah i definitely want that to be the case so that's another thing so when when any one of these are clicked we want to automatically shut everything else and only open this oh wait a second that'll fix our bug that'll fix it hold on yeah okay so this this will fix our bug if the first thing that happens is everything gets turned to false and then the one you click on gets open that'll fix the bug because it'll automatically be false and then it'll get open every time you click the only thing that will happen is if you try to open it again this will be open but i think that's fine i think that's actually a good behavior so they they both prio okay so it's pronounced de beauprio they they beau priyo dabo prio all right i'm gonna try my best to remember that thank you for um uh for let me know how to pronounce that all right cool you know what let me let's see okay wait a second is this not gonna work expect your tab or space all right cool i'll put that comment in there and um that way i'll remember to write this basically we'll just have to do something like this um but make set everything to false yeah that'll work cool um evo says i have a rather personal question how did you end up at your current job and how was your first day uh i ended up in my current job so i was freelancing but it was a little bit stressful especially for my wife because we didn't know how much money we make every month i had some clients that i had steady income from but then i had other times would just be you know some months i'd have a lot of work some months i wouldn't so that was really stressful for her not knowing you know would we have money for this or that you know not being able to plan in budget so i decided to start applying for jobs and i'm going to be completely honest with you freelancing i was not making as much money as i i wanted to be making our family was growing and uh the i was trying to get into some other markets because my my local market is economically depressed right now and it has been for for years so there just wasn't a lot there wasn't a lot of high paying jobs it was all really small jobs and uh it just it wasn't worth all the work so i had kind of broken into the market around new york city and i started to get clients and referrals there so things were picking up but i still thought you know what it's going to be it'll be a good idea if i just apply some other places it would definitely make my wife wife happy and we would you know basically have some more security and stability which is definitely a good thing when you have kids at the time i had four no i had three kids at the time uh so i started applying for jobs i actually took a a job and it was a work from home job and i was in like kind of a trial period to see whether or not i like the job or whether or not they wanted to keep me but at the end of that period i was going to get hired full time so i had started doing that and i was doing that for a while and then i heard back about this job which i had applied to months before it took a really long time and so it was kind of a funny thing i applied for a job called academic web coordinator obviously i'm not the academic web coordinator so i didn't get the job it came down between me and one other person who happens to be the guy that works in the office right next to me who's a really nice guy but i went through all the interview process they kept calling me back for more interviews in person and on the phone and i'm like why did they keep asking more questions and finally they called me to come back in in person again and at that point i'm i'm thinking what like what could they possibly ask me i come in there and they hand me a job description and it's for a totally different job and they asked me what i thought about it and i said i read over it and i said this i mean it looks good it looks like a good job and they said good that's what we wanted to hear would you rather do this job or the other job you originally applied for and i said well honestly i'd rather do this job because it seems like it has a much broader scope i get to do more stuff with with the web uh you know web development and so they said great we're going to offer you this job and we already offered the original job to the other guy and uh so that's that's how it worked out so i got hired i started a few weeks later and my first day was just me like meeting everybody and figuring out where things were i didn't have a computer for the first few days because the computer they had ordered me like just took forever to come in and eventually i had uh there they were another employee had switched apartments and they hadn't hired her replacement yet so i took that computer and put it in my office and had something to work with for a while before my actual computer came in um so i don't really remember that much for my first day other than i didn't have a computer and an employee sharon ann who i love sharon and she was like the office mom and she was so sweet she made signs for me so there was a signs at the door little signs on the floor leading up to the office um and just really welcoming so that was that was awesome it was a really cool first day everybody was super nice it was way different than it is now they totally reuh did the building remodeled everything so i didn't have an office before i had like a cubicle um it was it was weird it was really wild the building was so different but uh that was kind of my first day so sorry that was that was a long story uh but i guess it answers your question i suppose uh so that's how i got here it's nice they have good health insurance benefits so that's great for the kids and um you know steady income sal it's salary work uh retirement plan and my wife and i and my kids can take classes here for free i mean it's gonna be a long time before my kids are old enough to come here who knows if i'll be working here by then but if it does happen it'll end up being worth a lot uh so anyway that's how i got i ended up here my original title was integrated marketing communications coordinator after a year it switched to frontend developer which is way more appropriate for what i actually do but that's that's the story all right oh harsha says that is exactly for my name but you don't pronounce it terribly so i don't pronounce it 100 correctly i really want to let me know how i'm supposed to pronounce it um bruce says hey jesse sorry what i wanted to ask you earlier was would you recommend doing a wordpress theme from scratch or redesigning an existing theme it depends on how comfortable you are with the whole process if this would be your first time doing it then maybe it'll be easier to just take an existing theme and redesigning it i find that to be a lot easier most of the time and faster you end up with a lot of stuff usually that you don't need but it's quick if you were to start from scratch and redesign a theme my advice would be start from scratch and make a basic theme that you can then copy and reuse later on so you don't want to be starting completely from scratch every single time i think that's a waste of time but build if you want to build your own base theme and then just make child themes off of that i think that's the way to go uh because there's a lot of things that will probably stay the same from no matter what you want to do so make that first and and then go off it but as i said it kind of really depends on what you're most comfortable with uh steven says the starting pay for almost all positions here in austin is nuts i just need to get my foot in the door that's cool yeah honestly i when i see the pay for developers sometimes like at bigger companies and things i think wow that would be really nice it's definitely tempting for me um james says what are some good ways to get freelance work for beginners uh if you want to try to go on the freelance site sometimes that works i i didn't have much luck with freelance websites uh but some of them you can go to like like top towel makes you take a test first and they're kind of like the middle man between you and good companies so i i would be more inclined to do something like that as opposed to something like freelancer where it's basically just a bidding war and who could bid the lowest uh if you want to go local i would say just start asking people and find local businesses that maybe you can improve their website if they don't have a website if you really have time you really need work then just make a basic website for a company and then show it to them and say hey here's what i've done for your website you know even if it's just a mockup or like a redesign of maybe just the home page and say are you interested in my services i could build you out a whole website or i could tell you what i've done you know sometimes it's easier to show people the results to convince them that they really need it you know maybe they don't realize how much better their website could be that takes a lot of work and it's kind of like you put yourself out on a limb because you're doing work without getting paid but what you really do need to do is build up your portfolio and get those referrals you know maybe try to target business people in your area that you know have a lot of connections and that's where you want to get if you can if they're happy with what you do they're way more likely to tell other people so a lot of local networking might be your thing if you want to try to branch out to another area like me my economic area is not great for that then you might want to try to really target ads or different seo at another area a bigger city maybe it's going to be tough but once you get your foot in the door and you do a good job for one company it becomes a lot easier to do things for other companies especially if you get referrals you can try to have referral deals like tell your existing clients you know if you refer me you'll get a gift card or i'll do so much work for free for you that helps i've done that before all right okay so harshit has pasted his name um in hindi so i can check out google translate oh cool harshit's name means joyful excellent that's an awesome name and let me listen to this all right i'm gonna work on that that that it's so subtle like i can tell i'm not saying it exactly right but the difference is so subtle i'm having a hard time like grasping it i need to use um i don't i used to take uh like acting classes and stuff when i was a teenager and we went over accents before and one of the key things to learning another accent is learning where they position their tongue in their mouth when they're talking so maybe i'll have to check out you know that part of the world what's what's the correct way to place your tongue and if you can figure that out it makes it so much easier uh to uh to say words in that language and make it sound correct so maybe maybe i'm missing something like that um bruce says thanks i'm new to developing wordpress themes so it's a new field for me and that's really good advice to make your own basic theme and work from that cool yeah and there are some bare bones themes out there that you could take and work from so uh man i can't it's been so long since i've done wordpress themes i can't remember what like the the basic themes are so really sorry about that i used to know i mean this is like maybe four years ago i used to know a lot about wordpress but i've been i've been out of it for so long i don't even know if the stuff i used to use is even you know still in in use um osas says how important uh to know algorithm and data structures and frontend web development on a scale of 10 how close a and d s algorithm data structures is related to front end uh personally in my the daytoday work as a frontend developer i don't deal with it that much but it may come up in an interview some companies really like to test you on lots of different things so if you're if you want to interview try to do your research and figure out what companies use the kind of questions they use and then you may want to learn more about that but personally i've done very little with that but i don't know i might not be a good example for the average developer i'm not really sure uh let's see stephen says the problem that i have is i'm moving from education 10 years as a teacher i learn html css jquery get sas bootstrap uh on the side for the fun trying to make a move has been the hardest oh cool i used to be a teacher as well i taught for almost four years um and then i moved into freelance uh web development so i understand uh it's tough to make the move um stephen says just hard finding a frontend dev job that doesn't require react angular etc yeah well i mean try to brush up on your react skills there are definitely still a lot of places out there that have jquery based websites so there's definitely a demand for that um it may not be one of the higher paying jobs right now but if you'd like to get a job and you don't quite know enough react yet that might be a better way to go or even freelancing there's probably a lot of freelance work you can pick up that's jquery based um dj says can we use bootstrap in react you can use bootstrap and react i would recommend using a react bootstrap library instead of trying to use like the normal bootstrap i think it'll be a lot easier for you you'll run into less problems like that um oh cool uh her should put my name into hindi and put it in the uh live chat that's awesome uh let's see i should say what did you teach as a teacher i taught latin and um uh religion or like theology uh so i taught at a catholic high school so we have theology classes there which is not really normal uh at least in the united states most high schools don't teach theology uh but we did and uh so i thought i taught sophomores juniors and seniors in high school and um yeah so it was i had a good time teaching i hated the meetings and i hated all the paperwork and handling discipline issues i love being able to help out the students uh being able to just like talk to them about subjects especially um i did a course on like um like theology like history like church history and things it was really cool to just kind of like tell them stories of things that happened in history and um that was just fun it was fun and i i got to you know help out students get through a lot of tough things happening in their lives so i think i really had an impact especially on you know there are a few students i think i really had a big impact on and so it was worth all the stuff that i didn't like just for that but uh it didn't pay very much at all it would have been impossible for me to support my family on what i was making um so and it was tough i taught 150 students every day by the end of the day i had headaches every single day so there were there were things that i did not like about it but i love my students and i still talk to some of them and hear from them and so anyway teaching is cool teaching is a very very tough job i i do not think i'd want to go back to teaching high school uh stephen says i do have nine presentations at tcea next month three at uh south by southwest edu and one at south by southwest interactive so i have that going for me wow that's awesome you got a lot of stuff going on steven if any of those presentations are available online i'd love to check them out so please let me know send me some links if you're on twitter you can just dm me on twitter if you don't want to make them like public um they they they vote for yo they vote prio all right is um trying to pronounce that right but anyway it says i'm in my third year my cs degree computer science degree i want to participate in google summer of code this year what should i start doing now so the process gets easier i'm not that familiar with google summer of code so i don't know how much i could help you in general i would just say like um keep at it like whatever types of languages or projects that they work on i would start working on stuff like that now so you're like in practice for that just a little bit every day or every other day will probably help you um let's see uh let's see vijay says learning photoshop will add any value to web design yeah photoshop can for sure there are some other programs like photoshop sketch adobe xd i think they call it uh those ones are all used i think if you just know one of them you should be fine but for web design you know a lot of the adobe products are usually what people use heart uh harshit says i'm also planning to participate in google summer code this year i've gained uh quite a lot of confidence in my skills last year um says that is not the same here man it is regional let's see specifically that's cool i'm gonna have to look up this google summer of code stuff i want to know what it's all about um vince says uh in regard to using react with bootstrap uh it says there is a specific version of bootstrap that's built specifically for use with react so if you google react bootstrap that'll be there so uh thanks vince that's um that's definitely helpful harshit says but that's ridiculous i don't know what was ridiculous i don't remember what i was talking about there um steven says if you go to my twitter handle uh i have my education website listed okay cool i'll uh let me copy and paste your twitter handle now so i don't forget all right cool i just followed you this is it's the hyperlink with steven isn't it cool i'm on the site right now i'll check that out thanks for sharing that okay i'm really exhausted now i need i need a little break i need some food in me so thank you all so much i had a great time well mainly because number one everything worked number two you are awesome and uh really helpful and supportive and positive so i'll be back tomorrow i'm looking forward to it and until then have a great day
