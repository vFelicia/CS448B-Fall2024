hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse this is jesse and today we're going to test out keystone js i've never used keystone so i don't know if it's going to work i don't know how this is going to go this is for our our big project project 5 which would be the main website for the university that i work at we've already pulled some data and put it into a wordpress database so my sequel and that works and we might end up going with that but i thought it would be worth it to test out a javascript based content management system so that we could be full stack javascript uh so that's we're gonna do today i um i can see in the live chat here uh harshit is worried about graphql in it and i was a little bit too so i found uh on github that somebody had already set up next.js which is what we've been using with graphql and keystone all together now i don't know that i would like you know everything about the way they did it but for today i think it's worth it just to use what they've done to get us started just to see if we like it no sense in trying to customize everything early on if you know we're not even sure if we're going to use it if anybody knows of an open source headless javascript cms that we could use i'm still open to that because keystone is not maintained as far as i know uh let me pull over on my screen some some info about uh keystone so i'm gonna switch views here okay so let's check this out um okay so something was changed a month ago so yeah it's not i mean some of these are two years ago yeah the la the latest uh release came out in may of 2016. so you can see there's been some other stuff going on but it's really like i don't i don't know how i feel about using something that that seems to be not actively maintained anymore there's some activity but i'm just not i don't know we'll look at it we'll take a look at it and we'll see um we'll see how it goes so this is what i thought i'd use now obviously this is not a popular repository right we've got eight stars two forks um but what this does do is it uses you know the three things that we're already planning on using uh now to be to be honest i don't care quite as much about them using next because that's all going to be decoupled but it does have this which is what i what i really care about um graphql with keystone so let's try it out um we do need i do need to make sure that i have the latest version of which i don't remember if i do or not so let's try this out i'm pretty sure i have done this recently i'm i'm probably don't have um the latest version though hmm oh cool i should say and i can just homebrew um homebrew is uh like a project um it's like a package manager for your mac all right so let's try this out uh hey i see some stuff in the live chat andre asked if i'm canadian uh no i am not canadian so nothing wrong with being canadian but um i was born in west virginia here in the united states okay what's the uh what's the package for okay i found it um i think i've run a brew update recently but no reason not to run it again seems to be taking a while all right i'll let that go all right cool i went through all right so uh if you're just joining uh we're getting the prerequisites ready to install keystone uh so all right cool i was just installing and it looks like i i did already install this so i just need to upgrade all right so i'll let that go uh now let's clone this i mean it looks like i have everything else i need all right we're going to clone this and again i'm just doing this to get up and running as fast as i possibly can with graphql and keystone basically i just want to see how easy is it to add new post types and to navigate the um the editor and the cms i know there's already a demo online but i can't get in there and you know see the code and change it um like i'd like i want to the question hassam says what is collaboration on github um i is there something on github called collaboration i don't know i'm not sure who some uh does anyone else know um having answered the question what is collaboration on github unless you mean collaboration in general um i'm not sure uh if you could clarify for me um maybe i could give you a better answer all right still not quite done with homebrew installing all right great so we have there now let's do a git clone and i'll add this should i fork this first yeah let me let me fork it first and then i'll have a repo i can make changes and i don't know how long we'll be testing this out it would probably be better um so let's find this and fork it into here well that was fast awesome okay now let's let's clean this one um john b said i should spork it sporkit will let you fork the repo but also spoon it when you're feeling lonely oh what is my pass race uh joby i'm gonna remember that one and use it at some point in the future if you don't mind let's see i need to find my ssh passphrase and lastpass and all right and i think we've done this before but if you get asked for your ssh passphrase and you don't feel like typing it in again if you just do ssh add and hit enter uh it'll ask you for it again and then if you put it in then it it won't ask you again uh at least until until you restart your computer i think if you restart your computer then it'll ask you again but at least for that session you'll be um you'll be fine i'll get harsh it says brew services start mongodb aha do i just need to run it like that like later on when we need to use it or do i need to do that now all right so we have this we have a clone let's go what is that called keystone there we go let's run yarn get all this stuff installed okay harsha says i need to run that command now brew services start mongodb so i'm going to copy that and when this is finished uh we'll run that as well thank you harshit oh cool blake said the ssh ad worked uh so awesome i'm glad glad it worked it is useful to you oh also i have a meeting at three so this is gonna be a short stream i really hope i don't forget about my meeting at three i'm sure that someone one of my bosses will come in and knock on my door if i do forget and they won't be happy um all right i wanted to start the stream earlier but i was updating my computer to the latest um mac version so it is at high sierra and it took way longer than i thought it would take uh so and then when i finally got it restarted things were so slow at first so i did not get the streams scheduled earlier like i wanted to if you anyway some air is coming up i hope this isn't this isn't going to ruin the install let's see huh well that's no good hmm all right harsh it's saying that that fork is old oh man i hope it's not too old okay so harsh it's saying maybe it's trying to install things that don't even exist anymore well that may have just ruined my plan here and all right shoot um all right i this isn't the only keystone graphql repository that i found so let me just find the other ones that i had open and we can check out another one i mean i really don't know which one is better so i just happened to pick this one so i needed something all right oh roger said been running linux for years and never heard of ssh ad thanks oh you're welcome cool well if i can't get anything else to work at least i i was able to share that that little helpful bit uh with you all trying to get so i'm trying to adjust the screen i think i kept going i keep going off screen i can't tell which way all right that's that seems like it'll work all right uh all right let me i can't find the window let's see where is it at where all right maybe i closed it and i i i really wanted to have this ready to go so we could just you know go quickly since i don't have a lot of time but uh it looks like may not happen keystone graphql okay it looks like keystone js uh the organization keystone.js on github actually has graphql helpers there but it looks like everything's two years old not sure how helpful that's going to be hmm all right well let's um all right let's just go with something else oops all right oh there's some things in the live chat let's see what's what's going on here um my freelance project first prototype can you give me any suggestions the freelance project is using next a custom graphql server an apollo client and serverside rendering um yeah a hardship sure i'd i'd be happy to give you uh suggestions on that so just let me know uh where that's at if i mean i'm assuming you have a repo for it uh so just you know send me that link you know on twitter or whatever and i'll try to i probably can't take a look at it today because i'll have a meeting and i have to leave right after that but at some point this week i i can definitely take a look at it all right harsh it's saying let's let's use word wordpress roger says every time someone publishes a php website a kitten dies wouldn't we wouldn't want to kill kittens right just said it is truth yeah um yeah harsh i'm the more i um the more i try to look into these different javascript alternatives to wordpress the more i keep thinking we're just gonna need to go with wordpress like it's just all right listen everybody who's interested in a side project i think there's really a need for a javascript cms that is open source basically the javascript version of wordpress right so if anybody really wants a side project that could potentially be adopted by a lot of people make javascript wordpress certainly don't have the time to do it but i'd be happy to help um so all right i don't think we have time to do it before this project is due but potentially we could work on it longer term and then try to switch over to it at some point with this project all right so enough enough of me talking um let's see okay just let's make this together hey hey uh steven and um jewel it's jule i'm assuming that's pronounced jewel if it's not please let me know and i will do my best to pronounce it correctly horses let's make this together using graphql suggest the name portions you just mentioned here in the chat strappy cms i have never heard of strappy cms let them eat cake php and have it too um and check out strappy bla all right blake says go to keystone.com getting started that's where that was actually just where i was about to go the only reason i didn't want to do it before is that they're they're getting started guys as you use a yeoman uh generator which i haven't used yeoman for a long time i don't even know if i have it installed on this machine i'm not opposed to using it just to get things up and running it would probably be pretty fast but um i i don't know uh we could i'm checking out strappy right now on my other screen um all right i'm checking out their github repo they are definitely way more up to date they have things that have been updated just a few hours ago it looks like let's see yeah it's all javascript it has a lot more stars here api cash well you can work with whatever database you want which that's awesome okay i'm i'm definitely gonna look into um strappy more all right we're probably going to do a stream tomorrow on strappy today let's just use this yeoman generator install this thing just to see how it goes right because i named the stream i said in the name of the uh the stream that we're gonna use uh keystone i even put their logo in the thumbnail for the video so let's at least install it and mess around with it uh just a bit after after this whole mess here with getting errors trying to use this i i'm not confident but uh where's my i know i had the getting started here we go or am i here getting started yeoman yo keystone do i have you i don't think i have yo installed anymore hey i do have yeoman installed awesome get me out of here okay yo keystone and they're not the generator yeoman keys oh i need to install it don't i there was another getting started there we go this one is like the super easy version of the getting started there we go install generator keystone there we go i it's been years since i've used keystone i didn't or since i've used yeoman uh i did not even remember that she had to install the generator first yeoman used to be amazing like back in the day i remember being so excited about it but and then it's just like nobody used it i said no can i just say no whatever um definitely says if i'm gonna use one why not sure let's let's get everything user's good enter an email address temporary password receiving plain text and changes what what is going on i don't know what password i just gave that yes new director chemo configuration sure um i don't want any of this stuff yes that was a lot more questions than i thought all right let me see i'm going to catch up with the live chat while that's installing that's correct now rook said i know nothing about it i remembered the name uh don't kill me if it turns out bad nah so far it looks really good so that's awesome thanks for that oh okay it was already mentioned by shaw at lib high oh i must have just missed it when it was mentioned before so sorry that i missed that and then endurojs.com okay so blake says there's an enduro js.com which has a has a nice full screen video hero section check that out nice all right let's check this out that myself documentation cool actually says themes in it this is like a wow this actually does look like javascript wordpress actually if if we wanted to make a front end too coupled with this i would probably go with this i think um what was the other one strappy strappy looks better just from like the five seconds that i looked at it and a little bit of time i looked at this i'll i'm gonna really check out strappy for this project but if i were to do another project where i wasn't trying to have a headless cms this one looks really nice not bad um okay ours is saying ghost is the most popular cms for javascript i've heard about ghosts before but i've never used it oh okay so ghost is like a uh subscription based service right wow finally wow all right let's check it out okay so uh we act we have a keystone keystone site going all right so this is not the latest version so the uh the beta i think is like the 4.0 beta of keystone was supposed to be built with react uh at least for the admin panel i think and this is not this is not react this is uh jquery and bootstrap so let's check it out i think if we type in keystone that's how we get to the back end yep all right so um i don't know what my password was i was supposed to get an email about it so let's let me check my email here maybe i didn't i thought i was going to but it's possible that i um that i didn't let's see okay cool harshit says you can actually host ghost yourself that's that's cool oh cool john b no the password is admin awesome thanks john b i tried to change the password but it didn't work so i guess it ended up being admin i was just gonna make it one two three four because all right that seems like a good password no one would ever guess that create a new post it's actually really fast i mean it's running locally so it should be fast so i guess it's not a good test yeah i mean this i really wish is this the beta that says it's the beta oh okay you know what this this is the latest version because it the back end is running in react they're still using jquery which is weird but um hey i mean we i wrote a site with jquery and react so i shouldn't didn't say anything actually i built two sites like that um yeah before when i checked that wasn't the admin area so i was mistaken all right well i tell you what here's my take on keystone if if you are looking for something to run a small site that's like probably not for a client and you're you know you're not that worried about it it's not there's not a lot on the line like it's on ecommerce site or something like that i think keystone's pretty cool it's nice especially if like if you want to use it headless i mean i don't know if i would want to use the the full cms uh with with the front end coupled to it uh but i guess you could uh so if you don't mind that it's probably not going to get updated often and i don't know if there's any support with it but the back end seems super easy to use and to customize it it's all javascript so i think this is actually kind of a cool thing if you want to take this almost as a boilerplate customize it on your own there's little chance that an update will come out and mess up what you've done right so so i think that would be cool to just fork it and customize it do what you want with it i mean i assume it's mit license i guess we could check yeah it's mit so you could do you know you do whatever you want with it i mean who knows maybe there are forks out there that that are being updated that are awesome but i don't think it's the right thing for our project i really kind of hoped it was especially since there were already some builtin graphql things out there that people were doing uh but ultimately i would say probably the main reason that i don't think we're going to use it now is just the lack of updates you know as i said you know there were some updates a month ago you know but it's likely not you know it's it's not maintained like i said the first actual release you know the major release was was over a year ago about a year and a half ago and although there are some newer things here in the beta you know even the newest thing was october 23rd and then before that was all the way back in january 25th so that that bothers me a little bit you know this isn't you know this isn't just a side project website this is the main website for the university this is by far the most important project that i've worked on since i've started here so i don't know if if you all disagree on on that assessment of keystone for this project please let me know in the live chat or in the comments or even you know twitter direct message whatever you want so i think it was worth it to check it out so we're a little bit more familiar with it i was kind of impressed at how easy it was to start if you use that yeoman generator i mean that was really really fast and and we have it all up and running you know i mean potentially you know you could throw in some posts here publish this thing and you know you you have a website with that you can have users with admin panel all that you know you have it up and running in you know less than an hour depending on how much content you want to put on it first so i mean that's impressive that's really impressive so this is one of the things like i really wish that this had been maintained more because i think it's you know this this is still pretty cool even though it's it hasn't been updated in a while yeah so i think if if this gets maintained or updated or somebody takes over on a fork this could be really cool but anyway i'm probably not gonna go with this and now it's a great time for me to stop go to the live chat answer some questions uh because i'll have i have a meeting in less than 20 minutes anyway so this stream maybe turned out not exactly what i how i thought it would but we still got to try out keystone uh so if anybody's interested in it at least you know how to at least the easiest way that i've found to install it and that is the recommended way with yeoman all right so let me go to the chat now and i'll answer any questions that you have so you have questions put it in there uh if we end up going too close to my meeting i will have to stop so there's a possibility i might not get to all the questions but i will do my best to answer everything let's see so i'm going to scroll up a bit because i think i did miss some things okay blake asked earlier about what i mean by headless cms and uh horseshoe gave an answer but i i just want to kind of answer on the video in case you're watching later i think that's that's probably a common question i apologize for just using that term without explaining it uh so a content management system like something like wordpress if you're familiar with that normally at least it has been the case with a lot of content management systems that the front end what the users see right the client facing portion of it is tied closely to the cms so for instance in wordpress you install wordpress and it comes with these themes right so you can change the themes right there from the cms and the theme is all the html and css and everything that it users are going to see when you go with a headless cms your website that the users see interacts with the content management system through an api so they're not tied together uh and in our case what will happen is the this the client the stuff that the client sees that site which we're building react will be hosted on an entirely different server than our content management system so there'll be no part of that content management system that controls you know kind of the look of the site so that's what we mean by headless and you can run normal cms's as headless cmss which which is what we've done with wordpress several times now and what we may end up doing again for this project so anyway thanks for asking that blake so if anybody if i ever use some terms that you're not familiar with feel free to ask don't worry if you know you think you might look like a newbie or whatever but it doesn't matter i would rather much rather you ask right off the bat then have to go through the whole stream not understanding what i'm saying and if you don't know what the term is i bet you there's other people watching that also don't know what the term is and there'll be people watching later on the recordings that don't know so uh so please um ask let's see okay cool harshit i um i got the link here to that you put in here which is to your blog so i'm gonna check that out i'll put that in my browser right now i'll check that out when i can later on nice very nice i just glanced at what what popped up immediately and and that's looking really good harsh it okay okay harshit was mentioning using ghost for his blog and uh says ghost uses markdown in the editor that's actually really cool if you're familiar with markdown that would be really cool if you're not familiar with markdown that might it might be a little bit difficult but i found it pretty easy to pick up on i'm no expert at markdown but uh it it's kind of nice all right steven says jesse just a shout out to you running these streams great job really shows how a programmer works makes me feel better about looking stuff up online all the time awesome that's hey that's what i wanted from these streams right i want everybody to see how much i mess up on the job and and how much i have to learn and work through things so i'm glad that uh that that's helping you feel better about that uh but that's i mean that's what we do right we we always are constantly learning uh as we go okay and stefan asked the same question about the headless cms so um so great see i knew there was more than one person that would ask that let's see rook says that back end looks like bootstrap yeah bootstrap uh was used for this for keystone okay man who says my first uh oss suggestion ever being used by jesse keystone yes suggestion yes thank you manu um like i said there are definitely parts of keystone that i'm really impressed with um yeah definitely just i'm just kind of hesitant about that about it not being actively maintained now or at least that's the appearance that i that i have if anybody that works on keystone is watching or ever watches this um please set me straight if i'm wrong about that or if anybody knows anyone ever hears about a fork of keystone that is being actively maintained i'd love to see that as well you know unless i hear about it this week it's probably not going to be what we use for this site because we got to move on but i'd still like to check it out and maybe even use it you know one of our projects later on if i can let's see oh philip says how about apostrophe cms i i'll have to check that out i've heard of that one as well also check that out um i'm getting a lot of suggestions i'll definitely have to do my research tomorrow morning and um and then we'll try out one of these other javascript cms's on the stream tomorrow okay phillip says uh says my friend is using strappy so phillip yeah i'd love to hear how strappy's going so if you happen to talk to your friend at some point soon um you know ask about what they think about strappy uh because i'd love to hear from somebody who's actually using it all right uh homeroom says i have a request will you take the chat screen to your screen when you answer questions in chat i want to see the chat while i watch the video later thank you uh on room that's actually a good idea and i did do that once unfortunately when i did that somebody typed in some things that weren't very nice uh and kind of it ruined it so um i'm not i'm not going to do that i i really wish i could do that but especially since i'm streaming uh while i'm at work for the university i just uh and it's on behalf of free code camp i'd really rather not have something crazy come up in the chat um i mean maybe i could go through later on and like blur it out but anybody that watched it live and watches it you know until i get a chance to go blurred out would see those things so i don't want to get the precode camp or my university in trouble with anything so that's why i'm not going to do it uh if if i can think up or if any you can think up some way that we could i don't know protect against that then i'm open to it but until then uh i'll just do my best to kind of read out what's in the chat so anyway that's a really good suggestion i said unfortunately somebody somebody ruined that uh so i just you know i don't want to expose you all and you know everybody else watching to um any type of you know craziness right uh ahadimi says exactly what i was about to ask what key features made you choose keystone um yeah so basically i think i'm not going to choose keystone officially but what led me to it at least to want to try it uh was i saw that there were other people that were using keystone with graphql and we definitely want to use graphql i saw that it was completely javascript based which i really liked that it was all javascript uh that way we can be full stack javascript and not have to worry about you know using learning another language sorry yawning a lot um yeah so those were the main things that attracted me to keystone i mean obviously open source mit license right i mean uh it seemed like it was somewhat you know easy to you know mess around with and change uh so that's what attracted me to it uh in the first place and it's i kept seeing it uh when i would look up like javascript cms it would come up frequently so i thought it was worth a try all right harshad says you can block offensive stuff in the settings i think we're already blocking offensive things um but i mean they're you can't block everything right uh there are a lot of things that won't get caught by those filters so i mean i'm i'm open to rethinking that if enough people think it would be of of a benefit to the stream you know to have the chat up on the on the screen like that um i'll reconsider it let me know and let me know what you all think i'm just gonna have to be like really vigilant about making sure that uh things don't get in you know on the stream um you know i want i want to keep this stream like you know pg rated you know because you know young young people uh you know watch this too you've had you know like young kids and things watch this show before uh so anyway uh i wouldn't i wouldn't want to you know expose them to anything that their parents wouldn't want them to see something all right cool man who says you asked for suggestions in the first video for cms i remember it i'm feeling good about this one of the life's goals accomplished awesome well i'm glad you're happy about it i'm glad i could i could help you accomplish one of your life goals here all right blake has to go see it blake yeah hopefully he'll be back tomorrow and uh all right let's see harshet har i see the ip address you just posted so uh i will check that out okay uh john b says maybe ask free code camp to provide a moderator for the streams or to potentially promote someone who watches these a lot to do moderation yeah okay i i that's actually not a bad idea i've thought about that before i always just thought if we end up getting a lot of people in the live chat that would be useful uh so far it's always been enough for me to handle but i'll think about that um all right well i have to go now and uh and go over to my my meeting so um anyway thank you so much actually how should i i see your project your freelance project right now uh so i'm gonna take a look at that um but i just want to let you know i saw it okay i have to go now thank you so much for watching i will most likely be back tomorrow around 2 p.m uh eastern time and we'll try out another javascript content management system i will not be testing content management systems later than this week because we need to get get moving so we're gonna make a decision this week the sooner the better uh and then we'll move on to some other stuff but until then it's fun to to um to test some things out so again thank you all for watching uh so glad for for all the help and all the suggestions that that you all have given and um uh until tomorrow have a great day
