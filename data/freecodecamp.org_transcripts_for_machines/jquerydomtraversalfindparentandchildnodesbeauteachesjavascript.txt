hello this video is all about traversing the dom using jquery it's all about trying to find specific html elements based on the relation to other elements you can find parent elements child elements i have this html set up in here to show a lot of different parent elements and child elements you can see how one element is related to another because these green boxes basically show what elements contain other elements i just have css that applies to everything to make this all work here so you can see this div is the parent of this unordered list here and you can see this unordered list is the child of the div here we have a bunch of children of this span also all these elements here in the middle are siblings of each other they're all on the same level you can see that same thing in the html that's how you can tell parents and children okay i'm gonna bring up the javascript here so we can just focus on the jquery we're gonna use i've already added jquery to the project you can check my first video in the series to learn how to do that okay i just pasted in some code here we have the jquery selector to select the the li element and here's here's the new thing we're learning dot parent now we're going to get the parent of the li element and then we're just going to change the css we're going to change the color chocolate and the border is also going to be changed to chocolate i decided to use a tasty color this time so let's run that and you can see the parent of the li element has turned to chocolate so here's the li element and here's the parent the ul element now if i change this to span here i run that the interesting thing about that is there are two spans we have the span here and we have the span here the parent of this man is the li the parent of this span is the other span another thing we can do is instead of using parent do parents plural with an s at the end that's going to get all the parents all the way up to the root element so if i run that you can see now there's a bunch of things even things that we didn't even know about including this other div here have turned to chocolate border now another one we can do to find parents let's find the parent of the li element so instead of parents here we're gonna do parents until so this is going to find all the elements between two so starting at the li element and going to let's do the div element so let's see what happens there okay so it started at the li element it ended at the div element every element in between is just this ul element okay the the children method goes in the opposite direction so instead of the parents until i'm gonna change this to children and we're not gonna put anything in the parentheses here and let's run that and see what happens and as you can see this only is going to traverse a single level down in the dom tree so we're just going to get the span element if there were multiple li elements we would get the children of each of those elements now i'm going to change this to span so now we're going to get the children of the span elements and you can see all of these are the children of the span elements there's a bunch of children this of the span elements so inside the parentheses here we can put specifically which child we want so i'm going to put h2 and then run that and now it's only selecting the child of a span element that's an h2 element i'm also going to show you about find so i'm going to start this at ul and we're going to find all children after the ul element that are specific elements in this case i'm going to do span so we're going to start the ul element and then we're going to find all children that are span elements all the way down so let's run that so we found this span and this span and if you want to find all children not just the span elements you can put an asterisk here so it starts with the ul element then it finds all children that are any type of element and make some chocolate okay now we're going to talk about siblings i was telling you earlier that all these ones in the middle are siblings of each other i'm going to put h2 here and i'm going to use the method siblings nothing will be in the parentheses this time and we get all the siblings of the h2 element not the h2 element but all the siblings are now chocolate and you may want to just get specific siblings so i'm going to put p for the paragraph tag now we're just getting the siblings of an h2 element that are paragraphs i'm going to delete this here we're going to keep selecting the h2 element but now i'm going to show you the next method so the next just gets the next sibling so we were started on the h2 element and the next sibling is the h3 element and there's also next all so we started the h2 element and then we get all the rest of the elements afterwards that are siblings and then we have next until this time i'm going to start the span element and if i go back into the html you'll see that this first span element has the class child so i'm gonna do span dot child to select just this span element just the child span element and not the parent span element and we're using the next until method next until h3 so we start this this span here and we select all the elements between the span and h3 which is just h2 if we put a paragraph tag in here then we'll also select the h3 afterwards so i showed you next next all and next until the same things work with prev preval and prev until that just gets the previous element or all the previous elements or a previous until an element so i'll just give you one example of that just the prev if we run that we start this span and the previous element is the paragraph again you can also do prep all preventive okay those are all the main methods for traversing the dom finding parent and child elements check the description for a list of all the the methods we went through thanks for watching my name is beau carnes don't forget to subscribe and
