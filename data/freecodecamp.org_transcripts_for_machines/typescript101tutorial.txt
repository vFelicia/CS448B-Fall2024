what we're gonna be going over today is typescript what is it how to get started we're gonna be even talking about the TS link config and setup and we're gonna be talking about the major parts of typescript so that you know what to expect in what it all contains so what is typescript and why should we use it superset of JavaScript it was built by Microsoft I so it's being maintained by Microsoft it's an open source project more or less so you have a lot of the community contributing it to it it's one of Microsoft's open source items that they they tend they they now are going in open source direction which is pretty cool at the end of the day what you get back is regular JavaScript one of the benefits to writing typescript as it tends to be less errorprone we're trying to apply static types to a dynamically typed language and that eliminates amer while yeah the concise it's adding a little bit more development time now he could argue that development time is made up because it lends code to be more readable and thus more maintainable as time and time goes on we have seen as developers so what are we going to be covering well we're going to showcase how to get started how to assign types on variables how to assign return types on functions we're going to be talking about classes a little bit although this is more that's more of an es6 item we're gonna be talking about string enums and number in ohms we're also going to be talking about interfaces intersection types briefly about access modifiers and then we're going to be talking about how to set up TS lint so that if you are doing typescript any want your code to to be more readable and maintainable how you can make sure that it's even better in adhering to the latest standards so that's what we're gonna be diving into let's go ahead and jump right in all right so to get started in typescript first thing you're gonna want to have as a node installed if you don't already you can use the current or the latest it doesn't really matter whatever works best for you it's all gonna work and then from there well I'll be using the Visual Studio code text editor you can use whichever one you want but often times people ask me what text editor I prefer what I use this is what I use for quite a few reasons I like the extensions I think it's very clean then intellisense is great in it and they also have a debugging tool though I don't use it very often so to get started with typescript the first thing that you need to do now that you have known install just go ahead and run this command I'll be using git bash if you have another terminal you can use that as well it doesn't really matter so we're gonna install typescript globally that's what this G is that's basically just gonna mean that we're gonna have access to the typescript commands moving forward in our application this will take just a second and let's go ahead and open up our text adder and get started alright so now that we have a project open let's go ahead and create a new file here to create a typescript file all you have to do is instead of creating an javascript file with the Jas file extension we're going to be using ATS in this case we're just gonna call it example that TS now we have access to typescript essentially now with Ariel compiler or not that that's a whole nother story but let's talk about you know how we might use typescript for instance in a very basic way in JavaScript when we were potentially create an array like so we'll call this example we would then go and set this array and we could have maybe some numbers in it now the JavaScript itself is gonna say hey I see this is an array no big deal but you see now when we hover over this it actually is inheriting a type here of a number array an array of numbers right now this is called implicit typing where when we're instantiating an object it's going to look at it and if it can inherit its type there's also explicit typing where you can say look I just want to actually tell it exactly that this is going to be a number array or perhaps it is going to be an array of several things including bullying's right so true and you'll start to see right now the power of type scripts were hey this is supposed to be a number array we have instantiated the type of saying look cannot you can get this air here saying look you're trying to do something to a number array that isn't a number and one way that we can modify this is to add a or property as well as a use any and we'll talk about what that is right now okay so sometimes because of the nature of JavaScript when we're dealing with dying a dynamically typed language we're trying to make it a little bit more static and start assigning types is we'll have a race where we may not have all the same data type so one way that we can handle that and this is with input and output we can use the or operator in our case here it's just a single pipe like so and then we'd say number or boolean array right now what this does here is to say hey we are expecting an array it could be number values it could be boolean values either one but it couldn't be for instance a string value right we're throwing in something like that that's not going to break it because those types don't exist in this array now let's go ahead and just get rid of this and there's this any property I want to talk about as well where any essentially is the way of doing the oldschool JavaScript to a degree right so all we're saying here is that this is an array the values and it could be anything we can also go ahead and assign any directly and say look this may change this may not be good this may be a down the road you know if this was a let this may actually go and become a string and that would be okay in our instance because we have said that is of type any now if we said this was an in ear ray we'd get an air here and say look this is not assignable you can't make a array a string it just doesn't make sense a week we don't want that and that's the power of types to give you an idea of hey how to prevent things like that it's also going to stop you from doing sort of crazy things if you're caught up in the moment where you're like hey I want to do an example dot map then you return an array and you can do some stuff right but if you try to call map let's say let's say we actually typed this all out element blah blah blah right and we write here we return you know element +1 or something right and let's say this was a number array right now that would work and we'll go ahead and get rid of that boolean so we could get a new value here so the x2 and we instead say you know what I want to change this year to a string I'm gonna say this is a string and I set this equal to an empty string you're gonna catch this air here where it say hey say right right there is no map map does not exist on type string it only exists on type object so what happens here is we don't have to wait for our code to run and compile and then you know hopefully this function fires off and then we get a console.log air our Visual Studio code and the intellisense and typescript is intelligent enough to tell you hey we have an error let's look at what happened here in regards to our types and be able to fix it so that we don't have to have those errors go into the code now so far we've talked about assigning types to variables but you can also assign types to functions as well right so let's say we have a function called add and it has a number one and a number and what we want to do is return num1 plus num2 so not only can we assign it on variables assigned types on various it's going to zoom this in a little bit we can also go ahead and assign it on parameters where we are expecting a number here and we are expecting a string here for instance maybe we're gonna move it to you know a number or a string so we now can assign that but not only that we can say in this function we expect it to return a number throwing a colon on here as well so now this function is a lot more detailed it gives you a better idea of it's more descriptive in terms of what this function is actually supposed to do and sort of the type metadata here if you wanna look at that way and we have some checks in here so where if we say hey let's return as a string it's gonna say you know hold up hold up Dylan this type number is not assignable string because this isn't working here so maybe you'd go in and you'd say you know what let me couldn't I need this as a number thanks for reminding me and now I'm gonna convert it to a string so you have that additional detail to a function as well checks dry cleaner more descriptive code that's easier to read and maintain are one of the great things about typescript is everything that we've talked about is optional in typescript it's just another way of types are optional now you can write in the TS linen and well showcase TS lint in a little bit later how we might be able to make it not optional if you wanted to but by default typescript is optional which means everything we're doing you don't have to do it's additional and I think you should because it's shown to be better code in terms of less airs going in production but what you need to remember is typescript is just a superset of JavaScript it's just JavaScript to the next level essentially and so say we wanted to compile this down and that's what would happen typically you'll be working with like web pack and a production environment and it would just take your type script files and compile them the JavaScript when it does your build that goes out and is actually being used in production and so in our case you know our production application is just our example here so how might we manually do this so that we could see hey I actually want to see that it is just JavaScript that's happening here and nothing nothing crazy we're just assigning some additional data to Djoser well we can use this TS c command which you'll have if you finish installing it types is the typescript package we did earlier and then you name the file right so in our example here we would do example we're already in this folder using our terminal here dot TS and you'll see a second later we now have this example J's file notice how there's no types notice how nothing has really changed except the fact that we removed our types from this and it has compiled it to something that the browser your browser knows and can work with so keep that in mind is what we're writing in typescript is we're adding additional things to provide context for development purposes to write cleaner and better code but at the end of the day javascript itself is a static ly typed language that doesn't fully understand a lot of the more complexities when it comes to types and objectoriented programming so you can see this is as to me Tucker is very readable but even more readable when it compiles just down to JavaScript so let's say for whatever reason you don't want to create a paid typescript file and you're not ready to make it so you just want to do maybe some type checking in your code what we could do here is we can use this slash slash and go ahead and throw at TS check you'll notice there's some other ones there's ignore that essentially lets you ignore type checking on that there is I don't even what no check does I don't ignore that but TS check here and this will say hey let me just do a check to see if there's any errors in your code right here so let's say that we wanted to we had a number for instance or we said hey let y equal 5 and then normally you'd say yeah let's go ahead and map that and that's what we want to do we want to map something and then I have an element's here don't want to return true or something like that and it's a a does not max on type number the only reason that shows up is because we have our at TS check here to say hey treat this javascript file as a type for a file so that we can at least make some checks that go along with it it's not going to add more to the readability of the code which is equally important but is the very least is gonna say hey are there any clear heirs and to in this moment guys if you're writing JavaScript I would encourage you to have this on here so that you can sort of you know see hover over this and say look map does not exist on type number you're like oh let me let it click in a little bit why that is and you might you might pick up a few things that way so that's TS check which i think is really important so emails are something that's new to JavaScript and we're let's say we wanted to store a set of data that reference something and like we'd want it to be the same throughout the application one way that we might be able to do that is with a number or a string enum we're gonna go ahead and create a a new file here and we're just gonna call this example dot enum dot TS and we're going to export here a enum and this that we're gonna what are we gonna call this we'll call these art numbs you know and what's gonna have in here is let's go ahead and call this number one and you'll notice that by typically when you're dealing with enums it's going to be an all capped enum name as well as all cap properties and so we'll call this number one and then we'll call this num too and what this is going to be able to do if we go ahead and import this into our type script file here and this is what we call this our nomes enum import known genome from example you know now we'll have access to it right so what this is gonna do is say look whenever we have our whenever we instantiate numsy namnam you know num1 this is essentially going to be equal to one and this one is essentially going to be equal to two excuse me I went off the trail there this is actually zero on one because we never start anything at one and two I was like that's weird why did I say that but you'll see here that this is essentially zero and one now we are studying the values here but even if we delete these values like so our number enum here will still have those values and so we can now assign an enum as a type as well so let's go ahead and say we want this to be a nums enum and we want this to be a nums enum as well and what we want to do here is just add those two numbers so what we could do is let's say we want to call this function add and we're gonna pass in nums enum dot num1 and num2 num2 and now we're getting those values from the enum and if we actually tried to just pass in a number here which passed in three I'm surprised that actually worked because we should be passing in just an own genome but it gives you an idea that we should have that I think if we had a TS lint this would be a little bit more strict I think it's being lenient because it's a number type but what we would get after we compiled this right so let's go ahead and we already talked about how to compile with the TSC command and it's gonna build it let's go to our example Jess you also notice that it oh I think it's doing that for all of our folders in the area but you'll see here this is a lot more complicated JavaScript but for us to get a similar item of what we've got in our example enum TS right here which is a very readable much easier thing to understand this is actually what we would have had to do to be able to use it which is kind of crazy right because I don't know what that's doing at first glance that's that's craziness but here it's a little bit more intuitive right granted so part of typescript is actually taking new JavaScript and compiling it to older versions for so that even though it's less readable it is more functional it's not gonna break on bootleg browsers like Internet Explorer so here you'll see we'll add these numbers together and if we're to go ahead and run a quota for instance on this type share file I'm gonna save and everything and we consul blog I don't out a little bit it console.log the return of this add statement you'll see that we get 1 because this is 0 and this is 1 and it's getting those values from our genome now if we were to change these values and here or there it would reflect it because we're importing this but that's how we would create a a number he know now you can also create string enums these are a newer addition to typescript one reason you might have this is let's say that you have a dropdown that's never gonna change but you want the values to be all in one location and you want them to the users gonna select them and maybe at one day you'll edit them and you're using various files you could use an enum for that I've done it with like country codes and things like that and currency codes and where I wanted to keep a list of it so you could all you have to do here is now set this to a value this could be like hello and this could be a goodbye and now you've created an enum that's gonna break our code right because well in our example TS with that s files link apology but we now have a string enum that we can reference as well you can also define local types as well now there's sort of global types you can define define and those are more so called interfaces and we'll showcase that in a little bit let's say we wanted to define a type that we're going to only use in this file could use it at the type command and we'll just say we'll call it num num example and this is going to be equal to an object with a property and the scene being numb one of type number and this will be numb two of type number now we're not assigning values here we're defining a type so this is the key and this is the type of the key there is no value we are creating a type here with this type keyword and now instead of using our enums like we were using before perhaps we wanted to modify this to only take in one value and that value would be we have changes to the nomes right wanted to reflect what our code is here where our value would be our num example and now when we try and target this value here and we say nums you'll see then we hit this dot the num1 property and the num2 property type exists because we've defined it in our num example type so we can do num num 1 and num stop num two and then of course we have to go ahead and if we want to throw a value in here we have to throw a value in here that makes sense right we have num1 and then maybe that's 1 and you'll notice we're still getting here because we don't have all the values in here to showcase that but now that we do and it matches this type everything's hunkydory and we're good to go so that's how we would define a type now as I mentioned this type here is good only in this local file now a better way of defining a type and sometimes in the TS lint and the standard seems to be to get away from defining types and more so defined interfaces so we would do it like so we'll say num example dot interface dot TS now this is just a file naming convention that I typically follow but we want to export a interface usually interfaces are denoted with an I in the name of the class too to let everyone know that it is a interface it's not required but we're gonna go ahead and go with it numbs example so now that we have that we could go ahead and pass an object here which is num1 and that's a number and then num2 and that's a number and you're saying a gentleness is very similar to what we were doing just a moment ago with the type and that is true however types are declared within the file and this this ABS a little bit of a readability issue as well as we want to keep our code dry we don't want to repeat ourselves so if there's ever an instance in which we would need to use this this interface again this essentially this type here we can whilst we can't reuse types so that's one way one one main difference between interfaces and types really types there's essentially being deprecated at this point in time so I would say stick with interfaces if you're looking to do that so there's also well access modifiers which are an object or anything that's new to JavaScript as well because we don't really have them and they aren't really real in the sense of like hey this is a development access modifier it doesn't really matter once it all compiles down but it's equally as important and eventually they may come to exists as static types will eventually come to exist in JavaScript in one way or the other so let's say we have a class here and we'll call this example dot class TS classes are something that got added into es6 and we have a great way of creating classes in in typescript as well so it's very similar export class so that we can use it if we wanted to right and our class will just call this example class and we're gonna create some properties by default if we don't assign anything we say hey what do we want property let's say this is a person instead of an example we'll call this our person class and what might a person property be I might have something like a first name and that might be a string and then we might have something like a last name that might be a string and then we might have something like an age and that will be a boolean so we've defined our class here which looks very similar to interface at this point in time because we haven't added all the items that a a class essentially allows us and by default these are what are called public properties what public means and you could put them on here and typically I'd like to I like to be more descriptive with my code some people will say I'd rather just look at the code and be able to see that that's what it does but these are public properties that mean that the user when they're clicking on a page can access it and that other parts of the application can access it there's also things called private properties private properties and let's say age will say bank account all right yeah what nobody wants to share that and this will be a number this is something that within your application you can use but the user who would be consuming the application the client wouldn't be able to call this function that's really hit at the end of the day and so these are usually functions that other functions are going to call to hide some of your code and properties for that matter there's also protected as well which essentially means that it's going to be inherited from another another class in this case we don't that's the only way you can access to it I won't worry too much about that but there is another great one which I called read which is readonly so in our case first name and last name once we set a first name and a last name is not likely it's going to change right so we want to have the readonly access modifier meaning that once it's set you can't reset this elsewhere you can't update this elsewhere in the code because this is a readonly property it can only be read it can never be written to so those are some some t eslint access modifiers and of course if you're not familiar with you you know constructors you can pass in data and set these properties and your TS link class as well so you would do something like oh well this stuff first name is equal to data first name and then you could create public or you know public example public functions or you could create private functions as well as you know protected so these are how you might use them on functions as well so I want to talk about decorators a little bit these are an experimental part of JavaScript they eventually may make their way into it they're currently in typescript in angular they're used pretty extensively and I just wanted to give an example we're not going to talk about how creating a decorator and all that sort of stuff because it gets a little academic when we go into it and honestly I haven't found any use cases in my own personal like vanilla JavaScript where I need to create a decorator but they are used in angular so I think it's worth mentioning so a decorator is usually denoted by this @ symbol and then this a word in our case it's the component decorator and this what the point of this is is it will normally go before your classes and it adds some metadata that maybe your class is going to need to be able to perform and use and stuff that's not going to change you know in our case it adds a selector it adds a place where this is going to load in the view and then add some CSS files that are gonna be with it so you can make a decorator do about just store about any data they connect and do things but I wanted to bring it up we're not gonna create it again but I think it's worth just mentioning all right let's talk a little bit about intersection types just a little bit more of an advanced thing and I honestly have never used a look again hey there's a video where we're trying to learn so let's add some stuff in here do use so let's say that we had we imported our interface that we created earlier I'm going to go ahead and import with all this items example from not slash another example that interface so what we can do here is we can actually merge items together merge types together and one thing to be careful of is if you are overriding property values which is why it's usually frowned upon when you're doing this but in our example we have a number one and number two property so let's go ahead and close that close that jump back in here and let's change this to number three and number four so we don't have any any issues here but what we can do is let's define a value here and we can actually create a new type where we say this type and we'll call this intersection type intersection is equal to the items example and the num example type that we defined as well and what this is essentially going to do is give it get combine those two together and allow us to have those values so when we go ahead and we type intersection here it's in Section I guess what it's going to expect is that we have num 3 and this is you know throw number in and number 4 and we throw a number in as well so you can combine types as well although there found a reason and do it something you can do just be careful I guess is my word of caution now hopefully by now you've kind of seen the power of typescript and we're gonna take it one step further we've covered everything I wanted to cover about typescript thus far but another thing that I wanted to talk about is setting up TS Lynne if you've never used a linting tool before what it basically is like Jaya Jaya slant as well is a way to say hey I want my code to stick to a standard format and so that there's a space here this would be a linting error that's dirty code in that there's no semi clone here that would be in lint in there it's dirty code and make sure that I'm writing code like a developer should is really the point of a TS lint array linting option we're gonna go and get you started so that you can start writing code that when employers look at they can see that is of a professional nature now again I'm using Visual Studio so where you can get started to search for TS lint here you'll see it has four point seven million downloads it's probably one of the most used eye items there is so just go ahead and install that in the visual studio code to get going here and we'll talk a little and we're gonna have to reload and we'll talk a little bit about what this is gonna do for us at the end of the day okay after you have the extension installed what we're gonna do is we're in your CTS Lane and NIT command to install okay now that we have the TS Lin extension install we actually need to install the TS Lane NPM package globally so we're just gonna do NPM install gee remember how we did I served in this case it's gonna be Tia slow so once that stone installing should just be a second here we are now going to go ahead and create a TS lint file using TS lint and knit and you'll see here we jump back to here we have this TS link json now what this is basically going to give us is it's going to have some default rules and a bunch of other things that we can override just set what rules we find important when it comes to our linting you'll see already when we jump into some of our files we already have airs here and it'll tell you when you hover over it trailing whitespace in this case it means that we have actually spaced out manually so spaces here that the compiler are saying need to exist and that we don't need that so let's delete that and then you'll see here what is this this block is empty there should be no empty blocks of code right that shouldn't be a thing so it's telling us like hey put code here or get rid of it same thing here we can have that and we could absolve this by putting a comment if we need it an empty block or there's ways to disable TS lint so you also see like we have a white space right here this is not clean code to have these spaces now there's a lot of TS lint rolls and you can override them and in some cases you'll see here like an all files should end with a a extra line at the end there's some compiler uses for that but that's the convention but you can you can hover over this and they'll tell you so there's a couple things that you can do you can do /t eslint disable and this will disable all the TS late tracking while you're developing from that line down in this folder so again you can go and set some custom rules for your TS lint they're going to have the recommended ones and that's what I recommend if you're using typescript you should probably be using and unless you're working in a production environment that has a different standard for whatever reason what the language itself recommends it's Microsoft maintains TS lint it's Microsoft who makes typescript so that's my personal opinion but if you did want to set rules or override rules for your TS slin this is the the page where you can go and get all of it and you can see there are a ton of rules of what you can modify here and every new iteration of typescript has additional rules as they are getting stricter or modifying some things and and going from there so keep that in mind when you are working with typescript that TS lint and if you were saying look down I didn't sell me on top security I don't know how I couldn't but you didn't sell me on the importance of it but if you're just like I'm sticking with JavaScript fine that's completely fine you should probably be doing linting in your javascript and you can get ajs lint or Annie s lint package you can see here is lint has 7.1 million downloads and it's being used quite often as well and it works similarly it's just a little bit of setup so I do encourage you to do that but as always guys I hope you enjoyed this video I hope you found it helpful instructional and I hope by the end of it you can get up and get going with typescript I've actually been loving it for the last eight nine months I've been working in it and I plan to continue working
