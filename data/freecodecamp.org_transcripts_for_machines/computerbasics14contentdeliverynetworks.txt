in this video we are going to talk about something called a cdn a content delivery network now the concept of a cdn isn't that hard to wrap your head around what a cdn does is make a faster and smoother user experience by delivering content to the user faster it doesn't have to go through all the channels of the internet it creates a faster and more direct route from the site to the user when i first was learning about cdns i got really confused because i thought well doesn't everybody benefit from that who's paying for the service is that the user that will pay for a cdn to make their internet faster or is that the website that pays a cdn to deliver their content and it's the latter a cdn is hired by a website or in some cases developed by a website it's its own cdn then that cdn pays an internet service provider to help determine the fastest routes now what you need to know about cdns in the big picture is they are hired by sites or created by sites to make the user experience faster an example of a cdn that you should know about as a developer is how google hosts languages like jquery if you link to jquery from google's library instead of uploading it yourself to your site that's going to be way faster for your user additionally if another site has used that same cdn for jquery it might be stored in that user's browser so it doesn't even have to load again at all as a user you need to know that cdns are everywhere you probably use cdns all the time without really even needing to be aware of it as a developer it's important for things like the languages that are hosted on google libraries you can use those in your sites and create a much faster user experience with less work on your end than before as a big company you might need a cdn to do something specifically for you you might want your site to be on the fast track to your users and you might need a cdn to do that all i want you to take away from this video is that cdns are content delivery networks they are all over the place and they make a faster user experience
