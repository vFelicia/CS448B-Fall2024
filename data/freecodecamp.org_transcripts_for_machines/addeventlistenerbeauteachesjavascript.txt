the ad event listener method attaches an event handler to the specified element without overwriting existing event handlers so you can add many event handlers to one element so here's the syntax uh you're going to put the element you're trying to access and then add event listener and then you're going to pass in the event and this is the type of event like click or Mouse down and then you're going to pass in the function and then the use capture this is a Boolean value specifying whether to use event bubbling or event capturing this is optional and I'll explain this in a little bit so we already have this HTML code displaying over here and we've already selected all of our elements so what I'm going to do is create an event listener so here we're attaching an event listener to the paragraph that's this first paragraph up here and it's going to be a click so on click we're going to run this function so we're just going to set the background of my div to light blue which it already is right now but if we reset everything it will go back to this Coral so now if I click the words it changes to light blue now this actually does the same thing that this other that onclick would do so when you use add event listener and pass and click for the event you could also do it like this you could set on click equal to this function here however there are some bad things about using onclick with on click you may have only one event assigned at a time so if you assign another event to on click it will overwrite the first event you also can't set the use capture so generally you want to use ad event listener however on click does work in all browsers and ad event listener does not work in older versions of Internet Explorer before Version 9 before Version 9 you have to use attach event instead of ad event listener okay instead of declaring our entire function in here we can actually just pass a function reference change text and then it will call that function then here it's going just going to set the text content of paragraph 2 to some other words so if I click here you can see that two things just happened the color changed to light blue and this text down here changed with onclick only this text would change because it would have overwritten the changing the background color but with add event listener both things can happen Okay this right here is an example of something besides click before we were using the click event now we're using the mouse over event so if I bring the mouse over the first div and we see it changes to dark khaki for div 2 now I'm going to talk about the used capture parameter this changes the order that things happen in so we have an event on the first paragraph and then we have an event on the first div so the my P and my div so when I'm clicking the paragraph I'm also clicking the div at the same time so the last parameter is is how it is determined which event to run first so let's add the last parameter here remember you don't need it because it defaults to false so the first event listener is going to run the change text function the second event listener is going to run the change text 2 function so we have to create that function so so here's change text 2 change text and change text 2 are both going to change the second paragraph text content and this one is going to just take the text contents and add the real answer onto the end and we're going to make a slight modification to change text one now both change text and change text two are going to take the text content that's already there and then append new text and this will help us see what order the function are executed in if I click the paragraph one and the div at the same time you can see first it's appending the real answer and then it's appending according to a Cornel publication the answer is 700b so if this last parameter is set to true the outermost elements event is handled first and then the inner however if this is set to false the innermost elements event is handled first and then the outer so let's see an example of that and now here we can see first it ains according to Cornell publication the answer is 700b and then it appends the real answer so again when two event listeners are attached to two different elements but they're going to run at the same time the last parameter tells what order to run them in okay the last thing I want to talk about is remove event listener with remove event list listener it's pretty selfexplanatory it just removes an event listener that you previously added you just have to make sure that the parameters that you pass in are exactly the same so it removes the exact one you can only remove an event listener where you are calling a function by a name here if you actually put in the function like this into the event listener then removing it won't work okay well thanks for watching my name is Bo KS don't forget to subscribe and remember use your code for good
