hey everybody it's jesse and welcome to live coding with jesse and today we're going to do really basic stuff so we have some html and we need to style it this is within the context of our react app but we're not really going to do any react stuff today so if you're here for react and you're used to the react stuff then you might be disappointed um but this should be a great stream for beginners because normally if you're interested in web development you start out learning html and css so if you're in that that area of just just starting out then stick around for this video and if you're a little bit more advanced in that area it would still be cool to stick around and help answer some questions uh in the live chat uh from some of the newer people and you never know i'll probably mess something up so help is always appreciated uh okay so i think i do have a meeting about this site that i will be creating in the stream in an hour and a half so i'm just gonna try to do two pomodoro sessions and uh some question answer and then finish up uh so we do have kind of a cap we can't go longer than i'd say hour and fifteen minutes uh that should give me enough time to get ready and get to my meeting okay so we have uh a good number of viewers so maybe some new people uh let me just explain briefly how this is gonna go so i'm about to start a pomodoro timer it's a 25 minute session we're going to code for 25 minutes and then i'm going to take a five minute break and check out the live chat answer any questions that you have in the live chat then i'm going to do another 25 minute session of code and then after that i'm going to answer all the questions in the live chat so if you ask a question in the chat and i haven't got to it yet just hang on and i will get to it before the stream is over and then if you can't stick around for the whole stream don't worry about it you can watch it later on uh it will be available here on the free code camp youtube channel uh there's more information in the description like links to the github repo and um i don't know what else i have in there i guess there's a lot of stuff i always just copy and paste it so i don't even know what i have in there but there are some helpful links in there okay so let's start this up and then i'm gonna go over here to my editor i happen to be using visual studio code sometimes i use atom but today i'm using visual studio code and i'm going to shrink this terminal just a bit because we won't be using it too much what i do want to do though is save what i was just working on which is actually a whole nother uh page uh react component so it's not quite working but it's almost there so i'm going to save it now so we can start fresh and make a nice git commit at the end of the stream let me check the status we're going to add this file oops and then i'm going to leave a message so and we'll check out what i've just done here in a in a future stream i've already brought in all the all the data into our wordpress installation uh so we'll need to do some styling for that page at some point um there we go whoa we got a lot of testing going on it's good all the tests are passing i have not made a test yet for this directory.js it wouldn't pass because it's not working but once we get it working then we want to get tests on it as well be very similar to the tests we have for faculty.js okay so let's get to some of our html and css so this is our our react component we're not really going to do anything at all with this react component we're going to be mostly working in dev tools and chrome devtools and then we're just going to kind of copy over our styles so what i would like to do though is make a new folder in our static file so i know if you're if you're familiar with react and you've done things with react this is not at all the normal react way to do things so if you're confused just hold on for a few more minutes and it'll become really obvious why we have to do things this way okay so this is not ideal i wouldn't normally want to do it this way but everything is entirely valid in terms of just regular html uh but because of the time frame where the site has to be made live we're gonna i guess kind of do things a little bit weird at first to save time and then after we launch behind the scenes we're going to clean everything up little by little so that it'll be a smooth transition but it'll buy us a lot more time to make things right i do see a lot of activity in the live chat so if you're just joining a live chat i will take a break after a little while and i'll answer all the questions in the live chat so just hang in there i'm i'm not ignoring you at least not for not forever all right so let's make a new folder and you can also do this from the command line uh but if you're not that familiar with the command line it might be easier to do it like this new folder and we're going to call this styles and then within the styles folder we're going to make a new file and we're going to call this faculty dot css because that's the page that we're going to be on so it may make more sense at some point to extract some of the things we put in faculty out you know up to um a different uh set of css a different file and then share it among components but for now this this should be good uh we're i normally would like to use sas instead of just plain css but we don't have that set up yet for this project so maybe we'll set it up later but um today it should be it should actually be better this way because it'll be you know more basic for those of you who haven't really gotten into sas all right so let me bring over the site so you all can see what we're starting with uh and what we're starting with is just the very you know basic basic of of sites html with almost no styling so this is what we're starting with we have this data which doesn't look like much i know but what what we have here behind the scenes is a lot of structure to this data in terms of the tags so we just need to style those uh it'll probably be a good idea to make these images actually work the paths all broke when we transfer things from one database to another so let me make these images work first i'd hope to have time to do this beforehand but i got caught up uh with some other data so just for this i'm going to change i'm going to manually change the the files there and i'm gonna add so on my other screen i'm just changing the urls for these images manually so that they will point to the right place so i believe we only have two images let's see okay let's update that and see if we have images now there we go we have images okay so one of these images is supposed to be for a a detail view and one is supposed to be for what they call a list view on the other side so we'll just hide one of them for now eventually we won't have to deal with two at all but for right now i don't want to edit the data too much because we have a lot of data here and and any manual editing we do is is going to end up taking a long time if we want to duplicate that for everything so for now let's just take the smaller of the two images which i believe is this image let's see image there we go and for the list view image we want to just hide that completely so that'll be the first thing that we put here in our css so let me make sure this view image yep all lower case list you image and i'm going to say display none okay you know what i forgot to uh to actually hook this in here uh so let's do that as as well let's see so my let me see for my react people here what's the easiest way right now for me to connect this to the component uh from my static files i'll check the the chat in just a minute after delay's over and see what what you are saying but for now we could do none okay so if you've never used chrome dev tools before it's really good you can inspect anything on a page and manipulate it right here in your browser none of the changes are permanent if you refresh the page they all go away but it allows you to make a lot of changes here uh really easily just to see what they're like um so that's kind of you know what we're what we're gonna do for it for this okay so i could see uh using next head is probably the best way to go according to harshit so thank you all right so let's go import and this is some react stuff so if you're not really familiar with react don't worry about this we're going to go back to the normal css here in a second let's see and we're just doing this so that our css will be applied to these this component which controls that page okay so just have to do a little bit you know differently than you know we normally would uh so let's let's see if i can put all right so within the head then can i just put regular link tags i think i think i can i think we could do just regular link tag all right so we will do that link is it source for a link tag or href i can never remember i think it's an href i guess we'll find out in a second um okay so we have to do rel and ahref h thanks thanks everyone in the live chat for helping out with that okay so our href is going to be what we got static where we'll be at right let's just try it as static css oops all right let's see okay not working let's just inspect this and see i imagine it has something to do with the path um mmhmm uh rayon is saying add in type text css okay we'll add that in all right let's check that out then hmm all right let's see let's check our sources see if it'll tell us oops i mean our console um okay so that's definitely not the right path static can i see the structure all right here's our folder structure um style oh you know what it's the wrong thing i didn't call it css i call it styles sorry about that everyone my fault there we go now it works okay great um all right so now whatever styles we end up putting in our faculty.css uh will automatically be reflected here okay wonderful all right so here's i wha how we want this page to look let's kind of move this about here uh so this title we'll want this to be much larger so i guess let's start at the top and and work our way down from there so name is the name of this tag let's see what we want we definitely want let's see all right let's take this root details all right so i definitely know i want a different font as well so let's just do this on main we're going to do font family and roboto and sans serif as a backup and there we go all right so we got the font we want now let's work on our title all right sorry our name all right so let's do font size um what do we want let's try 24 pixels see how that looks okay i like that 24 looks good this is going to be pretty experimental as well um as we're going through since we have to work with an html structure that we didn't create ourselves we're just going to have to try some things out which i think is kind of fun it's not the fastest way to do things but it is interesting all right so let's let's throw this in uh under our name and one good thing about this is all these custom html tags are named you know very nicely it makes sense the way they're named we probably should have this in some sort of container so let's see let's see what container class we're using here i assume we're using something here all right let's check it out um where are we at index all right yeah let's put in a grid container in here actually i went for the entire thing yeah we'll start out with a grid container we will need to pull this in i assume grid so sorry i said i wasn't going to do too much with react but i guess we will be doing a bit with react uh so all this is gonna do what it should do is give us some nicer margins and i believe it made them worse okay i think maybe we'll need to wrap this in some grid items as well yeah let's try putting this in a good item you know what i think we did have some inline styles though did we all right let's let's go back to our css for now and well let's do this first are we getting this expected a different indentation all right there we go um let's go red item i thought it was great item okay it's like this and there we go so for for those of you who are interested in your kind of why we're doing this in react we're using materialize or i'm sorry material ui the beta version of material ui for these components and let's see i've messed something up let's see see how bad it messed it up okay not terribly but why am i doing this now oh no i guess those are just the regular colors i'm not used to this color scheme it was supposed to be the same color scheme i used for adam but i think there are some differences um there we go how harsh it's saying in the live chat to use format on save i will i will use that i don't since i don't have a lot of time on this stream i'll i'm not going to switch it right now but i will use that later on okay so that little distraction i had with using grid actually didn't do anything um but let's see i guess i guess it's okay for now okay all right so let's look at what else we have here i do want to put i want to find the container i guess this would be it this this container here for the test or even maine i suppose we could do it on main all right so let's go to our our main here and try to put in a let me think i need margin need some sort of padding or margin maybe i don't want to do it on main let's just do it on this content div margin and we just want 16 pixels all right that's fine for now i just wanted to get it off of the very edge of the page where i'm going to have to think up some other way but i'd like to maybe do it within this grid system i also have to check out the documentation i suppose but i don't want to get into it right now because i've said that this is going to be you know mostly regular html css and that would be getting into more of the material ui react components so i don't want to get into that right now so let's just do this on our css so we're going to make actually let's get rid of that we'll have more room and i can make this a bit bigger okay so i'm not going to do it on the main let's do it right there and then let me just do and i want to do its data test id content okay how do we do this oh you know what it's not like that it's like this all right so we're gonna put in brackets and we're gonna say um what was that called again data test id all right so this should select that i think let's see if it does interesting um i think it's just doing that because i haven't put anything in here uh and we're gonna add that margin 16 pixels there we go so let me make sure that this worked before i try to explain what's going on i don't want to explain something that's wrong let's do a refresh here yep that looks good so what i've done here is i've selected div you know the divs but i want a specific div so i only want the divs where it has an attribute of data test id and that attribute equals content so if you ever have an html element that has some type of custom attribute you can grab that attribute use it to select that div and and grab pretty much anything you know any custom attribute so that's kind of useful uh the syntax is maybe a little bit different than you normally use but you know it could be like i said it could be with anything the only thing you do you use these square brackets uh the first item you just type it out as normal equals and then the second part after the equal sign is you're going to want to put that in single or double quotes all right so now we can move on and i think i don't mind it being i don't mind it being like this on a small screen but on a large screen i'd very much like to take up more space and kind of have things side by side uh so i'm okay with the name and the picture being here um but then maybe let's let's move this other data up and uh make it kind of a whole another another column you know if we can all right so first let's inspect this and let's figure out if we have something that kind of goes around the whole thing i don't know that we do hmm well that root component goes around quite a lot of it let's do that then let's put the root component we'll keep it that's that's actually really weird that's that's very odd how it how it was assembled in there um education because the title for this section is within that root component but then the data for that the rest of the content for that section is down here outside of it all right this is some interesting markup here it's it's going to be a little bit more difficult to do what i want i'm not sure what this f is just hanging out here what is this f well i guess we'll we'll figure out where it's from at some point and get rid of it there we go details type f all right let's get rid of that as well so we're going to want details type to display none um let's just add it on here so if you're doing you know css and you want to apply the same styles to more than one element you can do that just with a comma and a space in between so we should if we refresh we shouldn't see that f anymore great so we don't see that f okay again if you didn't uh if you weren't here from the beginning um we didn't create this html we're kind of stuck with it at first um so that's why we're we're kind of doing some weird things here but realistically on the job you may get stuck with some markup that you have no control over and you just have to do the best you can with what you've been given that's happened to me quite a lot uh as a frontend developer so i know it would be better if we could do it differently and change the markup but you can't always do that okay so now let's take hmm cv link interesting not exactly the best title we may have to come up with some creative way to change this i'm going to think about that um right here this is a link to you know curriculum vitae uh pdf i hope it's a pdf it is uh but you wouldn't really know that right off the bat so we're gonna need to add something in here and maybe change the title okay so this phone number i want it up closer to the picture so hopefully it's in yes no right we can't can't do that i think we're just gonna have to bring everything over huh hmm all right new plan let's try to get it to where all these details are automatically open and see how much we're dealing with before i decide on what columns we're using um so you can see in this case we do have quite a lot of information so let's let's work with that first the markup it's just making it a little difficult to really do the columns the way i want so we we still may be able to do it but i'd rather do do something first that i know needs done all right so wow these details what changes so as long as they have open on them it's okay i guess so we're gonna need some hmm i need to change this okay uh harsh it sorry i just um i just saw that i you are talking about using ngrok yeah let's get ngrok up and running let me find my terminal where's my terminal i thought i had ngrok open already i guess i didn't okay um shoot i can't remember how's there we go nope it's not http 3000 okay all right i'm going to paste the link here into the live chat if you follow that link you'll be able to see what i'm seeing so you'll you'll want to go i'm going to paste in the where i'm at um so after ngrok after the the ngrok.io part you're going to want to add what i've just pasted in as well so slash faculty slash haney hyphen eric so you just copy and paste it right there all right so i think the best thing to do now would be to add some logic in our component sorry for the yawn okay and my timer is up and i have no idea how long it's been up i um i was focused and i didn't even hear it okay i will take a short break now and go to the live chat see what questions are there and then we'll continue on after that and we may need to cut the second session short second code session short since we went long on the first one i'm gonna scroll all the way up to the top of the live chat and uh just get it to as many questions as i can uh manoj says should i and sorry if i mispronounced that please let me know how to pronounce it properly so should i learn js or ts i'm assuming javascript or typescript um if you're gonna go for something first uh i would learn javascript first but i i have no experience at all with with typescript so you may want to talk to somebody who uses typescript to get another opinion on that let's see uh no beer said in response to that uh you can learn typescript because typescript has some advanced program that can convert into javascript so that that's cool the the only thing i would say to that i guess is um since javascript is way more widely used in typescript knowing javascript will help you to be able to read other people's code and contribute to their code base more easily so it does kind of depend on what kind of work you see yourself doing if it's all new stuff or you kind of have control over what goes into it then you know use whatever you want but if you'd like to get involved in existing projects javascript might be better for you uh unidos says i'm a i'm from developer from brazil and other countries do they accept foreign as well i don't i mean it just depends on the country uh and on the place so like i'm from the united states uh even within the united states it would depend on where you are within the country as to whether or not foreigners are accepted well uh there are some areas of the country where they're very you know accepted in other areas of the country where you know not so much uh and i imagine other countries are the same it just it just kind of depends on on where you're at so it's kind of a difficult question to answer like you know in general across the board but uh even in you know in my uh university where i work we do have some employees who have come from other countries just you know to work here and as far as i know they you know everything's going pretty well for him i'm not i don't know about you know the outside of of the workplace how things go for them but um at least within the workplace you know the university that i work for is pretty open to that um menno says very confused between angular react and view um i i guess there are definite differences i i don't really think i can i can really do a great job of explaining all the differences to you but i think the best way to really get a good idea is to do like the basic hello world example for react angular and view it shouldn't take you too long and then you'll get at least a little idea of what each one is like you certainly won't be anywhere near experienced in in any of them uh but maybe you just kind of see what it's like and then maybe watch some videos of people doing something a little bit more advanced with each one uh that way you don't have to spend a ton of time learning you know before you make your decision but you might be able to make a more informed decision on which one you'd like to learn more last question uh no beer asks why don't you use sass i think that's very logical for styling dom and it looks like rhaegal already says he said the answer but basically it's i just didn't have sas set up yet so for sash you need to be able to you know compile that into regular css so once i get that set up i would much rather use sas i prefer that but at least for now we're just doing regular css okay so i'm gonna make a note of where i've left off at and we're gonna do some more coding so here's what i'm going to do since i have a lot in the live chat i'm going to plan on taking a good bit of time to to answer the questions so this next session i'm just going to do a 10 minute session for coding and then see where we are uh harshit says it looked like engroc has crashed crashed i'm not sure i'm seeing let me let me uh check this as well because i'm seeing a lot of activity you know looking like it didn't crash but let's see okay it's still working for me yeah okay it's still working for me so i don't maybe um try to refresh the browser or go back to it i did go to a faculty page and it worked make sure everything's spelled correctly so let me i'm gonna paste the complete link in right now so this link right now is working for me no it's not when i click from within there it doesn't work interesting what's the difference that's odd that's really odd all right i just typed in the faculty member's name and and see if you can just copy and paste that in because for some reason it doesn't work with the link but it does work when i type it in manually so i don't know all right orson says maybe it's because we're using the development build right now yeah it's entirely possible uh that that's that's why it's not working okay so let's get a bit more done here and okay so we want to get these details few i've actually never used the details uh html element this is the first time i've ever seen it so i'm not sure it looks like there is some default activity here in that it automatically shows details and it automatically has this open close action going on so we really don't want that i don't think there's that much data that we really need the open and close stuff going on so actually this one might be long yeah that might be a bit longer but and that's that's going to need some work on the formatting but for now at least let's let's change these details uh and everywhere we have a details tag we need to change that i guess just to a div let's give it a div with the class um i i thought we maybe could give it a class details but now that i think about it we really don't even need that okay rook rook says so it's a basic html element thanks yeah that's uh the more i look at it the more i i think it's got to be a basic html element right so i like i said i've never seen it before but it that's how it behaves so unfortunately i don't think we're going to be able to use css for this one we're going to have to use a little bit of javascript so let's see let's go back to our component here our faculty.js component and let's see what we can do so this is all going to come to us as a string right yeah it's all going to be a string let's see if we can if we can do something so let's say um format content all right so let me do a bit of javascript here so what we've done here we're just going to make a function here and we're using an arrow function okay and that's because we want to have proper access to the word this uh in here so let's go within here we're gonna want to grab this data now within here we already have we've already grabbed this props but we don't do it outside of here so we need to start with this props um start um okay and isaiah is asking can anyone see my my chat uh isaiah i do i see your chat okay do it in render okay harsh is saying you can use a regular expression to do it in render um that's true i was kind of thinking that we may have some other things that we want to change so i would just make this uh function be where we make all those changes but i'm certainly open to other ideas uh also i was gonna do like a you know like a fine because i'm not great with regular expressions but at some point we could certainly change it if it would make the code more concise uh let's see stator factory edge is not content we're going to want to let's see okay um rook work pasted some helpful information from mdn which is the mozilla developer network uh i'm going to read this out just since you know we were talking about what kind of tag that details tag was it says details is used to create a disclosure widget in which information is visible only when the widget is toggled into an open state a summary or label can be provided using the summary element interesting interesting okay uh let's see i got i'm gonna have to look up uh the syntax on replace i can't even remember the last time i used it all right so let's go all right so dot replace it looks like the first thing the first string is what we are looking for in the second one is what we want to replace what if we want to do multiple things at once can we do that all right um well i don't want double quotes i'm not thinking all right let's go with um actually can do this let's say what did we want details yeah we want to replace details um globally so we want to get all of the details replaced and we want to replace that with div and let's just say class equals double quotes here class equals details that way um i'll be able to tell which which ones we've actually changed like that easily let's see if that'll work don't do this alright what about closing tag yeah hardship that's what yeah the closing tag will be missed so that's why i was asking if we could do two things at once otherwise i'm just gonna have to do content replace twice in a row so it looks like in the documentation i'm not seeing let's see blue house car oh here we go we can do i know we can't i'm not seeing a way that i could i can get multiple things and replace them all with the same thing but i'm not seeing in documentation where i can um get multiple things and then replace them with multiple things so i mean potentially potentially we could do this oh no this is not gonna be good we need to escape that how do we escape okay harsh it's um has some code that that may work here so let's check that out um if you're haven't haven't watched uh before um harshit here is a member of the community he watches the streams and contributes quite a bit of really good code so when i say harsh it that's what uh that's who i'm talking about uh so i'm gonna check what he has going on here okay our i see what you've done the only problem i have with that though is what if the word details is also contained in there and i don't want to change the word details that's why i've added in you know this and as well as this one the thing is though i'm going to need to escape that so let me i'll bring this over quickly just to see so so hardships will definitely work a harshit solution here so we're replacing all instances of details with div but what i'm saying is what if you know what if in here in in these paragraphs what if the word details was inside of here that would then get replaced with div and we certainly don't want that okay we're probably going to wrap this up soon i just got a notification that my meeting is in 30 minutes i do have to walk somewhere else on campus so i need to allow for time for that okay um so let me let's go back uh to whoops my timer did go off all right you know what i'm i'm gonna go to live chat because i promised earlier that i'll get through all the questions in the live chat so harsha said uh that he's gonna work on this um what we were just working on here to be able to make sure that it replaces only the detail tags and nothing else so okay harsh it says it's fixed so let me check that out now okay wonderful wonderful all right so let's let's use this now i'm going to copy and paste here what what hardship has done um hardship i'm just doing it like that because that's definitely going to be a lot faster than um uh the pull requests been merging the pull requests as expected what did i do wrong did i put this in the wrong spot no i didn't i did not put in the wrong spot maybe i just don't properly okay so it looks like a double quote there we go so we needed one more double quotes okay wonderful eagle i forgot an equals thanks harshit like why oh well sometimes that happens stuff you do all the time and it's just like you forget so why are what's it saying now i expected a comma somewhere oh and it's expecting that a space is required after comma there we go all right great uh data is not defined content is assigned a value but never used uh okay okay i see how harsh it also did this a bit differently so um let's see so i should put this here so let's do that this is the last thing we'll do and then we'll finish up okay so if you're not familiar with const uh it's the same it fulfills the same function in this case as if we were to use their var um so i'm not going to get into the details of what's different about const but uh that's basically what we're doing we're just declaring a variable and now we're taking that data we had before but now we're replacing some of the bits of data and putting in some some different things so now we don't need this anymore uh so that's nice that that got rid of um a lot of extra lines that we didn't need way to say constant sound value yeah and we need data oh okay are we inside we're not inside the render anymore are we no we're not so crazy not here you're not there not there it won't work so harsh is saying it won't work so things have changed oh yeah return change i need to see this file the whole file it's not showing me the whole file right now what i'm looking at faculty render return layout oh okay i see so harsh it has changed more um than what we originally had absolutely oh i see i see what i messed up that was the first that's what messed me up i just saw a layout and uh and that okay the details too okay of course all right wonderful and then within this we just need to put content all right let's check that out no oops did i forget an equals i did all right great all right so hmm um you know what i don't think it works this has to be a casting caching issue hmm uh let me try a different faculty member oh okay harsh is saying it's detail okay it's detail and not details okay there we go come on oops well if it is caching i know it'll fix it let's just restart the server okay that'll be the last thing i try and then i i've got to get to the questions or i'll never get through them all hmm it's very odd oh wait a sec it is details within us so actually we were right before it was details with an s so let me save that and refresh and uh let's go with a different faculty member uh let's try we'll try someone different they're they're not gonna have a um let's see they're not gonna have a an image because i didn't change it for anyone else let's try one that's easy okay walker john that's easy to spell no it's still the same details okay i've got to stop with with this i got to get to the live chat so i'm going to have to go fast as it is all right so let me scroll up to where i left off so uh if you are new this happens i don't know if i'd say frequently but it happens regularly that uh we in fact don't get done what we wanted to get done which is fine because this is supposed to be a portrayal of an accurate portrayal of my work as a frontend developer and things don't always work out the way that i expect them to so this will work out at some point we'll just have it'll just take longer than i thought so unfortunately we won't be able to solve it on today's stream but i'll certainly if we figure it out before tomorrow's stream i'll i'll certainly explain it to everyone tomorrow all right so i'm gonna do my best to get through this all these questions uh if i happen to not get to your question or i miss it just ask me the same question in the comments below uh this video or you can send me the question on twitter and i'll be happy to answer later on okay uh reijan asks which software i'm using i'm using visual studio code let's see jewel says hello hey how's it going thanks for watching uh let's see um no brs is is it free open source a visual studio code is is free uh someone says uh i should go now why is it so boring um coding is actually really cool so i apologize if the stream is boring it's probably entirely my fault so uh don't don't blame the code blame me if you'd like to give me some uh some helpful tips you know some helpful advice on how i can make this more exciting uh please let me know i'm always trying to improve uh andrew davis says is grid hard to learn i'm having trouble understanding how it works um no beer says nope uh it's easy but you have to practice it more and more cool and i i don't think i can improve on that that answer that's you know that's perfect um as long as you practice it it'll become like second nature and you'll be able to use it you'll be able to use it easily g streak says the reason i don't watch live streams i'm assuming i messed something up at that point i don't remember what was going on then but uh yeah things do get messed up if that in fact was the case if that's the reason then yeah it happens you can't there's no editing on live streams things break things don't work and you know you just gotta work through it but that's in a sense the point of this live stream is the value in it is seeing things break and seeing how we work through it okay no beer said uh when we use the css we did not actually need the quotes around content so i was mistaken i i i guess i've always thought that was necessary uh i was mistaken on that so i guess you don't need you don't need that so thanks for that no beer i appreciate you pointing that out ah john hanson said yes he's going to bring in the important i can feel it i didn't have to bring it important well not yet at least i'm sure it will happen later on uh a studio s how many days a week do you live stream i try to do five but sometimes things happen like i meetings or other things so i don't always get five days a week but i do try monday through friday yesterday i didn't get a chance to stream uh that was because we had someone else streaming so uh go ahead and check that out i think it was uh ethan uh was live streaming so uh sorry about not streaming but it was kind of in that same time period where i normally stream and um so you know i just kind of watched his stream and uh commented on there and so we're going to do a better job of trying to coordinate stream time so hopefully we won't both try to stream at the same time uh products geek says what do you use to make the drop down i'm assuming you're talking about these drop downs here in the details and this is just an html element if you use the details element it automatically creates this for you which i just learned today so it seems pretty useful if you're trying to keep the site you know kind of really light uh let's see isaiah says hi hey my name is jose i'm 14 years old uh if you want to check out my code pen it's isaiah ct i'm wondering what projects i can make i finished the port i know html css js and basic ruby and python this is my portfolio um let's see this is darno okay so uh must not have let isaiah it usually doesn't let you put in um urls if you put some spaces in the url usually it works if you want me to see your portfolio feel free to direct message me on twitter or you could just you know tag me in twitter uh with the link to your portfolio i'd be happy to check it out uh the question is what's the best way for me to be able to get my stuff seen um it's i guess it's tough to get your own project scene out there unless you kind of directly send it to different companies as you know check out my portfolio i'm looking for internships or jobs or whatever uh otherwise um you could consider contributing to open source projects and then that way um you know your your github profile will grow right and your name will be out there for in these other projects that people already look at a lot so that's a good way to do it as well um isaiah says where's the best place to learn to make servers um you know what i i don't know that i'm the best to answer that um because i mainly do front end uh so some of the back end people what resources do you recommend for isaiah uh to be able to learn more about about servers if you know any resources let me know i wish i could answer that question better but i guess i'm running out of time so maybe if i had a little bit more time to think about it i could come up with something but like i said uh usually if i have to do anything with a server i look up the documentation on digitalocean they have good documentation and i just follow the instructions isaiah says do you have any insight of the new courses coming to free code camp my 14 year old brain needs more um i haven't seen that much of the new stuff but from what i've seen it looks really good so i'm excited about it i think i'm going to try some of the new stuff out when it does come out as far as i know it's supposed to come out around christmas time so sometime at the end of this month hopefully it's on schedule um but as far as specifics i don't really know a lot of specifics uh i know there's going to be some ex6 stuff in there i'm sorry es6 in there um there'll be some more react stuff uh some stuff with sas so that's all i know for sure you can of course check out all the new stuff already if you want to um you know check out the free code camp github uh repositories and you could see it all we can even contribute if you'd like all right constantine asked is that a valid way to declare a function no it wasn't a valid way i just for some reason completely forgot the right way to do an arrow function even though we use them here all the time on the stream so oh you know what i took it out so sorry but anyway that yeah that in fact was the wrong way to do it uh let's see duncan says uh may i request live coding in java uh i would not be the one to be able to do live coding in java because my java skills are limited to like a one day course that i took at some point where we like kind of made a game and that was years ago so i don't remember any of it um so if someone else has some java skills and would like to live stream you know maybe get in contact with quincy uh maybe on twitter or something or send him an email with maybe some examples of your live coding uh which you've done before and maybe he might be interested i don't really make those decisions it's more up to quincy so i i can't say one way or another whether um whether you'd be able to do it i just you know encourage you to you know do some live coding on your own and then you know share it with with quincy uh quincy uh larson is the the head of free code camp uh matt says thanks for this jesse great learning experience oh you're welcome i'm i'm glad that uh this was a good experience for you uh edwin says thanks for sharing man i had a hard time trying to solve problems but it's great to feel we're not alone definitely not i have a hard time all the time uh but it's part of the fun of it it's always like a puzzle you know you gotta fix something and then once it works it's awesome okay uh harsh it said a resource for learning back end is from imad course so imad uh so see imad.tech um matt says linda is also a good place to learn about servers or udemy uh harsha says can i make some graphql tutorials for free code cam channels or maybe some mongodb stuff that would be great like i said do do some stuff on your own and then um send it to quincy or i mean i could um anyway i say probably the best thing is make some videos first put it on your own youtube channel and then we'll figure out uh who who at free code camp needs to check that out to prove it to be on free code cam's channel so that's the the first step then is just you know make some content at first oh okay let me show thomas okay harshit has finally figured this out uh it was case sensitive um and we had to replace we we had to use uh uppercase uh let's see let's replace details with details let's try it one more time and then i really have to go i'm afraid i'm going to be late for my meeting my boss is going to be at this meeting so really don't want to be late no is it still not working no still not working um all right i'm definitely gonna have to stop now uh so i'm not late for my meeting so anyway thank you so much everyone for watching uh i really appreciate all the help that you had and all the you know the awesome comments and everyone who helped out you know some people asking questions in the live chat uh you all had some great answers for them uh so really appreciate that uh for everybody that watched you know uh check check me out later on in the week i'll be streaming uh all this week hopefully if i'm not too busy here at work and you can follow me on twitter i usually tweet about what i'm gonna stream about earlier in the day please follow the free code camp youtube channel and set notifications so that you know whenever new videos come out and new streams come on uh so most likely i'll be back tomorrow with another stream until then have a great day
