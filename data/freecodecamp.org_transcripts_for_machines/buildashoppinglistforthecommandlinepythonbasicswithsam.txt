you well what's up everybody uh glad to be back this week so what we're going to be doing is we're going to be working with open file that kind of came up last week hey there jan how are you doing i'm glad to see everybody glad everybody's back today all right so the reason why this shopping list exercise is a good one is it takes in to account a lot of different aspects so let's just go ahead and get into it because we got our file object we got a plan we got a air handle we have to learn a little bit more about files and a couple other things i'm doing pretty good i don't know if you've heard my voice i had a with all this mask wearing i've realized that i'm having to yell a lot more so i'm gonna try to hang in there as long as we can we'll get at least through the shopping list i promise you that and uh we'll see how i'm doing after that but i tried to rest my voice yesterday and uh did not do a lot of recovering so let's just go ahead and jump into it so we got we got a we got a ton of people here right now so let's just get after it so file and file object and open and things like that so let's learn about open first so if you guys are new here i am sam from python basics and being afforded the wonderful opportunity to live stream with you guys on tuesdays so this is i told myself i would look and make sure i think this is the seventh stream it it may be the eighth actually you know what i'll click over to the playlist and beau has done an awesome job bo and quincy and i appreciate the opportunity to get to be here here let's go ahead and look uh today is the seventh today is the seventh live stream so we did four took a week off and then are back so yes this is our fourth one and they have all of them in their own playlist so uh in just a little bit of a history if you are just joining us these are a conglomerate of all of the i don't think i've left the first hundred videos that i have on my channel so if there's ever something that you saw here and you don't wanna and you may have a hard time going to find it you can go back and search it it's my channel is down in the description below but all right open all right so this is how you handle a file so we're going to go through this because because th this can get blurry really really quickly so i think we've talked about what these are these are so here i'll show you if it has an equal sign in the function it's an optional argument also default argument so it's already assigned to a certain parameter mode r is for read so by default it is going to read the file and you'll just see and we'll just jump into it so let's uh shoot i think i already created that so we will do um i think i have that in here too so we're going to make this f so it does not mess with our head about this argument right here file so we're going to do open then i know this isn't here test underscore 1 then txt txt now here let's just let's just leave this so we're going to run this we're going to go through everything all right so it fails right now because it defaults to r and r is going to read the file so if the file doesn't exist it can't read it so that's why if we want to create a file and write to it or create a brand new file we need to make sure we do w for write to open and we're going to start deal dealing with this so now we bring this in we have no error so now let's look at what we can do with file ah here we go this is a lot of methods and attributes so let's pull up help on file this is centered right okay you guys can see this now here's a file input output text input output wrapper file object and here are all of the methods that we have excuse me sorry guys now we've touched on this before where you can have a mix of methods and arguments mixed in so always go down here and the ones that jump out these are these are the attributes so we're gonna we're gonna look at this so this is all we've done so far and we're going to deal with this so right now the file is open and i can confirm this by file closed and i don't have to pass it parentheses because it's not a method because it is sitting right here closed so is the file closed no false so right now now i'm going to go file close now i call file closed is it closed yes it's true so this is one of the things that is very important when you're managing files once you open them do whatever you want to with them then make sure you close them same thing with databases but we'll deal with that at a later time all right that might be a very good idea with the with the honey and lemon yes uh that thank you that is a very good that is a very good point so all right now so now i'm writing here so we're going to open this up so before i still have my file object and dir on file helps if you get your parentheses going the right way we have write so help file right okay write string to stream hmm stream what is what is the stream it's basically the stream of information that is either going in or coming out from your from your object so if i were to let's leave this back let's get rid of this open this back up and then i go file dot right and i just pass in the text and write string hello oh well here's something interesting what is this well this is the length of the stream that i just put in and we're going to jump into this and we're going to see where all this goes so now we need to close this so we have file close what was the name of our file and let's see where did i put this this is right here so i have hello right here in my text file well that's kind of cool so now now let's do this and i want to show you because there's a problem um well actually why don't we look at reading it so we comment this out file dot open dot i guess i could have just nope you know what we're not doing anymore except under extreme situations will we will we copy so now i don't have to do anything because it defaults to read right okay so now i have my file object and what can i can i read can i read my f can i read let's see if i can do my alphabet read fast read okay i have to read hello okay well that's kind of cool let's get this closed f close um all right f dot right hi how are you now this is going to cause a problem and let's see if anybody has seen or experienced this f dot close all right so we're opening it we're writing to it then let's f dot open i already have a problem not right test underscore one text then print f dot read all right so let's see we open it we write to it we close it we open it we read it we close it all right wait a second so we got a problem where'd our hello go right so this is a problem with w it will overwrite the entire file so basically it is it just opens it and goes ahead and writes wherever it starts and we're going to learn how to look at that see it check it and work around it so that's just one mode or two we just looked at two r and uh w but let's get over here uh do no there all right so let's get with uh help help dot open so how in the world can we solve this because there's got to be there's got to be a way around this and there is don't don't don't so all right every time w is utilized it goes to the top and just starts now a and we know you know we know about appending with our use of list so a opens it up and goes to the end of the file and then begins writing so that's that's what we're going to be utilizing for our for for our shopping list so let's go ahead and get started on that so my def my list we're just going to open it and we're going to go from there and we already know that we need to use oh oh before we get before we get into this so let's look pass this is what's this is this is really cool so all right we have this open and closed and you have to remember and don't forget and it's super important right well guess what python has taken care of this for us with a context manager and it is literally this easy and this simple so with with open so use open what is your file test one dot txt then we are uh writing to it actually let's just read it right now oh and i forgot as f then f print f dot read so this context manager handles all of this for you so you're aliasing this so here's your file object you're going to turn it into this so this is basically the same as this line right here and then also whenever you get done with this go ahead and close it out for us so boom there we are right there so this is the this is one of the things that is very handy and you need to get comfortable with this and we're going to build upon it and we'll go from there but to just understand what it does for now so you can build upon it and uh because you this this is also a wonderful tool and best practice for working with databases so all right you don't need that anymore so let's get this in here so uh let's get this let's get this file up and running so right now let's just let's just figure out how to write to it so width and we're going to call this our shopping list so with uh and we also learned that we're going to be using a we're going to append to it because every time we open this we're going to we're going to want to add to it i just add to it but later we're going to want to be able to delete things but right now we'll deal with that we'll deal with that soon enough so open then shopping list dot txt and i said we were going to use a for append as f actually let's just do file because apparently i have that and i don't want to make a ton of mistakes and drive you guys nuts with the fixing of the typing but i hope everybody has had a good week and if we have anybody joining us right now what we are doing is we are going through and we are we are using the skills that we have so far to date to build us a shopping list and we're sprinkling in some context manager right here with our with then then we are going to be learning how to delete and uh learn how to work with our file object and then we need to air handle then we need to learn about two interesting um methods associated with a file object so all right first we need to have something that tells something to the end user enter item nope we don't want this right now we're going to do uh item equals input because we're taking input from the user enter item we're going to handle that issue next so right now all right so right now we're going to take this item and then we're going to add this add this to our list right so file dot right and then we're going to input item wow all right okay so let's see where we are have i lost anybody everybody good okay oh i just saw you can't you can't be at the office okay all right and i only have one kid on uh azuma eating today so hopefully the um the quality is a little bit better all right so we have a builtin flaw right now and we're gonna we're gonna solve this but i want you to understand the a uh the append and then we'll go from there so we got my my list all right enter item red oh hmm all right let's run this again uh milk well this this is a little tedious so let's just one check and see here hang on a second i just realized uh all right let's do w first because i just realized i had partial of another item so let's get this spread all right so now we need to change this to a because we'll see all right so milk and then uh eggs i need to run this one more time and we're going to see the problem that we're solving we need to solve two problems eggs because i will tell you right now the user will not ugh what are we doing right here the user went will will not tolerate having to call the the function over and over and over and over again so what tools and skills do we have at our disposal right now first how about we solve this problem right here so like i said a the the append mode it will just go to the append of the file the the end of the file and we'll look and see how to handle this in a minute and it will just continue on from there so what skills do we have in our back pocket to get this to go down a line okay solves problem solves problem one okay so let's get this going so let's check and make sure we got bread then let's run this again and then we got milk all right let's get this up okay bingo ah great question so and this is what i love all right so in python this is a new line let's look at print right here this is the new line this is how python handles new line it is line and i will explain you know i looked at escape characters a little bit ago and i was like no you know what i don't know if we'll get into that so now if i print new line so python already defaults on print at the end to go to a new line so i just told python to assign new line to this so i'm printing new line and python is already putting a new line now while we're here let's just look at this this is tab so python tabs over python tats so you have your new line in your tab and the reason why this because this is an escape character so this is how if you're doing something and python needs to understand because it had to differentiate between in so it got assigned um and how to handle and read this and maybe we'll do a whole lesson on uh escape characters that might be something cool if i'm uh if my voice hangs in there so problem one solved oops apparently i have a couple of these open all right problem one solved but now we need to keep this open repeating and checking for while true oops i can't even remember if it's open or closed bracket okay it's the close bracket so what i did is to put this in a loop i moved everything over so now my list will hopefully close it out my list will stay open so we got what do we have on our list what do we have on our list bread milk let's add let's add uh eggs eggs butter oh shoot we don't have a way to get out do we so caused solved one problem caused another i love it so now let's get out restart shell now let's see what that did to our list oh still there because it still wrote and it was just sitting so now we have to have a way to exit so let's deal with this all right so that always writes so let's come up here so if let me just keep this really really easy if item equals i doubt we'll need all caps exit then all right let me click back over here i haven't seen chat in a while how do we get out of a loop anybody seen that yet i can't remember if we've talked about it so you guys will have to forgive me have we talked anything bingo break and you have continue as well so if you're coming from another language if i were to want to go back up to a certain spot especially like a while loop and not continue down i would just continue back through my loop i would use continue but here oops i want to break out of this and jump out and move on all right let me check my notes here we go here we go so now i have my if now i need my else and boom if else so all right so now let's check this so we got um we got bread now we need uh jelly and what else now we need uh some lettuce okay now i'm gonna exit all right okay we've made we've made some pretty good progress we good so far everybody good how are we going to read this so right now i have this as append i know that i could put a put a read you could do that you you could actually uh how however you'd like if you'd like no no space entered you you could completely uh do however however you'd like it to exit you can exit if you don't want anything in the string if you want to if you want an empty string that works too so we need to learn how to solve how to be able to read and write at the same time and this is like the coolest thing well i think it's the coolest thing ever let's get in help let's get capslock off first help open yes i know it's 122 lines this is literally the neatest thing plus so basically it's this and the other so all i have to do is come up here and add a plus sign and now this is readable and writeable but we got a problem what you'll notice is that every problem we solve creates a new one and we have to deal with it so now i can read and write it i can read and write to it but where does this start so if i want to read now i need to figure out a way to read the file so i'm going to throw in an lf here but let's get out of here now i want to show you the problem first elif uh let's let's do list so if i want if i if they type in list well we need to be consistent sorry guys i just realized that i'm not being consistent with my quotation marks list so then file file dot print file dot read is that going to be right because yeah we're going to have a so we're going to do this so let's and i need to close that out all right this megan did i lose anybody exit thank you all right ah caps lock off item so let's see how i do here all right so right now huh i got i got nothing but i know let's close this i can't remember but i know there's something there right okay i have everything there and let's see if this is still working um let's add uh grapes my kids have been eating a lot of grapes all right so then exit all right so we got we got a little bit of a dilemma here but it's actually quite simple and elegant so there's two things we need to learn about is it file is it showing is it still file awesome okay so f equals open dot shopping list txt all right der on f seek and tell so f dot seek help f dot seek okay cookie change stream position ahaha okay zero start a stream one current stream position offset by a negative and two end of stream offset by unusual negative hmm all right and what does tell do help dot f dot tell returns the current position all right so let's look at something l if so actually let's look at something right here print file dot tell right because it's going to tell us where it is and then let's let's put it right here as well print dot file dot tell this all makes sense in a second 51 peanut butter 66 huh um potatoes okay wait a second wait a second as i'm moving through my file my current position my current position in the stream the stream of data going into my file is moving down the file so when i want to read this i'm at the end of the file there's nothing to read right so let's exit this so we're gonna let's make sure we have this closed all right so now let's bring this open so f equals f equals open dot shopping list shoppinglist.txt already defaults to read right okay read so then f dot tell zero the beginning of the file so then if i do file dot read i have all of this so if i do print file.i read i do this on purpose so this already read through this once so we can't read through it again because it's sitting down at the bottom so now where's my tell 75 there's nothing more to read but if i come up here and go dot seek what does seek do change my position zero start of stream so if i reset this to zero okay then i go now let's let's look at this for just a second this is the actual string with all of my new line characters i printed it print understands new line formats it very nicely so when we want to read this file we need to change the seek we need to change the tell and we use seek to change tell make sense everybody got that so if i do list i need to go and do so we're going to change this actually let's comment it out so you can go back and look at it so file dot seek back to the beginning save run all right then list boom there i am now i also don't need this either so let's uh let's go exit let's run this list cool so i got i got bread milk eggs butter jelly lettuce grapes peanut butter potatoes and let's add a chicken one more and then let's exit so cool now we're going to verify that everything is functioning and working very cool now okay so we've done we've done a lot of stuff here how's everybody doing with this this seemed to make sense everybody like it all right i think i need to refresh this because it's showing and i'm not seeing any chat all right so okay okay that that's everything all right let's get that off here now we've got to figure out a way to delete an item and this is where it gets this is where it gets fun all right so we've got to figure out a way to remove any opportunities for people to misspell so numbers are a perfect way to do this so we're going to i didn't even check my mic am i coming through loud and clear i usually do that i was a little frazzled today uh of course right before the stream uh my smoke one of my smoke alarms was going off and of course my daughter was laughing because i pulled it out from the ceiling first i tried the battery then then i did the uh then it kept chirping then i unplugged it from this from the ceiling and it kept chirping it was a reference to one of her favorite television shows and she was dying laughing while i was running around trying to get ready and she was supposed to be on her zoom anyway too so all right i digress but if you're just joining us we are working in building a shopping list working with a file context manager how to have a file opened readable and editable because i don't even know is that a word editable able to edit able to read and edit at the exact same time and we are using utilizing the a plus mode append with plus so being able to do both because a opens a file if it already exists and goes to the end of it and then now we just learned how to change the location of basically our cursor in the position of the stream the stream of data to then read the file so now the reason why this works nice and neat is it goes once you read it goes to the end of the file you can continue editing so let's just jump back to where we are so now now we have another dilemma so what we need to do is while in the midst of and pull this over because we're going to have lots of stuff right here so i'm going to save you guys a little bit of pain and i'll just show you i'll give you give you a little a little bit but but not a lot so we need to know how to get rid of one so we need to wrap this up and what skills we have so far is we know how to link to display a number and a list so right now why don't we take our file throw it into a throw it into a list wrap it up and then um enumerate with it so items oops items equals list enumerate file.read now check this out this was so cool all right so then we want to split it oops now that split and how does split work anybody remember everybody remember how split works so that was the one is for enumerate because people are not going to tolerate you we know zero indexing the end user does not care they want to know item one they're not going to go item zero why is it on item zero so we're gonna enumerate we're gonna start at item one all right let's see let's see let's see all right so then now oops i did not wrap list up so the reason why we're wrapping this in list is because you're you just created a enumerator object and then we want to put these into a list to build our tuples all right we did touch on a numerate i believe one time before i think i saw a comment coming through splits a string using the identifier uh identifier you mean delimiter because right now split is going to split on the white space any sort of any new line any tab any space so it's going to automatically go and read read each each item and split that out cool i i misspeak all the time i just i will always just yes no you no you're you're absolutely correct it will split on the delimiter delimiter is a weird word i get it i don't i don't blame anybody for not choosing uh the right word if if the whole thought process is correct it's the same thing you know what you meant no you're absolutely fine i knew what you meant it's just uh the how to identify where to split it i knew which i knew exactly what you meant i just wanted to make sure i just wanted to make sure that uh we were talking about the same thing no that was great so now we got to get this out printed then take more input from the user to get it out of the list and then be able to ensure where the placement is because this gets this gets fun pretty quickly so now now we need to look and get this printed much much more neatly so count so we're going to split our we're going to iterate through our items which is now a list of tuples so count item and items and print f and bracket count and we're going to give this three spaces uh what's in there oh that's what i was doing to really make this clear and then item so what i'm doing here is so now let's let's get this going uh list and ah this needs to be indented there we go all right let me see why this isn't working so we're splitting our line and we're going through file.read.split.one for count and item items that should have enumerated okay this all right and let me check this right here what is the difference between these two let me uncomment this and figure out oh aha so this needs to be because i'm already reading the file there we go okay so now oh now we got a problem check this out there's a new problem right i forgot about this this one so what just happened should be count oh no i only have one parentheses here i only have so here look i just have this output to kind of get the attention of it's it's something that i did a long time ago i used to do a dot and then uh somebody showed me a nice little parenthesis to just have this sit here at the end to just kind of clean it up and have your have your eyes jump to it so i have this space three and going through now i could do a parenthesis over here but it just looks too busy i just like this nice clean structure of that one little parenthesis to go hey here's your place in your list here's your number on the list so we can have a point of reference now here's this dilemma i just called list and it put list in the list but i don't want that so we need to figure out how to solve this we'll deal with that in a minute because i think that's further down but we have got so we have we have that going and we have this printing so now we've got to figure out how to remove how to remove remove equals int input then enter number to delete now for the sake of uh for the sake of saving a little bit of time now just like we learned that when we got into entering our list we got into that and it was just going over and over and over and over again so we need to figure and plan for a way to get out of our deletion right so enter number do to delete or 0 to continue and i'm already mixing and matching all right so and i don't think i have enough parentheses there we go all right so that's that's we're taking the input if remove equals zero break jump out jump out and uh continue on oops that's for next step sorry i didn't do that continue sorry i've ruined ruined our edition because i realized only about a year after this i had a bug that i didn't even know so continue because you always have to be prepared for the user just just to have areas of possibilities of mistakes so then else is where it gets fine all right so we're going to delete items i'm going to remove minus one then now here's where it gets fun okay are you ready uh we're going to do another context manager because this is how we're going to handle where to go item dot as as file and for item in items because that variable is still currently working file.right then item one then we need to add so what we're doing is we're going and deleting the item but then we need to because each item has a return put at the end of it right so then now we need to add the return back all right so let's let's see if i have everything here because now we're going to have a new error we solved a problem we solved another one of them but we have not airproofed this to have let's just jump into it so list and i need to click over list all right all right any questions right now all right now we need to solve so let's get zero to continue list then i want to delete one then list so it didn't quite go through so let's let's look and see where i am and what the issue is all right so now i need to bring in we need we need one more little tidbit right here because right now we got inner item and they don't know what they don't know about list they don't really know what to do so we need we need to handle something right here so please print and we're going to do this type anytime exit to quit and list to read read and delete and then one two three close this out all right so here we are oh at any time press exit to quit or list all right let's see where where i am seek zero all right all right because now oops so let's see where i am list apparently i cannot remember the bug to get this off the list right now so i'll need to work on that but if i were to hit zero here hit hit uh oh i think i got a comment shopping list is missing a g sharpening this is missing a g ooh uh what line all right okay uh let's go and solve this because um my voice is very very uncomfortable so it was you fixed it okay all right cool now so we need to have an issue of right here how to delete and solve this dilemma because right now uh i thought i'd tested this multi time so i need to when we get done we will wrap up our uh we'll wrap this fix up this this issue right here and i remember having it vaguely and all the tests i did this morning but all right we need to handle we need to have a try and accept right here and it needs to go all right so it needs to go right here so this is where so while while true while true try so what i'm doing now i want you to think about this control bracket control bracket so the reason why i had it indent twice is because i gave two headers now this actually needs to be down here so we'll copy and the reason why it goes down here because the reason so let let's look at this let's bring this here so we can see it so the reason why this is failing is this fails once you hit enter and you want to have your try block wherever the possible failures are and the reason why you want to be in here you want this to be going over and over and over again that and then if that is a zero they jump out of here and come back up to here does that make sense because you want this loop to come through and give them the error and then send them back up here and have the opportunity hey did you mean did you mean to hit zero do you still want to delete or do you want to go on and continue on the list all right so let's do this okay so now i get boom boom boom boom there we go and i'm in alignment with my try and i have a value error so i'm going to do accept accept value error so the value v and the e our our r are capitalized so then print what did i say because i think i think i came up with something very handy if you don't want to delete please enter 0. now i want you to think about this i'm doing a horrible job with my quotation marks today oh that was why that one is is because i have you know what let's look at an escape character so while we're talking about escape characters so if i hit list and then and then i'm up here to remember to delete so then now now this needs to be changed to break because i'm inside this loop i need to come back up to this loop so then boom i'm back up to be able to then add and edit and i will so we're about we're just a little over an hour by like a minute so an hour so yeah guys i really thought my voice would be rested and i will use some tea and honey but actually before we go i realized that we had a dilemma last time and it alluded me to y so there's my list and i know it's on the tip of my tongue on the tip of my fingers so all right this is how you handle so i was talking about no spaces between files this is how you handle um spaces between files you'd put it in quotation marks so it's free code camp dot py so then it runs oops why not right inside this i just did this the other day precode python well i'm just not doing a very good job today i just did this earlier today so i guess i have two things to clean up for uh for now next week sorry exit and that's also why you don't do lowercase exit so that's another keyword that python has but yes this is a great exercise and like i said oops and then continue on and then exit so just a very little handy experiment where you can learn about all these file objects and modes and workflow because this is a phenomenal one where you then have this problem and you have to go through and the reason why this works is because i'm escaping out from this i'm saying hey when i get rid of this it's stopping the string right here but now i'm escaping out of it and saying no i literally want this quotation mark right here i want that to stay because i have these two so i think that's what i was thinking today sorry guys um as always i really enjoy these streams i really enjoy the interaction i have a good time thanks for spending your time with me you guys could go anywhere i want to thank bo and quincy for this wonderful opportunity to get to share my knowledge and experience because i really truly love python very much i've been studying it for uh seven years now i guess i just passed seven years and i just truly enjoy sharing this and um the things that i've had to fight through and learn and even as you can see right here got a got a bug that i could have sworn had it solved and then then another one so i'll make notes uh oh and we need to uh we're going to work on pointers and is and um id and all of those things uh next week so like you hear on my other channel always guys please leave any comments questions video requests uh i've gotten into a pretty good habit of not closing this out all this all this is going to be on github you can go and check that out and delete it and we will well i really hope you guys get something out of this because i truly love teaching and love i'm constantly learning the stuff that i'm working the stuff that i'm working on i'm always finding
