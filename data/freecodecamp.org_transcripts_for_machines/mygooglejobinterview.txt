hey everybody it's me Jesse and I just want to tell you a little bit about my Google interview experience so my last video I talked about the overall job hunting experience and I mentioned the Google interview a little bit but several of you asked for more details so here they are when I first put out my message on Twitter that I was looking for for work I got a response from a Google recruiter and which was amazing right I had previously I had applied to positions at Google for their Pittsburgh office and even even with a reference I still couldn't even get an interview so I was pretty amazed at that that just I guess it kind of shows like the power of having a good Twitter network so I got an email from a recruiter or it might have been a DM on Twitter actually I don't remember for sure but either way message back and forth a little bit set up a phone call so that first phone call was just with the recruiter and I and we just talked like about what what I do what my my past experience was and what I'm interested in now and then we talked a little bit about the role at Google and whether or not I'd be interested in it so you know really basic no no technical questions or anything like that and then after that the next step was to set me up with a technical interview over the phone so the way we did it was I had a Google Doc so there was a link to a Google Doc a shared Google Doc I went there and then I was asked a coding question and I had to type out my answer in the Google Doc so to my surprise the question was actually way more frontend oriented oriented and didn't have much to do with data structures or algorithms I had heard you know from from other people from from sources online and in books that you needed to know your data structures and algorithms to work at Google but I I didn't have any this was basically just a frontend based question so it may disappoint some of you to know that I'm not gonna give you the exact questions I don't think that would be that helpful actually because the odds of getting the same question are very slim each interviewer has freedom to ask you know whatever questions they want to ask so it's it probably wouldn't be that that helpful anyway but it was more frontend oriented I got to use JavaScript and I I thought that I did okay on it it seemed easier than I expected and I didn't I wasn't really expecting to move on to the next round although I did better than I thought it just I wasn't expecting it right to prepare I had looked at some like online training so there are several websites out there that will let you do algorithm problems and just test yourself on them so there's a website called pram PRA MP and you can actually interview with other people so the way it works is you schedule time the first I think half hour one person interviews the other one and then you switch roles and then you go for another I believe it's a half an hour so I did a little bit of that and that was kind of nice just to practice like talking through things I mean through the live coding that I do for free code camp I was already used to talking through coding so that wasn't really a big deal for me but it was it was good to like be under pressure with a question that you don't know beforehand so on the front end related stuff I did great on any time I try to do a date algorithm problem I was not great with that but luckily the first interview all front end ended up getting a call back and the same recruiter that first contacted me from Google contacted me again and said that they would would like me to come out to Mountain View California and do five interviews over the course of a day out at at their main campus in Mountain View so I was I was totally stunned that guy I mean I honestly did not think that that was a possibility even when I got the phone call I'm expecting like wow this was really nice that you know she took the time to call me and tell me that I didn't move on to the next round you know but it was so pleasantly surprised and so happy so at that point I'm be 100% honest I had quit studying for the Google interviews because I just I just thought there's no way you know because you you always hear how hard it is to get into Google and how talented the people that work there are and I just didn't consider myself at that level yet but anyway I get the I get moved on to the next round right so the way the process works Google handles everything your flights your hotel I scheduled all the flights we flew out this was maybe this was really shortly after I got I got the call because I had some other job offers and I didn't want to keep them waiting so normally there'd be a little bit more time but for me I think it was less than a week between when I found out I was going to go for the interviews and then me actually flying out there so I go out to Mountain View and I get there kind of like any evening I have one night in the hotel and in the morning I wake up I go to my interviews so I'll give you a little playbyplay of how it went I thought that my first interview was at 930 so I got there early enough for that and it turns out my first interview wasn't until I think like 1015 a.m. so that was okay I was just there early which is better than being late but it gave me some time to just sit there and be nervous but I they came they got me for my first interview they took me to so this building had so many rooms right this is one of many buildings on campus there are a lot of rooms so they actually took me first to another building so we left the first building went to another building and went into a room there and I had two interviews backtoback in in that particular room so I think those two interviews went well those were probably my best interviews both of those were very frontend related so no data structure algorithm stuff more like Dom manipulation you know just kind of like basic like handling of data you know using for loops and things like that so yeah not bad I felt like I had kind of a good good conversations with with my interviewers so I was feeling pretty good after that I I think my first interview I probably did the best the second interview I think I wished that I would have had a little bit more time so it's like I had a solution but it was like I had ideas to make it make it better so then after that I think after that was that will dinner was lunch right so then they have a Google employee escort you to the cafeteria and you have lunch that's not part of the interview process so you're not being judged on what you talked about at lunch I've heard stories of people saying that you you are it may have been in the past that that happened but they told me several times throughout the day that that's not part of the any of you process like it just relax to was cool I got to talk to a guy who worked on the the pixel three the hardware for the pixel three and I had just bought a pixel three so it was kind of cool I could we could talk about it and yeah so it was nice and I got a really had like some really honest answers about things like you know housing especially with a family this guy had a few kids and you know talking about how long is your commute you know and and how long you know how much does it cost to live around here so that was that was a lot of good good info for me you know you know I have four kids and so that's you know being able to find a place that can fit for kids is important so I go back into my original building after that and find a room and it takes a little while to find the room I think we got lost this is how big Google's campus is people who have been employed there for a while we're actually getting lost trying to find the room where the interview interviews were in so my next interview actually I think I missed out on at least like 10 to 15 minutes of the time for the interview because my interviewer got lost on the way over so that really messed me up for that particular interview and for that one I actually got to use a laptop with a code editor all the other interviews were all just on a whiteboard with a marker so I really wish I would have had the full amount of interview time for that because I definitely knew how to solve the problem I just had such a small amount of time it was difficult I will say this to of my interviewers had really heavy accents it was difficult for me to understand and that definitely threw me so I mean that's I kind of didn't expect that but it does make a difference right like when you are interviewing with somebody that speaks the same language like natively and is basically a part of the same like culture it's easy to pick up on lots of cues even like nonverbal cues like manners of speaking and to get some feedback you just just by talking but when you're talking to somebody who is a nonnative speaker of your language who kind of pretty obviously you know came over you know to your country later in life right it's a lot harder to pick up on those cues I'm not sure if are they happy with my answer they're not happy with my answer then you know are they annoyed at this point are they joking or they yeah it was really hard to get a read so that definitely threw me off for for two of the interviews and then so the last two interviews were again on a whiteboard you know writing out all my code so that was those the interview process I will say you definitely need to be comfortable talking while you're rewriting out your code that's a big thing I kept being reminded of that by the preparation emails that Google sent me all the training materials that they sent me which they do send you training materials some of the books that I got so one book that was a big help was cracking the coding interview which was recommended to me by several people definitely helpful the algorithm stuff not so helpful because I didn't get asked about that but the general you know interview prep and just the explanation that the book gives about what the interviewers are looking for you know and what they're thinking definitely helps help me to kind of guide the answers I gave and what I focused on so I kind of I left the interviews with about the same feeling that I had from that first technical interview that I had over the phone which was this was easier than I thought it would be but I'm not sure that I did well enough to move on so afterwards they have kind of a candidate Center where you can go and check out some Google products you know use them talk to recruiters about your experience ask questions about Google so I went over there and talked with some of the recruiters that were there and somebody that I know that works at Google came over after some meetings and you know we talked for a while about the interviews and about what it's like for them at Google so that was that was really good it was some good information and it was nice to be able to see them again I had kind of we had both been to some of the same conferences before so it was cool to be able to catch up and then after that I had since since I was coming from the east coast of the US I got to stay another night so I just got stay one more night flew out early the next morning and that was it that was my my process so that was on I think I got back on a Friday and then I got a call Monday night from my recruiter letting me know that I would not be moving on and essentially moving on at that point means getting an offer right there's a couple steps that need to go on on Google's end of things to determine how much to offer and you know what team I would be on but for the candidate at that point you you pretty much are just waiting to hear whether or not you get an offer so didn't get the offer of course you know I was a little bit disappointed but I didn't really have an expectation of getting the authors the offer so I mean I don't know if that was like realistic like if that was imposter syndrome or me just trying to brace myself for to not be disappointed but I had some great offers and if you want to hear more about the other offers and everything check out my last video on my my job interview experience but it was almost a relief to me because then it I had I had lots of options and it made it hard to make a decision so that just took one option off the table and it took of our decisions off the table for me mainly moving my family all the way across the country going somewhere where you know we didn't really know we didn't know anybody I mean I knew one person from some conferences but like you know my kids didn't know anybody maybe one of different schools so it was it would be a big big move and it would have been a hard decision especially if the salary would have been you know competitive with the other offers which I'm assuming it would be because you know Google can't afford to do that it would have been a heartbreaking decision either way to move would have been heartbreaking to move away from family and then but to turn down Google would have been heartbreaking as well because you have the opportunity to build things sometimes that are really cutting edge that you couldn't build anywhere else you have the opportunity to build things that are used by millions of people which is it's a rare a rare thing you also the fact that you would have Google on your resume would help so much in you know future job opportunities so I'm almost I'm glad I actually am glad that I didn't have to make that decision because it would have no matter what I mean it's almost like I don't know it would have been good either way I'm sure it would have worked out well but it also would have involved a lot of sadness either way so overall it was a wonderful experience for me it's just to be able to get as far as I did in the process was was amazing it it I get I think it helped me to see how far I'd come and how much my sales had increased it's it's just hard to know there's not R it's not like you can take a developer test and it'll tell you how good of a developer you are really it's just you know but being able to get that that far in an interview with a company that interview so many people you know they really know what they're doing if the interview process and they're notoriously challenging it was it was good you know it kind of gave me a confidence that I think has already had an impact on on me and my work and I think it will continue to so definitely if you ever get the chance to interview at Google especially for frontend developer job I would say this practice doing frontend type of problems so you know go online you can go on free code camp or whatever and just take some of their challenges their practice challenges javascript stuff and practice writing the solution out if you have a whiteboard doing on a whiteboard have piece of paper do on a piece of paper have somebody there or at least record it and talk while you're doing it watch the recording make sure there's no awkward silences that is probably the key the feedback I got was that I definitely knew JavaScript but I just couldn't write clean code fast enough so I think if I would have spent more time doing that I probably would have had a much better shot of of actually getting an offer all right so just work work on that on your speed and accuracy of handwriting code without the aid of your developer tools or your code editor or anything like that and definitely if you're not used to talking while you're coding work on that as much as possible even if you have to narrate to yourself while you code that's that's a big deal that your interviewers need to know what's going on inside your head what you're thinking because what you're thinking is is almost it's it's more important to them than actually solving the problem if they like the way you think and you approach problems then you can get an offer even without having solved the problem but even if you solve the problem and you don't let them know at all how you knew it it's it's not that helpful to them so anyway my experience that's my advice videos a little bit longer than I expected it to be if you stuck around this long thank you so much let me know if there's anything else you want to know about about my interview process or any other topics you'd like me to cover you can comment in this video reach out to me directly I'm on Twitter I'm on Instagram and you know please think about subscribing if you if you want to see more videos like the video that'll let me know that you want me to keep the one more so until next time have a great day
