hey everybody it's Jesse today we're going to go over props and passing data into react components with props so this is going to be pretty pretty basic so if you're already familiar with props you probably won't learn anything new before we get into that I just want to go over a couple of things the website now has a new launch date so it's supposed to launch tomorrow and now we have until May 25th to launch which is good news if you remember we had a backup plan and that was just to launch a static site but now we we don't have to we have more time and we can build out all the react components and launch the site that'd be more in line with how how I wanted it to be anyway hey everybody as some people saying hello in the live chat thanks for watching I think I started a minute early so there we go we got some more people coming in no it was weird at first it said no one was watching which is crazy because I had some people waiting maybe it's just a little delay in the analytics reminded me of my first live streams when it was just me talking to no one so next week is going to be a crazy schedule and I mentioned it a couple times that it would be different than normal but I've kind of thought through when I I really could stream and Monday and Tuesday are just so booked up with meetings I think the only time that I could stream is 1130 a.m. Eastern Time so Monday Tuesday that time will be different so hopefully everybody who's kind of a normal viewer will will see this and they won't miss it the recording will still be available so you'll still catch everything you just won't be able to participate in the live chat Wednesday I will be travelling I have an early flight to Charleston South Carolina for a conference so I'm not really sure if there's going to be lashing that day or not it depends on whether the flight goes well and nothing is delayed and what the WiFi is like at the hotel so we'll see Wednesday maybe there'll be something I'll try to let everybody know through through Twitter and then I'll schedule the event so you'll be able to see the event time if I can so Wednesday might not be anything Thursday and Friday these are the days of the syntax con conference that I'm going to I don't know for sure what times during the conference I'll be able to livestream but I'd like to do some live streams from the conference it probably won't be me coding and this also is dependent on the WiFi available at the conference if it can handle a live stream but I'm thinking maybe I can livestream some video from my phone I haven't done mobile livestream on YouTube so maybe oh I'll have to read more about it and see exactly how to do it but that's what I'm thinking let me know if you're interested in that I'm not exactly sure I mean maybe if I can talk to some of the speakers and do maybe do a little interview or something I don't know it might be interesting it should be good quality I have the one of the pixel phones so the cameras a pretty decent quality I don't know I mean it can take 4k video but I really doubt that I'd be the network can handle streaming that so maybe if I can get at least 720p that I think it'd be worthwhile to stream ok so that's it for the schedule next week let me know in the comments or in the live chat if you would be interested at all and seeing some sort of stream from the conference if you guys want to see it then I'll really try to do it otherwise maybe maybe not and I've had a lot of people asking me for new videos like on topics so not a live stream but just breaking down maybe a shorter video on a specific topic a lot of people ask me about my build tools you know how I just how I have my workflow set up we're different topics like somebody asked yesterday about sass the CSS preprocessor sass and like how that works so I'm going to do that and I have a list of topics and if you have any top that you want me to talk about let me know but right now the top priority for me is getting this site that we've been working on launched so I'm guessing I won't have time to make those videos until after the site launches so expect some new videos after May 25th and then I'll try maybe in the mornings oh I'll try to come in early but when it's quiet and get some videos recorded and post as many as I can alright so today is Thursday I don't know if you guys are Spotify users but every Thursday they have a throwback Thursday playlist I was listening to that playlist this week and it was from I think the year 2000 and it got me feeling nostalgic so I thought I would do a throwback Thursday to start things out of a website that I built in the early 2000s I can't remember exactly what year if I had to guess maybe I'd say 2003 so I'm gonna put this over here so you can see it and don't don't make fun of me too much but I don't understand if you want to make fun of me let me switch over here so this is one of the first sites that I ever did professionally meaning I got paid to do it so I'm using the word professional here just in the sense that I get paid not in the sense that I was any good so this website remains largely on changed I will tell you though I did not put this in and right now I'm uted the sound but there's actually a voice over when you go to this website and I didn't put that in I'm not sure if the counter still works or not well as CEO over 14,000 views right that's that's respectable so this is for a local community center that I did this so I've come a long way since then alright also I want to thank you thank everybody for being so awesome and on social media and in the comments what year published I think 2003 I think that's when I published it somewhere around there if not 2003 you know give or take a year or two you guys would be nice about that website it was I I'll throw it back on just one more time this little section here I'm not sure what's going on up here this wasn't there when I first made it but this little section drove me crazy and at the time I couldn't figure out how to get rid of this little white section there uh and I I just it wasn't like it was like one of those premade website builder things so it wasn't like I was really doing any coding you know very much coding at all but um it got the job done people still go to this site from from what I've I haven't asked about it in a while but the last time I asked about it which is maybe a year or two ago they said people still go to the site they still download different forms they need and and get what they need from it so it still functions but you can see my name is nowhere on this site if you won't see this in my portfolio okay somebody says they're looking forward to watching this whole series awesome we have a good evening from Pakistan awesome welcome yeah if you guys want to put in the live chat where you're watching from I think you know that's always cool to see where everybody's had I did want to show you a small milestone sorry the kind of the interest taking a while but I prepared a little bit ahead of time so we should be able to get through everything quicker than normal little milestone for me my twitter has over 100 followers so that's that may be a very small amount for some of you I'm sure you have a lot more followers than that but that was that was cool for me that's that's a nice little personal milestone I know a lot of you're following me if you do follow me on Twitter I will tweet out the times that I'm doing all the live streams beforehand so I don't tweet that much but I do try to tweet out the times at least so it's another way for you to get get the times I think if you subscribe to this channel as well you'll get an alert at least I get an alert on my phone and in my email when a live stream is going to happen alright so I think I think that's everything I wanted to say at first now let's start with some some code all right we got the Netherlands London Nairobi also okay coding tutorials 360 is asked if I'd be interested in being interviewed to talk about react yeah I'd definitely be interested go ahead and send me uh you could put some in the comments if you want to send me a private message do it on Twitter that's that's what everybody's been doing I usually so yeah if you guys have a question you don't want to put it in the comments you know I totally understand if you're not comfortable commenting for every book the whole world to see I I'm usually the type that kind of doesn't comment on things and stays kind of quiet online so just direct message me on Twitter and I can answer any questions that you have so yeah I'm definitely happy to do an interview you want we have Ghana Alabama Guatemala Guatemala Philippines San Francisco India u.s. awesome we have people from everywhere I just think that every time I see that it's always so cool I just don't get tired of seeing people from all over the world so let's get to a little bit of this code we'll go back over here and show you I've done some of the work already so usually I just kind of do everything you know as we're going but I started on this will start properly tutorial yeah we're starting we're starting the tutorial not yeah back to me egg that somebody told me ignore the live check and chat good advice so I'm going to ignore it for a while I'll come back to it later on before we end the video so I've blown this up a lot so it's kind of hard to see and I have a lot of inline Styles right now which eventually I'll clean this up and they probably won't be inline but for now yeah I don't think I'm nothing at the end of this is important for what we're doing right now so we can safely ignore that what we're worried about for now are let's see this props component here okay so we have this props title we're passing those props in so this is the about page so I've copied into a lot of that boilerplate that we worked on for the index page and I took out the hero section since we don't have to here a section on the interior pages and you see I've added this title component that we just saw and in the title component I have two properties one is just called title and I'm passing in about as the title the other one I've named image path and I'm passing in the path of the image that I want so whenever this component goes to get rendered these are the props that get passed in so now we go back over to the component this makes a little bit more sense so the title of the page which in this case is about gets put in right here we've used this dot props title and we've put that in brackets so in react if you want to add in some JavaScript in the middle so we're inside this render function this is basic its HTML it looks just like regular HTML for the most part but then we can drop right into JavaScript right in the middle of our HTML as long as we have in brackets so this part is the JavaScript and we can grab those props this is what allows us to reuse components so I can use the same title component on every page and all I have to do on that page I'll flip back over is just put in the correct title since we want a different image as the background for that title section and let me let me show you what that looks like in case you you're watching for the first time or you didn't see it here's kind of an example of the title section okay so this is the actual section that's being rendered it has a background image and then it has the title about okay so the two thing the only two things that will probably change the background image and about we're going to change a third thing so I'll actually code in another prop live so you can see how it's done okay the other thing we're putting in is the image path and that goes in actually this does go in the background image so this is a little tricky let me show you how this how we did this so we've added this is just a normal style tag like we put if we wanted to do an inline style I just glanced the livestream again sorry I know I said I was going to do that but somebody said they're from Narnia again and I just I think that's that's awesome if you're not familiar there's a series of books that take place in this imaginary world card called Narnia and they're good books actually I read the whole series to my kids about a year or two ago it was it was fun so let me scroll over so all that's going on here is this is a background image property inside this style tag so we've dropped into JavaScript right and then we're making an object with that's what these second brackets are so we can see this is just you know normal a normal JavaScript object okay we normally you wouldn't write it all in line like this but it's a basic JavaScript object let me see if I can let me put it in a way that maybe will look a little bit more familiar to you so I would normally make a component like this but just for the sake of the demonstration so it's easier for everybody to see I'm going to break this down okay I don't even know if this would actually work with all the spaces and stuff in it but but it's easier to see so this looks let's break this down okay so this probably makes it look a little bit better why you style an HTML put everything in the stylesheet well one reason to put it in the HTML we'll see in a second you can do either way if you want your components on my feeling is if I want my components to be really modular so that I can use them not just on different pages in the same site but on totally different sites then it's probably a good idea to put all the Styles you would want for that component within the component so I don't always do that I probably won't do it for all the components for this site just because of the compressed timeline and that the launch date that's coming up soon but I think it's a cool concept to make your components completely selfcontained and able to be reused the the goal my goal for for the university that I work for is to have a set of react components that are completely selfcontained that have the the styles that we like to use for our sites and that other people could use so somebody another department maybe a you know maybe the IT department has a developer that can just take those styles and use it and they don't have to know anything about the design or anything about how we make components but they can just use that component so I get to sum up you can do it really either way and you don't have to put it in line I'll show you probably not in this video but another video you know you can put your Styles in a variable and then it will look more like a normal style sheet but in this case we have the style background image it's a little bit different normally you'd say background image but this is JavaScript so we're going to camelcase this and say background image and pretty much I haven't come across anything that doesn't have a camel equivalent there might be some sort of CSS property that is different if you have one that's different usually I think this this works if you did something like this like let's say you didn't camel case and you made it the normal way with the you could put it in quotes and that should work I haven't tried in a while though but I think on a previous project it works is this a background image we're just adding this this gradient this might look weird to you if you're not familiar with es6 or I think it's officially called es2015 it's some new JavaScript syntax this is the template literal syntax the set little backtick that's right underneath the Escape key on the keyboard and I'll show you what's awesome about this in a second when we scroll over so what we're doing here is we just have a linear gradient as our first background we've added a comma in and now we're adding our second background which is the image this is kind of a nice way to add an overlay of your image without having to make an extra div and trying to position it you just make the gradient the same so this is these are exactly the same values and then it looks like a solid overlay instead of your normal gradient that fades in to a different color so we've got a URL part now normally we would just type in a URL here but we want to be able to change that so in this case we put this Propps image path but we had to do it differently so here's here's what we've dropped in at this point after the style tag see this part is still like HTML stuff as soon as we put that bracket we've gone into JavaScript mode so this between these two brackets this is all JavaScript so this part is basically a string this whole part is just a string well normally if you had a sure and you wanted to put JavaScript in there you would end your string you would put a plus sign and then you would put your JavaScript and then you put another plus sign and you would start a new string right let me know if you're not if this is not making sense if this is totally new to you maybe we might need to watch it again if I'm going too fast or ask me some questions put in the comments I'll be happy to go over it again but with instead of doing all those plus signs we use this template literal syntax which is a tick here this back tick here and a back tick on the end inside that so it's just a string inside it so you can use that and it's exactly the same as using a single quote or a double quote but the cool thing you can do is if you put dollar sign curly bracket now you can write javascript in there you end the JavaScript with just one more curly bracket and now you're right back into a string I can also use both single quotes and double quotes inside this template literal syntax ease back text without breaking the string so normally if you had a double quoted string and you try to put more double quotes inside you're going to break up the string so this is really cool I am I'm kind of considering just making these my default goto for four strings the only reason I haven't is I'm just so used to using usually single quotes in my JavaScript that by habit I put it in here so you see I've done it here but really these are so much more useful not every browser supports this so you will need to transpile that and I'll probably do a video on transpiling basically if you're not familiar transpiling it would just transform this into older style JavaScript that more browsers can use so it would take these out put in regular quotes put in some plus signs and do all this but next which is what we use to build this app a few days ago or to build this react site a few days ago comes built in with es6 support so we don't have to worry about it this is going to get transpiled if we put this inside of our components does that make sense I have the last unit in pretty dead this whole time so either it makes sense or I've just lost everybody but let me know so that was a lot so let's do one let's let's code one right now and kind of take you through the steps sometimes it could be hard to read it when it's already done so we'll go through the steps I'm just going to go back on all this so it's back to where I had it before whoops area almost back all right I think that's back to where it was great so what I want to do what I'd like to do let me bring this in for you to see I'm gonna bring this site again and show you the problem that we have the problem is each image that we're going to use in the background it they don't always work in terms of the part of the image that shows up here so sometimes you would just see like the sky and you wouldn't see the buildings you wouldn't see all this landscaping or you just see the very bottom part so we want to make some way to easily change the positioning so kind of show you let me show you right now the original positioning was about like this that's that's not really what we want so all I'm doing now I have dev tools open in my other window I'm just changing the CSS attribute called background position Y so I'm changing it up that I'm using right now this is actually set at negative 46 VH and that gives us you know pretty nice section you can see as we move the screen it pretty much stays in that spot it does it's not the greatestlooking thing on a small screen but it's not terrible maybe we might put in some alternate images or small screens at some point also for some reason this I might need a better quality image I just pulled these from the old site and I don't know that doesn't look great to me so the image itself might need some work but the basic principle is the same so what we need to do then is we need to go to that background position Y so the background image is on this section let me scroll over here this is all just within that style attributes though these are inline Styles which as someone mentioned in a live stream in the react way it's it's not looked down upon to mix CSS with your HTML inline it's a really weird way to look at it there's actually a video where they explain why they did it like that the people who made react if I can maybe I'll try to remember to find the link to that and put it in the description just to give you an idea of it definitely is strange if you're not used to seeing it okay so let's see the background position Y this is where I'm at right now so you see I actually have it right now it's set to 100% and dev tools I had a change but what we actually want to do is we want to make this I'll be able to be a prop that's passed in so right now remember we're inside this draw the script portion and we're also inside a string so what I want to do is change this to use that backtick between you take advantage of that template literal syntax okay so now this is still a string but we have the ability now to do this which brings us back into JavaScript so we can do this props and let's see what we want to name this let's just say say shorthand counter for position y you can name your your properties anything you want it doesn't really matter okay so we have this in here now let's go back to about and we're just going to add in here where we have our our title our title component being pulled in we're going to add in another property another attribute called position Y and we're going to set that equal to what do we say this negative 44 VH I'm going to save that let's go back and check it out and see if it works all right it looks good I'm going to check it out really quick in dev tools on my other screen to make sure that it in fact did pull over okay we have negative 44 V H I'm going to refresh it just to triple check and make sure that this still works and it's looking good on dev tools it's looking good over here okay so it works so what we've done here is now we've we've given anyone editing this the ability to change the wide position of that background image whatever they want without having to actually edit this title component they never have to go in here never have to change any of this and now we can change three things about this title component string from the page where we're importing it we can change the title we can change the the image and Spain use and the vertical the Y position of that image and we can reuse this on every single page so what I'm probably going to do as soon as I'm done this livestream is I'm going to copy and paste this on all the other pages unless I can figure out some way to save myself from copy and pasting this which there there may be some way to do some sort of overall layout component and next maybe I'll read the documentation since we don't have a lot of pages is probably going to be faster for me to just copy and paste but on a larger site we may want to think of some other way to do that so all right it's 230 exactly I said I'd go back to the live stream so the tutorial parts pretty much done if you don't want to stick around I'm going to go to the live chat now check out if there's any questions and try to answer some questions before we before we end so let me scroll up all right so we have people shouting out where they're from Germany South Africa Netherlands Nairobi Ghana Alabama Guatemala Philippines San Francisco India Ukraine Syria North Pole Alaska farthest Wow somebody they said they might be the farthest north I think you're definitely the person that's the farthest north that I can remember it's Paul said that Montreal Portugal wit Narnia uh let's see okay Samuel Kaiser which I'm sorry if I mispronounced anybody's names I'll try the best I can asks what's the head component he's using so I don't think I explained this I apologize this is something that next j/s has builtin we can import head from next head so anything time we're importing something from next this directory it's something built in from next and basically what this does is it lets me put a custom head tag in any of my pages so I can change the stuff in here and that will go into the head of that that page when it gets rendered so that's nice for well like we have different titles for the pages we may not need to load everything if we're not using you know the same fonts or styles so that's where that comes from that's this a built in thing you can read more about it within the documentation for next Jas which I think I have linked already in the description and now I just scrolled down and saw that Samuel Keizer just did exactly that he checked the description and checked out next J s and found the answer to it so maybe I should have scroll down a little bit more to see but yes that would be good for anybody's watching this later on and has a similar question people are asking about the code editor I'm using it is Adam I have a link to that in the description if you want to check out Adam I'm using the SETI theme SETI some from Australia from UK Sweden India Somalia Scotland Italy Ukraine Pakistan England Thailand Poland hey Poland I have relatives that came from from Poland on my mom's side my mom's parents were on one side Polish and on the other side Italian so I had a lot of love for Poland and all right so that's it for the live stream if you're still sticking around after all that I know I went a few minutes over I want to make sure I got your questions if you have any other questions let me know in the comments if you don't want everybody to see your question direct message me on Twitter I will be back tomorrow at 2 p.m. next week's going to be a weird schedule if you missed the beginning of the video go back and rewatch it I have explained what the schedule is going to be like next next week and why thanks again for watching and I'll see you tomorrow
