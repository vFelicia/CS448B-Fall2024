hey hey hey free code camp people chris coyer here i'm one of the founders of codepen i know that free code camp as you work your way through it there's you know an exercise or two where they uh uh optionally you can pop over to codepen to do the work to complete the thing which is just so cool but anyway i'm just going to talk about codepen and how it works and introduce you to it in case you just have no idea or are interested in it and how it might be able to help you on your learning to code journey because it certainly can do that so i'm just here logged out on codepen codepen is a site that just like free codecab you can have an account on and it's free to sign up so if you're interested in signing up just hit sign up and it'll take you right to the free sign up and you can sign up through your github account or just with your email address or whatever when you land here on codepen you know it kind of tells you what codepen is but there's all these all these things here all these cards down here and these will always be different every time you come to codepen because they're uh we picked them out the staff of codepen picks out cool things that people are doing could be you you know if you sign up for codepen and do something cool on here we'll pick it and just just to show off interesting things and there's just dozens and dozens of these get picked every day you know so come around and check out what people are doing and codepen is like so what are these things and what what are they exactly that these people have made we call them pens on codepen it's one of the things that you can create on codepen probably the most popular thing and i'm gonna go ahead and do one actually you know what let me uh let me log into my own account here i'll log in through github and i'll pop into my own account which is just it's gonna show me the same stuff here but i'm gonna go to this create menu and i'm gonna say create new pen and this is kind of the heart and soul of codepen is the editor so you're learning to code on free code camp you can do some of that coding right here on codemen you just type html type css type javascript and the results of what you're doing show up here in this kind of big white area the preview area over here so if i were to type hello campers as i type you can see that being output over here or i could for example make an h1 tag you know a big header tag and say hello and that's going to render over here as well i can write css as well let me target that h1 tag and write color equals red this is valid css and it's you know my hello has become red over here how cool is that javascript works in the same way i could say you know var you know a equals one or work on my javascript skills and i could say console.log a and it's going to output one of course i can even open a console here and i'll show me those results we have a console writing code pen so wow i've made my first pen congratulations myself i've done good work here so what else can you do here let's like do something a little bit more robust let's make like a card component so you see i've just typed card and then press tab right there that's emmet which you might be familiar with that works in lots of different editors helps me write html a little quicker and it has some css stuff as well let's have an h2 and i'll say my card let's say it'll have some a p tag in there i'm going to type lorem and hit tab and you get a bunch of gibberish text that lorem ipsum text it's called just filler text you know let's say body and html are have a height of a hundred viewport height units and then it's display see it's helping me out with code completion here that's kind of nice let's say it's display grid that modern fancy thing and that we're going to place items which is how grid works in the center and that's going to put my card in the middle and if i say my card say has a max width maybe of 4 500 pixels let's say it'll go in the middle maybe even narrow you'll see that it's kind of centering in the middle that's nice that's nice i don't need my javascript i could say whisk that away i can kind of control the look of of how things are going here on codepen i can move my editors over here if it's more convenient or put them at the top i can do all kinds of stuff so again i'm just saving my pen as i go i can title it and say playing with cards for example and i'll be able to find this again pretty easily at any time i can jump back to my dashboard that's available in my user menu here or any header that looks like this it'll say your dashboard i can find that again that's it's forever it's never going away i go under pens and i could say show me you know my recent remated cards here's my playing with card ones it's right here so i could pop that open again or if i you know have lost track of it i could search for card or something or what did i call it playing with cards i can get it to show up but it's listing them by popularity here so i could say show me my newest ones first that's going to find me my card anyway the point is your work is saved here so it's kind of a it's kind of nice you don't have to worry about losing the files or anything like that so let's see you might notice that the the css up here says scss after that that's a css preprocessor something that's really easy to use on codepen so if i click that little cog next to it there or open my settings and go to the css tab well for one thing it's going to show me the title and i might have a description here that says like oh just showing free code camp people some things just adjusting just you know whatever i have a description there i can use mark down there and tag things but we were talking about preprocessors instead of saying none just regular css i had particularly picked out scss which is you know a sas preprocessor meaning i could do something like i don't know dollar sign bg color equals um what's like a cool color fog dog that's one of my favorites fo6 do6 yeah and that's not valid css that doesn't mean anything in the language css but it does you know if i say html background now i can use that variable that i just created background color and it's gonna make that oh but now my card is weird i'm gonna have to say background white and padding maybe of two ram or something that's a nice looking card component isn't it cool so i'm using a css preprocessor there and there's lots of different versions of html preprocessors css preprocessors javascript preprocessors all that stuff is available now let's see what if what if we're learning bootstrap or we wanted some kind of freebies out of our our css a bit i could open up settings again and notice there's more things going on here for one i could click something like normalize you'll see the fonts change a little bit when i turn that on that's kind of a css reset library and it's just applying those styles to the pen we do want to make things like that really quick for you vendor prefixing it can do for you but let's say i want to use a library like foundation or something i can just click that or i could have searched for foundation or used our quick add to find stuff like that now some of this stuff changes over time so just they'll always be searched so that's probably your your best bet for looking for things but anyway now that we've had added foundation we should see some changes to our card as well wow that's kind of cool foundation being applied to the card as well so lots of stuff to play around with write your own code or bring in libraries from elsewhere you can play with bootstrap or bulma or whatever these materialize fancy frameworks are those are easy and quick to play with on codepen so let's say i want to make a variation of this or i found this and it wasn't mine it was somebody else's i'd be looking at their pen and i could hit this fork button which would fork it from their account to my account it'll just give me a copy of it that i can begin playing with immediately so i'll do that notice the url changes so that other one will just stay exactly how it is forever but this new copy of it will be totally changed you know let's say i make the background purple and i change it on this copy this copy is totally unique and the other one won't be affected in any way so that's a way you can make kind of a variation of a thing that's kind of neat so let's say there's some things that i know that i personally really like myself to work with like i really like sas so i don't want to turn on sass every time you might even notice when i turned on this pen sass was already turned on for me that's a setting so i'll go under my user menu here and i can pop open settings and it's going to take me right to my editor settings and there's a lot of stuff here so you know forgive it being a little overwhelming but i can say you know when i start a new pen my defaults make my default sass and turn these settings on and i like tabs instead of spaces and maybe i like you know gentronic as a font or or fire code or fira code rather than operator mana or whatever you know you can kind of pick out your settings maybe i'll change to a different theme and if i come back here and reload things will just look a little different i have a little bit of different settings there you can just make sure codepen is comfortable for you i think that's pretty fun uh okay so let's see let's see let's see there's a couple of other interesting things we could do here so let's say we really like this css for centering things that was really useful for us but we want to make a different pen that just leverages the css written here but otherwise start fresh that's kind of an interesting thing you can do so i can take this url of this pen and i can start this new pen has is nothing it's totally blank new thing under my settings under css i can put a link to that pen and close it and i think you'll see the background go purple because it's going to load in the css from this pan into this pen so cool like there's no code here but the background's already purple because there really is some code it's the css from that other pen and this one so if we wrote card again and wrote hello we're going to have a card in the middle here but we didn't have to style it this time the css was coming from elsewhere just like it would have been if we loaded up bootstrap or something like that so that's kind of neat uh the other way around is let's say i wanted to use this pen the html and not the css so i wanted to like oh let me close out that but i want this html certainly i could just copy and paste it over there or make a fork or whatever but i can also this is just kind of interesting thing you should know is grab this url and put it in triple brackets over here paste get rid of that and it's going to pull in the html from that pen into this pen so if i make changes to this html boom i'll see it over here as well so just kind of a little interesting trick that you may not have known about in the past so let's do something kind of javascripty for one we might as well keep this here actually let's just play with our original whatever we're just playing around right we already had a little javascript over there i think we like console.logged something we could do something a little javascripty if we if we feel like it so for example we could say like let's say when you uh let's put a button in here so it feels like a real action you know button is go away uh so that will be there and it doesn't do anything because buttons don't do anything when they're not in a form just sitting there like that but we could say uh ma i'm going to let because we can write in modern javascript why not right let button equal query selector button now i have a reference to that button and i can use the regular browser console if i want also i could say um well if i type button here it's not going to be quite right because the context is wrong right i have to i would have to make sure to to select the correct context which is one of these things or you know what if you just inspect something it changes the context for you so if now if i type button um that button button is not defined queries oh document document.queryselector where you free codecamp people aren't you gotta watch me um so now i'm in the right context and now if i type button it's gonna show me come on in my console does is button the right thing one let button query selector for the button element i still think it should be it's oh it's i see that's the one is just coming from this or whatever but we can say uh button dot add event listener click so if you click that button it's going to run some code and we can can we stay can we stay fancy yes 60 oh look era code has this nice ligature button kind of thingy here isn't it click oh it's it's click but it's we need a click uh we need the event i guess or you could just have empty if you're not going to use the event which we're not going to we'll say console.log clicked so i am going to open my my console here and okay it is logging the right button at the top of this i can always write console.clear which every time the pen runs then it will clear the console instead of it just persisting you might want it either way but whatever so okay i click this button over and over click click click click that should work let button is it not liking lead for something query selector for a button there really is a button it's right here i'm clicking the button add event listen er i think i spelled it wrong i spelled it wrong there it is i'm so glad okay so click click click click click we've just done a little javascript or whatever that all works perfectly well uh in codepen as well should we have it actually do something maybe we should select the card as well it definitely wasn't that um let's say the card is the the card i know a lot of times use query selector all but there's only one card here we know there's only one card so we'll just say card has you know when you click it we're going to say card.class list dot add away because we've told it to go away right so we're using scss so we can nest in our css a little bit that's always fun we'll say dot or and dot away so card dot away when the card has also has the class away we'll say translate oh transform translate y the vertical direction like i don't know 2 000 pixels or something and if there's a transition on the card transition trans i should use auto complete more with my typing skills let's let it make it take a long time like one second so when you click this whoop it goes away but now it's gone away how do i start over here all that to say you can press command shift 5 and that will rerun so it'll refresh uh that's kind of a thing even if you change this to like red or something it's you know it's a lot of times you change javascript you change html we refresh the demo for you so that sometimes works but not when you write oops um css css we try to inject it for you which is kind of cool because you see it even transition from red to white there because if you're in a particular state like you're trying to style a drop down menu or something just changing the css it's kind of nice to have it not refresh the page every time if you really want explicit refreshing i said as command shift 5 but you can always go under your javascript settings and we i know we haven't looked at this but surprise surprise you can add external javascript libraries like jquery or react or vue or all that type of stuff and preprocess with things like babel or coffeescript and all that but what i was going to show you is under the behavior tab you can say auto updating preview nope don't want that so you'll get a run button so you got to remember you did this because you might make a change like my car with exclamation points and normally codepen would just refresh this browser window we're down here but it's not you have to press run and then it'll refresh and you'll see the exclamation points down there so um that's that that's writing some javascript and stuff we looked at the console we looked at that kind of thing um i have some links we could look at here you know think if you're learning something more advanced like react for example or ajax and all all that kind of stuff works just fine on codepen so here's an example where we loaded up the react library and we made a uh ajax call for some for some data and pulled it in and used state and looped over all that state and that kind of stuff we use jsx in here too if you if you are going to use jsx you will have to flip on the babel preprocessor in javascript there but that's kind of cool so there's something else that you should know on codepen of course right at the beginning of this video we looked at you know here's all this new stuff and in fact look there's even been some new things that have been added to the home page even since we this video has even been started let's look at this pen just for fun um i have something in mind that i was going to show you but no javascript this is a checkbox that oh look how clever that is the corner of the box becomes the check that's the coolest thing i ever saw if you wanted to explore how that was done of course all the code is here for you too and it's open source code i could fork a copy of my own and make changes or use this even in a project of my own so darn cool love that anyway i'm gonna heart it because to show some love for this pen you know even that harding this is what i was originally gonna show you works into some algorithms on codepen to increase its popularity and and for one of those things we use popularity for is search so if i look up check boxes in search we haven't this is what i wanted to show you a search on codepen and just enter that search we're going to show you all kinds of stuff here i would i guess it's not showing you how many results there are but i'll tell you for check boxes there's probably tens of thousands or more of results here and we're kind of ordering them by relevance and uh hearts and views and comments and all kinds of fancy stuff here to make sure that when you search for stuff you're getting really interesting results and showing you kind of a lot of the best stuff on codepen around that search and even the pens we made today like the card and stuff that's all findable from other people from search so if i've named it well and added a good description and it has a few hearts and stuff that type of stuff ends up in search and becomes part of the kind of the codepen ecosystem which is nice so let's see do we have a pen open left i just want to show you a few more things and then we'll kind of be done so if it turns out that you really like working in codepen or you know a lot of people end up using it for you know working in teams because we have teams accounts or they they use it in a teaching environment or they use it even in their agency for showing clients work that they're working on let's say it's that one i might want to make this private because i want to show this to my i don't want the world to see this yet i don't want it in search i don't want people finding it on my profile everybody has a profile on codepen as well i want this to be hidden from the world well all i have to do is open up settings and kick it onto private which is a pro feature of codepen so there's there's a few things that kind of have to be paid for on codepen and now look at how weird this url is nobody could ever find that it's not in search it's not it's totally gone from codepen only you can see it and somebody that you'd share that url with so you could share that url with your client they could see this and nobody else could so just an example of a pro feature another pro feature is like let's say you're using it for teaching purposes i could open the same pad in collab mode and it looks a little different you can see the yellow bar there so you're kind of sure that you're in collab mode notice that you have chat as well here i could open this in another browser or share this with a friend and then we could be typing at the same time and you could see their cursor jumping around and adding code to you can work together there's real time features of codepen that's another example of kind of a pro feature on codepen so so that's kind of that that's kind of the you know and there's so much more to codepen i haven't shown you projects i haven't shown you professor mode i haven't shown you asset hosting even that's a big one maybe we'll end with that one i can click assets down here and it's going to open up a your files section which i can drag and drop stuff like images and javascript and css or any file that i want to here and give me quick access to urls to use those on codepen and then there's some things that we give to you so let's say i wanted to have a picture of let's see playing cards i could do a search here and it's going to give me a bunch of design assets for playing cards hopefully and i can let's see i'm going to grab the full background image there i'm going to hit escape to close it and rather than a purple background here i'm going to use my new playing cards image back there and hopefully that will pop right in there background image url oh i have to hit run you could have told me that uh and it's so big that it's you can barely even see it but it did show up there i'll say background size contain and that's going to kind of squish it down covers almost the better one isn't it background size cover run and then i'll shrink it up a little bit so we can see the playing cards but we make those kind of things available to you and there's so much more but i'm gonna stop now i hope you made it this far thanks so much for listening code camp precode camp people uh it's so awesome to see some of you pop over to codepen and use it for stuff like learning and playing goodbye
