we've seen that with like design Trends all these startups now have websites that look the same but you know I think that we've become so practically oriented that we've kind of lost touch of that kind of creative angle and welcome back to the freec Cod Camp podcast I'm Quincy Larson teacher and founder of freecodecamp.org where each week we're bringing you Insight from developers Founders and ambitious people getting into Tech this week we're joined by Kobe fok he's a developer experienc engineer and a prolific teacher who has created 60 tutorials for free C Camp over the years and he's published 176 tutorials on his own YouTube channel all freely available this man is a Wellspring of developer wisdom Kobe welcome to the show hey thanks for having me I've been super excited for this yeah man like you are somebody in the community who's just like a main State you're like you're always there you're like the Energizer Bunny you never burn out you're always creating and uh it's it's like such a breath of fresh air to have somebody who's just like a super chill you know Dad who who goes out and like creates tutorials and I've never seen you in a bad mood either hopefully I won't say something that makes you angry and you won't like Hulk out I can't imagine yeah you won't like me when I'm angry yeah yeah well dude uh it's so cool to have you here and I want I want to learn more about you because I interact with you all the time and yet I know so little um so maybe you can share some of your uh Journey with us and we can go way back to maybe your formative moments like at what point did you first start getting interested in technology and design and just creating yeah so I've I've always just generally been interested in technology uh my dad was that way my brothers were that way I still remember sitting back behind my brothers playing like Warcraft 1 and uh all those kind of games on the older computers and just watching them with you know amazed um eventually getting into to playing those games myself you know playing Warcraft 3 and Counterstrike in high school and all that stuff but um from a code perspective and actually starting to play with the technology I still remember in Middle School sitting in a classroom my buddy broke out this HTML book that he got from his brother and we were trying to make all these different websites this is I think in the uh Angel Fire uh era where Angel Fire was like kind of like a selfhosted website like like you could just go in and customize it was like geoc City yeah like go cities and like you the crazy backgrounds with the floating text on top of the stuff and I just remember having a lot of fun doing that yeah yeah and a lot of people have started with like Neopets um of course Myspace you could you used to be able to use like HTML CSS to customize Mike space Mark Zuckerberg rolled in up in as the fun police nope you can't have any fun every page has to look like a boring Facebook page if you're on Facebook right but before that there was this Cambrian explosion of creativity uh people doing all kinds of things to customize their profiles and to build you know their you know Buffy the Vampire Slayer fanfic pages and like all this stuff right um yeah and you were part of that era uh you were growing up during the uh kind of like web the the Renaissance Era when is it considered a Renaissance when it's like the first time it happen but but just you know there were no rules right yeah people didn't think about accessibility they didn't think about like you know whether like some pattern on their um their website could induce you know epileptic seizures they didn't think about um you know localization or or how long it would take for the page to load or anything like that they had these crazy ostentatious Splash Pages it was it was a different world right yeah and it's funny you mention Myspace because I think that's kind of when I started getting slightly more serious about just playing with code because because of the ability to create and customize like I learned so much HTML and CS s by fitting that into their little text box to Overlay complete custom profiles and even making a few dollars out of it uh during that time but um I I spent so much time creating them and it's just amazing what you can learn with like CSS by being able to do that so you you were able to uh you know make some money helping other people set up their profiles yeah yeah yeah so like uh bands like I would create a band website and they would want their Myspace profile to look really nice right so uh I would charge them additionally to create a basically a custom web page for Myspace but uh because the way that it works it hooks into like you know the little mini player that used to be on there their profile picture so it's basically like creating a really Advanced template for a mypace profile yeah that's pretty that's pretty good work if you can find it like just being able to help local bands uh and and get get to apply your design chops and I don't want to jump too far ahead because I do want to take in those juicy like early years experiences of you unlocking different aspects of you know what was what is ultimately become KOB fok but uh but clearly like you did study design in school and and so would you describe that as like an early passion of yours Art and Design for sure I've always been interested in like the whole graphic design angle um just designing my own things uh I I always all the work that I did was always both design and development and you know when I was in high school I didn't like I had had a lot of fun uh and I was really engaged with coding things but I never really kind of took it seriously so when I went to go to school and I don't think there was really much curriculum around uh uh College curriculum around uh coding at that time or web web design and web coding at that time so um there wasn't really I didn't feel like there was really a path for that so uh deciding what I want to do I really enjoyed design so I want to try to go for graphic design um ultimately I like during that time I was coding the entire time on the side whether it's rebuilding my portfolio every year for my design work uh or trying to do like a WordPress site for somebody um but it was really just a side passion of mine the entire time and uh trying to make it through the the design program yeah and let's talk about design school because like a lot of people will not have the luxury of going to design school because like things are becoming so competitive that I just tell people like go study computer science like yeah uh like I I genuinely my advice to pretty much everybody in 2024 is like if you're G to go get a degree get a degree in computer science just because you're definitely going to use that like employers are definitely going to you respond positively to you having a CS degree uh but what was design school like um you know we've had people on on the podcast who went to like art school and we talked about art school confidential like the comic book and stuff like have you ever read Art School Confidential no no okay so uh Daniel Chloe I think he did like Ghost World and a bunch of cool uh graphic novels in the early 2000s late 90s um but but his experience going to art school where when you went to design school you went to a really good school you went to Penn State right um what was it like like what kind of things did you learn in school yeah so interesting enough like Penn State isn't like your traditional art school right but like they had this small art program or design program inside of it um and they only accepted so the first two years I was part of that design program but then after that they narrowed it down for the final two years to a group I didn't make that group to be honest uh because they only accepted 19 out of the 69 or so uh people that were inside of the actual program itself um which considering the size of the school is pretty small right yeah um but through those first two years I learned so much for like typography and um like Design Systems and um illustration and uh illustration through like illustrator not uh not by I I cannot draw for the life of me um but you know trying to really think about the design fundamentals from a graphic design perspective and it really had nothing to do with web design or anything like that but I feel like I was able to take a lot of the lessons that I learned and apply it throughout my time uh whether it's designing UI uh from more of a uex perspective or uh just trying to be a little bit more creative with how I um display typography on a page or something like that yeah and I've talked with several people um on the show uh who studied graphic design um and even uh Allison uh Allison Yun studied like fashion design uh and I've talked with people that went like architectural architect School essentially like and one of the definite like commonalities that I picked up is that like design is kind of like you have to apply Aesthetics and you have to it's not enough to to make some interesting brush Strokes on a canvas or to mold something out of uh bronze or or clay or something like that but you it has to have some practical I guess underlying business value right it has to do something yeah and like I thinking about it from an engineering perspective like you're solving a problem so graphic design isn't just uh and I think that's where it kind of in my opinion kind of differentiates itself from traditional art is that it's very problem focused where you're solving a problem with those designs as opposed to to uh expressing yourself right when I create uh my designs like it's solving that specific problem whether it's trying to Market a particular product for for an ecommerce store or whatever that may be yeah and um we're definitely going to get more into what kind of problems you've been solving over the many years of your career but were there any like really formative kind of like experiences in college like you're already getting this uh this bachelor's degree in design and graphic design design as a field is kind of waning in its importance like magazines are becoming discontinued um newspapers like like print graphic generally is focused on like print and then there's like web design or or it's called visual design is kind of like the the Webby version of that or or the uh I guess interactive design and stuff like that yeah uh did you at any point feel like hey some of the stuff I'm learning like may not be that useful like we were you like thinking about like what your jobs were going to be like where did you decide to further tool up your your already existing web design skills because as you said you were already doing some client work for bands and stuff like that but like like maybe you can talk about that journey into I need to get more serious about code yeah so I don't think there was anything specifically that made me feel that because of my career path that I needed to focus more on code it was always just a passion inside project and again like building my these projects on the side I never I still I don't think in college ever considered that that would be something I would ever do fulltime I think it was just this this medium that I was using to uh showcase my portfolio to help clients uh but where I would be focused focused on the design that they can then put on the website as opposed to the website that they can put the design you know what I mean by that like try to think of it from a different perspective um but I think one of the things that was interesting is how I was able able to apply that design um and the last two years I spent on learning photography as well and really take those lessons and apply them to uh crafting experiences on the web um so I think back to like when I worked at think eek like it's an ecommerce store and uh having to um think about how the products are going to actually fit on the product pages for instance and um working with the creative team to uh get their photography uh onto the site and uh those kind of things and it really I think it helped me think a little bit differently for how I was able to build those pages and and experiences yeah and when did you start working at Think Geek cuz Think Geek for people who don't know was this it was The Sharper Image for sis edms it was all like nerdy jokes and stuff like that like like half the stuff you saw in like Big Bang Theory it' be like purchasable it was amazing yeah yeah and they they just had this a lot of weird inside gags a lot of things You' probably buy and then you'd like regret like okay that was funny but now I own this weird object totally totally like a pet rock right yeah yeah it's it seems like a good idea at the time but then you're like man my wallet um so man I want to learn more about Think Geek what was it like how long were you there man uh I was at Think Geek for three years and I I still look back at it as one of my one of the top career uh one of the most fun times I've had in my career um is the culture itself was just amazing like everybody there everybody were Geeks like like we were all enjoying the same thing and uh everybody felt passionate about helping other Geeks and not only other Geeks but uh bringing Joy to the World because there's countless times where we would send uh um products to some kid that was having a hard time or going through a rough time in life and being able to see that joy that we were able to indirectly help them bring it was just really magical experience so um just you know I I miss those times dearly and the team that I was working with uh my buddies there um it's just a completely different experience that I miss but yeah and was that your first job out of college or no so I had two two others two and a half because one was parttime so yeah uh right out of college I started at an e marketing company startup uh called Snap retail that was pretty much just designing banners for their website and if you kind of like look into that so I wasn't doing too much coding but I was designing the graphics for the people who would code it up right um eventually I would do a little bit of code but then just to get my first fulltime job I actually kind of went back to a fulltime design job where I was designing uh wraps for tractor trailers and cars so you know there's big graphics on the side like with all the dead bugs yeah exactly exactly or or if you've seen The Big Bang Theory or not the Big Bang Theory uh we just talked about that uh the Silicon Valley like the the one guy has like his startup name he wraps his like you know Dad mobile thing it's like just a logo all over it it's like his his viral marketing or his Gorilla Marketing like everywhere I drive people are seeing my startup name yeah and like that was that was a huge learning experience like it was a lot of fun because I had a lot of freedom like that I was able to do um but also like it was a completely different format that you never think about so trying to solve the problems of that from a design perspective was really interesting yeah I guess interesting Dimensions too like like like how big can this graphic be like you have to have room for the wheel well you know lot of math because we would we would be given these little templates that were at scale and we' have to design on those little templates and those get blown up and then print it out and like you can make a little bit of an error and then it completely ruins the rapping team's job and that's HP that happened a few times unfortunately but it was it was an interesting learning experience yeah wow man uh I guess if I had infinity money I just wrap my car in like free C Camp since I like I'm kind of like a walking free Coke Camp billboard all the time just get like the the checkered the checkered logo all all over the car I might be at like a stoplight people like hey what happened to my account I can't claim the certification you know like no sorry I got my kids are in the back said I need little support yeah yeah maybe that's not a great idea that's that's interesting you're the first person I've ever talked to who has designed like truck CBS yeah yeah and like it's it was such an interesting because I never would have thought that I'd be designing for trucks and cars and that kind of stuff but like I had a lot of fun with it you know sometimes they would send the art and it was like a corporate thing that I needed to put on the side a logo or something but other times I was given complete Freedom like was it like Regal movie or this one movie theater that I needed to create a design for and I was able to take all the like characters from candy that they had and put candy in the background and I was able to create this really cool looking uh thing ultimately it wasn't used but a a beer company one I did was used but um it if you got that candy WP thing if you still have any of that around okay yeah yeah I'll I'll add a link to the show not so you can see what that concept for a movie theater candy truck wrap what it looks like because I mean it never saw the light of the day but at least we can shine some light on it enjoy it because it sounds like you did a lot of work on it yeah it was a lot of fun yeah so you you worked in a truck wrap company yeah and that was like literally applying your graic design that is a practical job that you can get as a graic designer doing Graphics you know doing them with particular client specifications working within design constraints right the the big thing about design and how it's different from art and take this from a non designer non artist is like with design you have so many additional constraints that you have to work for like clients are imposing or the laws of physics are imposing rules upon you uh and you know like you said you had to do a lot of mathematics to figure out like the dimensions of the car and like you only have so much canvas and you have to make every you know perspective of the truck interesting and identifiable probably I don't know what fun you mention the perspective cuz like I don't know if you've ever seen some of the memes where like the door opens and it looks weird so like you know you even have to take those kind of things into consideration it's you know it's crazy yeah you don't want it to look maob like the person's heads cut off when they roll down the window or something yeah exactly yeah so uh so right out of school you get this job and like were you excited at the time like I'm going to do graphic design or did this feel like kind of like a Backwater for you like is there like a big leagues for graphic design that you like had your eyes set on and this was like a step toward that or what what were you thinking in terms of career progression yeah so I think at that time like so I was working parttime at the other job and honestly I think I was just trying to find a job so I was literally on Monster I don't know if Monster's still around but I was that I could that seemed interes to uh to try to S it over um it it was you know it was challenging to find I'm sure it still is but um you know that's the kind of challenge that you run into and um I never did any like internships or anything like that when I was coming to school which you know I don't know if that would have helped or not but uh say you graduate from college 2010 okay so pretty pretty close to the uh Financial recession that uh was like the worst so I actually have talked to lots of people who graduated in 2009 okay 2008 2009 is like even worse but I mentioned you're not that far out of there so there was still diminished opportunity um what kind of uh what what would have your ideal job like when people went to design school and you all got together and you're like playing board games or you're having a party or something and you talk about like what the future is going to hold what would people be excited about what were people aspiring to do with their Graphics design chops yeah I mean I always imagine working at some kind of agency um you know I I think back to the TV series madmen and you know beyond all the the negative angles of Mad Men in that era um just like being able to work at a company the client comes in being able to create that design process like that that inspired me a lot um it's not a projector it's a spaceship or it's it's a time machine right that's what he says yeah man great I love that show I tell everybody to watch it even if you don't care about advertising even if you don't care about the 19 in America and all the social issues and everything that show is just a masterpiece through and through like it's Abby the editor that edits your work when you submit things and and that edits my work uh she is also I think it's her favorite show too like she and I always like make madman in jokes and stuff like that so good it's so good but yeah um sorry so so that's kind of like what you're envisioning and I guess madman wasn't on the air back then was it like if I remember correctly it was like right when I got out of school and was trying to find a job if I'm not crazy um so like it was inspiring that career maybe I'm mixing my times but yeah so so the first season or two might have been out by the time you you graduated so yeah yeah I mean would you all have like watch parties and stuff or anything like that like because I imagine a lot of designers were really into this man not I would never had any watch parties but I do remember just uh you between col and getting that first parttime job like I spent like a whole summer longer than a summer at my mom's house and I just there myself watching it um and yeah watch parties would have been fun in college but I don't I don't know that it really in my circles really blew up um because I didn't really honestly hang out with too much designers like in college and stuff um so yeah yeah well what kind of people were you hanging out with Gamers um well the photography te uh people uh and then just uh I don't know I had friends from uh uh from my area met new friends and I wouldn't say there's any like specific type of people it's just random people I met through college because you know Penn State's so huge like it's so easy to make friends in completely different areas and um I mean of course there's you have your clicks everywhere but uh like it's just easy to meet so many different people of totally different types yeah and uh for perspective currently they have around 90 ,000 students enrolled that's a massive University uh and of course one of the most grew since I've been there but yeah yeah wow uh so uh from truck reps yeah yeah where do you move on so during that time I pitched to them to build their website so I did that um and that helped me kind of spend some time professionally doing yeah quote unquote professionally um I was also just like with a friend's building uh like a deals site in the background do you remember woot.com well woot.com and Sh woot was the best they had the best cool funny shirts I would always buy those at Christmas time for my family and like every time they're like all right I wonder what I got from Quinsy this year oh it's a shirt they had so many good ones though and I remember uh I always had like the deal trackers so I was watching him but this deal say it like I would uh there was woot.com there was a bunch of other ones and it would like uh uh pull them all into one site I I never actually launched this thing to the public but I was working on it and I was learning PHP and I was learning all these uh tools to you know web development things to build this site um so like while it never launched it was a huge learning experience but anyways so that was some of my spare time spent leading me to um where I eventually got my first fulltime web design job working at a startup called show Clicks uh which was an event ticking software company um and I was able to pull that design and development uh where I would create custom Pages for some of their ticking ticketing software but also uh I built like their entire marketing site uh landing pages for that and that was a huge learning experience in itself yeah yeah are they still around or have they been acquired by uh the Big Ticket Master the big bad the final boss of uh any like person who wants to go see their uh see a Taylor Swift show or something I think fortunately there's still so they they were acquired by something called Patron technology I don't know who they are but there they still seem to be not under Ticket Master thankfully uh you know um but they were you know they were a small uh company based out of Pittsburgh um and they worked with a lot of cool events uh so yeah I had a lot of fun working through there yeah and then uh I'm curious so when was your first like because currently like your job title is developer experien engineer which is yeah yeah yeah really cool did you grad like I mean you already had design skills and you're already kind of thinking about like doing user research and understanding like uh what the end user is and yeah developer experience like there are lots of business to developer b2d um tools out there like obviously like any cloud services company like they're not primarily marketing to like the mass public they're trying to Market to developers and get people to build on their tools like what is your kind of like perception of the developer experience engineer role and how would you compare that to like just like is that similar to like developer advocacy is it similar to like like you you go to a lot of conferences and things like that like like how would you describe that and how did you get into that line yeah um so kind of starting off how I see uh how that role fits into the bigger picture um I think a lot of this kind of falls under the developer relations tree um you know it's arguable if it could fall under like other things or be its own bucket but um ultimately I like I I work with developers to help them become more productive and build cool things you know hopefully that's with the product that I'm working for cloud but I generally just want to see developers become successful um part of uh the way that I see the difference between developer experience and then developer advocacy is developer advocacy is more uh working directly in the community um more traditionally going to things like the events and uh creating a Discord uh for you know community with people hitting Community forms and stuff and while I do that stuff as like as part of my role it's not necessarily required or standard um what I typically do is anything code oriented so creating code examples content of course to go along with that um I create demo applications I uh I create and manage and create and manage and SDK uh to interface with kinary um basically just like anything that you can think of that would be code related that can help uh people uh succeed ultimately interesting so to an extent you might describe uh developer advocacy as as kind of like a hybrid like developer kind of almost sales type role uh and I'm not sure if that that may be an uncharitable description of the field but but essentially you are trying to get people to like be familiar with the the tool and adopt it but you're more focused on like okay once they're familiar with the tool once they're familiar with uh like they they're like okay I need to solve problem with why solution your why solution and what do you have for me that can help me solve this problem you're you're actually building the tools that help developers get those things done yeah and one thing like specifically that at least if you're doing it right the one thing that differentiates developer relations that tree compared to things like sales or marketing is that there's kind of a difference in priority where um my priority is the developer uh and then you know hopefully you can use the product but may that might not always be the case whereas sales and marketing is uh the product is the the priority so if from my perspective is I want you to solve that problem um hopefully it's with Cloud night whereas sales and marketing is I want you to solve that problem with that product uh if you can kind of see that differentiat okay so just to recap I want you to solve that problem versus I want you to solve that problem with my tool exactly exactly okay um and you know again like ideally like uh the tool can be helpful like if I believe in the product which which I do you know I I can see a lot of value in the person using it to solve those problems but ultimately I want you to solve that problem with or without it yeah and that makes a lot of sense and uh I think that's like a very good intellectually honest like uh way to be because you know developers like we're it's actually a pretty small community you might think like oh there there are 30 million professional developers on earth right but you know once you start like stratifying that down to like like different like locations and different areas of expertise and different things like that like I mean how many Cloud Engineers are there in Boston who uh you know do devops in cloud like they might have like a a Meetup and like 50 people come every time or something like that that'd probably be really good attendance for a Meetup but but like you can be kind of a known quantity in that area and people know you and you're giv talks about different stuff and you're building things and when somebody has like hey I need like uh you know an image optimization API that can where I can just like throw an image in there and it can do different things cloudinary can do so many different things it's really cool and we actually recently published a course taught by you on free code Camp uh that was made possible thanks to a grant from cloud Nary uh I've been talking with the cloud Nary folks for like years and we finally made it happen we got we got this course and uh I you know I was just thrilled to finally have an opportunity to have Kobe fak on the the free Camp uh YouTube because you're an amazing teacher uh and and we'll get into that but but just real quick to explain what cloud Nary is for people and I just want to point out this podcast is not sponsored by anybody right this is pro this is made possible by the 9,331 people who support free C Camp each month by donating so if you want to become one of those chill human beings and become a supporter and support our charity and our mission go to fre camp.org donate but I do want to be very clear that like there was no stipulation in our grant that we got from cloud that we would have Kobe on the podcast or anything like that I just reached out because I I genuinely wanted to talk to him uh but it is um it is uh timely that you you did recently publish this course and I want to call that out like if anybody's looking for a course that tells you how to use AI to you know update images and like some of the things that Clary can do are almost like Black Magic like they certainly would be considered you know sourcer if you were to go back 10 years now you can kind of understand how they work with the power of like Ai and things like that maybe you can just give a quick uh explanation of some some of the ways that cloud ner works and why you're excited about it yeah so I kind of like the interesting thing about images and videos is you really don't hit some of the problems that tools like Cloud can uh solve until you get to scale or if you have like specific problems that you want to solve so example um like for your random uh personal blog you probably don't need Cloud n but one thing people like to do is dynamically create social uh images for each of those blog post and Cloud R can do that so that's a personal use case but if you think about going to scale when you have like an ecommerce store with thousands and thousands of images um you need something that's going to be able to you know first of all handle uh that image load being able to manage the the images uh and videos more gracefully on the back end and those kind of things uh and that's where Cloud n really comes in and then from a programmatic perspect perspective you can do things like kind of like a Photoshop API uh with just some URL parameters which makes it pretty compelling so if you want all those images and videos to be a square uh and they're all different shapes and sizes like you can add a little bit of code to um do that to every single one right so it's really hitting those scale issues to just make it easy to work with the products and and like some of the things that it can do though that are really cool like I think it's called like image expansion or something like say you got yeah right what is it called Phill generative is the generative fill so you know generative AI generative fill so let's say you take a picture of me standing here and you want to get the rest of the picture but you don't actually have that to work with like Blade Runner enhance type stuff right like hey change the perspective what is the perspective has to do all this calculation figure out like but it does it it works pretty well so like you if you were to take this picture of me like just like cutting it off wherever this Frame if you're watching the video version of free cocam I'm holding my hands up to the side of my head if you're listening to the audio version which is what I listen to by the way uh I don't uh and yes there is an audio version uh and I encourage everybody to follow Freo camp in Spotify and in uh Apple music wherever you listen to it follow us and there will be a new episode every Friday but um let's say that you have like me and I'm like very tightly cropped in the frame and you want to expand you want to see the rest of my bookshelf uh you know and you want to see the rest of this white wall behind me and things like that like Clary can do that yeah yeah and is just with a little URL parameter um I like to kind of call it uncrop because when you're cropping something you're ultimately going to lose that data right like if I'm cropping you to a square I'm going to lose some of that data of the image and if I don't want to lose any of that data I want to expand that image and that's where that kind of tool can come in yeah and uh it just makes life a lot easier if you're trying to um work with images so again like we're not going to talk a whole lot about Clary but it is your current employer and uh I did want to like explain kind of the Contemporary work that you're doing right now yeah and I think the interesting thing about the course that I published I had a lot of fun with it cuz I was trying to uh replicate as many Google photos uh uh features as I can um and while some of the Google photos features you know just uploading uh images and storing them like that's uh that's not super exciting it's practical but not exciting but I was trying to replicate the Creations so creating a collage creating an animation um what else was it colorpop just real quick the the title of the course is I think like create a clone of Google photos right code your own Google photos like all that different functionality that Google photos have you're going to go in you're going to build a full stack web app and you're going to implement that again this is a free course it's available to anybody who wants to watch it I'm going to link to it in the show notes or in the video description just check it out and uh take in some of Kobe's thoughtful uh deliberately you know planned out teaching and and I think you're going to appreciate his teaching style u but but yeah like of the features that what are some of the funnest features funnest is that a word the most fun features that you implemented that you had the most fun with so the Creations are my top uh that's my favorite but also like the image editor and again like it goes back to just adding the URL parameters so like I was you're able to do so many different things you can remove a background like click remove a background enhance the photo restore the photo um crop it to like different dimensions and add a bunch of filters and effects and like it was uh some of those things were just so easy to implement and you'll see the course because they're just simple URL parameters that you're able to add and your photo just immediately gets that uh transformation it's uh it's pretty wild um but yeah a lot of the creativity is some of the stuff that you don't typically see uh with some of the image and video uh courses that there's a lot of interesting features yeah well we've talked kind of about your developer Journey uh we've talked about your your kind of daytoday work as a uh I have to look it up developer experience engineer uh uh again developer experience is like an entire field uh making life easier for the 30 million developers out there who have to do things and get tasked with different things Often by product managers who are not technical who don't understand uh like how difficult it is there's that XKCD comic uh it's what do you know what XKCD comic I'm talking about xkd I don't know which comic require five years okay I'm going to read it out loud uh H um okay yeah yeah yeah this is it okay um so I'm just going to describe it I'll just describe it verbally and I'll link to it but um there's this this boss um you know kind of like imagine office space there's a woman in a cubicle at a computer and then there's the the manager with his tie and his coffee kind of like leaning into the cubicle saying when a user takes a photo the app should check whether they're in a national park sure that's easy we'll just use the gis lookup give a few hours and then uh and then the boss says and check whether the photo is of a bird and then the woman says I'll need a research team in 5 years and it says in CS it can be hard to explain the difference between easy the easy and the virtually impossible I think that this is like actually today it would be very easy to determine whether there was a bird but this this uh I don't know when this came out uh probably at least 10 15 years ago uh but uh yeah like a lot of nontechnical product managers or or semi technical product managers may take for granted that like oh you can just do XYZ and actually it's really hard to do that right um and so this you know you're creating tools and helping uh make it easier for developers to like have to get things done you know a lot of times the manager may come to you with like kind of unrealistic expectations but if the tooling is good enough you may be able to like figure out a way to like actually meet their unrealistic expectations or you may be able to build something that has never been done before that does kind of like you know a good enough job at imitating like some incredibly hard science problem or something computer science challenge right yeah absolutely and like that's that's part of the uh you know both the fun and the challenge of it is trying to figure out what those uh challenges are that can help people to kind of prioritize that work but also then it's fun trying to uh figure out how I'm going to implement it in an intuitive way something that people are going to very easily understand um and become productive with yeah and that's where teaching comes in like you're somebody who spends a great deal of time thinking about communication right because it's not just like it may have taken you a long time to grock some Concepts you're like ah I finally got it I finally had that flash of uh that that epiphan or that Revelation like oh okay that's how it works but you don't want to have to drag everybody through that like you don't want to have to impose upon everybody to go through that same lengthy thing you may be able to figure out a way to condense things down like Aha and maybe people won't appreciate they didn't fight as hard for the insight because you you gave it to them uh of course a very good teacher can like ask questions to try to lead people on this journey of Discovery and have guard rails to keep them from going off in the total wrong direction and being in the weeds for like several weeks you know um how how do you teach how do you approach teaching and how do you balance like just ex explaining versus getting people to get their hands dirty and kind of like have these Revelations for themselves yeah uh so that's an interesting one um so part of what I try to do anytime that I'm building content is first of all I just kind of build what I want to teach um so with this uh the Google photos course for instance I I built the Google photos clone um I certainly went out of scope for that uh clone and I turned that into a starter template that people can get it's linked on the video um but ultimately like I I get it to a place that I want to teach it and then I try to start thinking about the different concepts you know I try to strip it back a little bit find things that AR aren't necessary to teach things that are just going to distract people from it so one example of that is I a lot of the times I don't teach uh UI uh stuff sometimes I do but it's usually not the focus so I try to come with a starter template that um already has a lot of that to find so that we're not spending a ton of time going through Styles and nitpicking on that we're focusing we're focusing on the actual problem we're trying to solve right um and then trying to break it up into little chunks where we can gradually little by little um build up to the Great thing and you know sometimes that might feel like a longer path than if you were to just to implement it but trying to make sure that we're explaining those Concepts in a gradual way that people are going to understand is critical to make sure that they're not going to just get super confused lost and then wanting to leave because they can't understand from that huge jump yeah absolutely like a lot of the things you're teaching are so unintuitive and like nobody would just independently arrive if like let's say you were like you know an Neanderthal wandering around on a Savannah and you saw this uh or I guess if you were Neanderthal maybe it would be like a frozen tundra or something but you saw this computer and you're like o you wouldn't just independently like arrive at like creating a web app or something like this like this a lot of this stuff is very unintuitive and it requires so many different layers of like uh formality and like understanding of like how different things work together and a lot of the people watching your course don't have the benefit of you know having study computer science and having written their own operating system or written their own uh you know compiler or anything like that and and they may not have a lot of the uh foundational knowledge they may not have had a math class since they were in high school right and so to some extent you have to figure out a way to kind of like summarize a lot of stuff and and it's a single course it's not an interactive experience uh where you're like having a conversation with them and you can answer their questions and walk them through things right you have to kind of like have this middle of the road approach where like the mean person approaching this uh mean in terms of like measure of central tendency uh the mean person who approaches this is going to understand this this and this and like they're less likely to understand this so I'm going to do a quick sidebar and explain this and yeah and that's the tricky thing like I I try really hard to not make any assumptions about uh what somebody already knows like if I'm creating a react tutorial like of I would assume that they know react but I'm not going to assume that they know every little uh API with react I I'm going to typically try to walk through that step by step if it's a New Concept just to make sure that they're able to still follow along um even if that's a completely fresh concept um I think especially for like YouTube at least for my content like the people that I I can't I really don't know if the majority of my audience is beginner or or Advanced but I try to make it where the problems are interesting enough for the advanced people um but friendly enough that people who are more of a beginner can still go through it um and both can enjoy it and learn something from it and an experienced tutorial Creator you know somebody who's created 176 tutorials on YouTube like that's that's like you get feedback from the audience and you start to like understand oh like I glossed over that but I should have gone in more detail or oh people feel patronized by the fact that I'm explaining this very basic thing and it sounds like most of my audience does understand how this thing works and I don't need to go into such detail right right trying to strike a balance where you're respectful of people's time but at the same time uh you know also not overly uh presumptive yeah for sure for sure yeah it's a tricky balance yeah and uh I have uh I mean you you've created so much successful stuff over the years in terms of just so many different courses that people have walked away with like yeah I like this guy he's a good teacher and I hear it all the time like uh definitely like I'll I'll see comments and stuff like like whenever people tweet on free cocam like with the tutorials uh again you've published uh what is it like 68 tutorials including like the Santa Claus tracker that was epic the Santa Claus tracker app uh but like it's always a joy CU there's like a little button on free camp and people can say tweet a thanks to the author and so I see those a lot and people it's like oh yeah I love seeing that I'm glad that they like uh K's article yeah yeah um man the Santa Tracker that's one of my favorites and cuz so it has more history than just a Santa Tracker cuz the reason I got into teaching in the first place is cuz I was working at a company where I was building a satellite tasking application that you would overlay the data on a map and before taking on that project I was like I have to build a map I'm going to go crazy this is so hard but like it totally wasn't as hard as it as I thought it was going to be so I was thinking you know other people probably struggle through that as well and Maps can have a really significant impact on science and stuff like that so uh I decided to start talking about it and teaching it and um so that's where that kind of seed came from but I love the Santa Tracker because it's also something that I've seen dads and parents say you know I just spent time with my kid building this Santa Tracker and they had a lot of fun with it I love seeing that kind of thing yeah and that's like what it's all about like I I love it when people are like I I played learn to code RPG with my kids you know or um you know like we worked we went through this python course together and and like we just had our laptops next to each other and I was like oh man that's like gives you the feels like you know uh that you're being able to play a part in like this you know role like the the the father son or the father uh daughter or or the mother son mother daughter like that relationship right like like they're going to have this shared moment and it was around something that you created you know um yeah that that definitely like one of those kind of like hair standing up on your on your arm type uh it's such a joy that we can bring those experiences to people yeah and um I'm really interested in just like learning a little bit more about your journey why did you start creating YouTube courses like this wasn't your job right like you had a fulltime job doing other stuff and you just what inspired you to like do that first big upload to Youtube yeah so it began with the mapping projects uh but then I just kind of started so most of it was writing at first and uh after I was talking about mapping I I didn't want to just talk all about mapping and become the map guy so so I started writing about other things and as you saw in free Cod Camp you could probably see there was that map one and then other stuff um but then at some point I don't know what really triggered me to want to do YouTube I just kind of thought hey maybe I'll give it a shot see what happens um and I remember I was so nervous posting the first one the very first one my first video was if I remember correctly was creating the table of contents inside of the free code Camp um content editor I don't know if you remember that yeah the the old ghost CMS yes which sadly we're still using just it's deprecated and ghost has moved on to other products but we we are migrating and uh if you are an author on the freeo camp uh publication soon we're going to be doing it on hash we're having such a great time with hash node and we've been working very closely with the hash node team uh and I've known them since the beginning like ear days uh you know and uh always inspired by them and and we're finally going to use them as a CMS they have like this Enterprise CMS that they're providing for free to our Char is the Headless hash node yeah nice nice I did a tutorial on that it's it's a cool product yeah and they've got like a lot of other stuff that's incorporated into that that uh is going to be available as well um that's awesome yeah they're making heavy or very fast progress with it yeah you've got like a lot of videos from the early days all with the kind of you're kind of like almost winking you're like taking a bite out of like this lollipop that's it's like the Earth on a lollipop or something like that yeah so that that photo amongst other photos is from my think days because uh thinki would use employees for product photos and I became like one of the more comical ones cuz like I would make the funny faces and everything you know surprised I don't do that more for YouTube thumbnails right but uh like that was one of the things the other one was I became famous not famous internally for hugging plushies so that's where my uh my yellow profile picture comes from the Star Wars one because I was modeling I was modeling uh Star Wars plushies but wow you're a male model is is it anything like in Zander do you mod days do you are you like programmed to assassinate that's classified yeah but why m models but but that's really cool so this is actual like product photo of you like so there were like you know Pops that were shaped like the Earth or something like that yeah so it was a series of uh of lollipops that had like different planets and the Earth was one of them and I just thought it was interesting uh for that particular because I was doing the mapping stuff so I was doing mapping and I was taking a bite of the earth I just thought it was a fun little play um but I I use that and I just kind of stuck it on there because the whole idea of uh people seeing my photo and like oh that's his video I'll watch that cuz I know that I liked it if they liked it right of course um and I just kept it on on there for the longest time and it's pretty memorable uh I mean I see it on like pretty much every video up until 3 years ago four years ago so and you know who knows if it was a good idea to take it off or not I was trying to take my thumbnails more seriously um I don't know I still haven't cracked myself for the thumbnail game I find that so challenging but yeah actually you you took it off I'm scrolling through your videos and you added it back in and you were using it as of like a year and a half ago two years ago yeah trying to test out see see works and what's not um yeah but I I don't know I I haven't learned I feel like I haven't learned anything cuz as soon as I feel like I did learn something like it it doesn't work so I'll tell you a secret on on thumbnails people may think oh free C Camp's thumbnails are kind of bland in our like area of expertise like these long tutorials you don't want people to like just click through like like oh that looks so interesting was so fun click it and then they watch like 10 seconds and they leave that's actually bad for us in the YouTube recommendation algorithm like we want to look very serious and like literal like you know python in 6 hours or something like that right we want it to look like intimidating because we only want people to click on it who are actually serious about watching it and then that like means that the the average person is going to watch it a lot more and it's going to be so like YouTube's algorithm and this is all Theory nobody knows how it actually works including the engineers at YouTube whom we talk to regularly um yeah but but the idea is that like okay now only people that are serious about python are going to be presented this video and they're going to click it and they're going to watch it and they're going to get a whole lot out of it and so the average watch time is ridiculously long because we did that like I mean we could actually be even less fancy in our thumbnails and just put python 6 hours like like really ugly font and only people and often I see like the videos that get recommended to me in YouTube uh a lot of times they won't even have a thumbnail it'll just be some guy at a video title but the video is really good yeah I don't know if you know web dev Cody but um it's funny I was talking to him before and like for a while he would always just use the default photo um he eventually started to test the thumbnails but like a lot of his just default thumbnails would just perform so well and he's like why am I spending time on these thumbnails when you know the default is working so well for me yeah it's it's funny yeah I mean not all of us are Mr Beast with like you know heaps of burning money and stuff I don't know what he puts in his thumbnails but does get lots of kids to click but like when you're when you're going after like software Engineers who are like okay I got some time dur lunch I want to learn something like you want something that is a strik the balance between appealing and serious and uh sufficient depth right like you've got uh a lot of your videos um are just really quick like bites uh but then you've also got uh you know live streams of you uh building stuff that that are quite a bit longer you do have like more indepth courses uh and you've got like do you have multiart courses on here I don't have any multiart um any of the multiart would just uh would be over on like uh Egghead or something like that yeah um but not on YouTube and that's a great opportunity to talk about like you're not just creating courses on uh YouTube and uh occasionally you know creating a course for free code camp and then publishing text based tutorials you create a lot of places um can you talk about like how the like if you're a developer and you get really good at like a tool or something and like one of these platforms like plural side or Egghead or frontend Masters front end uh I can't remember all the names of them there are a lot of them and they're um paid platforms that you pay like or O'Reilly right like the big textbook companies we have I think Bo on the free Camp YouTube channel has been approached uh by Manning and he's published a a couple courses for Manning for example like can you talk about uh how they approached you and like how how that went down and you developed those courses yeah so I approached them like this is years ago at this point because I was just familiar with uh some of their content saw a lot of uh people who I respected and uh looked up to as content creators uh were publishing on Egghead and um you know I wanted to be there I was you know inspired to uh create my own course on heed so I was reaching out to them uh I think I was able to find somebody that I was friends with who uh was already working there or not making courses from there and kind of get my in um but then from there like I learned a lot from egad throughout this process and one of the things that I like to publish on egad is a opposed to trying like you to me or something like that is um how ethical and how uh just real Egghead and Joel and the team around them are they're just really great people they're really focused on um really trying to provide a great education experience for people um of course you know it's a business as well but um just the the thought process that goes through all that is just really compelling for me as opposed for me to try to just push it on any random site um but you know I learned a lot from them for my my coding style like how I format my code editor how I uh remove distractions from the screen and um also how to kind of break some of that content I learned some of that from them um and it's just been an interesting and fun proog uh process a long the way and what is your kind of like workflow when you're sitting down to record because uh you you record a lot and uh obviously you've got like this really nice background with lots of plushies you got your uh GitHub octocat back there and oh yeah uh and you've got like uh you know baby Yoda uh stuff like that like and you have do you have another background that you use a lot in your videos too uh no so this is this is my primary setup um if it's another background it's either because I'm traveling or just an older video from um I I usually so like I have my desk here and I usually just record from here I've been thinking about doing like random broll things like in my backyard or something like that but I don't know I haven't gotten that creative in my videos yet I just sit here and knock them out yeah and what like do you have like a workflow like how what what goes into creating a video like do you just like hey that should be a video and you just sit down and knock it out or is there a lot of planning that goes into it yeah so I wouldn't say there's a ton of planning but what I typically do is I try to keep just like a backlog of ideas that I that I want to create a tutorial on and um that can be challenging since I already have 176 videos trying to think about something new that I want to do that I haven't already done um but once I have that the very first thing similar to when I do a course I build the thing first um I then try to create an article a written tutorial for every single video that I create so I'll first write that out um and while I don't create a script that somewhat becomes a script mostly just in terms of like the flow of the video so how I'm going to walk through and teach uh teach the the uh content and Concepts um but from there I again I don't create a script I know that's um something I eventually want to try out but just currently don't feel like I necessarily need it um but then I I just kind of sit down I try to record an intro uh and try to work through the content um I'm one thing that I do differently than I think a lot of people is I don't just record one long video and then edit it I create little Clips so I'll record the intro I'll record little blips of like every little uh everything that I say or code up and then uh edit those down all together but I kind of edit it as I work through the video so like if I have a bad take like I'll just go through and and delete all those bad takes before I drag it into the uh video editor so that like that's just a pretty it's just trimming it from there um but yeah that's so I think that's Yeah so basically just creating the article is almost like the prep work to being having everything in your head and having a clear kind of like almost like subconscious like okay I kind of know where I need to go from here so exactly like the way I describe it like when I uh when I write a lot of times uh I've already gone through I've done something so many times that I'm like it's almost kind of like the information is going through me but that what's really happened is I've structured everything in my brain and it just it flows like for these interviews I know they probably seem incredibly unpolished and rough and that's that's intentional but uh what I do my my process is just to do a ton of research listen to a ton of other podcast people have been on and uh and kind of build up this this kind of like uh this General like feeling this Vibe uh for who Kobe f is right uh and similarly like with anything I do I try to it's it's heavily Vibe based it's it's doing a lot of research and then it's just sitting down and uh you know doing it and it just kind of happens uh is that is that kind of how you feel like a lot of the course Happ it just it's happening you're not really thinking about it too much you're focused instead on what the next thing you need to do is yeah totally and you know the the writing out the Articles certainly helps from like a code perspective of the steps of the code but um like it's a different medium cuz I'll be recording the video um and something just might not feel right as I'm trying to teach it in a video in the video format so either I'll try to rework it or figure it out or sometimes just run into bugs um but like it's I do kind of just go off the cuff a lot uh based off of the prep work that I did um and you know so far it seems to be working out for me I I know not everybody can uh do it that way they need the script but um I I have a hard time uh trying to go the script route personally yeah uh it's interesting with script because technically like everything you deliver is more precise but there's like less feeling yeah it's kind of like the tradeoff I look at it because like yeah I can like when I read my book like the audio book version of the of my learn de code and get a developer job book that I I authored last year and released on the podcast feed it's on the same feed that uh if you're listening to the audio format you can go listen to my full audio is like 4 hours uh painstakingly edited it took forever to do it and because I wanted to get like the exact intonation and everything just like just perfect you can still there's still some imperfections you can hear my kids you know playing piano in the background and stuff like that during certain parts but uh but yeah like reading from a script you can sound very audite you can have very deliberate decisions around the words you use and how you structure things and have you know witty kind of like Transitions and stuff like that it doesn't feel as freewheeling as this but uh but at the same time it's doesn't feel as real it's scripted right it's just like uh like watching like uh reality TV which is heavily scripted uh or or very you know deliberately edited I guess versus watching like you know in Star Trek they never uh you know nobody ever burps and says excuse me or something like that right that doesn't happen in start Tre because it's not relevant to the plot everything that happens is like relevant to you know solving the weird like space anomaly or something at the T 20 minutes or so yeah yeah any sort of flavor comedic relief or anything like that is like very intentionally sprinkled in there because they're like oh we're about to go to commercial break we need to like add something dramatic so that people will you know stay tuned dur there's so much engineering that goes into that and I appreciate that engineering and I appreciate watching like a well done scripted thing but then I also appreciate just watching documentaries where people are like walking on the street like putting a mic in somebody's face yeah like that so yeah it's anyway um similar topic like I I've for a long time all the talks that I would give like I would always do a full script and that's how I did like a year or two of like all my online talks for instance um but like I I recently tried to start doing nonscripted talks and um I was super nervous about it because part of my issue is like uh like with anxiety like my mind would just go blank and I would forget the things that I would want to say but um spending extra time trying to like think about the the slides differently like rather than trying to create the slides to fit the script I would create the slides based off the story that I want to tell um and I was able to kind of position myself in a better way that I was able to do so unscripted and I think it's I think it ended up turning out better because while I was still super nervous about it like I was able to you know kind of feel like what people were thinking in the room what I what I actually wanted to tell them to inspire them a little bit more yeah and to some extent like by not having like heavily scripted it's more interactive and it it feels more organic like the things you're saying like oh that brings up a good point you know or you know anyway um I want to learn a little bit more about you as a person because in addition to being this uh you know accomplished engineer accomplished teacher very prolific you are a family man uh y maybe you could talk about uh meeting your wife and and something that uh you and I have in common is we are both married to people who were originally from a different country who've since naturalized as US citizens um yeah can you can you talk about that yeah so uh my wife she's from Brazil uh I absolutely love Brazil so shout out to all the Brazilians out there um she came over originally to be an opair and I met her online to be honest and opair for people who I didn't even know what that was until like a year ago yeah what is that uh so it's like a work and study thing so the goal is that she's able to come over and study uh in the United States but to kind of support that uh she would uh help kind of watch over uh she would live with a family and help uh watch over their kids and stuff um but like the primary goal of that was to be able to study get the get the experience over here um take that back and you know apply it to her career uh but I I like to say that I stole her because I uh you know we met online uh and we hit it off and she had no intent of staying over here but um you know after hitting it off we I she ended up staying here with me um but we went through that process of uh you know going through the green cards which was super painful going through and then going through the citizenship uh which was also really painful um and I say painful because of the uh the processes in place uh not necessarily anything specific to us it's just the process everybody has to go through is painful in order to get there um but you know it was it was worth it you know we're happy and so she was like did you experience the same thing kind of Mary Poppins like uh like staying with the family watching the kids probably helping the kids get to and from school and stuff like that yeah is that like an opare like it's kind of like a a living Nanny yeah yeah but then like you take classes or whatever uh for like the study aspect of it um so while the kids are at school you can go and you can what did she study yeah I'm not sure of the specifics around uh that angle um uh I don't know what class I don't remember what classes she took um but that was eight years ago now yeah um but yeah well congratulations on helping her thank localized I've already told kind of my my wife's localization story we met in grad school um after several years we were able to get a visa for to come here and and because it took so long she immediately got her green card when she arrived in the US because she'd been she'd already like done the duration of like waiting for the green card um and then we just you know settled and eventually many years later uh she was eligible to apply for citizenship we went to the we went to this big thing in California like thousands of people big naturalization ceremony and and they they played this song I'm proud to be an American I can't remember like what it what it was but it's like some country song that everybody has to listen to when they when they get localized or naturalized um what was your did you go with your wife when she naturalized or how did that work so she was naturalized during Co so I wasn't able to go in with her which was which was a huge bummer so I don't know exactly I know they gave her a little American flag that she carried out um but yeah unfortunately I wasn't I wasn't able to enjoy that with her that was a bit of a bummer but um we you know went back home and celebrated um remember correctly we had like you know uh American flag desserts and stuff sitting around you know yeah it was it was it was a different time because of the because it was like mid pandemic yeah well you you've been able to go to Brazil uh and and in fact uh did you go to a conference there recently yeah uh so we usually try to go every year uh at least you know at least once a year and this year uh I just got back a couple weeks week or two ago from Brazil JSC and that was in uh Porto Brazil and you know unfortunately they're going through a pretty rough time right now um I which is very hard heartbreaking cuz it's such a beautiful Community down there um and to see that happen shortly after I after I left with this is this is the floods that are affecting Porto Allegre we have a team member in Porto Allegre fortunately he uh him and his family were not in like the path of the floods uh but um yeah we always call it happy Harbor because that's what it translates to in English and so we're like the Happy Harbor is not happy right now but they're going to be happy again soon uh so um by the time this airs hopefully everything like the waters have receded and everything like that but um yeah definitely uh hoping the best for everybody affected by that and you were just there you like flying out like days before the flooding started literally two days uh after we left uh the the terrible floods uh happened um we were we were there for so after Brazil JS comp we went to the city outside of Porto Le and um it was raining the entire time and raining decently hard the entire time and you know we were just thinking oh it's you know pretty bad rain it's long um and there was even like roads I I laughed sorry there was roads that were breaking on our path to get to that City when we were coming home so we were afraid just from that we weren't able to reach back to the city um but we made it back to the city and at that point there were no flooding issues that we were aware of um but then we heard two days later that all that was happening it's it's insane yeah well how how's your wife's family does she have family there so so she's not from there she's from a state called madise and uh so that was much more North and fortunately wasn't affected by any of that um but so yeah they're they're doing well yeah well um I'm glad that her family is unaffected and uh yeah definitely hope everything goes all right uh and that they're able to you know probably billions of dollars and damages and like lots of Life lost uh it's it's going to be a big process to recover um but but Daniel from our team you know his family's there uh you know they're they're doing everything they can to like power through that um yeah yeah well I wish everybody they're the best of luck you know yeah absolutely um one of the things that um I'm really impressed by about you is just like how wholesome and down toe you are like I don't think I've ever seen you not smiling and it makes sense that you'd be like a model for thinking and like you're always happy you're you know have you ever seen like that the nerd Parx or the geek Paradox it's like like the happiness for a typical person is like as highest at high school and then it starts to dip but the happiness for like you know a geek is like lowest in high school and then it just slowly climbs through their life okay yeah yeah because they they get to do what they love like they're not afraid of like Society calling them nerds or Geeks or whatever like like that it's almost like a badge of honor and I think nerd culture is one to the point that like basically I even hear the terms nerd or geek anymore like my kids like love computers and I've never heard any of the other kids like computers are nerdy right right right right yeah it's kind of like the Geeks one and now with with the internet there's so many different subcultures and everything everybody's into like different types of music and different different types of everything and it's it's fine like it's expected that everybody has different uh you know interest like very hyperfocused on specific things uh like people aren't ashamed to say that they are really interested in like bug collecting or something like that right whereas before it might be looked at as like what's wrong with your kid why doesn't he play on the football team you know right right yeah it's it's been amazing because I remember like it's funny just I connect thinky because of that culture but that was before like geek culture really exploded but then honestly around the time that they got bought by GameStop and you eventually they Sunset it like that's when that was that bubble was starting to grow because now all the the stores wanted to carry all your pop funkos and um now of course they're kind of oversold but uh that's when it was starting to grow and grow and grow and now we can see it all over and like we we think about the Marvel movies for instance like that was that's like if you go back like 10 years ago that's a super geeky thing um and now like everybody loves to go watch those movies and you know it's it's cool to be able to have that much content you know marvel maybe overdid it a little bit but um it's cool to have so much like amazing content like for the kind of Worlds that we love you know just freely available I mean like our kids will never have the experience of being ostracized because they're really into like Scandinavian death metal or something like that right it's just like everybody's into like whatever you know whatever you're into it's cool nobody cares right there's that there's that uh that web comic the guy is like he's like walking down the street he's all distraught he's like nobody gives a damn and then he stops and thinks for a second he's like nobody gives a damn right uh so cool man uh I'm so happy to be alive during this period where like there's not this Con force of Conformity because like you know I I grew up and I'd like listen to Rush and watch like the subdivisions uh you know music video from like 1982 or something like that great video that I was talking about uh with uh with Jessica Lord who grew up in subdivisions uh around I think around Chicago area like uh you know it used to be that like you had to conform and fit in and like there was pressure to drink alcohol and stuff like that and like my understanding is a lot of that is receding and there's just more General acceptance among kids and a lot of that kind of toxic you know Conformity culture is is like going away and amazing you're a new dad right like you you have a threeyearold yeah yeah he's going to be three in July and man it's it's been a wild ride he's I love him so much uh but it's definitely one of the biggest challenges I've had in my life life um but you know also one of the best things that's ever happened in my life so yeah it's been a fun balance and I've learned so much through this process tell me a little bit about him like like what is he into as a threeyearold yeah so uh he's wild uh going all around he loves to just kind of run around and play uh more recently he's uh done more of like the imaginative playing you know with the figures and stuff which I have a lot of fun watching him uh do um yeah I I he he likes trucks a lot right now so he has like a bunch of little uh like you know like a dumb truck uh I don't know all the different names of the trucks but um and cars and stuff so he's been playing around with those a lot yeah my kids uh were a little bit older my son six now and he loves making Mario Maker levels that's amazing yeah and he'll he he cuz for a while like it was like this he went through these phases where he's like he'd love to like borrow my phone and just like find real really hard Mario levels on YouTube like these you know wow people that like I guess stream Mario maker like several hours a week and extremely good like precisely timing their jumps and you know spin jumping off the piranha plants and everything and he would watch those and then eventually I got a Mario maker to and man he just went crazy with it like he built so many levels and uh I remember when like he uploaded his first level he's like wow and some kid liked his level and that was just like huge deal he was just like what somebody likeed My Level that's amazing and just like think about like the world we live in that you can do that right it's just so cool I mean you obviously you're wearing a Super Mario Brothers tshirt uh with like a lot of the Sprites from the original uh uh NES game 1985 1986 or seven here in the US that it was released but like it's such an iconic game and uh you know you and I our gaming experience was very like one way it was like we consumed the game maybe we got really good at the game we could like you know get to like the the kill screen quote unquote kill screen on Tetris or something like that of course now we know that's not the kill screen and then people would just keep playing Forever Until the game literally like crashes uh it just it was called a kill screen because it got so hard that it was thought that you couldn't conceivably move the pieces over far enough and that you would just die um didn't a kid recently break the record for that within the last year yeah so so there was like something called like uh hypertapping which is where you just tap really fast and then somebody invented rolling cuz for Original Classic NES Tetris uh you have to play on the old NES controller the boxy one that like cuts into your palms and stuff not not the most ergonomic controller the most ergonomic controller is the N64 controller but uh you uh actually I don't know that that's the case but like I always thought it was with the extra handles it was a really kind of freak of nature design thing to have like three different handles on it but that was definitely the most Innovative controller ever in my opinion but uh sorry for like the long tangent people who don't care about gaming they're like I want I want to learn to code what are you going to talk about how to get better at coding but classic NES Etc like so you hold it and you kind of like roll your fingers against the thing and like the number of rolls is how many times your finger will tap it so you can go Boop Bo Boop as long as you can as fast as you can like roll your fingers you can move that many spaces to the left or the right so you can move the piece around the piece well and uh get it oriented and and you can get some lines that way but people like these are young kids they're playing a game that was created you know 20 years before they were born in some cases um and they're just tearing it up and and kind of blow like who would have thought like but that game is probably played and the other game that's extremely optimized by speedrunners of course is Super Mario Brothers uh on NES to where they've got like these like frame rules like they they've dissected the co code and figured out like if you play perfectly and all this stuff you have to save like I think 13 frames for it to actually reduce the amount of time at the end of the level so people are trying to shave off frames and then they hit like some threshold oh we shaved off 14 frames so now we like saved a frame roll right right and like yeah it's incredible how I mean this is the level of geekiness that even you and I would probably be like whoa this guy's like really down the rabbit hole right with this with with like trying to shave a few milliseconds off of their Super Mario time but it's amazing though yeah and it's so interesting for me I love watching videos about speedrunners um my kids love watching like Games Done Quick and stuff like that and it it's just really really cool that we live in this like geek culture that the Geeks won and that now we have like this incredibly longtail form of entertainment and then we have distribution channels like like you and I would never be I guess compelling enough and down the middle of the road like interesting enough to enough people to be on like one of the big three you know networks from our parents generation right like used to be three TV channels right and how many channels are there on YouTube I don't know like hundreds of millions probably right each with their own special Niche so so like we are alive at a time when we can express and we can teach and we can find other people who have such ecle you know esoteric interests as ours and we can connect with them yeah yeah yeah so and I was thinking about like the the fact that K was watching the speedrun videos and like just that alone that's not something that we could have done when we were going up right like we didn't have speedrun videos to we didn't have maker videos to watch um like it's just a completely different world and it's it's amazing that we have all this um you know and being able to grow out into this community and meet people and have common things with everybody it's amazing time I mean the closest we got to that kind of thing was like probably magazines like egm next generation was a really cool one back in the day of course Nintendo Power with the iconic Super Mario 2 like clation thing on the cover of the first issue um I remember getting a couple walkthrough magazines for games that I was having a little bit of hard time with yeah and I you know I'd create Zen and some of my friends would create Zen like Zen being the shorten form of magazine which is a cool Arabic word that is a lone word into English oh um but we would create Zen and like go to the photoc cop here and publish them and pass them around at school and stuff and that was kind of how we shared our uh our esoteric interests um but now it's just super yeah like I put something on the Internet and like like I love Hot keys right I create like some article about how to use this very specific type of hotkeys in mac and like people just organically start seeing it because they're looking for something like that so it's pretty cool to be a Creator in 2025 for sure which next year this year is 2024 yeah yeah I'm getting ahead of myself I I was wondering this is going to be published next year right yeah so uh I have just like a bunch of Rapid Fire questions cuz uh I want to be mindful your time uh okay you're really into space like that like you got space jelly as your mascot first before we talk about space let's talk about space jelly yeah so um I I've just always loved and been gravitated to space like gravitated uh I just you know am amazed by it I think it's super cool and like I I always tell my wife like the one one of my buckless goals is to go to space and cuz I would imagine by the time I'm about to die like it's going to be cheap for just you know at least going up there and exploring she doesn't want to but I told her I'll I'll take my kid there uh but you know it's just I don't know I've always loved space and um I've always thought jellyfishes were cool too they just look really cool and the way that they're kind of in the the water I love kind of the colors that are associated with that like the purples and the blues and um so I I wanted to create some kind of character because I thought it was cool that like some of these uh content creators had a little character or something and I wanted my own uh just for fun so I asked my buddy uh who was a phenomenal illustrator uh to I to create one and of course I paid him for it um and I told him I I was pretty loose with what I won you know a jellyfish astronaut and he came up with uh the character and um that's kind of the the origin behind that and yeah I was super happy with what he came up with and thought it was really cool and and you've just run with it right that's your mascot yep yep create stickers you know I uh give them out to people whenever I go to conferences and uh try to do some giveaways every once in a while and and it's not something that I'm trying to like blow up into some huge brands or anything but like it's just I don't know it's it it makes me happy and you know I hope it makes other people happy and that's yeah well if you want to be really happy listen to the '90s band jellyfish they've got some I've never heard yeah really solid band they only had like two albums but they're like really creative and fun uh that's awesome yeah definitely check out uh their albums um and speaking of the fish though uh I I it was my birthdays but my wife got this custom created on uh Etsy which was just amazing yeah I object yeah yeah yeah it it's just amazing that they were able to come up with this and so I keep this on my desk as well well you are a hardcore plushy uh connoisseur and to have a plushy of your own personal mascot that's pretty awesome one day I want to create like a a rubber one I don't know if you know Jason Lang like he I want to create like something like this one day but you know one day yeah and Jason lorf uh interesting used to be in like an emo band and he he's a really really good guitarist like I listen to like a lot of his uh kind of like kind of punk emo music videos and stuff super chill dude that's aome I I've never heard any stuff I was in a band in high school but we we just played like a a graduation in the basement and like at a park once so we didn't really do anything but we recorded an album but yeah that's cool I would love to check it out if it's uh if you got it like archived anywhere dude I'm a digital packrat I have like every single thing I've done I have in my if you have a link to it I will include it in the show notes and people can check out your high school sounds good sounds good awesome uh I want to talk a little bit like practical tips because I don't want people to think like oh they just talked about you know Kobe and and quiny shared a bunch of personal anecdotes the whole time I want people to walk away some with some actual advice from having listened to this entire thing and um I'm really interested in like what knowing what you know about like your career progression from designer like let's say somebody is in the audience and they did go to design school or they're really interested in design but of course magazines are essentially over and even a lot of web design and stuff is kind of like solved is what I've had some designers describe it as is like there's kind of like a few op like there's just not the wide open decision space that there was in the U or design space that there was in the Myspace era where a website could look like anything now it's kind of like people have this expectation that it looks this way you got all these like domino people literally getting sued because their page wasn't accessible enough stuff like that like like what advice would you give to people interested in design or people who have design degrees who want to get into Tech and get like a a a knowledge worker type job job and have the uh you know relative uh stability and comfort that that sort of job provides them yeah that's a great question and like so I one thing that's interesting off of that is I kind of had to challenge the the notion of that everything actually does need to look the same way and I think that ends up happening I mean we've seen that with like design Trends all these startups now have websites that look the same but you know I think that we've become so practically oriented we've kind of lost touch of that kind of creative angle and you know sometimes you do see websites that do really amazing things but I think often what you'll see is that the usability isn't taken into consideration as much as it should be during that process so that's where we get into the situations where um they go to the site it's completely unusable the accessibility is not present at all um and that gives that kind of idea bad reputation but there's a lot of ways that we can get around that um and it's cool to see some of the like uh CSS grid work that's been uh going on and some of the demos I've seen that take advantage of a lot of the like typographic and uh layout design that you would traditionally see in some of these design schools um where all this is leading to is I really think that we do need to kind of bring more back of uh more of that traditional design back into the web design and um I I don't think I'm the one to do it I think I've lost a little of that edge but um I'd love to see designers really Embrace that and uh try to create their own uh expression um um to be able to create better experiences on the web yeah um so it's not solved it's in stagnant state but it's not a solved State and in fact it may never be solved because Aesthetics is subjective right yeah and like uh for sure and like I think we're going to keep going through those trends of the design like things that are more popularized than others um and I think something that might be like borderline solved is just more of the traditional ux pattern so um if you're showing a form like you want that form to look a certain way to make sure that people have their expectations for that form but that doesn't mean that the content and design around it can't be more expressive right um so that's why it's like the UI patterns as opposed to the the web design itself um is differentiating what you're trying to put in that bucket right yeah 100% so again like surprising people and delighting people is great when they're yeah you know learning about your product or something like that but but when they're trying to like input a credit card that's probably not the time to uh that needs to be precisely optimized you don't want to play around with that yeah yeah awesome uh I'm also interested in like where you see tools going with AI because of course Cloud Nary makes heavy use of AI and that's how they accomplish like at scale inexpensively uh like for pennies on fractions of pennies on the API call they they do this AI stuff like what are the immediate consequences of us having just profoundly better AI yeah so I kind of see two angles for this like from a perspective of where it's going um you I I've been saying this for a while that I think that people really try to just hop in the wagon and throw a chatbot wherever they can and you know while there's some value some people I don't think that that's going to ever be the future of AI like I think really it's how we can take the those tools and integrate it into our workflows so rather than having an assistant that gener a blog post rather writing a blog post and you have an assistant that helps you write write it so you know it gives you tips uh grammatical things and those kind of things um because to be honest like a lot of the times generative the generated content you can kind of tell that it's AI generated like it always has that that Vibe same with the videos like it always has that generated Vibe um so I encourage people to kind of think about it differently from a workflow perspective um now thinking about clowner specifically and this isn't intended to be a plug this is I cuz I just think it's really cool like I think that's where some of their products be AI products become compelling because things like uh being able to analyze an image and create captions or alt text from that image automatically using AI is very compelling because that's going to help a lot of people from an accessibility and SEO perspective um but it's not necessarily generating the image um it's analyzing it so that we can provide a more descriptive uh an easier way for more people to experience that uh who might not be able to visually um but those kind of things like I really think it's more workflow oriented and helping us become more productive not necessarily taking away the creation yeah and uh I do see it as like just a tool and and I don't like chatting with chat Bots and I I agree with you that like you know hey our our website now has a chat bot like technically they had like primitive chatbot like support things or like things that would stall while they got a real human on the horn maybe they don't actually need to get like a real human to like come in and tell you to uh that you signed into the wrong account or you accidentally created a duplicate account or something again I say that again because that's the most common support thing we have is like you deleted my progress I'm like no you probably off originally with your Google account and then you Au with like your GitHub account or something like that the emails didn't match up but uh you know like things to to address those kinds of uh common things um yeah I I can see AI doing so many little things like so interestingly um the have you ever seen the expanse I know you're a space fan I I'm like three quarters away through the first season um so depending on where you're referencing it may or may not so they asked the expans authors the the author team that like wrote the books that the the show is based off of by the way strongly recommend the expi it's probably the most accurate like uh in terms of physics and things like that like TV show we've gotten since like 2001 Space Odyssey um where like literally like they're up there trying to figure out what the Stars would look like from a specific position in space things like that right aming like yeah incredible attention to detail in 2001 Space Odyssey but similar in the expanse now of course there's some kind of Fantastical elements and stuff as well but and a lot of hand wavy like oh we just have nuclear fusion it just works you but um but uh in the expanse like they ask the authors like where's the AI like wouldn't AI just be everywhere like why are people still doing all this stuff and they're like yeah tons of AI but it's invisible it's like whenever you see like a ship passing through like a tight passage or something you see all the the turs collapsing and like all that stuff like nobody on the ship has to tell it to do that stuff it's just like their perceptions uh on the ship the ship's monitoring all these different things and like of course like the ship robot and stuff just kind of like intrinsically can like diagnose radiation poisoning and stuff like that so like like you know the AI is there but it's not like it didn't fundamentally change society it just made things Al easier in a lot of very kind of like grab bag ways right and I mean I don't think about AI as like oh it's going to be able to you know make my image the exact right size and it's going to be able to you know make sure that it's the exact format that is the most efficient for this particular thing like a lot of very specific kind of problems that you don't even think about those are the ones that AI is probably going to solve you're probably still going to be sitting at a desk they like what am I going to write a tutorial about today you know right right right right for sure like I while I think that AI can will be able to practically solve things like it's still going to be a linear path for the AI to get there so there's a lot of problem solving that goes around that and a lot of contextual things that I don't think will'll ever not willever um that is just a little bit more difficult to solve and then you got to think about the upkeep from there like of course the can keep doing it maybe but um we're definitely not there yet I don't think we're going to be there for a while um so I I don't know it's just not something I'm personally worried about uh but I do think that people um should embrace it as a tool um personally I don't like using it too much but from people who are able to use it it makes them feel more productive so um if you're able to feel more productive uh no matter where you are at your career you know take advantage of that just be we that AI still is in a state that um it might have the hallucinations it might create code that doesn't work and stuff like that so um as long as you're kind of using it in skeptical way almost like it can really help you yeah yeah where it could get dangerous is if people just always assume that it's true or people start like factchecking each other with GPT and being like see you know yeah yeah that's why like I I really find it more compelling from the analysis side rather than the generative side yeah um where it's really trying to look at an enhancing your workflow as opposed to trying to take away your workflow yeah well what do you think um in terms of like specifically transitioning from developer uh you know Web Web Master it sounds like back in the day you were doing stuff like that uh doing doing uh visual design on websites and things like that like transitioning to a developer experience engineer how would somebody ultimately get your job if they uh wanted to work at like one of the literally thousands and thousands of De business to developer like Tech Tool type um companies out there yeah um so primarily like I think you need to have experience as an engineer and like I'm not trying to gatekeep or anything but um I I do think that having some experience actually working as an engineer or developer um actually solving problems is important to kind of uh give you a bit more context and maybe that's not working for a company maybe that's you doing your own Contracting uh building stuff but ultimately like having that experiences and you're building things helps you have that context and empathy and everything that goes into kind of understand how these uh pieces fit together why this really helps solve problems at scale uh that other tools might not those kind of things um from there I I created so much content like I um so it's still kind of that devil angle it's definitely not a requirement like some people try to come in only content creators some people come try to come in just as an engineer but um having that Balan and like anybody can publish a blog post these days you go to Hash node for instance like you were talking about earlier um like you just kind of got to get yourself out there start building in public um build things and that's probably the underlying thing build things um whether that's building your own portfolio site over and over like I did or it's you know building example clone sites uh like Google photos to try to build more experience it's ultimately about getting that experience uh working and talking about it yeah awesome that's a great note to end on just build things as kby said twice for emphasis like build your portfolio site over and over just keep retooling it keep uh you know customizing it over the years as time progresses and when you're including some additional you know portfolio pieces why not also update your portfolio to like make it look more contemporary you know get like glass amorphism in there or something I don't know right right yeah I mean your website is typically one of the lowest risk ways to be able to do that and have something that's actually in production right because like um people might come to read some of my blogs but like if somebody comes to a down site you know on some random Thursday like because I'm experimenting with some new uh tool like that's more beneficial for me that I'm learning that experience than um them having that downtime that I could later fix um so uh I I love to encourage people to do whatever they want over over engineer your personal blog over engineer your personal blog and as you said build clones and a great clone to start with of course uh just a just a reemphasize you've got this excellent course uh that we just published like a week or two ago uh how to build build a Google photos clone and it covers so many different things and it'll give you just tons of practical experience like taking an API integrating it and do you use nextjs what what uh what tools do you use for that yeah we're using nextjs for that one nextjs and just cloud like the amazing thing is you can do all this with just clown R yeah uh so again I'm going to link to that be sure to uh follow this guy his amazing YouTube channel where he's published so many tutorials over the past four or five years um and uh again I am having a blast learning from you and I'm so happy that like so many of the people in the space are just like these really chill down to earth accessible people cuz uh you know in a lot of Industries people are like I'm important you know like you approach them conference they're like I'm I'm too busy to talk to you you know like that is not the case generally in software development like people want to teach each other there's not this same kind of like fear of like this person could be like trying to like apply for my job six months from now or something like that right because there's still an abundance of opportunity out there even though it may feel like right now like nobody's hiring because the interest rates went up and companies are like trying to cut costs and stuff like it's going to come back and uh I'm optimistic that your approach of just being a chill human being whom people like you're a known quantity in the community you're probably always going to have a job right like you're probably always going to be able to go find another good developer role uh you know if if you need to and and yeah yeah that is very much the way to be like I definitely look to you and I look to your kind of uh just cheerfulness and and your just general kindness and like you're unabashed like this is who I am you know I love that about you so I'm so cool that other people in the community that that we had this opportunity to sit down with you uh and like learn a little bit more about what makes Kobe fak tick yeah and thank you so much it's been an absolute pleasure it's always a pleasure to chat in with you but uh this was a good time well everybody until next week happy coding happy coding
