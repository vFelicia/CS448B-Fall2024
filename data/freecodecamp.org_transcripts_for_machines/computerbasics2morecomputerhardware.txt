Hi, I'm Briana from freeCodeCamp. Let's quick review. The four basic parts of a computer are the Input–like the mouse or the keyboard The Output– what you're seeing on the monitor or hearing through the speakers the CPU– the Central Processing Unit and the Memory. Now Memory can be shortterm memory called RAM or longer term memory. That is usually is a hard drive, but can also be like a CDROM or Flash Drive anything like that. In addition to those four basic parts, we have three more things we're going to discuss today. The Motherboard, Expansion Cards, and Power Supply. The Motherboard is what connects everything. While the data is flying around over here trying to figure out where to go, the Motherboard helps route it. So it goes to the right place. Expansion cards are sound cards, video cards, that kind of thing that can really up your experience as a user. Power supply is as it sounds– what gets power to the computer. It's usually the part of the computer that has that fan on it to keep it from overheating. So let's do a quick review. In addition to the four basic parts of Input/Output, Central Processing Unit, and Memory We usually have a Motherboard, Expansion Cards, and a Power Supply.
