in this video I'll be defining four binary operators for sets I've defined uh two sets A and B to help give some examples so the first is a union B which equals a set containing elements P such that P is an element of a or p is an element of B the next is the intersection a intersection b equals the set containing elements P such that P is an element of A and P is an element of B the next is the set difference of a and b which equals the set containing P or elements P such that P is an element of A and P is not an element of B and finally we have the symmetric difference which is uh going to be very helpful when you actually complete the symmetric difference algorithm challenge so the symmetric difference of a and b equals the set difference of a and b unioned with the set difference of b and a and finally I will uh fi Define the irrational numbers which I hinted to at the end of last video so the irrational numbers are simply the real number real numbers uh minus the rational numbers and that equals the irrational numbers
