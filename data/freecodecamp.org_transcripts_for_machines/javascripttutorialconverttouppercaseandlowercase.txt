did you know that in JavaScript you can convert all the characters of a string to uppercase or lowercase you just need to call the two uppercase method to convert them to uppercase and the two lowercase method to convert them to lowercase but you're probably thinking right now aren't strings immutable why can I change them just like that without any errors or bugs well you're not really changing them directly you're creating copies that you can work with and assign to variables so you can use them in program later on
