let's see how you can create a password field in HTML we create the label and input elements in our HTML file we add an ID attribute to the input element and a four attribute to the label element let's see what happens if we use the value text for the type attribute in our input element everything we write is clearly visible and that is exactly what we don't want so how can we fix this we just need to update the type attribute to the value password and this will create a password input field where everything we write is hidden now if we write our password we just see a sequence of dots and some browsers might even display asterisks instead of dots but either way your password will be hidden and that's how you can do this in HTML
