In this video we are going to talk about an important device in networking called a 'network interface card' or NIC. So before we talk about that I want to give you an example of how humans communicate. Now imagine we have three different people John, Bob, and Mary. How did they talk? When you're talking you're using your mouth. So you're transmitting information using the mouth and the other person is receiving the information through their ears. Now, how do computers, y'know, talk or listen? They have a device called 'network interface card' which acts as the ear and the mouth of the computer. So that's how computers talk through the 'network interface card.'
