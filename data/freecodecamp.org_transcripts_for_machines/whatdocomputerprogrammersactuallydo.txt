so what do programmers actually do let's look at the wiki definition of a programmer computer programmer is a person that creates computer software and what is computer software computer software is a set of data or computer instructions that tell the computer what to do let's take wikipedia as an example wikipedia needs software engineers to make sure that when you and i open the same article to edit it we can actually collaborate on it and the changes that you made won't be erased when i click the save or added button wikipedia needs a set of software engineers to maintain its databases all over the world because believe it or not wikipedia has around 6 million articles so we need to make sure that all of that can be maintained and be robust wikipedia needs to make sure that the front end of the website looks the way the designers have implemented so it needs a set of frontend engineers to do that wikipedia also needs to make sure that when you i millions of people around the world open millions and millions of articles wikipedia doesn't crash it's fast and it's able to maintain that huge overload software engineers solve problems and to solve a problem x they use coding as a tool so essentially software engineers are problem solvers and to solve a problem x the programmer needs to understand the problem they need to understand the context around the problem they very much need to understand the constraints of the system surrounding the problem and they of course deeply need to understand why they're solving the problem they're solving it might go something like this i work as a software engineer at airbnb and let's say airbnb wants to develop the wishlist feature to develop this wishlist feature i as a backend engineer would be responsible for all the underlying logic that you the user do not see but that is how the system works so when you heart a house on airbnb i need to make sure that this house is going to be associated with the wishlist list that you as a user create and that this list in and of itself needs to be associated with my user accounts and that this list is going to be saved in the database the house will be saved in the list in the database and associated with my account i need to make sure that when you unhard the house it's going to be removed from my wish list and removed from the association with my user account all that is what i as a backend engineer would be responsible for a frontend engineer will work closely with me because they need to know what is the underlying logic for this feature as well as with a designer who will propose the designs of how it will actually look like on the platform and then all of us together will also work probably with the data scientists because a data scientist will actually analyze how successful was this feature should should it be something that we should keep on the platform so we would implement logging to track how popular the feature is how many users use it are they happy with it is the button color all right so all of us will work as a team on this i hope this shed some light on what programmers actually do and if you like this video don't forget to like and subscribe leave any comments down below put the notification buttons on to know when the new content is coming and i hope you guys have a wonderful wonderful day bye for now you
