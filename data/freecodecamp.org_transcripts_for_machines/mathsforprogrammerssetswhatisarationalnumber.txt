in this video i'll be introducing the rational numbers and set builder notation the rational numbers are defined as a ratio of two integers and examples include the integers themselves terminating decimals and repeating decimals so let's start with repeating decimals if we let 10x equal 9.999 repeating then if we divide by both sides by 10 then x equals 0.999 repeating and if we subtract x from 10x we have nine x equals nine and then divide both sides by nine we have x equals one and then if we multiply by ten both sides by ten we have ten x equals ten so now we have ten x equals ten but ten x also equals 9.99 and repeating so we have now and these are in fact true 9.99 repeating equals 10. so we've we can now express 10x as an integer which is a a rational number we can put 10 divided by 1 which is a ratio so another problem we have is terminating decimals if we have 2.78 equal to y then we can just easily say 278 divided by 100 equals y as well these are two integers and it's a it's another rational number so a convenient way to define these or is denoted with a q and this is called set builder notation we have the q equals the set containing elements a divided by b such that a and b are elements of the integers with the only condition that b cannot equal zero if you divide by zero uh it's it's undefined it doesn't mean anything so if you're interested in that i recommend googling it i think it's interesting
