in JavaScript you can convert a string to a number very easily let's see five options first number you pass a string as an argument and you get a number with parse in you can also specify the base of the numeral system of the string for example two would be binary math of floor is another option but it returns an integer the original number rounded down to the nearest integer math. seal is equivalent but it rounds up to the nearest integer and let's see if you knew about this option if you write the unary plus operator before the string you can convert that string to a number of course for all of these options the string must represent a number otherwise you will get n a n which means not a number
