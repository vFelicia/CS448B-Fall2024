In this course Nishant Singh will teach you how to integrate GPT. Three from open AI with the React application, you'll basically be creating a website with similar functionality to check GPT Nishan has created many popular video and text based tutorials. Hey, guys, welcome to Free Code Camp. I am Nishan. And I am your host for today. And in this video, we will basically learn how to integrate open API with React, we will create two applications. And this one is the first one. In this application, we will use Open API and react to generate images using AI. For example, if we type something like this, and click generate an image, it will give us this image using AI. So let's wait for it. We can see this loader. And we have this image, which is loading. It's the editor using AI. This one was the first application. Now the second one is called Jeopardy clone. So you have matched heard of Chad deputy and what it does. So it's a tool, a very powerful tool that can explain us some code, or gave us some code if we type it the prompt. Or you can give some question answers if we read the question. But we don't have option to integrate chargeability into our JavaScript or reactor. But I have used some model from Open API to create this application, which can give us some question answers based on the knowledge or the clinical piece of code, or all of this stuff. So let's create this as well. So here I have a React app with beat that I created just now. So let me clear the code a little bit. In Abdo JSX, I went from this, remove all this junk, removed class name, let me remove this state of count. And this literally, we used it because we knew it later. Also, from the CSS, let me remove the black color. Okay, leave the black color, we will work on this. So let me explore this service first open API service. We have documentation overview examples that you can explore. Let's first login or depend sign up if you want. So it will ask for the email address to create an account and all. So you can sign up. So let me just go back to open a website. Let me Okay, this one in my generation. Let me go to login. And let me log in with my email account. Click Continue. So in the process of logging in or registering, it will ask you, why do you want to use this API service. So you can choose that I want to create my own app, only then you will get access. And that's how I got access to this open AI beta. We have text completion, code generation completion, whatever image generation finding, so I don't know the rest of things will use image generation service here. All right. So let me explore this, how to call this. So we can click this clip documentation. Then let's click libraries. Here we can install this in Norges. So basically, we have to install it using this command npm. Install OpenAI. Let's install. Wait a second. We don't need this dollar. Okay. Let me move. Now it will install and will be listed in package dot JSON file. See this open a fine. Let's also okay do nothing. Close it. Now we have to import these things here. Configuration and open AI. So let's say this is a module like es six module. So we have to use import. So we can say import. This just do from open AI. Inside we can have configuration, comma, open AI, open a OPA like this. So we have two things imported here. Now we need to initialize a configuration variable called this configuration where it will take our API key. So you can add your API key. So let me add my API key. Create an API key from here API reference. Not from here, let's say click this personal icon, View API keys. Then, just copy and API key from here, let me delete this revoke key or just okay, we can recover. So just revoke the key, create a new secret key, we can just copy it and let him paste it in env file. So in the source, we can create just this dot e NV in the env file, we have to use VT, and the key name. And this en, we should be outside the source folder. Before this, we had it inside the src folder, move it outside, and then simply start the server, you will get the key here of the week. And I think we don't need this backticks or template literals. So we can also remove this. Okay, now it's fine. We don't need to restart. Okay. So it is here. So let me just copy and replace this with this key. Now, let's see what we have here next. In the Okay, so let me go back to this image generation. Okay, we have this configuration, we will not here we went there. So let's see libraries. Okay, so we have imported this in React this configuration with the API key. Now we have to use this. So we have to initialize one more variable called Open AI. And this will contain this open a configured a open AI that we imported from open AI. And it takes a configuration that we created here with the API key. Basically, we're initializing our API, open API, open API API. It's hard to pronounce open API API. Fine. Now we have this response. So let's add this response here. So for this to work, we need to create a sync function. So let's create it so const, let's say Get Image or let's say, gin, rate image. I think the spelling of generate is correct. Let him better look this on Google. I think it's correct. Yes, it's correct. Generate, okay. So you have to use your own API key, don't use my API key. So in the generate a met image function, make it a sync function, and just paste this thing, await open AI, dot create completion. But it's wrong. This is for something else, it's for. Like, I think it's for completing some text that we showed you in the beginning. So instead, we will use open AI, dot create image, create image this, and it will take not the model, but that prompt. And this things like n, which is number of images that we need to generate, and the size of the image, like the resolution that we have this, if we call this function, it will return something. So let's say so in this response, okay, in this note response, okay, we need to just get the data and the response. So we can say const, Ras or response, then we can simply console dot log, this RAs, and all of these items will just let me copy this and paste it here are es dot data dot data, the root index dot URL, I'm in the first URL for this because we're generating only one image. So now let's call the function. But before that, okay, let me just create a button here. button and say generate an image. On this button. Let's assign this function to against on click Generate image, we have this button that will be helpful to or help us to generate image. So let's also do one thing, okay, let's not do that. Okay, so create or generate an image. Something is wrong Open Network tab. It's pending. It will take some time like 10 seconds. Now, if you open the console, we will have this link here in the console. So if you open this link, it will open up in a new tab. And you will see the image that related to this prompt, say this is a test. And this so it scrambled. So instead of this Okay, one more thing when regenerate the image, and then open managed account in your daily API. It's number and you will see that my usage is this. So we get a $10 credit to use the API for free, then we have some charges. So if you see this daily API usage 7pm, okay. So we have basically some usage here that we can track. If it is, like it is, if it has expired, you have to use or have to pay using our account. So fine. So we have done this. So now let's create a state here. And what the state will do is, we have to get the prompt from the input. For that let's create a state called const. Oh, prom and that from B, O MBT. I must be here, prompt and set prompt. So use state. Let's say this is a string, because yes, it's string. Now, let me create one input. So we can say input. Here. We will have input but we need to arrange them to div class name, let's say app. Main. Now go over to let me close the env file. Come over to advert CSS, we will write the stylings here, we can remove all of these, click add this, okay, some thing is here that we need to leave I think this class name, yes, fine little classmate. Now let's say we have admin here, copy the class, come here over here and say, Lex, our display of flex, then flex direction column. Now we'll have this input and button. Now let's tile input. So we can say class name. Let's say app input cookie. Now in this let's say app input, let's say height 40 px, but it's too much let's try 30 or 30 is fine. If we type 2020 is also fine. We can type anything in here. Fine. Now let's give it some margin around them or around it the country pixels. Now we have this also let's add width of 200 pixels to make it big. Like this we can type in here. Let me zoom this and yes, this is perfect. Perfect. Let's give it an h1 here. Or Yes h1 Here. Jen rate image using have been a I APA I think I'm pronouncing this correct now. Yes sir. It's too big but bit to make it an h3 not h1 to decrease in size. We can now design is broken or we can say the server content okay this will not work because you know my previous video was all about this. Now it will look p p o okay. Okay, okay. Okay. Now, what we got to do is let me zoom this Okay, we have this text. So, let me set the prom from this input. So we can see on change wanna change we can generate an event and then call this function that prompt and store this event dot target value inside this state using this function not validation message value. Now this state which is from should have this so we can replace this or we can add this as well and this as well as the input field or you can do that fine and generate your image. Now if you type something and click Generate image, this will throw us a link here. The terminal, our console. Yes console. So okay, let me also add a placeholder, that placeholder that says, in turn, or type something to generate generate an image. Okay, two dots. I think we have to make the size a little bit bigger, some big 400. Too much 300. Let's see, 300 is fine. Okay. Now, we have a place to assess prompt state in order work. So let's think of something, let's say, a man on a beach. Now click generate an image, it will take some time. So let's wait for this. Don't worry, I will add a loader or a text. So we have this image now click this link. And we will have a mage, a man on a beach like this. It's wonderful, isn't it? I think it is. It is wonderful. And so I think the usage of per API call or per request is 0.0. dollars. So we have $18. That's, I think, sufficient for testing this otherwise, if you can pay then you can pay. So now what we have to do is let's create an image tag here. IMG tag, images, source something. Let's add something, save this. But since we don't have the worth of this, we will not see it here. So what we can do is create one more state. So let's say const. It is right and set it is because to use date, employees train because image will be a link in text. So we can set it here, not in so in the console dot log. So if you open that URL or just mark the SRCS link, as a result, it will be here when we type and generate the image. So it will you will see that the result is this so we can just use knowledge, what is it called Inside the curly bracket? It is called Knowledge coalescing, I think it's interesting. Or what we can do is we can say if result, dot length is more than zero, only then show this else show an empty fragment, we can add it here. So then we don't need this. Now save. Let's give it a try. So let's add something else. A man in a hole cannot this time not a mountain or a beach wall cannot click Generate image. Let's wait for it to generate. Okay, we don't need the console. And we'll get this messy image that we can make smaller. We can say class name, result image. Just cover this class and add it here. And we can say with 400 pixels. That will be fine or 300. Okay, 300 is fine. Some top margin the margin top 20 pixels. Fine. So we have this image to spin. That's all I think I can make it 350 That's fine. Fine. Fine. If you click it again, this will generate a new image. So let's wait for it some time. And you will see now oh let's spend things or just say Mona Lisa. Let's try this it will take some time and it looks ugly. I mean this technique, this thing or whatever it is. Look Sorry. So now let's type something really different. I think let's say, Let me think. Let's say a bird riding. Okay, not this, let's say a horse riding a Dyna dyno. Thor. Now let's see what we get this in this respect. So basically, this service open API generates image using AI. So whatever we type, okay, this is not a horse. It's a man, let's say a camel riding. Yes. So basically, it uses AI to mix images according to the prompt. So that's what it is. And I think it's a camel riding a dinosaur, but it's not a camel, it's still a human being. But that's fine. All right. So that's how we create a service, or app and react that can generate image using this new dolly API from open AI API service to generate image. For the second application, we will use chargeability. In our React application, we will use open a model to do that, because we don't have any current integrations from chat API to in our React core Javascript app. So let's do that. But first, let's see a glimpse of what it can do. So we can give it a prompt like this explain quantum computing in simple terms, if you click this, Send button, or enter, this will trigger and it will start this answer. Which is this, we can stop, I don't think we can stop. So we can create different types of conversation. For example, when this is ends, when this ends, we will have this named as quantum computing, like this symbol coordinating, we can create a new chat. And here we can say, what are how do I make a JavaScript request using HTTP, or even fetch API? Now click this button, it will give you this answer. Like this, we can have several methods to do all of these you can read this, it will also give you the code here, which is this. Fine. So if it ends, again, this will be named as the prompt, how do I make an HTTP request in JavaScript? So it will give you all the answers that you need. So it's a powerful app, see if it is now getting renamed. So we're gonna delete this chat. Yes. And then we can get a question answered as well, like, got any creative ideas for 10 year olds birthday? If we click enter, this will give us the answer. It can solve any problems or make a list for gifts and do all the stuff that you want it to do. Fine. Yes, very good tool. I don't have to say more. In this setup, I have a React app with nothing. So it's all empty. But we have a commented console log here. So if we understand this, we will see the open API API key here. So let me show you. Let me bring it down here. Okay, now see, this is the API key that we have in the console. So let me just comment it out. Fine. So to get this key, you have to create a env file here. And we have to add this string, wait open API key and this API key from open AI. Sorry, open API. To get the API key, simply go to open api.com/api. If you don't have any account here, sign up, or else just login, select me login and show you the API key the source so you have to enter the email and this check. So we need all the cards. So verify. Continue. Then let me enter the password and continue. So we will see this page. Now to get the key just go to this. This this this personal and View API keys. Here you have these keys. When create a key and get started to click the or to see the usage, you can simply go to Manage Account. Here you will see the usage. So I have used 0.6 $7 of mine account from a account, the total amount, I have a certain knowledge, which is free, fine. And it expires on March word of the next year. So that out of the way, now, let me go to the homepage. So, we need to create an AI app in React, similar to what we have in charge of eight. So let me open chargeability. So, we cannot use this in our reactor for now or in JavaScript app because we don't have the capability to integrate it. It's just something exemplary, or we can say it is. What is it? What is the word? It is for? Review usage? Yes. So, if we click the examples, we will see all of these categories like q&a, grammar collections, so we can use all of these into our React app. So let me show how to do that. So first, let me create a component here are first a folder called components. In this folder, let's create two files. First will be option. Election, dot j s x. And second component will be let's say, let's say what can we call it? So let's say what can we call the component, let's say translation. Because here, we will translate the component so JSX, like this, I know we have two components here. Let me close this. So now what we have to do in this oxygen election, we have to create all of these options like this, we see. So make a functional component here. And simply call or render component inside app dot JSX into our main component, like this. Now if you see the app, we will see this text here. So let me remove this. Just let me remove this div and make a fragment from react. inside. Let's make a word tag for the heading, which says react AI app. in bold letters. If you want to get some fonts, just head over to bonds.google.com and get some fonts from here. Just paste this inside your CSS. So let me just remove all let me select Poppins because it's my favorite font. So we can select regular 400, italic, in bold font, medium 500. And that's all so just copy all this using clicking this icon here. This I can celebrate families. And just just do what just copy this input and paste this inside the app dot css at the top. So we can remove all of these because we don't need all of these points. So remove. And to get the text from h1 are in this font, we can add a class name and say heading. Inside this we can say heading and font family Poppins. If and this will be now in Poppins font, just like that. Fine. Now we need to create all these menus menu items like small tabs. So it's better to create one array, some mock data so we can say let's create a folder called grid or let's say AI options. In this, we can say index dot j s x sorry, not JSX let's say JSON. Or what should we call it? Let's say JSX fine JavaScript file and then say const array items, which will contain all of these items in an array object. So we can say name. This will be q, and a. So I will not use all of these items, I will just use a few of them, like q&a grammar collection, text to command and all. So we can say name, then let's say ID, ID will be, let's say, Q. Question and a like this fine. Let's say some description. Description In here, we will say answer. Questions based on existing, exist in knowledge point. So just like that, we can create a lot of these as much as you can want, or do you want. So I read a bunch of these into the React app from this list. You can add more if you want, but I have already or I have just added 12345677 pieces. So let's get the items into our app projects expert. First, we have to export this array items. Now we can simply do import array items from a options from that file. Okay, now we can simply console log to check what we are getting in the console. So you will see we are getting seven items in the array. Now we can traverse through each item. So let's just add the items inside. Or just pass it as props into option selection. Because here, we will select the option. Right. Now, let me just map all these items. So we can say we need to create a grid so we can set Dave first. Inside, let's map it. So our items dot map, let's see item. So we can say return an empty fragment. In this, we can simply have an h3, which will be the title of that particular item. So we can say item, dot let's see what is the key name they have added. The key name is called name, item dot name. And second will be will be p tag item dot description we will get all these items. According to the array. No, all we have to do is to make them in a grid. So we can say div class name, let's say grid main. So we can just copy this and add it here. Grid main display off grid. Then we can say grid template columns auto and auto to make them two in a row. But something is wrong here. Let me open that index dot CSS. And I have to remove something from here, I think. So let me remove all of these except this one. But why it is failing? So I guess we have to add a div here. Yes, now it's working. If I removed him, it will not be proper. But if I add a div, it will be properly rendered. So we are editing this file. Now in this wave, give us a demo class name of let's say grid child because it's a child like every item is the child air pods grid of the can sixth grade child, let's say let's add a border or what we have here is nothing. So what can we do? Let's make this an h4 to make it a little bit smaller, fine. So we can say great child in this let's say great child h4. Let's add font family Poppins and font weight 600 Fine. What if we add 700 We need to make them bold but it's fine. Now in great child b tag we need to add Poppins but we need to decrease the font size so we can say font size. Let's say you've been pixels let's remove this and make 500 What's not getting refreshed? What why? Let's add 12 Yes, now it's working. So basically, let's make this an h3 and revert this back to h3 to make the text bigger. Fine. I think that's fine. looking fine. Now let's add a border. So great child. Border one pixels, solid, white smooth color like this. We can also add a gap between all the items to say gap 10 pixels, or 15 will be fine as well. Now we need to make these what is the we need to make the border curved around it? So we can say border radius 15 pixels as well. Now they're curved current. What if we make this two pixels? Yes, now it looks fine. So also, we can add some padding to sing the items like this. Now it looks much better. We have reacted if title. And this also late set margin top 20 pixels to shift them in the top at 20, but margin top 20 Let's set 3040. Now it's fine. Yes, it's working fine. Now what we need to do is or let's do something like this. So if you hover the titles or this card, we should see a highlight options. So we can say first cursor pointer. Now if you hover them will see this pointer cursor here. Now in the grid child, we can say dot grid child hover over in this we can say background color as white smoke and color s 212121. You save and if you Now hover the items will see this kind of thing. Which is I think great. By but something should be checked here. So in ebook CSS, we are having all of these items, max width margin text align center index dot css, okay, this is the problem and we have to remove font size from here. Okay, nothing happened. Okay, leave it fine. So we are saying this ugly looking items. Now what needs to happen is in this example, so let's say you open the first one called q&a. So we have a response lists, we have this like we have this response, which has model prompt temperature and all. So we have to make them default for each item. So to do that, we need to create a function. Or we can do this as well. So in this app in this area of objects, we can add the model using an object so we can say option, let's add option, and this will be an object. So for this q&a, we have to copy all of these and paste it here and save. But the problem is it will not look like that. So I guess we have to do it from here. We have to send it from here directly. So we can say let me remove this console log. And then we can say can or const select option we have our arrow function which will take option value. I mean option Behram we can pass let me Okay, nothing there, it's fine. We have to pass this function as props to this Component Options election. So let's get it here. Fine. Now if you click this child, we should trigger this. So we can on click the Select option but I guess I have to add the items as options here. Only then it will work. So let's add this just remove the prompt because this will be dynamic except the rest. So let me add this for now. So what will happen is if we click this select option function is the one click should send this item dot this key option. So let's do that item dot option. Now, in here in the amber JSX, we can simply console dot log this option like this. Now let's see what happened. If you click q&a at the top, we are reading all of these. But we still need one text area, or input field for these items. So let me show you what I mean. So click this click open playground. We need something like this a text area. Okay, like this, we need my, so what can we do so in this other component, translation, or JSX, let's create it, the RFC. Let's save this. And let's import translation from this component and just render it out here. Translation. And we will see it here if you close the console, but we need to see the translation only when we have selected the option. So let's create one state here. So let's say const. Let's say option and set option equals to use state use state. And it will be an object. So we can set it here like this. When we click or trigger the function to a free console, in the console, this option initially, we should get nothing I think, so let's see. See, we are getting this object and it's empty. So to check if it is empty, we have to convert this into an array. So we can say wrap this inside when parentheses is the object dot values. And it will convert it in an array of values from this. And we can say Slynt. If you refresh, it will select the zero it means the error is empty, or we have nothing inside this object. If you clear it, and look again, it will be seven. Because we will have seven items inside the array to check we can simply do this. See, we will have seven items. So we need to show this translation component only when we have something inside this object. So we can say wrap this inside a curly bracket to make it conditional. So we can say object dot values dot option, I mean objective values option length. If it is zero, we need to show this component. Else we need to show translation. Wait, if it is zero, go to refresh. If a click Quick q&a, we will see this component now translation. So inside this let's add a text area text area of HTML, we have this. So we can style this subject class name, text area. We can also specify the row and columns. So we can say columns, let's say pour into was small, let's say 40. Now that's fine, we can increase it make it a T by this looks fine. And let's also add some lows to increase the height. So let's say 40 as well. If it is too much, let's set a t okay 2020 is fine. We're gonna type it inside it. So in the text area, we have to change the font size. So to make the font bigger so we can say text area. Font Size, let's say 20 pixels. Now we have this and it looks fine. So if you're making this font size 30 So we have to decrease the column so let's say 60 or 30. That is small, let's say 40 What the What about 5050 is fine motherboard 60 extends too much is going out of the screen. 50 is fine also make this as 10. Now this looks fine, correct? Fine. Also, we can add a little padding here. We can say padding 10 pixels. Now we have this cool looking text idea. Let's add the font size for the font family as Poppins. To get the font in Poppins. We can also make this 55. Yes, no, looks fine, fine. So this is done. Now we need a button to translate. So let's add it. Like to trigger the function so we can save button and say, do your tough now save, let's style our buttons knows the class name, let's say action button. Action BTN. In the CSS style, this we can say with 200 pixels, height 50 pixels and font size 20 pixels. Fine, left side margin top 20 pixels. And that's all also cursor as pointer. Now we have this and this. Now the options are here. Now if you click or refresh the page, you will see this page, click this we will see this thing if you refresh, or let me do one more thing as well. So in this translation, let's also add one more button to reset all of this. So we can say button, reset, reset, reset, reset add the class name here. But I guess we don't need that for now. So let's leave it removed about 10 minutes refresh the page by if you do your stuff, this should trigger a function correct. So let's say console party const do tough and in this function let's do something later. So just first pass it inside this translation component as props receive it here and make onchange so the unclick this function also create one more state for the input. So we can say const input and set input. So you will state and string pass this will hear in translation component receive it or destructor it then on this input of text area we can on change you can say it will take up param called E or event and we can say or we can just store event dot target dot value inside this input. If I type something and check this state called input, let's see what we are getting open the console and type something and we're getting it here. So let's say we type hello we will get Hello here like this. Now, we are passing let me open this we are passing all the options here in this function called option. So this is an object. So we can append this option like all of these options with this text ad I input to make the full set of this to make a full set of this using prompt. So you can simply destructure this. So we can take we can see options comma, let's say prompt and prompt will be this input file. So if you're not console log the option let's see what we are getting. So open the console like this options are here. But the prompt is empty. See if you type something like Nishan here, you will see from the still empty Okay wait. So we need to set this in options. Okay, let's do this. Let's console dot log this inside this to stuff. Now if you click those stuff, it will say this and prompt is still empty. So I made a mistake. So what we need to do is we need to set the options from this error object when we click the card. Now, if you console dot log this, let's see what we're getting. There considering the options, so click this, and we'll get all this. But we don't have prompt here. So when we need to, we need to use the prompt or set it in this do stuff function. So we can do it like this. Now, if you type something in the this text box, you will see this prompt here. Now click the button, do stuff. And we will see the prompt this. So let me start again. Initially, this will be empty object. See, if you click this card q&a, we will get all of the items but not the prompt. Now click Nishant or admission here, you will see nothing. But if you click the Do stuff button, we will see the prompt here as Nishan. So we are now having the full set of the items. Now all we need to do is translate this here. So let me copy all of these items. So copy this configuration and open it. Okay, I need to install it as well. Because I did install it. So we can say go to this tutorial. How to install this in production. Quick Start tutorial. No, let's say examples playground API reference overview. Let me figure out how to install this because I have forgotten. So to install list, simply open terminal and add this. So NPM, I open AI, enter, and it will install the open AI into our project. That's all check the package JSON to see if it has had been installed or not see, fine, was in 3.1 Point zero. So close the terminal. Now we need to go back to this quickstart tutorial. We not this try examples. Yes, try q&a. And now we need all of these items from open AI. So we can import this. So we can say let's import them at the top. Or we can say import something from open AI. And inside we can add configuration and open API. Then we need to create the instance for this configuration just like it says here. So let's create it here. And this will take the API key. So we can simply cut the page from here and paste it. The next step is to create instance of this open API using the API key and this configuration so added here. That's done. And now we need to do is this so in this function we need to do all of the items so we don't need to set options here, we can simply create one object so let's select object equals to these items, so cut this and paste the move the state and if you know console, this options are option let's see the result. No not options are the object. Now let's check this click this nothing will happen. Add some text like hello. No enter or press this button. It will see these items. So prompt is hello and all the items that we are getting perfect. Fine. So in this function, we have to add the response. And we have to make the function as async like this for Asynchronous JavaScript. Now, we need to pass the object here, not this items. So we can remove this object parenthesis and simply say object. Now if you console dot log, this response let's see what we get. So just say Theologie. Response, I think it will work now. So let's start from the beginning. Let's copy some question. Let's say this. Let's paste it and see what we will get like this, paste this question and say do your stuff. So it will take some time. So now we are getting it. Yeah, so now we are getting it, if you open data, we will see the choices. In the choices, we will have the text. So let me just do response dot data dot choices zeroeth index dot txt. Now we will get the entire text only, not some other thing. So try again, and we will get this. Now let's create one state called result. So we can say const. result and set result equals to US state empty string. Now we have to store this response inside the state and pass this as props. Now we have to get the props in the toggle General J six and add the text after this text area. This so let's do that. So I have added this result dot length, if it is less than zero or more than zero, we will see result LLC nothing or empty string. I have also added the model temperature and all all options in other objects as well like grammar correction, like this. Now all we need to do is just try this. So refresh the page. Let's try grammar correction, which is after q&a, which converts the wrong English to Standard English. So let's try this. Do your stuff. And we will get this correct answer. So let's try something else. My name a nation note is we have typed a no click Do your stuff. They will see the both texts here. She didn't go to the market. My name is Nishan. If we add one, space or enter, let's see what we get. Really good. Same thing. It will not be separated by spaces. But I think we have to do this one space. I think that's how we get space here. No, it's backslash dot forward slash do your stuff. Okay, it's not working fine. Doesn't matter. So that's how it works. If you add one only it will give you one. Now let's try other ones like what is this? Java school JavaScript to Python code translator. So open this JavaScript to Python. Let's copy this code and add it here. Now click Do your stuff. Let's see the output here. So we will get the Python code. But without indentation, that's fine. Because I have not added internet indentation here. So we have an array called docks. And we're pushing all the docks for each into this car array docs into car ready. So in the Python, we can simply do append Auto, and this is how it works. Fine. So I think this is done. So we can say translation of English to other languages. So let's try this one at last. All right, where does it? Let's see. Let me search for this. English to other languages. Okay, this is there. So let's see this. translate this into French, Spanish and Japanese. So this text will be translated into three items to your stuff. There we'll see this one is I think French. This one is Spanish and third one is Japanese. So it is working. So that's how we create. Now you can also create one react, AI f this that does all of these things dynamically. It can explain code or convert the code to Python from JavaScript, or summarize for second grader and give her some answers. So again, go ahead and create this.
