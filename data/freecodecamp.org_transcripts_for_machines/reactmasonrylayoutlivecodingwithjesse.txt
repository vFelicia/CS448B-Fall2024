hey everybody its Jessie not today we're going to try to do a masonry layout with this section sorry wrong phase with this section so these are all resources they're going to have images and there are already different heights and I just did this kind of ugly workarounds to keep them all the same height what I what I was going to do as kind of a bandaid on this until I got the masonry layout set up was just truncate these but I think I'm just going to go ahead and do the the masonry layout now and what that's going to do is allow allow me to use different height cards and not have to worry about the different heights and they'll automatically line up either the right way I know that you can do this kind of with a width flexbox the problem is the order of the cards is weird when you do it with flexbox so the cards will go like let's say if the list was one it would be one two three four five six seven eight nine where normally you would expect it to go right to left and then down so any type of sorting will get will get kind of messed up if I do it like that so what I need to do is use JavaScript to position all of these so I found in the past I've used masonry so I've used this library and it works well but I have had I've had two issues with it that I always have to try to work with one if you have images you have to add another another library called image is loaded to figure out when the images are actually loaded and then positional because otherwise if it tries to calculate the size of all those divs of all those little cards beforehand before the images are loaded they're going to like stack on top of each other because the initial size of them is not corrected too small the other issue of that is when I've done sites with reacted in particular with next in the past when I've tried to do clientside routing I've had issues with with things not working so it's possible that I was setting it up wrong but today I think I'm going to go with something else so instead of me trying to take into account those factors I'm going to use this library I think this was the one yeah so it's react masonry component so this is using it seen from the documentation it seems like this is using masonry anyway so it's still the same library so we'll still get the same effect but it's already taking into account some of those other things and it's already you know built in react so the thing that's going to be weird for me at least is this is different than just like your basic setup to use masonry to use that package so it's it's kind of a layer on top of that so I'm not really familiar with with some of these options so it'll kind of take a little a little messing around with I think to get this to work right but it looks pretty pretty straightforward we'll see if we get it to do what we want and I like that this is you know react style you know we did some some kind of odd stuff for react to get our jQuery things working so I don't want to have to do the same workarounds to get masonry working I'd rather do it like this you know in a in a style that's more in line with what we should be doing in react okay hey everybody I could see some people were saying hi in the live chat Cory s would love to be added to Jesse Trello you mean like like the Trello board that I have here how much sir can you can you add people I mean I don't have a problem making these trill Awards public at least most of them that I have there's nothing like they can't be public I just want to make sure nobody can just come in and mess with the board so if there's a way to just make them publicly visible I don't really have a problem linking to that lemon says please use es6 yeah actually I am using some things from ESX so you'll see as we go through I don't know for sure that I'll be using a lot of es6 stuff and today but I have before and I certainly will in the future so for sure I often use template literals obviously I use let and Const instead of they're using some arrow functions so some basic stuff you know not really you know you know complex things but definitely we'll use some some es6 features also I need to keep this a little bit shorter than normal so I've actually set an alarm for 3 o'clock so if you hear an alarm going off at 300 that's because I need to make sure I get to the store pick up my son and take him this karate lesson so I have to get out of here I haven't been able to take him for a few weeks because I've been working a lot extra so today today I need to take them my wife's not feeling well so I really don't want to have to call her later and say can you take him please so and today this this is at the first code that I'm actually writing today because the day has been filled so far with so much paperwork that I've put off for the last few weeks so so let's get started I'm going to I'm going to move this let me let me show you at least if you're not familiar with the masonry layout I'll show you a demo of this so this demo is linked from from this repo and basically you can see the effect we're going for is that these cards are all a different height but everything lines up and I'm sure you've seen this before I mean it's this is kind of everywhere now but it's nice everything spaced out you know kind of properly as you would expect right now if I put cards of different height I would get weird spaces on even spaces everywhere just with with the the styles that I have applied currently so this is what it should end up looking like you know everything should and actually we should we should be able to see this change okay you see how that kind of just really fluidly resizes and moves okay so that's the kind of thing that we want this one actually even kind of sorts kind of resource everything so we're going to have some of that because we have those tabs already but that's what we want and let's let's get started I'm going to move this to my other screen and I'm going to pull in my my terminal and actually let's let's move this whole thing to the screen I don't need it right now um for my terminal and we'll install this package and we'll test it out first what I want to do so if you'll notice if you watch yesterday you know I forgot to get Poole and then we had to do a merge and I messed it up and it was it was embarrassing so today I made sure that I just did a get Poole right before we started so we're up to date I mean I knew for sure this time that I hadn't added anything in that I needed to pull but I just wanted to check it out let me check I'm going to check the live chat just for a second and then I'm going to ignore it for a little bit while we're setting this up so Jay says you can make the Charlie Board public so people can view it but they can't edit okay awesome so I'll try to set that up then like I said today I need to get out of here like very quickly after the stream ends so I'm not sure if I'll get to set up today but I'll make sure I write it down or making it somewhere to do that and then I'll link to it in the description mahomes asks why use a jpeg instead of PNG um usually JPEGs uh I can get to a smaller file size so that's why I use JPEG if I need transparency then I usually go with PNG but otherwise I go with jpg they always seem to be smaller I'm not like really an expert on different file types I just know kind of basically what you want for performance on a on a website okay uh recce I'm sorry if I'm mispronouncing your name right keyless on says guys what about you jazz I don't know that much about UJS I'm interested in it but for now I mean this site stood built with react so we're definitely going to work with react to this one but I'm interested in learning more about you okay alright so I'm going to ignore a lot of chat for a little bit if you write in the live chat oh I'll take a look at it at the end and if you can't stick around till the end for me to answer you then put it in the comments for this video or just direct message me on Twitter and I will get back to you Oh awesome Hamza actually I remember you uh I mispronounced your name a few episodes ago makes call me out if I do it again it's Hamza right yeah Hector my code is and github so there should be a link in the description to the code for this and a link to the to the live site alright so since this is going to be kind of a big change and I'm not even sure if I can get it complete today this might end up being a twopart thing because since I kind of have to cut this actually I mean originally I was one halfhour videos but they've been kind of getting closer to an hour every time I'm not sure I can finish this so maybe we'll finish it tomorrow so I'm going to do a branch so if you're not if you haven't used yet that much you haven't used branches you can make a branch and get and then it won't affect your master branch you can do whatever you want and totally mess mess up your you know your app or your site and then just switch back to the master branch and everything will be back to normal again so branching is at least for me since I work by myself primarily what I use branching for is if I have something that like I know it's going to take a while to implement it and I'll need to switch back and make some minor changes on master that's a good good way to keep those separate so I can you know keep updating the the main site and not worry about having this halfway finished code in there also if I just have always want to mess around with a new idea and I know it's going to be a major change and it's going to be hard to like come back from then I just do you know do another branch and sometimes I never really finish it but it's not really a big deal to have you as many branches as you want if if you're working with a team then branches are also good like you know I've seen people they have like their their master branch is like stable then they have you know their development branch which you know you has like a newer version of things and all the work gets done primarily on the development branch and then you know it gets merged in the master so there's different ways you can use branches with but but for me I just you know they're just kind of for experiments or you know large changes alright so we're going to make it we're just going to type git branch and we'll just give it a name so I'm gonna name this masonry that means because that's what we're going to do that way I'll know what's going on and then I can I can do I think this will actually list them for me there we go so if I type get branch with with nothing at the end then it doesn't create a branch it just lists them so I can see have two branches I've master in the masonry so to switch to the masonry branch I'm going to go get check out masonry okay and now I'm in a Mason regressor if you see here this this in the in the green tells me what branch someone so it was on master now it's on masonry so now anything I change in this branch won't mess up master so if I get a message in the middle of this video from my boss and he says hey there's an emergency you know you got a there's just some things messed up on the site you can change it I could with one command switch back to master make the change or a quick push it and then switch right back to masonry and I don't have to worry about that the site is like halfway broken because I'm adding stuff to it so super useful I'm sure other systems like version control systems aside yet have similar features I don't really know I've only used get alright so now that we're on here I'm going to install that react masonry component so remember we're using yarn on our local development environment instead of just playing NPM I encourage you to check out yarn it's a I've it's definitely faster at least from my experience it's it's faster to install things than NPM is and the commands are a little bit shorter so we're going to go yarn add and we're going to react masonry component okay I'm just doublechecking make sure I spelled that right here we go I just had the idea here not that I would ever do this but if somebody was really being like a not nice person they could probably make NPM packages that were terrible that were just slightly misspelled versions of popular packages I don't know me that's a terrible idea but people may accidentally download them so I don't know has anybody ever seen that happen I okay so we've added this and let's get and see how to how to require so we want I'm looking now back on these the documentation for this and here's what we want we want to use the es6 style modules because that's what we're we're already using so we're just going to need to import this and let's add this in let's see where we need to add this uh so our our cards themselves are a separate component it's separate from the page that they're on so let me think for a second where we need to add this we need to add this on I'm not sure if we need to add this on the component I think it I think it's supposed to be on the component so like I haven't I feel like I say this all the time but I haven't thoroughly read through this documentation so so I'm kind of just going through this and learning as I go which is pretty much what we do right I mean I mean most of the most of the job is learning new things and implementing them all right where's my card here is it the text card not a resource card obviously okay so here's our our card that we're working with as it is now and we're probably going to change this a lot it seems like from the documentation so first thing we're going to do is copy that and okay so we're importing masonry from react nation you component and now we're going to put in some some of this markup so let me I'm going to show you this but I'm going to keep it on the other screen just so we have more room to see the code that I'm working on so if you want to check this out and kind of follow along um check it out on get up if you type in react masonry component just on a Google search this will come up so you can check that out and follow along if you need to I just rather not split the screen up I think it'd be better to just make this code bigger and more readable for you all and I don't need this side so I'm going to make it smaller so we can see more okay so some of the stuff we definitely want to keep so we want to keep you know the general look of these cards that we already have which I think I shown at the beginning but I'll show again just quickly for for everyone that's tuned in a little bit later so this is what we're working on these are the these are the cards as they are now so we definitely want to keep this and for right now I'm not going to add in the images maybe tomorrow add in the images but I know I'm not going to tell the mess with them now but we will need to test it with images since they will have images sometime in the near future but we can definitely test it with differing Heights since you know if I hadn't have set a max I these would all be different heights right now and the link to that the live version of this site is in the description okay so let's try to convert this component to this masonry to use this masonry component okay it looks like alright so if you're following along with the react masonry component documentation I'm checking out the custom prop section just to get an idea of you know basic the basic you know kind of how to initialize this it looks like the component name just needs to be masonry and I don't even necessarily have to add any options right now so here's what I'm going to try I'm going to try to wrap this entire thing and it can in an element that's just called Mae scenery and see what happens I think I'm gonna have to put some stuff in here some properties there let's see okay so we've wrapped that in masonry it looks like classname my gallery cut they've given it a class name style and on clickhandler but I don't I don't know that those are required I think that's just you know in there for demonstration so why not just try it see what happens so I'm going to save this and we're going to go back did I move this and it's my other screen we're going to go back to this and see how things look did it refresh I don't know let's see so it didn't it didn't break anything but I'm not sure that it's actually using now it doesn't look any different than it did before so it's possible either that I just set that up completely wrong or and maybe both my styles that I put in there are kind of messing this up so let me see I'm not getting I'm not getting any errors specific to that so let's go in and remove the styles from these that are making them all the same height and that should give us a better idea of you know what's going on back side so let's take out actually this just take out all of this we don't need it and now I'm going to save that and we'll go back and you can see okay so here's what's happening this obviously is not what we want but at least it shows us that whatever we just did with May is not working I'm going to check the live chat quickly I always forget to do this but when I mess something up usually you own a live chat tell me what I did wrong and I don't look at it and it takes me forever to figure it out so I'm going to check it quickly okay so yeah remove in the live chat someone actually let me see by 700 I know you're always watching the videos when I'm not sure how to pronounce the ER your youtube name it looks like by Seba xxxx so is it cool if I say sever for your name let me know anyway they said remove Mac site first which is what I ended up doing so thanks for that alright so let's look I'm going to compare quickly the what we have here compared to what's in the example okay Sebastian awesome in the lodge cut the person I was just talking about that I couldn't pronounce her YouTube name is Sebastian so I like that name Sebastian alright okay so in the in the chat uh let me see bromo Maddox says when we want one instance of masonry that has all of the cards as children instead of every card being a masonry element I'm not sure that's a good idea let me let me take a look again at at this actually you know what would might be useful I wonder if hmm I wonder if that site that had the demo I wonder if there's a repo for that site I just checked the sighting it doesn't look like there's a repo but it's possible that we can inspect it so here's the inspector for that site as possible we can inspect it and go into now it's not it's not bringing up the option to inspect all the components that's weird happens yeah usually I have the option inspector with react but not now so but at least we can check this and see how this ends up coming out it so okay they do have this looks like the yeah this is the overall container that they're using and they have classes on it just like we have some we have some columns okay this by this this looks like it actually is giving some good information I'll explain what I'm saying here there column classes are actually on the cards themselves and our cards are within a column so our columns are separate divs and there's part so that might make a difference so what we could do is maybe try to make the columns the masonry components or make the masonry component be the wrapper around old columns and not just the the cards themselves yeah so let's try it and you can tell here we have these this absolute position these are definitely the divs that are being positioned absolutely because these you know these are being generated and you'll probably able to see them move like if I see how that all flashed those are definitely being generated from JavaScript okay so let's try that we're going to go we're going to need to go out into so let's remove what's actually we won't need this in here let's remove shoot that was the one that I wanted to just this masonry and we'll remove this down here and we don't need this anymore and our component and now we need we want to go to the actual page that these appear on which is okay I could have kind of liked it if this could have been all in one component but the way I have this set up now it's going to go here I could probably refactor later on maybe and make it all in one component but just for testing it'll be easier to put it in here so we can see I have so I have these right now glowing in each of these rows is actually a tab so if you'll check so I have these different tabs so these will get populated you know when the page loads and then it just switches between which row is visible and which really is invisible so that's why we have these loops for each row so I'm just going to test it on first the first one because there really is not not I need to do it to everything before we're sure that it works so here's our div that I think probably should be the masonry component um either this div or it should be contained in there so I'm actually going to try to just make this masonry at first I'm a little skeptical as to whether this will work but this is kind of the easiest thing to try so let's just try it and we'll save that and check back here all right and obviously I didn't work I'm sure that so you caught that I defer got to import this so let's save it now and see mr. fresh okay so it looks like nothing new it's still doing the same stuff I do want to inspect this and see what it looks like with the react inspector okay so I just want to see kind of what it's doing so we have this masonry component okay so it's changed makes your component here and then there's a masonry container inside of that where it's actually applying the same the same class name so I'm not sure if that's what we want and then the card is is inside of that okay so next thing I'm going to try is just wrapping this and the component I do want to check I want to compare this to how it looks in the other side as well let's see actually this looks this looks pretty much like what the demo site looked like in terms of just you know the markup is that the the outer div had the column classes on it and and look this actually does have this position set up here so so this is doing some of what we want so at least that's that's a good sign right is it maybe not I'm just wondering where this height is coming from because I'm definitely not setting this all right I'm going to check the live chat again to see if anybody has noticed something okay alright so let's try actually I want to see if we have any change at all we do okay all right so check this out did you see that that was like we're getting we're getting changes so we're getting a positionabsolute we're getting changes so this is definitely doing something I'm not sure exactly why we're not getting what we want all right let's see okay so these are I just want to make sure that these columns actually do have a height so they do so that's good maybe there's some styles that I'm applying that I need to stop applying for this to work I mean honestly if it's if things are being applied with with JavaScript you know in line like that it should override anything that I'm doing but you know just to be sure I'd like to hmm I'd like to see what's going on let's compare gonna check quickly all right yeah I'm not getting errors related to that so that's good this is from that demo site I'll shoot no it's not we're going from the demo psycho I'll just inspect it again I must have closed it out so here's the demo side just to give us an idea of what it's supposed to look like okay all right I see here all right so whoever said sorry I can't remember right now you said this but someone in the live chat said a few minutes ago to wrap the entire thing in that masonry component instead of each thing and I think that's probably the the best way to go from looking at this now it seems like what's happening here and this on the demo site this is the overall container for all of the cards and it has the same Styles being added dynamically as each one of our column classes does this relative positioning and then inside that we have our cards being positioned absolutely so that's that's not what we want so what that means is we need to go up another level so that our main container for those cards is what is the masonry component and then below that you know inside of that we have our column component so whoever said that I'm going to scroll up so that I can give credit where it is due let's see alright bro bromo Matic is the one that brought that up like over 10 minutes ago so good call on that and let's let's try this out so what we want to do is go back down to where we added this in Oh mister that we're done for there yeah so we're down here so let's change this back to a do and instead inside this I guess inside the row will work will do another another element Mason reading I'm not going to give it any extra configuration at this point but we probably will once we once we get it working we can mess with the configuration alright let's save that see what we have oh oh that that looks like what we want let's mess around with it alright what do you think it looks like it happened it works Wow um I did not think that we would get it working that quickly so what time is it oh wow so under 40 minutes not bad ok so this is I mean it's working right now for what we want it to do right we have different size cards we don't have that scroll bar that honestly on on a Mac the scroll bar hides automatically it's not a big that big of a deal but on on a PC it like is this big ugly scroll bar so that was not a good good so awesome so that's working so here's what still needs to happen though and we need to test one thing I need to test is if I click around will this still work because with with the clientside routing I'm assuming this will since this is a react component there it's probably assuming that you're going to use clientside routing but we can check that out right now the other thing we want to test our images and making sure that it takes into account the height of the card from when the image is actually loaded and for some reason okay I thought my computer for is but I think my my trackpad is running out of battery so we'll go back to resources this will try let's uh now okay I'm going to restart my dev server quickly since it's hanging let's make sure it starts okay hmm okay that's where your knows really slow but hopefully it works now alright so now we've we've navigated away it looks like it's still working that was actually where did you see that we had this indicator here with spanning two rows I'm going to click out and back in just to doublecheck this go on the the loading is just taking forever it doesn't normally take that long I probably do have maybe I have the network throttle I don't know for testing okay so that works we didn't get whatever that weird thing was so I'm not too worried about that great so that's the the first thing that I was worried about the second thing is the images and I think I'm going to save that either tomorrow or maybe if I have a chance to get it done before tomorrow I move on to something else since you know the bulk of this was you know we implemented so we do have I want to bring bring this back in quickly before you finish where is it I lost it I lost my here it is my documentation anyway so you can see there's definitely other things that we can do with this there's different options for transitions so you know I'll probably mess around with this uh you know we even have you know soon there's a lot of different things that we can do so maybe I'll mess around with it a little bit and see but today I don't have a lot of time so but that worked it wasn't too hard I said really the hardest thing was just figuring out exactly where where to put this the end of these mace this masonry um there so all right so that gives us plenty of time gives me plenty of time to check through the the live chat okay I actually just see one that I'm going to answer right now at the bottom here so yes this does apply the question was this is just applied to the old tab right now yes and yeah that is true we only apply it to the all tab so I am going to have to go in and apply it to the other tabs hopefully that doesn't mess anything up I hadn't thought about that until right now but I was just assuming that you could have multiple instances of this and it would work so that's going to be another thing I hope that does work out if it doesn't and I have to do something else I'll make sure that I mention it tomorrow whether or not we actually do it live tomorrow I'll at least mention if I had to do something different I'll mention what the problem was and how I fixed it all right so I'm going to scroll up a bit to where I last looked at the live chat and I'm going to answer actually should I do let me show you to show you all this interview first it's only about 30 seconds I'll do that first and then then I'll get a lot chat that way if anybody asks any questions they want to get in you can get it in and we'll have maybe like 10 minutes to go through and I can answer some questions so this this video is from Rick Ryan who does he works with operation code he actually works at Akamai the like the CDN company so but he also does this operation code which helps out military veterans get into you know get into coding so I have this up and make this full screen for you all and Lacey short interview but he's going to go through just like the previous interviews if you've seen any of them you know just really quickly talk about some new technologies he's interested in and give some advice to people who are just starting out and learning how to code all right so my name is Rick Bryan I'm a CTO of operation covary nonprofit the kids veterans and their families into programming new technology that I'm excited about is lick sir I really like functional programming and like the paradigm it's fun and sloka challenging my advice to new programmers is go out there and build stuff thank you all right so yeah really short but good advice actually I like that everybody that's my last interview by the way from that I did with people from syntax con but everybody had really great advice and and just to add to this advice in particular just build stuff yeah definitely build stuff I've been in the situation before where I've done a lot of like tutorials and didn't get out of tutorial mode or stayed in tutorial mode for too long my thing where I've done like the online tutorials and I haven't actually built anything there's nothing that I could really put in a portfolio so the tutorials are really good starting out and sometimes even to go back to when you're learning something new but the sooner you actually build something you're gonna you're gonna have something put on your portfolio you're going to feel really accomplished that you built something and you're going to learn a lot of those skills that aren't exactly covered in this tutorial but you're going to need you know if you're if you're doing so you know if you're using like the in browser editor that handles everything for you and you go on to a real job and you have to setup you know your code editor and your terminal and all your build tools some places you know have DevOps people it can handle a lot for you but if you don't like I don't have that here you know you're gonna have to know how to do all that so at some point you know it's good to make the transition and you know start building stuff and use that so so a thanks to thanks to Rick for doing that interview and thanks to everybody at syntax con who who volunteered and to do interviews I really appreciate it alright so now we're going to take at least until they sit until about three o'clock or until I get through these questions whatever's first I'm going to go through the live chat questions so if you were just here for the coding then you know you can you can check out now I won't be doing any more coding let's see where did I try to figure out where I left off at okay so it looks like I left off right about the point where we were talking about get branching so Hector says in some cases cherrypicking with git is useful okay that mean asks how much you charge for this website so for this website in particular I did this at the the place where I'm employed so I work at a university and another department was was starting this project and needed a website and at some point along the road it fell to me to do the site so some of the some of the work for the site was done basically there was another site that was built differently some of the design elements I was able to repurpose for this site but so basically I didn't charge anything I get paid a salary and I work on various web sites for different departments and different things that this university has ads going on I would probably say if I was going to charge for this site I don't want to like I'd have to take into account other stuff but if I have to give an answer on this now I would say someone in the end the chats mentioned five thousand dollars I would say that that would probably be the minimum that I would charge possibly more probably more for this site because this site is definitely not finished yet there's actually a lot more that that they wanted to do that we're going to add and right now either there's not content for or I didn't have time to add it in so when this when all is said and done this is going to be a bigger site and it's going to do more things so I'd be thinking more in like the ten thousand dollar range I do some some freelance work on on the side and the last site the last site that I did that would have been like comparable technology wise and like scope was to this project was over ten thousand so it was like almost a $12,000 site so yeah so I would say like some more than ten thousand range is probably what I would charge I am in the United States so I don't know what that would be in different areas the United States are different as well so if I was in a bigger city or maybe on the west coast I would probably charge charge more but I'm not I'm in a smaller a smaller City and not really a wealthy area of the country so I think that makes a big difference to if I'm doing local sites for local businesses they there's no way they would pay $10,000 for site it just wouldn't they just wouldn't have the money where I'm at to be able to handle that so but when I do sites for clients that are outside my area I actually got a lot of work from people in New York City then you know that they're not shocked by a bigger number like that you know they understand that a good website we'll take you know it takes time it takes money let's see have you worked out so nano Aquila I think I'm I think I'm saying that right ask have you worked out how to do load balancing so you can have one server running while you update another I haven't yet I actually talked to so there's another person in my department that does web development stuff as well Brian and he just got back from vacation today so I was talking to him this morning about how we can set that up so I haven't decided on anything yet and I'm gonna have to try it out I would like to read up on it a little bit more but here's what I'm thinking and I'm gonna have to talk faster if I want to get through this so if I don't fully answer anyone's question please put it in the comments or direct message me on Twitter because I want to answer your questions help you out as much as I can here's what I'm thinking that might be the simplest solution I don't I don't know how I would do this exactly but I'm thinking maybe I have two copies of this particular site running on the same droplet on digital oceans on the same server I already have nginx set up as the reverse proxy so what I would do is I would have them both running but they would be running select the Express server would be serving them on different ports okay so what nginx would then do is split it up between the two ports and I think this would be more simple than trying to do it on separate droplets I don't know I don't know because the separate droplet would potentially have a whole other IP address and then I wouldn't be dealing with ports I'd be dealing with IPS I'm not sure exactly how that would work with you know the SSL certificate so I don't want to deal with that right now I'm sure it's possible but I think the simplest way at least to start out with since my main concern is just avoiding down I'm when I'm updating and I'm not necessarily worried about like well what if this droplet crashes like you know it's not the type of site that like absolutely has to be online all the time so at first at least I think I am going to maybe try to run run two instances of this on different ports and then use nginx to switch between the two I don't know whether or not I'll have to have it switch like manually so maybe I only run one and then when I'm going to update I bring the other one up and manually switch it or preferably I would like to have them both running at the same time and just have nginx like load balance between the two and so then it would automatically do it I wouldn't have to worry about it I don't know if anybody has any thoughts on that if you've done something like that before have any articles or videos that might be helpful then please let me know alright when I mention the NPM type of thing earlier not a mod says he was thinking about the same thing the other day and he puts a little devil emoji so nobody go and use that idea for evil okay okay I have some advice for when we were working that you know we actually work through so I'm going to skip over that but thank you everybody who gave me advice um if if he I'm not sure to pronounce that but it looks like if ëif ie says still learning JavaScript have no idea what's going on here with a sad face emoji so yeah don't worry about it there are a lot of videos that I watched starting out and sometimes I still watch them now or the first time I watched him and like I have no idea what's going on but I learned a little bit I try it and then I go back and watch it a little bit later and I understand a little more and then eventually I go back to the video and I'm like I you know I got all this stuff so it will happen and ask questions so I'm happy to explain you know what I'm doing if the dinging that's confusing and looks like also you know it's got some similar advice for people in live chat so awesome everybody I'm glad to see the positive encouragement and I think that really helps I mean I know it helps me when I get positive encouragement and it you know it helps people who are new starting out as well so it's good good to throw that around I mean nothing with wrong with constructive criticism as well but especially when people are new I think they mean they need encouragement more than than criticism at that point you know they'll they'll get better that will come so I'm going to uh my hair I guess that's how you pronounce it I'm not sure sorry when when we when you will guys complete the courses in your website I've been waiting for a long time um I'm not a hundred unsure what you're referring to but I think let me know if this is wrong I think what is being referred to here are the free code camp courses like the new courses so there's there's like a beta version of free code camp that has new courses and yeah so I don't know what the timeline is for completion if you want to try those out you can I think there's a get github repo for that that's up I don't I don't know the link offhand but you can check that out you can work your way through the the beta version so if if you want to get in and try them out you know they're not like a hundred percent complete but I can't lace it I don't know so I can't give you a definite answer I don't I don't want to try to tell you something and it not be correct but and let me know if that's not what you're talking about um okay let's see all right I have some there's some comments here people coming explaining to me what I was doing wrong and I missed them when I was doing it so sorry about that thank you for the advice okay there we go John Murphy says I know it's been brought up affordable what ide is jesse using so yeah I mean that almost every video someone asked about the ID which is totally fine um I don't get annoyed by that at all because I know sometimes people were watching for the first time where they never caught it before so totally fine if we get the same question but Patrick Patrick handle down a live chat it is Adam so if you're watching later on and you can't see the live chat then the link is in the description for my editor it's Adam it does have some custom um Styles oh and there's my alarm so I'm going to go ahead and there's not that many questions left so I'm going to finish this out really quickly and then I have to go the package I'm using the SETI theme so that's my theme sebastian asks what packages you have installed so the theme at least is SETI SETI I do have a bunch of other packages and I'm going to do a video soon and put it on on my youtube channel about how I set this up really about all the different tools I use I'm going to do some short videos on each one so those should be coming soon I just need a little bit of time maybe to get in early uh one day and and do a few videos so that will be coming and I'll share that some aim high ass how long have you been a developer um I want to say like like five years I've gotten this question before and I'm gonna have to like go check my calendar and so I can give the an accurate answer but I'm guessing like five years ii've I messed with websites and did like some really basic things like back when everybody did like tables for layout and things like that um you know back in like the early 2000s and then I didn't do anything with it for a while but then I got back into it like seriously you know professionally you know for money probably like four or five years ago so that would be that would be kind of the start at first when I get into it I definitely would have considered myself a developer I was doing a lot of different things and most of my you know the closest thing I was going to development work was like customizing WordPress themes so for that first like year I was just learning I wasn't really be doing developer type stuff but then after that I got more and more into it and now at this point my my title is frontend developer and that's you know that's what I do fulltime okay so someone's asking I think based on what I've seen your easy 18 to 20 K all right thanks it R I'm sorry that wasn't a question they're stating that so spinnerbait um actually I think that name is like a fishing reference so that's really cool why I like fishing I I don't get to go as often as I would like but I like that name um alright awesome thanks so I'm glad you think that this site is would be worth that much bromo Matic ass how did you find a client for the 10k site I don't want to give away like a ton of information about this because just in case like the client doesn't want everybody knowing how much that they paid for the site so I'm going to be like Generic I'm going to be as vague as possible but still tried answer question it was a connection through a family member so sometimes that happens you just get a connection somebody noose someone new one of my family members and they the company they worked for needed a website so they got in touch through social media and and we're directed to me and then that that's how it all happened so my best clients have always been like that it's been like personal connections or referrals from from previous clients that's always the best so I've done advertising and like all the different social media sites you know Google Ads you know I've tried to you know get my my website ranked higher are in things and I've gotten very very few clients from that and usually they're not big clients so you know those kind of things are it's good to have a website and have a social media presence because people are going to look at that but the personal networking is is really where I've gotten the best clients from and people that I know that also I've done freelance work before they've said the same thing so you know that's that's a good way that's where I my best advice I can get for trying to find clients and trying to find bigger clients is you know try to get those referrals from maybe smaller clients and try to work on you know those connections that you have already and yeah and then eventually it took me a while to get to that you know I worked my way up through a bunch of really small sites that that didn't pay very much at all before I got to that point so it's not like I just you know started started getting you know bigger sites like that right up right off the bat okay so Chad says uh sorry if it's our guests I just got here but when you do work remotely what form do you charge your clients so you don't get skinned um usually I do something like so I do have a contract that I give and in the contract it states upfront that either the full amount like if it's if it was a smaller amount you know if the site I was going wasn't let's say it's not ten thousand let sales knowing a site for just a few thousand dollars which at this point I don't know if I would take a site for that much maybe I would against it depends on the site but cause knowing is safe for smaller amount of money that would be more reasonable for a company to be able to pay upfront they would have to pay the full amount upfront before I start working and then that's like obviously you don't get scammed right because you get the full amount upfront and that would be in the contract otherwise if it's a larger amount of money then it's usually a percentage like you know I get fifty percent upfront what you know whatever percentage it would be it does depend a little bit on the total price and what's reasonable to expect a company to pay you know based on the size of the company so I would get a percentage upfront before I started working and then I would do the work if it would be a really long project there might be some like payment you know in between like you know once I get to a certain point the project I get another payment and then finally I never launch a site without final payment and that's in the contract the site the site does not launch unless I have that money once I have money then I launch the site then I hand over all the passwords and everything but that's how it has to work otherwise yeah you could definitely get scammed so that happens I've had it happen before where clients um I've never had it happen where a client just flatout never paid but I have had it happen where a client didn't pay for a really long time after they were supposed to and I had to like keep after it and keep contacting them like you know every week or so for months and months until I finally got paid and that was just I didn't like to do that I didn't like the bug people with um I didn't it was just a bad feeling to know that you know somebody was you know was owing all this money and yeah so now I don't I don't do that I don't do work without being paid upfront before the word goes live so that's what I would and and if if you get a client that's not willing to accept that then just turn them down unless you really really need that money you know you got to feed your kids or something like that um then just turn them down because if somebody's not comfortable paying that then it makes me wonder like are they thinking that they want to back out of this if they don't like the product like is that you know why they do they not want to pay you know they're coming into this not trusting you that's not a relationship with a client that you really want to have so anyway so that that's my advice maybe some of you might have more experience with that kind of thing and you know feel free to add your ear advice as well okay spinnerbait says using on standard port for dev okay cool that's that's good advice Patrick's been looking into load balancing lately he thinks that we need nginx health checks which is not available in the free version in the pain version it's expensive okay that's good to know I'll look into that um I'm glad you brought that up because that gives me some place to start looking at least let me check the time so okay I can finish this out there's only like four more comments here um Zach asks how or where do I learn the visual design portion of making websites do you hire someone for that part or you use do it for yourself yeah so it depends on what you're into in what you want to do for me I don't mind doing the design stuff I actually I do it myself and some some people do work like that and other people they don't want anything to do with the design and they have somebody else handle the design they get it the design basically handed to them finished and then all they do is make that design into a real website okay so I don't have a person like that working with me right now so I have to do the design as well I I use Google's material design standards so that takes a lot of the work out of it for me um it keeps the continuity so that I don't really have to totally think up the design my you know on my own you know there are customizations that are made but I don't mind doing that I definitely I don't consider myself a designer but I do things that are you know it's design work it falls under that you know that category so if you're into that you want to do that then you know I would I would go for it and you'll learn a little bit about design as well otherwise you know if you're freelancing maybe like find somebody that you can partner with that can you can recommend to do designs when you try to get with clients if you don't want to do the designs yourself and then you know that could be you know a nice partnership for you or if you work in a bigger organization they'll probably have people go into decides if you want to just focus on you know developing the site so but that's how I do the I would always say I do actually do the design and development together just myself okay umberto says often times it happens my sisterinlaw's uncle is Larry heck I'm not sure maybe I'm not sure what Alberto was responding to oh okay um the question before about payment and not getting ripped scanned by a client Chad asked that I misunderstood the question a bit Chad wanted to know like specifically do I use PayPal or do you something else so I give clients the option I actually assuming the clients in the United States and it's not a big deal to mail something I just mailing a check because you mail a check then there's no fee for that right at least for me if I accept a payment on PayPal then they take fees out so the check is easier for me it's just as easy as PayPal for me without the fee but sometimes clients prefer PayPal so I I do allow PayPal to so either way I don't think it really matters what payment method you're using as long as you make sure that you get the payment before you you launch anything and then you'll be fine because then I mean it's at least get part of the payment if not all the payment before you start work and then for sure make sure you get everything before you launch a site and then no matter no matter what you use to receive if it's paypal of course you get that money instantly and you can see if it's a cheque get the check and cash the check to make sure that they actually have the money in their account first before you launch the site so that's a good point like don't don't just look at the cheque and say hey I'm going to launch this make sure you cash it because if they don't have the money in their account then you're not going to get paid even if they wrote the check more of an asked you use materialized CSS framework yes I do I do he's materialized and aim high ash this is the last one last question have you got a personal website I do have a personal web well I guess it's kind of a personal site so it's just Jesse Weibull Khan um it's Jay ESS if you go to that site keep in mind I've not actually worked on that site for years so be kind and don't don't think too poorly of me when you see it it's just a basic WordPress site that's using like a premade theme there's not a whole lot of customization going on so just keep that in mind I really would like to redo that site one day and make it like really cool since I'm not really actively trying to get clients anymore anyway so that site currently is kind of like a marketing site to get clients I just never changed it you know since I've started you know working like salary and fulltime so one day maybe I'll change it and just have you know cool stuff on there that that I like to do maybe just side projects and things but for now it is what it is so don't don't go there looking for inspiration you won't find it yet um but maybe one day said you're welcome Jed said thanks for instant questions you're welcome no problem I'm happy to do it um huh man you all snuck in some extra questions here all right let me see what time it is all right maybe I can finish these last questions and then for real I gotta you know I gotta leave I got a um pick up my son and okay so what are your top Jeremy cos what are your top three code editors I use Adam I like Adam I also have used Visual Studio code and I like that as well I'm kind of using the two of them right now for two different projects that I'm working on and in comparing so at some point maybe I'll switch I don't know I'm not I'm not sold on Adams been my goto for years so I'm gonna have to really be sold on something else to switch just because I'm so comfortable with Adam and I have all my packages set up how I like so my third I haven't really used another editor enough to have a third one before I use Adam I use notepad plus plus for Windows I don't really recommend that it wasn't compared to like the newer editors like sublime and Adam and Visual Studio code and what else I think there's like brackets like notepad plus plus just didn't seem as as good as the other ones oh okay I'm there too made a comment earlier and I wasn't sure what it was but it was in response to networking okay I kind of thought it was so um yeah sorry I didn't understand that at first okay um spinnerbait says have a great day later all right you too now thanks for watching sublime chesa sublime man sublime yeah I know there's a lot of people that really like sublime I just I've never tried sublime so maybe one day I'll try it but you all know how it is if you used an editor for a while it's just like it's easier to just keep using that than to learn a new one so it takes a lot to switch so maybe one day I'll try it out but alright so I really have to go now if I didn't get if you have a question you didn't get to ask it or you're watching this later just put it in the comments and or direct message me on Twitter or any of my social media stuff and I'll be back tomorrow same time 200 p.m. Eastern and I'm not exactly sure what will be working on it depends on how much I get done between now and then but I'll put it on Twitter whenever you know just a reminder whatever I'm going to be live and there should they'll probably be like an update if you're subscribed to the channel that'll remind you all if you want to watch so thanks so much for watching and thanks for all the help that you gave me in the live chat that that definitely helped me to get this running faster so I really appreciate that and have a great day I'll see y'all tomorrow
