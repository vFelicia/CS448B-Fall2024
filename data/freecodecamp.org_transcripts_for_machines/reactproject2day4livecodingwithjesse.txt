hey everybody is Jessie and today we're gonna switch over to using the newest version of material UI so this will be let's see we started with the the stable version then we switched to the alpha then we switched back to what we originally had and then a few days ago the beta version came out so now we're switching to that so I know we talked about switching yesterday and I didn't realize when we were talking about it that the beta version had already come out so I saw that on Twitter afterwards and I felt really stupid and then a few of you messaged me and told me about it so thanks for giving me the heads up on that I appreciate that let's see alright somebody in the in the live chats asking how do I get started with a series this is only the fourth stream in the series for this particular project so just go back to where it says I think starting my new react project if you want to see like the very beginning of the series you actually have to go to to my channel my personal channel the links in the description and if you if you check I can't remember what the name is I think it's the the first video is like building a website as fast as I can that might be the title so I did a few videos on my own channel before I got invited to livestream for this channel so that's where project one started but project two we're still in the beginning phases of that all right yeah and I am at work today so the video quality should be good sorry again about yesterday's quality I'm I'm in the middle of actually switching over so I'll show you how it's going so this is how it's going so far it's not too bad they were more there were more errors so I've gotten it down I've just been slowly working through error messages because it's definitely different so this switch once I switch it's not going to be that easy to go back so there's differences I guess this will be really good for anyone to watch if you're thinking about switching so let me go through some of the differences that I've noticed so far and I had to change let me bring up the code so I think this this is a good one where I had some differences all right so originally we were bringing in app bar and actually if you check out the code that's in the git repo right now it's the old code I haven't pushed any of the new stuff up yet because there's errors on I never really liked to push errors unless something comes up and I have to leave work and I just I need to push it so as soon as I get rid of the errors I'll push up the new code but for now it'll be alright because you can check on github what we did have and how we had to change it so I did leave some of the code in here seek at least see some of what we had down here and we did change some stuff up here but you have to check that out and github so they make this a bit bigger we had app bar we're bringing in app bar from material UI and all we had to do was put in a title and that's what show up at the top of our our app and you know then we had some other options for like clicking clicking the menu button and that was it it was pretty simple we've replaced this with this button app bar and this is a component that I've made but I basically just copied and pasted everything from the docks for the latest version of material UI so let me show you what I do so in order to get that same thing with I'm still not even sure this will work since I keep getting so many errors but in order to get that same thing it's a lot more complicated so I'm not necessarily saying that's a bad thing it seems like they'll be it'll be easier to customize things like this so I think it will end up being a good thing but for now it's just I'm gonna definitely have to change you know how we were doing things but basically we've got now instead of just a bar we have app bar toolbar typography button icon button menu icon so we're putting all of that together here and you can see some of the stuff is still similar I guess we have this is a little bit odd you know instead of being able to put the title we actually have to put it inside typography so I haven't played with it enough to know whether or not you absolutely have to have this but for now I'm just gonna kind of leave it there once I get it working then we can try to customize it and see what you know what happens there's a little bit so I've noticed for some things I've had to switch to this type of import so before for some of the things I could just import it like this like I'm doing with what say you know app bar toolbar so import app bar from material UI and slash app bar I was getting errors on some of that those and I had to switch it to look like this import and then inside my my curly brackets I'd have to put it listed so I just kind of keep going back and forth to the documentation and trying to figure out what the new way of doing it is so that's what I've been working on so far I had to change okay this is a good example so before I was able to bring in menu item just like this so I would so I would import menu item from material icons or material uimenuitem now I had to switch it and I have to import menu item from material you I'm menu so there's just little things like that that aren't really a big deal but it's a big enough deal to give you an error message so I'm sure it'd only take a few days to get used to how everything is especially since I wasn't really that used to the old way so right now I mean I'm just gonna work try to work through these error messages and let me bring pull that over there and bring this over so our error message that we're getting now and make this bigger Oh actually before we get into anything I do want to say thank you to Patrick and Sebastian for their pool requests so actually a lot of the stuff I just showed you probably seemed weird because those are all new things from pool requests so I'm sorry I totally forgot so a lot changed since yesterday let me take you through some of the changes just so that we're all on the same page so most of the changes are available in github right now so you can check them out as I'm going over them but right now in terms of how everything looks it all looked pretty much the same the changes were just how everything's laid out behind the scenes the only difference that you could see was Sebastian had the different background color to that active class so that it actually did show there was a visual representation of what page you were on when you open that that side drawer so this is what so this side nav component this was all Sebastian so he created the side nav component now of course as I said I've edited it to work with the newer material UI but the bulk of it is still the same I also edited the side nav to add this the sidebar item component so this is a component now so what I had done is so Patrick had submitted a pull request and it was the second pull request then Sebastian submitted pull request three so I think they were both working at the same time so Patrick had worked on some of the same stuff that Sebastian was so I kind of combined the two so I merged and Patrick to pull requests and I turned what he had you know he had basically had this component inside the main app.js file so it was just like okay I mean obviously I don't have it in here but it was just above here you know as a functional component and then he could you know call it you know down here this is all now changed a lot as well but basically I just took that I made it a component so that allowed me to use it this sidebar item inside the nav could side nav component that Sebastian had made so it worked out pretty well I had some trouble getting everything working but that was just entirely due to me messing up the prop names so for a second I thought I had some like really weird bug but it was just just using the wrong prop name so that happens let's see anything else okay on app dodge is a lot did change here as well so you Sebastian change it to use this switch so it's it's a lot more concise and you can see our app component now it's way shorter than it was so the top part where we're importing things actually you know we do have a lot of different things imported now Sebastian took all those can all those views and he imported them all so now they're actually working so you can see each one has like the barebones it needs to be a component which is awesome and so now this is all imported and so you can see what our routes will render each one of these views depending on what the URL is Sebastian also added a component in case it's it's some URL that's not here it's just just like a catchall to tell users like hey that URL doesn't have anything so I think that's also Sebastian Sebastian did a lot of stuff in his pool request he added in the theme properly which I had to take a lot out of things so here's the theme right now because I was getting weird errors with the colors and I realized that I don't actually need to import the colors cuz I was just using the default colors anyway and the only color I had change was primary so I got rid of everything that didn't matter except this primary color that had changed and we can just add back in what we need as we go based on the new documentation and then that'll that'll help us get up and running a little bit faster right now because you know just one less there you less areas that we have to worry about but anyway thank you so much Patrick and Sebastian that helped a lot and made things a lot more clean and it took care of a lot of stuff some of which I had no idea how to do so it would have taken me a long time to figure it out so okay now that we're all caught up and everyone should have a decent idea of where we're at today we're gonna start fixing these errors so we're going to look at cannot Reaper you at bar of undefined in at barge s54 so that's not I don't like this error because at bar isn't even our component right at bar is at bar comes with with the theme so we're gonna have to look at the documentation then and see what the heck's going on with a bar so we have a bar it's just an aesthetic bringing a bar see that this is actually really weird because I copied and pasted this exactly from the documentation and that should be the only place that we're actually using a bar let's double check and make sure we didn't leave it in anywhere so inside I mean other than here which I can get rid of this now other than their I don't think we're using a bar anywhere let me check the live chat quickly I haven't even said hi to everybody yet also this is being broadcast simultaneously on YouTube and on Instagram so if you're watching on Instagram check out the free code camp YouTube channel and you can see the code that I'm working on and if you're watching on YouTube if you would like to see my face and some of my office while I'm doing this you can check me out on Instagram and the link to that is in the description for this video all right so let's see hey everybody Sharan is asking about links to my channel in the description okay it looks like you found it so awesome Joel says hi from Bolivia hey how's it going thanks for watching all right so getting some comments about I guess the new material you I wrote on says looked at Mervyn's here UI and I actually like how it bundle those multiple exports into one where it makes sense but the thing is you wouldn't immediately know without referring to the docs mmhmm alright cool yes and the the editor is Adam to tell you the truth I'm pretty sure we had a few streams where no one asked about the code editor I was kind of disappointed maybe I'm mistaken maybe I have to go back and watch the streams but I'm pretty sure no one asks maybe yesterday or last week at some point I know there was at least one where I don't think anyone asked so broke the streak and then says hi campers any good resource to learn jQuery real quick I think the free code camp course goes through jQuery at first write the jQuery documentation is actually really easy to read so I would check that out as far as documentation goes some documentation is super difficult to read and but I think the jQuery Doc's are really really easy so I had some similar just joined an Instagram hey how's it going a couple people join in thanks for watching if you want to see the code check it out on free code camp youtube tone asks a fellow include redux I don't think I'm going to include Redux in this project I don't think it'll be needed but I'm there are plans for doing a really really big website in react and if that's the case I'm probably going to use some more advanced things for that so that projects coming so if just a little sneak peek the main website for the university needs redone it's like three years old at this point and the system it's built on is going extinct so we need to redo it and I'm like 90% sure it's gonna be redone with react and there's gonna be cool stuff with load balancing so we're gonna have lots of lots of servers with load balancing going on and lots of caching and things so because it needs to handle a lot of traffic so that's going to be fun to do so all these little react projects are building up to that I'm purposely testing out different things don't eat on that project so that's my plan so that's coming okay Umberto says hey Jessie are you able to comment out the place where you use app bar and see if the error goes away then debug from there I guess I could but really like I'm using app bar here you know and it's wrapping its wrapped there on all this stuff so I'm not sure I can't just comment that out without commenting all this stuff out and then that's basically the whole component what I could I guess like where am I using this set button hat bar I guess I could comment this out really quick and then I have to comment this out too so don't get in err so if you're new to react and you can't figure out how to do comments inside JSX this is how you do it it took me forever to figure this out I used to get errors because I tried to do comments and they wouldn't work so you have to use the curly brackets to drop into JavaScript and then you put your multiline comments and that's how you have to comment it out it's a little bit more work alright so I'm gonna do that and just see what I get I don't even know where my there we go okay so I actually did get a different error let me show you what I've got going on over here so this is the the app so nav drawer is now undefined yeah and that's actually in this is another area that's that's within this material UI drawer component so I don't know what is going on let me read a few more comments here to see if anyone has any ideas for me hey Jordan Jordan says hi hey Jordan Phillip said Patrick saving Jesse's job one pull request at a time I like that I mean I'm pretty sure I still have a job but I really do appreciate all the pull request it does make me look better that I have these I give you all credit though even like in meetings all uh when we have our our department meetings I do bring up you know that you all have submitted pull requests most of the people in the meeting have no idea what I'm talking about I try to explain it but sometimes it's better just to say I've lots of people helping me XANA says she doesn't have Instagram oh uh I didn't have an Instagram until maybe two months ago and it's kind of fun I never thought it would it would really be I didn't think I'd be into it but it is kind of fun all right Sebastian says remove the prototype Moop remove the prop types oh okay is that what's causing my errors then actually oh really Oh unsaid my Instagram livestream keeps on buffering so I don't really know I I'm really new with everything on Instagram so I'm not I'm not even sure if I can change settings or anything it seems really basic you just hit a button to go live and there's not really any options alright so here's what I do want to say this is it possible is it possible that some stuff from the old version could have been left behind I do remember reading in the in the changelog something about I thought it was something about zindex being removed and that is actually part of what era I was getting all right bill says maybe delete yet then it sounds like a good idea I'm gonna go and I'm gonna delete material UI and then I'm gonna reinstall it and after I delete material UI I will manually check to make sure that it really is deleted so let's go and I mean this is where the shot this is really easy and if it fixes it that'll save a lot of time okay now let's check our node modules so we should have alright so there's no material UI we have the icons there but I'm gonna leave them because I've had no issues with the icons alright now I will I did the at next version and that did give me the the latest beta version is there some other way to do this that would get I mean I assume at this point it'll be fine it'll just give me the latest version so I did doublecheck in the node module to see what the version number was and I think it's beta v1 and it's like 0 0.2 or something like that Johnny asked if I'm using Ubuntu no not for my machine it's it's Mac I usually blew through all my servers 16 point o4 yes uh ones using the Bluetooth so as Anna I'll join you said the console looks like Linux this is actually I term 2 for the console I mean it's all the same commands that you would use in Linux alright well hopefully that make a difference I'm gonna restart the server as well since that seems to help sometimes and I really wanted to start use using and rock like I had mentioned yesterday but is if I'm just getting errors right now there's really no point oh I'll start it if we get these fixed sorry if you're watching on Instagram I my phone just fell over and you're looking at the ceiling so I just noticed that hopefully it wasn't going on for a while let's see all right Sebastian says make sure you updated all the old version components to the beta ones all right let's see natural I'm gonna check out I guess is really not not much I can do except try to check out the docs for everything that I'm getting an error for and where I lost my dog oh hey there alright so I'll bring ease over and I'll leave this air up and so let's check out drawer okay it looks like there is some different stuff for the drawer sorry that was really small I didn't didn't realize that okay I'm gonna move this over to my other screen so I can compare it with the code that we're currently using for the drawer just to see if we're we're doing this the right way so I'm looking at the documentation for the newest version of material UI so I had you have to click the bar if you're gonna go to material you i.com you have to click the bar at the top that says all ya material UI v1 is coming I like that that's fun so I'm just gonna check to see that I am importing what I need to import and see all right they definitely they have a different way of doing this this handle close I doubt that would be messing us up it's probably worth a shot and now it's saying like instead of saying this state let me bring this over so there's a lot more options going on here so you can open it from all these different places so this state open left then they have different ways to close it so maybe I ought to pull in a lot more what's going on here let me get check back in the live chat Rowen says at this point I would just try modifying other modules by hand and commenting out the offending lines yep sometimes I do things that make people kill themselves one says wouldn't it help to look for more info in the Aires call stack that's close yeah embarrass it says just remember to uncomment your button a part yeah maybe I should just uncomment that for now and then take these one at a time so we'll come back to the drawer thing let's handle this we'll handle them in order I have a feeling that once we figure out one or two of these then the rest won't be as big of a deal oops I forgot to uncomment this there we go okay now let's see what our air was and this one was giving us the air here okay so it is this zindex thing again so for both of the components the air we're getting has to do with this zindex themes the index at bar hmm actually let's check out let's check this out hmm I'm looking looking for things that were really new now as to all right it's worth the shot to just throw this in the Google search and see hello so I didn't really have much hope since this version just came out so let me go back to I wonder we so I did have something I mentioned earlier that I took a lot of stuff out of my theme and I did have some stuff in there I think about the index maybe it was about shadows I hope that that wasn't somehow required and now my themes overriding stuff and it has no there's nothing in there all right let's check out our theme hmm I have yeah let's check what it says about themes then says that seems to be the issue here we go seems he annexed a poor okay so in here in this thing we do have zindex at bar let's check out what we actually have and some triage styles theme jazz alright let's check out our theme JS file all right this looks different let's looks like we have the index touches okay it looks like it's here so so this should be getting imported into the themes well let's just copy this it's copy all of this and let's put it in our custom theme so let's see should be zindex all right not sure if that'll do anything heeey they see where my terminal went I moved it over all right cool hey we fix that error ha ha so hey guess what I have a better idea what if let's just copy everything in this theme Jas since it seems like it's legit and we'll paste it into the theme guess and our node module or better yet let's just paste it into our custom theme so we don't have to mess with our node modules so I mean a little bit repetitive here to have it all in there but instead of going through one by one it's think I think it makes a lot more sense to do it like this let me make sure where this starts okay all right stange it still Evers all right what is it now color theme get palette did did my restarting of the server actually do anything maybe it did okay all right so let's let's look specifically at what's going on here no that's not what we're a par 74 color theme palette you're conscious okay alright let me go back to the to the lab chat for a minute here let's see all right yeah so I'm not good thing everybody was still talking about zindex and I'm not I'm pretty sure that we've we've kind of with I don't want to say we fix the problem because really we just like worked around it but contrast Texas not hmm so the problem with everything is this theme file where's mine so this is really small let me make it bigger okay it really wasn't even a theme is there yeah sebastien s is that the old version theme now I think this these are the dogs now you're right it did switch over I thought I had the it must have switched over when I went to issues so good call on that Sebastian okay now we can actually see this okay palate this good Hallet there we go so I suppose whatever is they're saying it's not a function should be in this palette file all right which one were you looking for get contrast text yep this is it all right so for some reason it can't find that Why Why cannot find that let's see if we have a pallet J s file in our high modulus under Styles polishes get contrast text okay so we have it all right so we we obviously have the right function here okay it is bringing in pallet okay so I don't maybe I'm missing something I'm gonna go to a live chat and see but it seems to me like we just saw that this theme Dodge is is pulling in pilots which is requiring pallet and then when we looked in pallet we did have the correct function all right so let me scroll up a bit Frances asks can we fork your project and fix it for you yeah you can I don't really want to push things with errors up to github but I I might I might push this actually it won't let me my commit hook will probably not let me push this up all right let's see huh Joe honey says the next video should be named problemsolving with Jesse yeah honestly sometimes that's that's what happens so hey with someone else joined us in on the Instagram livestream so welcome if you want to check out the code that I'm working on go to free code camps YouTube channel and then you get to see what I'm seeing on my screen alright John Hanson said the Instagram live feed is great as it's not delayed sound to the YouTube live video cool alright that's cool I mean I'll I never realized that it was pretty cool Patrick says you're using the old theme way with the new beta way check out the docs for themes okay cool I will do that so let me see I think I have the docs up here still I thought I did did I move him yeah yeah I did I moved him to the other screen so I could see better so let's do the provider so it's full and so here's where I'm here's my FPS thing obviously I copied over pretty much everything let's see all right so maybe I am I'm thinking so I did update and where we get an app j/s I updated to thought I updated to the new way of pulling in a theme so we changed before this was different and so I updated that and also how we pull in the theme as well all right so maybe I'll pull this over so y'all can see what I'm looking at here so this is under the new documentation at the bottom of the themes page so maybe creating the theme is different as well so maybe I need to do something like this alright so let's try gets us to change the URL too oops put down the wrong spot with the Fierstein does that look right that does not look right let me see okay definitely get an air maybe I'm looking at the wrong John Henson in the live chat says great news I installed react on top of web hack pain in the works now using router as well for multiple pages links not trying to see if I can get sass to build separate files for each page that's awesome definitely let me know how sass works out for you synthetic today how did I put that in the wrong place probably I did yeah I'm still getting that air yeah John said the Instagram feed did die yeah so I guess Instagram has a limit of an hour on live streams so only the first hour of anything I do gets good streams imagine my stream was probably super boring for Instagram because it was a lot of me just looking at a screen I wasn't doing much talking so alright so I'm not sure I'm not exactly sure where to get an X from here no you think for a minute uh uh so I mean we had we made some progress and then we're stops okay let's see if we have a pallet what was where is our our github documentation for pallet I can't do this can i this isn't gonna work is there any way for me to put a function inside this object this I feel like this is like just objects 101 but we have figured I can't do that what if I get contrast ratio I hope I do like this okay okay so faster exists JavaScript has firstclass functions of course you can put a function and an object or not like that just because you can doesn't mean the material UI knows how to use it yeah at this point I was just continuing on with our process of putting everything that we get an arrow and into our into our theme but it looks like this pulls a lot of other stuff so it's probably not a great idea because well we will literally end up having to put everything into there when the problems seems to be for some reason things aren't getting pulled into themed ijs properly actually hold on this this looks weird maybe I'm missing something I might be missing something one on in here but look in here it's saying palette is palette right but up here we're naming it underscore palette where else are we are we getting are we changing that somewhere okay here we go looks like we're defining palette here Rohan says I think it's the wrong way to go having to put everything in a custom theme file yeah I agree I think it was worth a shot if I could just get it to work with just the part that I put in but if I have to put in more than it's not it's going to be too much Tylar s in the lodge at what's your opinion on these new nano degree programs popping up and I'm going to answer that just to take a little break from this I'm I'm doing the react nanodegree program from Udacity right now in terms of the course quality and content I'm impressed with it so far I don't know firsthand whether a nano degree is helpful or getting a job excuse me he's yawning today is day two with no caffeine I think I'm gonna take a little break from it and see if it helps me sleep but I am you own anymore so anyway I don't know personally whether it helps getting a job of course you like I've read online that you know companies are starting to recognize them but I don't really know you know how many companies and so I'm not I'm not really sure if your main goal when taking a nano degree is to learn and you want to get feedback to do like the paid version and you know get a you know actually end up with a nano degree then I think it's good for that I just I kind of wonder like what people think when they see nano degree on a resume does that really mean anything or not I think at some point it might mean something into some companies it might mean something but I'm just not sure yet but I think it's you definitely learn a lot all right okay Patrick I see your your comment here you can't are you using create Mui theme which is how the dogs did let's see yeah so here's what I'm going up here Rowen says are we importing Mui theme provider yes I am importing that as well yeah that's the thing some stuff was working and even before I changed all this around which I couldn't even keep track of what I was doing I think I I think I've messed this up I should probably just undo everything since it was working but this was you know it fixed that zindex issue that we were having so obviously this was getting used somehow but I actually do think I should just undo all of the stuff I did in here I don't know they did it is fixing the zindex issue still right let me let me take out this stuff I did down here we got accidentally set a debug point didn't realize it okay yeah so that that that actually is taking care of that zindex issue it's going farther down in at bar Jaso the zindex thing was up here in line 54 now we've we've made it all the way down the line 74 and now is this pilot thing let me see I see I'm barrister I see what you're saying shouldn't that be from interior UI styles and UI theme provider let me see where I was having that I think I pulled this I think I pulled this right from the docks let me doublecheck yeah Patrick said I feel like this beta is an alpha yeah kind of regretting regretting the decision to do this the good thing is let me check my git log and see what I've actually done I don't know that I've actually committed any of this so we could just go back easily yeah so if this endeavor fails it won't be hard to go back to where we were at that's that's the beauty of get in version control in general so if you aren't using it this is a great reason to use git is if you if you mess up your app just pretty much beyond repair which is it's kind of what I think I've done just now then then it can help you can just go back mmm same thing oh actually we've got okay so I had gone in here and mess with some stuff actually okay so this makes at least this will help us narrow down so it's it's able successfully at least it was able to go into a theme palette background at bar but then when it tried to theme palette get contrast text it couldn't work so it it actually is importing so the issue then would probably be within palette dot Jas okay so this is where it is actually returning get contrast text and that is yeah that is the name of the function okay I said now I'm seeing what you all were saying about pushing into another granite branch first okay let's see so is that is there like a shortcut way for me to switch to another branch and commit these or do I need to commit them to master and then push to another branch and then just roll back the commits okay david says there is a shortcut way if anybody commits directly to branch alright let me check so like commit directly to to the UH to another branch okay cool it comes up as one of the options in the Google search all right making new parents check it out and the change will come with you and you changed and I had the chance to see wrench commit okay I had no idea that you could do this alright let me pull over I'm gonna do this so everybody can see it okay so this everybody knows what I'm doing I am on the master branch and I don't want to commit these changes to master branch I've decided according to the advice of you all that I should commit these on a different branch and then push it up to github and then that way everyone can see what's going on so that's what I'm attempting to do so I'm gonna get checkout Hey and then we're gonna say material you are beta okay cool awesome everything's right here grades I can't believe that made it through I thought for sure I had done something that was gonna cause an error that's awesome alright oops cool all right now it's on github cuo can see the mess that I've made yeah that's why I get all right okay so this should be working because it's undone everything but for some reason it's not there we go sir I didn't I didn't install the right packages so that's that was the problem all right so at least now I can show you show you this the the highlighting of the page you are on is working so I think this is what's yeah I think what I'll do for now maybe is give up on the idea of using the newest version so the whole point of me wanting to use the beta version instead of the normal one is for the coulomb class components and I figured that that would save me time in the long run by having all those extra components and it would be worth the setup time and transferring it over I think now that that does that's not true anymore so the time I thought it would take to get this working was way less than what it's actually taking and then that's no longer a good decision time was I think it would be faster for me to just make my own column classes and use them I mean I could potentially even try to model them after what's in the beta if I want to but that's just too much also I'm a little worried that if I run into errors since it's so new there's not going to be a whole lot of other people talking about those errors all right one has to go see later one thanks for for joining us what Sun isn't that okay it's about 330 so yeah I think now's a good time for me to admit defeat for today and wrap things up so all in all today did did get a lot of stuff done behind the scenes in terms of getting the pull requests in and making some extra components and things so it wasn't you know in terms of trying to do the switch to the beta that that definitely was a failure but did I did get some stuff done on the site and can always come back since we've you know save those changes in another branch it's entirely possible to come back to that at some point but for right now I'm not sure that's the best idea so this is gonna be a very good lesson to me and maybe to someone else out there that it's probably better just to pick something and stick with it and not try to keep changing it because I've definitely wasted a lot of time I don't want to say wasted I mean learned some stuff along the way but it could have been using that time to actually build this out so don't like to I don't ever really like to back down from trying to figure something out but at some point there's just not enough time to figure some things out bill wrote react project to day ten design decided for real this time that actually does sound like something I would type if you've ever seen my commit messages if I try to commit something and I accidentally don't commit what I wanted to my next commit message is always do this thing for real this time so it is how I would say it okay so I'm gonna go back through the chat now and see if there's any questions that I missed I'm sure there probably is because I was so focused on this so if you have any questions put them in the live chat now if you can't stick around for the chat it Patricks if you can't stick around for the chat just direct message me on twitter or put it in the comments to this video and I'll get to him whenever I get a chance Patrick said dude commit amend yeah I actually did do an amend on a project I was working on my lunch break so I have done that before but usually honestly usually I don't even care enough to do an amend because it's just me working on these projects so um although now you all are working on them with me but like in the past it's always been just me working on these projects and no one ever looked at my gig commits so I got was lazy about it and I said I'll just do another commit it would be faster so I probably should start using amend more but all right so let me go through the chat here and if you got to leave now thank you so much for watching I'll be back tomorrow all right looking through right actually not really a lot of questions so far in the chat oh I see you all have made some comments on JSX comment tags being ugly I agree I mean it's not really that big of a deal I guess but I do wish there were a simpler way in a nicer looking way to do comments so Jan asks can you recommend me a good tool for debugging j/s that was that's a long time ago so I'm not sure if you're still around but I mean dev dev tools is pretty good chrome dev tools is good does anyone know of anything better than then chrome dev tools that's easy to use I mean I assume you're talking I guess about you know regular JavaScript I'm not sure how good dev tools is a debugging like node or I don't know if you're trying to do something with react native or something like that I'm sure maybe there's different debuggers for that but if just talk about like normal JavaScript that most people write I think dev tools is pretty good I haven't really used much of anything else though so maybe there's other things out there and not aware of nam says hi everyone I'm a new person I've gotten into programmer I like working on backend or to be software engineer in general someone here could you suggest the programming language you like most I think this is not going to be a surprise to anyone I'm gonna say JavaScript so yeah it did I guess if your question is simply what do you like the most then I would say JavaScript although I did enjoy Python when I did some stuff in Python just because of like all the indentation and stuff it was really easy to do and you could actually program with Python on a phone it was easy with the phone keyboard normally programming on a phone keyboard is ridiculous because you know all the brackets and everything that you need take forever to get to someone should make an app that's a phone keyboard for programmers and you could have custom keyboards depending on the language that you're using that would be awesome I would like that app I mean I don't really plan on programming that much on my phone if ever but if they're a really good keyboard that made it easy I would definitely like that because I'm sure there's some keys that you could just do without because you don't use it that often and you could replace it with brackets something that you use for anyway or maybe an app that's like an editor a mobile editor so not only does it have the keyboard but it also has all the features that you would have been like a code editor the autocomplete and things like that anyway if anybody wants to work on that project if you open it up and make a repo on github all I'll try to contribute to it okay Noam says thanks for the suggestion not thanking me this was earlier thanking Rohan for the suggestion of Rowan actually suggesting Python as well this is actually most people using Python tend to machine learning or data science my favorite is creating apps actually so nam if you're interested in creating apps you could try to go with one of like the native app languages so for iOS I think it's it's Swift right and then for Android it's Java but now you can use Kotlin which I don't know anything about Kotlin but I'm pretty sure you can use it to make apps on Android so if you wanted something else to make apps with you could make apps with JavaScript using react native so I guess it depends on which what you want to do the good thing about doing it with JavaScript is that it would let you more easily make apps for iOS and Android if you just focus on on one or the other then it would probably be a little bit harder to switch that's my assumption I don't really know cuz I haven't done it but anyway that would be my advice either JavaScript with react native or one of the native languages for iOS or Android well I didn't see this so I I definitely didn't see this so sorry if you're doing here but it's free code camp said how much longer you'll be streaming so I'm assuming that was someone else logged in as free code camp while I'm streaming he said that I didn't even know you you could do that but if you're still watching I want to wrap this up by 4 o'clock all right so I'm gonna skip through it looks like there's a lot of discussion about helping Blake with his I guess there's portfolio project so I'm gonna skip through a bunch of that how I bill said drinking some G fuel thanks Jesse for bringing this into my life cool I'm glad she liked the G fuel so ahead I had mentioned before that I I drink e fuel and so bill had asked me about it and I directed him to the the chief fuel site so yeah I liked it and I guess bill likes it so I need to get like some affiliate programs set up so I can get I can get you all a discount if you use my code or something like that I think I need a lot more people watching me before I would they would want me to be an affiliate okay almost to the bottom of the live chat Jordan has any good videos on git and Sarah said Udacity has some good visit yeah actually I really like the Udacity course on git that was really good I I'm pretty sure learn Codecademy that that's the YouTube channel learn code Academy has some videos on git there's videos on get on for free code camp so on this channel yeah so between those you can get a pretty good idea about how to use git okay in regard to the JavaScript debugging question from a few minutes ago jordan says Firebug works as well and David says Visual Studio code has builtin JavaScript debugging that can be used in the editor which is nice so that's cool I didn't didn't realize that so those are some other options John Hanson has a question is it better to jslint for es6 and JSX in the build or in the atom editor it's probably you could probably do both if you if you want to know was better probably probably both and then that way having it done in the build or on commit would enforce it for other people working on the project but then you would have immediate feedback of how it's supposed to look in your browser or in your editor if you had the editor plugin so I would say if you're only gonna do one I think doing it on on commit or on build is the best if you can only have one but if you can have both and that would be better services that Firefox development browser is pretty good now it looks like David gave Jordan pretty much the same answer in terms of both that are better to have in terms of linting es6 and Rohan said it as well so I sit a read down farther I'm good John said thanks for the answer you're welcome I have Sebastian asked if I fixed the issue with the theme no that definitely didn't fix it so there's a there is a branch now on github that has the mess that I made on it so if anybody really wants to check it out you can but otherwise I think I'm just gonna leave it alone for now and just continue developing with what we had before that actually works on the master branch so all right well I've gotten through everything in the live chat if I miss your question just send it to me on Twitter put it in the comments below thanks so much everyone for all the help really sorry I didn't we didn't actually accomplish anything so it's a lot better I think when we get something accomplished because like we can feel good about that but we did work through a lot of stuff even though it didn't end you know finally and you know us solving the big issues but anyway it was cool we got to dig into a lot of a lot a lot of the node modules and you know a lot of the code base for material UI the beta version so that was kind of cool to see how it all work so maybe it was useful a bit and got to do some stuff with get that I'd never done before so not bad and it was good hanging out with all of you and talking with all the years so I will be back tomorrow should be at the normal time 2 p.m. Eastern time and have a great day I'll see y'all tomorrow
