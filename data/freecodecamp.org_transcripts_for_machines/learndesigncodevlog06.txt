this week i've been practicing more my design muscles my do it's monday 7pm i've just gathered five brownie points and i'm missing six to my 500 browning challenge majority day of today was preoccupied with my design project that i have just started from learning and my challenges i took part in helping people on guitar and i'm going running right now using the rest of sun from today it's tuesday and the second day i have been working on the design of the new project the biggest problem that i face is a lack of selfconfidence so i'm learning right now how to how to sell the the projects i do the designs i do and also how to believe in in you know in yourself it's a bit hard especially when you cannot show the projects to you know all over the world because they are not your projects and sometimes you have to keep them for yourself and for your clients only believing that you are good at what you do pretty hard because you know that you always can be better i'm trying to build my selfconfidence the work that we are doing as designers or developers is just you know some person of the final product and the rest is selling and telling the story about it and explain why we chose this way not the other way so you have to rely on what you think before you deliver to the client and later you can iterate over it ladies and gentlemen it's wednesday and i'm missing one brownie point to my 500 brownie challenge so it's pretty exciting yeah i i made it i got a 500 brownie points during these three days i gathered the missing points and i just completed my challenge my challenge was to reach 500 brownie points before going to the next level that in my case is data visualization certification my last brownie point was gathered well in javascript room so help javascript maybe it's a sign to start being more present than myself down down it's friday yesterday in the evening i set my brackets to work in sas brackets has nice extensions and you can write themselves and later you'll get uh your assassin's css that's great because the code editor makes majority of stuff for me it's enough to set the json file and remember about it in each project you use sauce i have less and less time right now for my company that's cooking so i prefer myself a whack good coffee and a treat it's dark chocolate with fruit let's get back to work i have to finish right now the empty states and the design that i'm working on and i will also have to connect uh the the screens into prototype majority of this week i spend an experience design and just a little bit of time in the code editor that's the week mostly devoted to design because i'm working on a new project i got another graphic designer i learned at the same time code so how to implement my solutions and design so knowing at least a bit of ux always helps somebody asked in the comments how i do the projects from scratch i start with designs what i mean by starting with designs is starting firstly with the users and the goal so analyzing who is it for and how this product that will be designed and implemented in code how does it solve their problems you have to put yourself as if in user's shoes and think what would i want to do right now where would i like to go from this point to the other one what would be the other point what i'm what am i looking for in this particular page user journeys and imagining like from which screen would i go to which one it's really important not to forget about something when i do the designs forum for my projects very often as i showed in some of the videos i finished at something like that which is a kind of uh of sketch right the truth is that if i implement it and it's my side project and it's really small project like kind of website or small app i didn't need high fidelity prototypes because i was also implementing it but when i do it for the clients i go to the tools such as experience design or protio i will provide all of the links in the video description below so there are various ways of learning ux by chance one of them is following the twitter accounts and you know just only looking at what's uh what's interesting for you uh there are awesome um there are some places uh and people to follow our organizations one of them is neil's norman group they published a great report very interesting ones great resource for those who are interested is also luke vublavsky and he's really really great guy on when it comes to giving the talks and being a user advocate at his side you will find a lot of awesome articles presentations and you will also find a lot of great talks that he gave and at youtube so you can look at youtube another great source of ux knowledge is for example medium so i follow for example ux planet and there are great articles i love especially those written by this guy so nick is really great when it comes to examples and providing meaningful explanations at ux panel that is another type 2 you'll find a lot a lot of free ebooks and um this is also knowledge that is like as if compensated in one place blister part um another very famous uh place to look for great articles i know that there are some developers who say i'm a developer i'm not a designer so i don't you know give a about this stuff about design because it's not my thing and in that team there will be people responsible for ui and you know i will not have to do it uh i'm not the kind of person like that so i want to also get to know um some at least basics from the design and the usability and accessibility stuff you don't have to be experienced designer you don't have to be a graphic designer but you can make your projects stand out by knowing these few simple rules start with a user and their goals so start with the audience and who will be really using this product take care about visual hierarchy make sure your text your content is readable make sure that something that needs needs to stand out stands out provide just in time feedback try to make your navigation intuitive and call to actions at the right place in the right moment i also focus on being consistent so if i use for example the action color that is like mint green i will always use this main thing for the action provide just in time information so do not provide long tutorials before the user even starts using the product make users feel secure and sure so explain what's needed and do not require too much another pretty crucial thing is to make it responsive so start mobile first it will be easier for you to design uh the project for your desktop version because on mobile you have less screen and as a result if you have suddenly more of the screen it would be easier to fit to fit the elements in test test test so test with users tests on various devices test in various browsers remember about empty states so the situation when a user uh comes into your app for the first time and you know there's no data provided if you want to improve your projects and besides learning to code you also want to get to know at least a bit about user experience design i recommend to start with this book that is don't make me think and generate this offer because uh it's really a great book when it comes to the basics of the basics this week i was mostly working on the clients project and it was a design project so i was uh practicing my skills and experience design this week i have also reached another milestone that is 500 brownie points in the freakout camp community and this way i opened myself the way to the next challenges there i also prepared brackets for working with sas and i created the wrapper for the new project the biggest problem of this week was selfconfidence next week i will be implementing finally implementing my um about portfolio page and i will be using flexbox sas keep on doing learn at least a bit about design especially user experience design and see you next week you
