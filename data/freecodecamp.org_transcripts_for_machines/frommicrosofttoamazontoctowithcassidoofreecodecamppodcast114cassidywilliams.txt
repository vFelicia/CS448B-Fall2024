welcome back to the free Cod Camp podcast each week we talk with developers entrepreneurs and ambitious people who are getting into Tech this week I'm joined by Cassidy Williams AKA cassid do Hello thank you for having me yeah we're thrilled to have you here cassid where does that name come from that's your handle on Twitter and Tik Tok and all the things uh it came from my mom actually she would say like how do you do cassad do and I picked it as a username in college and it just kind of stuck everywhere awesome awesome yeah and everywhere indeed that's one of the things I want to just start off by talking about like how you are ubiquities I can't really even think of any developers who are on more platforms and and like putting out more stuff than you so just some quick background on Cassidy she's been a developer for more than a decade she's worked at tons of big companies she's worked at lots of small companies as well she's currently the CTO of a tech startup uh so yeah let's talk about all these places you are so you I guess my first exposure to you was maybe like four or five years ago like watching the short kind of Tik Tok videos and hearing about this developer who was like Making Waves on Tik Tok on the talk right I don't use Tik Tok myself uh I watch Like These two or three hour long video essays on YouTube and stuff but uh certainly a lot of people were sharing it and it was also making its way onto Twitter and like Reddit and places like that that I would normally see it so maybe you can talk about like content creation and like how you became so prolific with your crazy you know Dad joke humor my memes yeah your memes yeah yeah and so I feel like I always made memes but Tik Tok just made it easier to make more um where I I even loved making videos a ton just when I was young but video editing takes time uh as you probably know and so I I kind of stopped but it was always like a fun thing that I did um and then yeah when I when I got Tic Tac I was like wow this editor is so easy and I just started recording silly ones that I had ideas for back in I think it was like mid 2019 when I started and things kind of exploded from there I never intended to be a content creator it was just kind of me joking around about the state of development and went from there yeah so maybe talking a little bit about content Creation in general like what are some of the cassid do memes that people may have seen like the the short videos like is there one that it just like completely blew up that you were like wow like I had no idea this many people would appreciate this developer humor yeah I think this was like the second or third one I made where it was me singing the song Impossible from a Cinderella movie where it's just someone repeating impossible a bunch of times and it's when your code works on the first try and it was just a bunch of people going like impossible impossible and it just keeps repeating it and it's true because you should always be suspicious if your code just works on the first try it's also you're also like o I'm a genius but also I'm probably not what's going on um so I think that one related a lot and then I also uh I do a Halloween Tik Tok every year where I admit I don't make as many as I do as I did before because I just have less time but I still always do one on Halloween where I do a CSS trick and I hide the word boo somewhere in the Tik Tok at some point and uh as you do the CSS trick the word boo appears and I scream at the end that that one I feel like a lot of people they're just like I look forward to this one every year because I can't figure out what it is until I see it and so that one's pretty fun too yeah interesting so you kind of like recurring uh themes and Rec even like recurring kind of inside jokes from the cassid C Universe yeah there there's some where I definitely it's like such a specific joke where I'm just like hm there's maybe 10 people in the world who will actually get this joke but it's funny to me so I'm going to do it anyway where like one of them was very specifically a reference to the Dream Girls Musical and then if you know that Musical and the lyrics that I am singing in there and you know react and how the use effect hook works it's a really funny joke and it like combines the two of them but yeah there the people who got it they're like oh my gosh this is so specific but this is hilarious and then everyone else is like good job you know that the definitely a lot of them are Hit or Miss but it's it's fun to just kind of laugh at a very serious industry sometimes like as a very amateurish dad joke and I only do it among family you're not going to see me trying to crack dad jokes generally in like the free C Camp newsletter or on the free C Camp podcast or right anywhere where you get your weekly do Quincy Larson right um I am very scared of just like getting the Crickets effect because I was like too many references deep and like at what point does a joke become too esoteric and you're like I really don't have confidence that this is going to land with even like one out of every 10 people that like do you have like some heuristics that you use when I just make the joke anyway cuz if I'm laughing at it I know that I can have a good time and and like there there's some specific people who like my husband or my sister or something they will all they will always be just like oh my gosh that was dumb but I know exactly what you're referencing and so like I I I've got a few people in in my back pocket where I can be like you'll laugh at this and then most people where they're just like no Cassidy I'm okay with that I just kind of make the joke anyway yeah so to some extent like you can be your own barometer of relevance and trust that your life is experience is overlapped with enough other people that like you know you've got some audience out there that is going to appreciate it and sometimes like the most geeky if I can use that term like of humor it brings people together who feel like I thought I was the only one who was interested in Doctor Who and right or who had this experience or something like that yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly or like greatest showman in typescript or something like that like yeah you you never know who it might work for and at the same time if anything future me will laugh at the joke and so I I make the joke anyway awesome yeah that's a great Philosophy for being is just like I have faith that other people are going to be similar enough to me in some specific way that like it'll it'll work out I want to talk so I mean there's so many things we can talk about because there's just so many interesting Dimensions to you uh but one thing that is really interesting is just the extent to which you put yourself out there there are plenty of people who got a CS degree a computer science degree from like a good Public University here in the US and got good jobs at developers maybe got an uh internship in Microsoft right those coveted internships in big Tech that you got as a university student and they're just like cool I'm set I can write my own ticket I can get on the train and just enjoy my hobbies and work you know a reasonable amount of work and you know eventually retire and I can just be a professional Dev like I I suspect a lot of people go into like Fields like Dentistry or medicine or maybe even law just because they are remunerative stable careers where people are always going to have cavities you know like dentist are not going to go yeah yeah they'll always have teeth maybe they won't always have cavities but get the nanites in there cleaning the teeth for us but um a lot of people choose CS precisely because it's a stable income if they're like a first generation American or second generation and and they've got a lot of family to take care of like yeah uh for example a significant chunk of the Indian economy historically has been doctors Engineers people that are living in the United States who are making a lot of money and then remitting a lot of that back to their families their extended families I'm married to an immigrant so that's very real yeah I am too uh my wife uh uh she actually immigrated after we met in graduate school and we got married uh almost 20 years ago and then we moved back to the us and we went through the lengthy Green Card process and then the naturalization process she's a US citizen today uh but but yeah like I could totally understand if you're coming from that perspective of you didn't grow up you know middle class in like New York City or Los Angeles or something and you don't really have a lot to fall back on just getting a safe career like frankly being a developer is basically the safest career you can get in this sense that like I always like to say the Act of automating things is the last thing that will be completely automated and software Engineers are doing the automation so by definition like they'll be that's the last job that will ever exist probably right um but you have not rested on your laurels and you have not just checked out and just focused on you know living the good life and and making a lot of money as a developer and having cool creative you know selfactualizing work you've gone out there and you know put your reputation and like all this stuff on the line by attempting to make funny jokes on the internet where people might be mean to you right yeah what what drove you to do that so it wasn't so much me just being like I'm going to be funny and who cares what people say I think it was more just I a lot of the stuff that I do put out there I want to make Tech more accessible in general and so like I have a Weekly Newsletter and every single week I share like weekly links and a practice coding question and with the jokes I want Tech to not be as scary because honestly it's a very very serious industry that like you deal with certain bugs and you might think I'm the only one who's dealt with this and you're not like whe whether it's the paranoia of your manager calling you into a meeting or just your code not working on the first try or you suddenly saying like oh I I'll never be interested in some language and then you try it you're like wait I am it's amazing and and there there there's so many different things where uh I think especially in the pandemic so many people were very very isolated and uh a lot of the work that I've done it started pre pandemic but continued and and I went a bit harder on it to try to provide resources to people that I wish I had when I was learning yeah so that that's a big idus is like I want to make sure people have resources that I wish I had when I was learning yeah I mean it's very similar to free obviously like I learned code you can probably relate yeah um so was that the main reason is just like because a lot of the things you're doing like you're putting out learning resources and you know I would consider you an educator even though it sounds like you're mainly like an I mean you're I guess uh you worked in developer myself as an educator too so yeah yeah so I guess what were your roots in wanting to do that of course you start with this abstract goal I want to make it easier for people who are going through a journey similar to my own what what were the early days of content creation Cassidy like yeah content creation Cassidy who is she um I first started let's let me think I guess when I was in college I that's when I started doing things like uh being a TA for people or or a peer mentor for for people when I say ta teacher assistant and kind of just helping other students and stuff and um even earlier than that uh I we're going way back in high school when I was first getting interested in coding and stuff and there was no free code camp or anything like that at that point for me where I was just kind of like blindly trying to code uh and learn things I got involved with an organization called ncwit the national Center for Women and it and they were so helpful not so much to be just like this is how you code but like they got me connected to a lot of people who are so helpful to be just like this is something you should know or or like this is this is a thing that you should talk about or this is a thing that you should remember um just mentors even if it was just a a one hour mentorship session or or just something in passing and I think just being engaged with them from an early age just because I truly randomly saw their website and I was like I should try to apply for a SC um it it kind of just snowballed from there where uh one of the mentors that I had said lift as you climb where just as you move up in the industry you should try to lift other others up with you um and because as you move up in your role or somewhere there's going to be someone filling in the space behind you at all times and and it just benefits everyone over time um and yeah I think that was just something that hit me hard early and I kind of just rolled with it where after being super involved in high school and in college with NC Wht and I still am to this day not as much as I used to be but I do like resume workshops with them and stuff um it it just kind of snowballed where I was like oh well now that I'm in college I can give talks to high school students so that way they know like what to major in in college and I wrote blogs for my college to on like what the computer science major is like and then I started to like do aot of networking and meeting with people especially at internships and stuff in college and then from there as I got to see people in the industry before graduating I saw so many people where they were coding but they weren't just coding and I was like you know I like the idea of coding but not just coding and seeing what that could be and that led me to start doing Dev advocacy and stuff and the again it kind of just snowball where from there I was just like okay I'll go to hackathons and be a mentor okay and then from there I'll speak at conference and maybe teach some people things and then I started teaching online classes and I first started my newsletter because I thought oh I could teach people on the side of my online classes promote my online classes but then also help people out and so it just kind of kept growing over time where it it started with people helping me and then me realizing I should help others as well wow yeah it it sounds like you had uh a lot of people that were very inspiring to you and that you got hooked up early on with people who were kind of in your corner and could relate to a lot of the challenges you were facing and uh that I love what you said like lift as you climb that's such an amazing like I mean makes sense from like a rock climbing thing like you might have two people that are tethered together and like so you you climb up and and they're there to like help you in case you fall like they're provide some security because they're also connected to the wall and stuff I mean I've never G there's so many people where they probably don't realize the impact that they had on me where it was just like one person was an upper classman just at my school where where she was just helpful enough I was just like okay I'm going to listen to what she said and and the sometimes you never know like what small pieces of advice will hit and then carry you on and and that uh that kind of stuff I want to be able to provide advice that I wish I had um to as many people as I can yeah yeah and it sounds like you're reaching a lot of people just to put things in context like the degree of impact you're having uh not just as a developer not just as a CTO developer Advocate but creating courses teaching people how to code um you've got a ton of people of course watching your Tik Tok videos and by extension you know the videos are cross posted on Twitter I often see them like like you've got the pinned C locks oh yeah I encourage everybody to check out the the link to Cassidy's Twitter uh Cassidy's Twitter in the uh in the show notes because uh just checking out that one it's just you play all these different characters and and that's one of the things I don't know if that's like a Tik Tok thing but it'll be like one person playing like all these different roles and uh maybe they're wearing uh like a hat in one or they're wearing many wigs I I I think wigs are so fun and so I'm just like this is a good opportunity to just have a different hat yeah I mean it's it's like a campy way of so economizing like because you don't need to get more people involved you can really DIY it you can literally be this sole writer producer director actress like actor all all those different things in the show and you don't need really anybody's permission to do anything and then you just have like the editing tools you make it and then you you Syndicate it across all these different things of course you've got your newsletter that I'll like I enjoyed reading some of the back issues of it always includes a joke it's worth signing up just for the joke definitely just read it to scroll to the joke yeah yeah I mean at least they're reading it and getting some uh benefit from it yeah yeah hey if anything what's fun is I I used to only do Tech jokes or or like most of them would be Tech jokes but then a bunch of people started saying like thank you so much for these jokes I read it to my grandma every week and I'm just like oh my gosh I'm going to do non Tech jokes so you can read more to your grandma but uh yeah the jokes are great yeah uh like free C Camp my email every week includes a quote of the week and and recently of course I quoted one of your quotes about like some joke you made about get and uh it it was something about like I don't want to misquote it do you remember I honestly I literally wrote a blog post about get like a half hour before this recording so it could be anything yeah there are lots of like uh puns that you can make around get especially because I I think like there's so many weird mixed analogies in get and so many of the commands it's like like how did you go like get blamed that was a real head scratcher like such a rude way blame someone yeah I I saw someone made like an alias where it was get props and it's the same thing as blame it just makes you feel a little better about it yeah the toxicity of tech is built right into the tools themselves blaming people though um yeah I uh so you also stream on Twitch and I'd be curious to learn I haven't actually watched any of your streams yet I'm hoping to catch them like I don't spend a lot I watch vods on um YouTube that people upload video on demand so I never watch I watch everything on YouTube like double speed it twitch it's just like onx is too slow for me like no offense if anybody here is like finding this conversation dragging a little bit just go and bump the speed a little bit and I promise it's like way more everything is more interesting at 2x um and I do that for all my podcasts like basically every piece of content my wife won't even watch movies with me anymore CU I double speed them um oh gosh movies too sometimes you know it depends on like if it's like you know like a a late night kind of like guilty pleasure like watch of some 8s or a really really really slow movies where it's like we're walking across the sand Blade the new Blade Runner one was slow as heck um it was a good movie but it was slow like man AB some respectful people's time I'm sure like all the the you know filmmakers in the audience are like crying don't you yeah but anyway I do stream yeah talk about that yeah so I and I admit I've slowed down a little bit because I had a baby and it's not as easy to live stream weekly but I've been trying to get back to my regular weekly Cadence of streaming and it kind of started where once again I I thought it might be useful to teach people something and then kind of talk about it and so typically what I would do when I first started streaming um myself I had streamed before like with my sister and stuff Tech things but um I I would talk for like a half hour to an hour about like whatever questions people had jobwise or or technical questions opinions about the latest hot new JavaScript library or something like that and then after that I'd go into some project that was like recurring weekly and everything and I admit I leaned more towards the first part because people were so they had so many questions um for a while until a lot of my stream ended up being mostly just like a Q&A session seeing what like what questions can answer for people or just hang out and cowork um but then yeah some other ones where it's I'll be like I really want to work on this library today so I'm just going to code and I'll check out the chat and see if yall have questions from there but yeah it's it's a very casual stream I I admit I should probably be more like consistent about it there have been times where I'm just like I'm not streaming this week because I have a really good sandwich here's a picture of it see you next week and so like it really just varies from from week to week but uh yeah it's it's fun to just kind of chat with people in the community especially once again it's a very remote World um especially uh post pandemic we're still kind of in it eh um and and being able to interact with people in the community yeah yeah so being out there especially like real time communicating with chat and uh as you're on stream like doing Q&A sessions or just live coding and answering people's questions as they fire them in uh I did stream for like a couple years years uh while I was building a lot of the early versions of free Cod camp but it just um I got some the same question so many times over and over I'm like I'm just going to write articles and writing articles like I I got a lot more I guess help helped a lot of people more a lot definitely I I have like an ask me anything repo on GitHub you can go to cast. run um I I have like an ask me anything repo where it's like frequently asked questions and then also yeah if I get a question repeatedly I'm just like okay I'll write a blog and then I can just kind of link it to people so I don't have to keep me saying it what questions do people ask I'm just curious like what would be the most asked question about you that is not specific to like how do I get you know fix get detached head or something but like not a technical question but just a question about you in general yeah um I should pull up my repo but uh let's see people often ask like startups versus big companies people often ask like should I get a computer science degree um they often ask what mechanical keyboard should I buy yeah uh what's it like being a woman in Tech uh should I write a cover letter for my job okay so practical uh you know yeah so so some some of them are practical some are very specific to my experience okay cool well we are going to talk about several of those things that just mention I can just link to this episode yeah mechanical keyboards something that you're interested in uh something that I I happen to have a mechanical keyboard I just use it when I'm on a PC and when um but I I have these little remote Mac ones like this because they're Compact and yeah chick you're like ah Sak blue no like like what is your interest in and how did they come about in mechanical keyboards it really just spiraled where I it started with me just wanting a pretty keyboard where I was just like my desk should be cuter and I always have just like a really boring looking keyboard and then I realized you could customize keyboards and then I just kind of took a nose dive deep into the entire keyboard Community where um there was a point I I lived in New York for several years and then moved to Seattle and I remember one of my coworkers that I was speaking to in New York right before moving he had the coolest keyboard and I just started asking questions like okay you 3D printed that and what switches are these what does this mean and so I just asked him a bunch of questions and then moving to Seattle Seattle is a hobbyist city I've said it before and I will always say this people are so into their hobbies in Seattle where and anything that you could be interested in you will find people interested in that where it's I admit it's kind of hard to make friends outside of of just the hobby but the hobby itself huge and so when I got to Seattle I just went in deep where I ended up being like on the board for nonprofit that taught kids Electronics via soldering mechanical keyboards and reran the Seattle mechanical keyboard Meetup that had like 3 to 400 people bringing their keyboards and that's a lot of people for a keyboard meet up my goodness like it was amazing and and like we had talks on like manufacturing and on stenography and and and so many cool things and and yeah I just kind of got really really deep and then I started designing keycaps because keyboards are expensive and I was just like if I design keycaps maybe I could get some free key caps so I'm not spending too much money that did not help me but hey some some of the key casts behind me I designed those ones I designed those ones I like it it just kind of became a fun thing where I just got really involved with this community that likes making things pretty and functional it's it's reminds me of just like Legos but with more electronics and it's very fun yeah I suppose as a developer you're kind of a crafts person and your tools of the trade your keybo right like that's that's how you kind of interface with the machine is uh and typing keyboards are never going to go out of style because you can type so efficiently and I love typing like whenever I need to think I open up a text editor I just start typing and and that's kind of like I use the pages kind of like an external brain for organizing my ideas I love typing uh what is it about typing and like keyboards that just you think get so many people to care about the kind of tool that they're using because you said it you had 400 people in Seattle by the way I'm interested like this is the first time I've ever heard the notion of Seattle is a developer or like I'm sorry like a hobbyist city do you think that has something to do with like all the rain and people staying indoors more yes I 100% that that's exactly what it is I think people are just like well we can't go outside because it's so rainy I guess we're going to get really into this one specific thing I and and there might be some seattleites who disagree but I'm going based on a lot of experience and what I saw um and yeah anyway typing is just it's something that you do it's something fun and also I'm going to shill my startup a little bit to talk about thinking out things but anyway uh yeah when I type on a mechanical keyboard and depending on the different switches all of my keyboards have different switches and different feels and stuff it's it's just kind of fun because it feels different depending on the keyboard that you use and some keyboards make you feel more productive some some are more loud some are more quiet I'm using a quiet one now because whenever I do recordings I have a silenced keyboard because I don't want to be clack clack clack that kind of stuff and so it's it's just kind of fun to have different options and different feels as as you type and and some keyboards I genuinely just type faster on and so I can type at the speed of thought kind of like what you're were saying yeah I when it comes to just like whistling while you work kind of like you're you're going to spend so much time typing like I don't know how do you have any idea like how many key strokes you make on your average day have you ever tried tracking that or anything like that I haven't I should but there's a lot yeah I I imagine you're just constantly typing and like that little tactile feedback it's just like people get really into their cars and like like having the the feel of the car against like exactly how much it slides how it feels when you're accelerating or when you're Switching gears and stuff like I can imagine like developers get the same thing cuz you're kind of doing a lot of those cheaper than a car yeah yeah well how much would like a like a middling mechanical keyboard like a starter mechanical keyboard start you can start relatively cheap I I actually just helped a friend buy one who has never gotten a keyboard before and and I think it was like $40 and and it was it's a nice keyboard like that's going to last for a long time um it they get pricey I I've I've typed on keyboards like at these meetups where it's like oh this is a $3,000 keyboard you type it you're just like oh that's why this is nice but I don't $3,000 keyboard I don't I don't need to go that far but I get it yeah so if money is No Object and you want to have like the best feel then yeah people people spend a lot of money on their Hobbies right I I think that's a reasonable use of of funds uh so let's talk a little bit about uh your startup because you mentioned that you're you know you're CTO and you it's you have uh wall jump many times from company to company over the years and you're like really high up now you're basically it's the Pinnacle as a developer unless you want to go find your own company uh the the pinnac and a lot of Founders are CTO as well maybe you could talk a little bit about that and ideation and and just getting your thoughts down on paper yeah cont contenda is that what it's called contenda yeah but uh we we're in a pivoting stage so we're building an app called brain story and we're uh speaking getting ideas down on paper that's what brain story does so sh'll Break um what we do at uh on brain story is you just talk to your browser about an idea you have and it could be you could be brainstorming like a whole new side project a blog post a conference talk you could just be wanting to talk out while you want to prep for a podcast or a meeting and as you talk it helps guide you uh as you as you speak where I could I could say to brain I'll be just like okay I know I want to build this feature in a side project but I don't know what the UI should look like it just asks me questions like okay well what's the most important thing about this UI and it so it it uses AI but it's not generative AI it just talks back to you and forces you to talk and then as you talk out your ideas Eureka you get answers and so I use it to write and speak and do a lot of things so what you're telling me is I'm spending all this time prompting AI but AI could be prompting me exactly yes and and and yeah and and I think that's the main differentiator and that's why we're we're trying to gear it more towards like students and nontechnical people because a lot of developers will be just like well I could just build this with GPT I'm just like kind of but it's once again you're not prompting the computer the computer's prompting you to speak it's it's we call it iterative AI instead of generative AI yeah um but anyway startup things I uh I've been with contenda for a long time for for about three years but I actually started as an adviser for them um and we can get into advisory things in a bit but um my CEO she was a part of my patreon group which I have a patreon where I can help people like with resume reviews and have a Discord group and stuff so just to give people some context like maybe they would subscribe and like pay you you know $1 a month and then if they're at the higher tier maybe they get like a a oneonone call with you every month or something like that and yeah and so like cheapest one is literally the lowest tier that patreon will give me and it's $2 a month and that just gives you access to the Discord and having that little pay wall is really good for keeping spammers out and so that that's that's that one but then yeah if you do $15 a month I'll review your resume and so we'll all the community to like give you tips and then there's like an interview prep one where like I'll get on oneonone calls with you for as long as you do it to help interview prep with you um so anyway that's that's what that is and so anyway my CE she was a part of this patreon and she was just playing video games and kind of chilling in the group and she noticed that I was mailing stickers to everybody in the group by hand which took a lot of time and um she said hey if I build something that helps you mail stickers to people would you use it and I said yes cuz I'm getting a hand cramp from writing envelopes um and so she built a tool that we now call contenna which which mailed stickers to people and it did so well it actually helped lewig on Twitch break the world record for the most number of subscribers um which was cool but stickers don't really like Venture scale and so it she I I was an adviser at that point trying to like give tips as she was kind of working on this and then uh she had founding Engineers to help out and they ended up building tools for like helping you retain subscribers as a Creator and then eventually before the gpts came out it was transforming content where you could say like turn this podcast into a Blog post or turn these videos into tweets or something um and then the gpts came out and all of a sudden everybody knew about Ai and so there's so many pivots in there to try to be just like here's how we're different here's how you could do this but um because Chad gbt and all these tools came out the differentiating factors were getting Slimmer and Slimmer and so we were pivoting more and more again um and we had a developer API and in this time I joined as CTO um and so I I've been I've been full time as CTO for over a year now year and a halfish time isn't real but anyway not after the pandemic yeah seriously though it's it's wild um but anyway we had a developer API with our previous product and we thought oh let's build just like mini apps on top of our Dev API and see what could work and we had built this tool that we designed to help high school students write college essays um where it wouldn't write the essay for them but they could could just talk out like essay questions um and figure out like how they might want to frame their essay and it worked so well we were like wait a minute this could apply to others too and so we we thus brain story was born and it's just helps you talk out your ideas for anything and people have used it to plan D and D campaigns some people use it to like write literal like standup comedy sets um there's a big like contingent of like sports psychology like improving your mindset around certain by just talking it out performance Coes yeah yeah ex which is really just therapy but it's like therapy for professionals yeah exactly uh honestly there there was one user that where we were doing like a user test and she said I think this knows me better than my therapist we're like no this isn't a therapist we don't want that legal burden but uh that's what brain story is and and it's been really fun to work on very cool it is cool like you know just to give context if anyone hasn't heard the term pivot like a lot of times startups early on they everybody's trying to get traction right they trying to get a whole lot of people to you know essentially like use their product or you know better yet give them money so that they can go and they can get more funding and they can expand and you know do all these things that that startups do and uh so a pivot is just generally where you completely change your product or maybe it could be a smaller pivot like instead of doing like something in the same space you you your solution is slightly different you take a different approach AI caus a lot of companies to Pivot over the past few years uh and uh you know it also costs companies like Che that like you know would help people with their uh their homework and stuff uh you don't need to pay for you know answers to test questions and stuff like that so you can cheat on your test if you got like something like uh a foundational llm that can like help you just answer all the questions real quick and like teach you that stuff right so um yeah it's been quite tumultuous uh but I'm glad to hear that you all have been able to actually not only pay it but also incorporate some similar approaches even if you're not using like an llm per se uh I'm not sure do you do you all use llms at all yeah we we do some under the hood we we've done so many things custom where we're like now we're just like dang GPT makes this easy and so there we we uh do have some gupt stuff under the hood but a lot of it we've we've built in housee yeah and just to be like I have a policy like on the podcast I always explain acronyms even though I've said it probably a many times llm large language model uh gp4 being uh probably the most popular large language model so um and spoiler alert we we do have an interview with uh the first developer Advocate uh at open aai uh and she and I are neighbors we were just talking recently we're like so we live less than 10 minutes apart Chicago Connection wow Patrick being the person we're talking about yeah um you've lived in so many cities I know this is like a really bad transition you've lived in so many cities like so you grew up in Chicago then you moved uh to Ohio to go to Ohio say Iowa I always get those four letter O names mixed up Iowa State uh and then while you were there you of course got your CS degree and you've lived in like where what are other major cities of a bunch of cities yeah so so I've lived I yeah moved to Iowa for school and then for my internships I lived in Minneapolis Seattle and then the San Francisco Bay Area um I also lived in Spain for a good chunk of time for studying abroad and loved it that was amazing everybody should study abroad if they have the opportunity it's it's so great and I've gone back to Spain so many times since like it it I've maintained friendships there H it was the best um and then I lived in New York City after graduation for three years three or four years you lived in like every major city except for Dallas pretty much and then and then I lived in I lived in Seattle after that and then in the pandemic moved back to Chicago yeah wow so you you've like hit basically every major city and one of the things that is that really intrigues me about your career this past decade plus that you've been working in Tech is that you've changed jobs a lot and there's conventional wisdom that like oh you get a job and you keep it for at least two years you don't have gaps you don't have uh you know you don't want to have to explain your your job changes to uh some HR person because it's an awkward conversation but um you know did they quietly push you out and then you just resigned and made it look like you Chang jobs or like there's always that suspicion like looming over like why this person keeps changing jobs are they just not a good fit or are they overly careerist and they're just trying to ascend the ladder as quickly as possible like why have you changed job so much and like and what do you think are the stigmas around that and do you think they're warranted yeah yeah I think there are stigmas around it and and for some of them yes like I will say if you see a bunch of people work I I've talked to people I'm just like all of your jobs have been like two months or less that's very short I I try to I try to stay a little bit longer at places and I never go into a job thinking like I'm going to be out of here in a year I I always try to to stay as long as possible but just life happens and I think just as an aside it's really good to do like life audits to be like are you going in the direction where you want to be going um and is your job stopping you from doing that um and so after college I went to venmo and I was a Dev Advocate there it was really fun I I was working on the product itself um I built blocking so if you ever block someone but no that was me um cool and then uh also how does that work you block people they can't send you money anymore or do people send you money like is there a messaging client or something well people would like be annoying people or harassing people by just sending one cent at a time with like annoying payment messages ah people people be annoying but anyway um so loved being at venmo it was a really really cool place to work they were bought out and um them right yeahp right yeah PayPal bought them and and this was before eBay and PayPal split and stuff and and they were actually bought by a company named Brain tree and PayPal bought them we jokingly called it ventry palb because it was venmo brain tree PayPal eBay and then like PayPal and eBay split while I was there chaotic time so a lot of chaos that was completely out of your control and and you just want to like work on product and yeah there's probably all kinds of org changes and like they ended up discontinuing the API and as a Dev Advocate what are you supposed to do if the API is going away like that kind of stuff and so I ended up leaving because like I was talking to fellow coworkers on like the brain tree and PayPal side and they're just like they're not going to be supporting you much longer if you have an opportunity you should probably get out of Dodge and so that's why I ended up leaving um yeah and and I'm so grateful to them they were they were really kind people who I still keep in touch with who were like looking out for me in that regard and um so anyway yeah I left that's not the only time your company that you've been working at has been acquired right like is that happened another time that's yeah so that that's happened that happened again so after venmo I went to a company called clarify they're an AI startup um I think they're series C now they do cool like image recognition things I I loved working there too I actually worked with my sister there for a little bit of time before she went off to Google and um I moved and remote work wasn't as much of a thing then and so I was moving from New York to Seattle and that is what caused me to do that job change where just personal life things and so after that I went to a company called L4 L4 digital which was a creative Agency on Seattle Super loved that too it was also bought out and so that that one was bought out by a a large company based in Argentina called glent and um it was it was cool kind of being involved with them but uh they were very quickly changing a lot of the company culture and everything and and uh it it just it just wasn't the kind of environment that I was really wanting to stick a part of but I but I really enjoyed that job cuz I was an engineering manager there as well as just engineering on a bunch of cool client projects um but yeah eventually I was just like the I think I was there a little more than a year and a half but the large company changes were uh kind of messing with the the culture enough that I decided to go and then I went to Amazon which was a bad choice um for me I'm sure there are people who love their jobs at Amazon and are there for a long time but I knew like two weeks in that they pay very well but at what cost and it was like truly a golden handcuff situation and so I tried to stick it out but there came a point where I was just like the money is not worth it I'm really unhappy here um and so I quit after about seven months at Amazon and then went to Coden which was awesome yeah codepen amazing tool C is such a great tool yeah and I I still talk to those people to this day like literally yesterday um they're they're such a great team and I really loved working on codepen um building out features and stuff and it was just a straight up software engineering role not Dev advocacy or anything but as a result I was kind of missing the dev advocacy stuff um and so I would like still occasionally speak at conferences and and uh do more developer facing things and that was where I started doing the Tik Tock and and just started kind of doing more public things while also working on the product um but they needed they needed someone who's just software engineering who who wasn't doing the dev advocacy stuff and and uh are doing like the public speaking things and we we kind of tried to see if there was a balance there and and honestly there just wasn't there were just like we're so sorry but we can't really support like you going to conferences and stuff we need you to be engineering and um so we parted ways I I I was just like I love you guys but I'm going to go do something for developers because I really like the teaching aspect um and uh yeah the that one was a shame because I I really loved working at codepen I just wanted to be working with developers more and um so then I went and became a fulltime teacher and so I I was teaching at a company called react training fulltime and it was great I was I was traveling a ton and just giving workshops on how to write react better all the time um that is where I started live streaming a bit more on on the react side too it was great um and then the pandemic happened and uh at that I guess that puts a Kash on like a lot of the activity that you would have as a teacher if you're doing like inperson workshops and stuff it did yeah I was I was doing so much iners stuff that like I called 2020 in January I was like this is going to be my year of travel I'm going to do like a last Terra and then I'll stop and so like I went to Austria I went to Boston I went to SF I went to France I went to Ireland I I went to Hawaii I was traveling a ton just in January and February and then in early March I was coming back from Dublin I was going to be home for three days then go to Spain and then shut down and everything started shutting down and digital workshops weren't just simply weren't as much of a thing at that point people probably were less inclined to pay a lot of money companies were probably less inclined to send their employees to something that is just a virtual webinar type thing and so like within two weeks react training had to shut down cuz we just W two weeks well at least I mean kudos to them for rep recognizing the writing on the wall that this was going to be a big thing the biggest thing that's happened in our lifetime probably hopefully the biggest thing that will happen in our lifetime yeah it was it was wild and and it was such a shame too cuz we said at the beginning of March we're like we have so many workshops in March we just have to get through March and then we'll have runway for like two or three years and we couldn't get through March so um anyway that that that is what led me to leave react training because the company shut down and uh then I went to NFI after that and nlii was great I I was doing Dev advocacy on act in xjs there and had a blast and and I did that for for a while um and then after like almost two years I was just starting to burn out a ton because I moved up into management as like a director of Dev experience there and uh it was just it was so much work um but it was like a combination of doing the director work and the individual contributor work um where I was still like coding writing blog posts doing all these things but I was also in meetings like so so many meetings like 11 to 15 meetings a day it was like like 10 minute meetings or like how are you doing no they were not I I like it was it was too much and and the it was the kind of thing where I really loved the product and working on it I just physically couldn't handle it anymore um and so I ended up I ended up leaving because I I was just burning out but I'm to this day I'm still an adviser for them where like I still talk with them regularly and stuff and have a great relationship with them because I do like the product and what they're doing I just was so tired yeah they're they're a cool company and you know I as I always like to tell the tale of me being in hackathons with Matt bman the founder uh and they've been a supporter of Freo Camp early on uh as well and we we have used their tools over the years um so many things to talk about so many things and I I still have two more jobs to go okay go ahead let's continue yeah and so after that I I considered starting my own thing and like took a little break cuz I was like maybe I will maybe I will then I didn't and I ended up going to remote remote.com to uh I was ahead of developer education there and I was going to see like okay what what resources can I provide for remote developers remote grew so fast where when I first started talking with them in like early pandemic days just like friendly they were at like 25 people then when I interviewed it was more like 200 people wow which was quite a big jump but I joined they were at a thousand people they exploded in growth you can't gr that quickly without making a lot of bad hires in my opinion like I just don't I don't believe for a second that an organization can grow that quickly without cracks forming I it was yeah and unfortunately I think I kind of was falling through some of those cracks where like everybody was so kind and and there's such lovely people there which once again still stay in touch with them um but it just grew so fast and and I would be working on something like I I ran like the devs for Ukraine conference to uh help support developers there and people there to raise money and I I was able to do some cool initiatives but so many things I was just like hey this is like the plan for this and people would say Cassidy that's awesome we don't have time for that because it was growing so much um and so anyway I really liked it there but it just it was so much um and then this is where like the personal things came into play I got pregnant and I was just like is this the kind of role that I want to continue doing while I'm pregnant and will I have the flexibility to like be able to take care of my kid and stuff and um that's when I started talking more with contendo where I've been I had been an adviser for them for a year a year and a half for them at that point and um they had been talking to me about how they wanted to find a CTO to fill in some gaps and so as I was talking with them I was like so what if I was that CTO and and uh we kind of talked as a whole team and it just kind of was a very natural fit where I knew everybody really well I had met with them in person a bunch of times and and we we were like friends in addition to colleagues and stuff and yeah it just seemed like the right fit and I've been with them ever since awesome so many different stops your journey uh and uh I'm going to link to your LinkedIn in case anybody wants to to follow you there or like read through I was in I was like you know she's she's younger than I am uh I don't know I'm not going to ask your age but you're like way younger than me and yet youve worked at like 10 times as many places as I am I think it's it's wild like I think there were like 20 plus entries on your like experience so many of it is like advisory roles and like parttime things too but yeah I and it like when I go into the story like that companies never question why I have such a big resume they're just like oh well of of course oh yeah that makes sense like it's it's never me just saying I wanted more money so I left it's it's usually you have good reasons for every single thing and one of the two of the reasons that I do want to drill deeper into one is you know the notion of culture which a lot of people uh who are privileged just like culture doesn't even exist what is that it's like nonsense you know Corp culture always exists yeah what are what you would call cultural indicators uh and and maybe we can back up and we can talk about if you don't mind me just saying your experience in Tech as a woman because women uh I don't like it but women are a minority in Tech I think they depending on like maybe maybe you have like a good estimate of the number of women in Tech or the proportion of women in last stat I saw was 133% 133% yeah and there was like a stack Overflow survey a few years ago where like 6% of the respondents were women or something like that that it was like really low um and of course like I can tell you like fre Co Camp we're very proud that about a third of the people learning on free Camp are women that's not 50% but right but still that's good proportionally compared to a lot of the industry and it's going to be a multigenerational effort to get more women into Tech uh in my humble opinion uh there are lots of cultural things and a lot of economic reasons and a lot of just like systemic you know bias reasons uh but maybe you could talk a little bit about your own kind of like entree into Tech and the first time that you felt like wow I I didn't realize there were so few women in Tech yeah I found out early on that there were not many women in Tech because I took AP Computer Science in high school where I first started coding before that where I was just like oh wait you can make websites and I was really excited to play around with with HTML CSS JavaScript and just kind of was figuring things out and was having a blast doing it and then when I realized that my school was offering AP Computer Science I was like oh I'm going to take that and and it'll be great and literally the first thing that the teacher said in the class on the first day was as you can see we have a girl this year I was like oh and uh yeah that that that was a very rude awakening where it just the that was the theme for a lot of girl this year that's wild yeah that that was my first like group inter action um but that is how I found NC wit which I mentioned earlier where where like and what what is National Center for Women in it I'm going to link to that yeah they're awesome they they have uh awards for high school girls every year and then they also have a Collegiate organization they they're they're a research organization so they put together really good uh research um and informationals that companies can use and stuff they're they're a really great orc but any anyway I first got involved with them because in that class when I would like finish an exercise and had time I would just start like looking up like how do how do I find other girls because I just didn't know where they were um and yeah so that that's how I first got involved with NY wit um because I was looking for a community where I didn't have one yet so you were not content to just accept that like okay everybody I interact with is going to be a dude you very early tried to like build connections with other women at Tech yeah and like I'm okay with I'm okay with hanging out dudes and I kind of have to be because because of the nature of tech and and so many of my college courses there would be like one or two of us or or something just funny story recently I was I was just walking around in Chicago and I saw one of the girls where she was like the other one in my course and we looked at each other like you live in Chicago hi and like we just hadn't seen each each other since college and it was cool to be just where like we were introducing our husbands and we were just like she was the other one we this is great um the bond it's it's forever but uh anyway it it was something where like I knew there had to be something out there and then luckily there was and it's something where in general I think you should have a community no matter the industry to stay in it where people have your back um where like whe whether whether it's a diverse one or not it should be a diverse one but you know like it it's having a community that can check on you and be just like hey how did this thing go I know you were worried about it or hey good luck on your job interview this day or or let's talk through this problem you're having or something Have having that kind of community is so so valuable and I think is particularly pretty hard again in this postpandemic world but again that's why I have like my patreon Discord group we have we are such a great Community where it's just us talking about this is this is what I'm trying to learn right now and uh there's there's so many good ones associated with free code camp and on Twitter and and various places have having those communities is so important and that's that's been something that has been so helpful to me throughout my career yeah and so you've talked a little bit in the past about like kind of cultural indicators that you look for to companies you even tweeted a few days ago I think I was scrolling through your Twitter earlier that you think that companies should offer three different things and if they don't offer at least two of those three things you shouldn't consider them as like a serious opportunity uh maybe do you recall what those three things were yeah and so that that's while you're at the company or while you're interviewing they should have good pay good culture and good growth opportunities yeah two out of three is pretty good all three would be great um but if if you're at a company and you realize oh I only have one out of three or something or or I don't have any of these or or something you might want to question why you're there that doesn't necessarily mean jump ship because having a job is good but yeah if you if you don't question those kinds of things then you will be stuck in a situation that's not serving you well yeah well I would argue that like just from looking at the job application you can probably figure out the compensation if they publicly list that and you you might even be able to surmise like software engineer 2 probably leads to software engineer 3 probably leads to like Engineering Management you know role uh so like assuming it's like a big tech company and that people do gradually rise up the ranks um that is that's basically two of them that you can kind of surmise just from doing a little bit of research but culture is a little bit trickier and how would you establish whether a company has a you know a healthy culture that's like conducive to being able to work and be sane and stuff like that how would you figure that out if you were on the outside and you were looking at a company and considering applying what what are the uh kind of the telltale signs of like potentially toxic culture yeah well so first of all one that I've seen and where I've actually like gone in the other direction is where they say oh we don't really have a culture yet all companies have a culture like if you say that there is no culture that means that there might not be a great culture like like all companies have have some element of culture there um but then I also I'm very curious to sus out how people communicate across an orc um and so I typically one question that I actually ask in job interviews is what's the most important thing the customer the product or the employees and none of those answers are wrong like those are all actually like they're they're all three important but if you were to pick one what what is the most important customer product or employees um and what's interesting about the answers is how people answer them and if that answer is consistent across interviewers where like when I interviewed at Amazon every single person said the customer like it was a very very clear customer Obsession right I customer Obsession that's what they're all about yeah and and so you know that they communicate well on that front and granted the culture wasn't that great when I was at Amazon but it it it was a good indicator of how people communicated and when people answer that question differently then it's interesting to see okay why do you why do they answer it differently how did their answers differ um when they explain it because sometimes the the way they explain it you're just like oh it makes sense why this person would answer this way and this person would answer this way but um again none of those answers are wrong but it's useful to see we're like when I internet into it I I've been doing this for a lot many years now internet into it everybody said oh the employees are number one and and here's why I think it and and it's it's cool to see how people communicate about what their environment is and then one last one that uh that I like to ask is just if you had a magic wand and could change anything about the company what would you change um and seeing people do that where like like it's not necessarily a bad thing but what what is the magic wand that that thing that you would change people's answers there are very good ways to sus out how things are where sometimes people are just like I would get rid of this group in the company where where it's just like I I don't want we have too many product managers or something um sometimes the answer has been I don't like that we're under the fist of capitalism I would probably wish away our VCS or something like that and and you can kind of see what is the thing that drives uh culture or NE anything negative or or something at the company and so anyway those are the questions I answer and it's been pretty helpful for those are great questions um especially like what would you wish away man like when you as that I was like what would I well we're not interviewing me here but one thing I would wish away is the complexity of the US immigration system I would I would love to be able to say to everybody who works at freeo Camp we're going to get you and H1B visa and if you want you can come and live here in the US um so that unfortunately that's yeah I mean you you probably I don't know how much of the immigration system you've had to go through with your husband but it was it's been it's been yeah yeah it's quite complicated to uh to get even like so we have a team member here in the US and sorry I'm not going to like bash the us but I will bash the US immigration system that is one thing that I've I think that's fair it's within my right as a US taxpayer as somebody who works to you know make this country better that I can complain about the immigration system so uh we have a team member who is working she's also working at Salesforce uh she's working parttime at free Co Camp developing some courses and she you know studied in the US she's worked as a software engineer at Salesforce for like four years um actually it may not be four years but she's the four years that she's been here in the US she's applied to the H1B Lottery and she every single time she has not gotten it and this is absolutely the kind of like welleducated like highly compensated like expert that the US yeah and she's going to have to move to Canada if she doesn't win this time like there's like a limit in the number of times and Salesforce actually has like an entire like plan in place for uh employees who can't get an H1B Visa through the lottery uh despite spending you know tens of thousands of dollars and everything to try to get help them get that they have to move up to Vancouver from the San Francisco Bay area and they have to continue working from the Vancouver you know satellite so it's just one of those things it's like why does America shoot itself in the foot with this terrible immigration system but anyway I'm sorry I'll stop venting but but that is my magic that would be a great magic wand I would like to borrow that one that's one of the few things that like me as like a founder and like executive director which is basically the charity equivalent of a of a CEO like that's one thing that I feel completely powerless over uh I can change so much and like like we we work very hard to attract lots of women to work at free C Camp and and as I may have said earlier we're like nearly half women on our team both engineering and instructional and you know we're proud of that and yeah it takes a concertive effort to not only uh encourage women to join your team but to retain them over time because yeah uh it sounds like some of your cultural experiences I mean like when you look at culture like how much of it has come down to like they they do they have systematic bias against women at some of these organizations you worked at I don't want you to have to like Lobby specific lob specific accusations or anything but I left Amazon for a reason like and and luckily like with with some of the organizations sorry there's a big siren coming out outside so no worries we're in Chicago after all and it's a big city like a do you live in the BBS or I live in Chicago proper yeah oh wow yeah it's and it's great I just happen to live somewhat near a fire St so that's why we have some Sirens but anyway um luckily I think in a lot of my jobs it hasn't been too bad relatively speaking like like I I have no room to complain because people close to me have gone through so much worse that being said it exists there there's there's definitely systemic biases and very unkind people in the world who who let those biases the affect their decisions and and the words they say and the things that they do um and yeah when when I I'll just a a brief vignette when I was at Amazon like there was a point where I was for example supposed to run an event for a bunch of uh customers who were building on top of the echo devices I'm not saying her name because she's back there and she'll talk back okay um but anyway I was I was running inent it was a big deal like I was literally reporting certain findings to the s team which is the people who reports Jeff Bezos like it it was a big event and people weren't responding to my emails and I was like you need to submit your talks to me so I can put together this and and like make sure that these technical areas are covered and stuff people just wouldn't respond to me and I remember talking to my manager saying like hey do I need to build some clout here or something to so that way people respond he said oh it's cuz you're a woman we have a problem with that here like cool great well at least he acknowledge that it's a known issue but yeah do something about it what the heck so and like he he replied all to my group email to all of these people saying Hey give Cassidy the info they would say okay hey Dave here's the stuff like within an hour after me him they wouldn't add addressing him not me and like there were that that's like a very brief small minor thing but there was so much more that happened beyond that that like it it just it was miserable and and unfortunately like that was nothing compared to what some of the women on my team were going through there or my own sister was going through there yeah let's talk about your sister a little bit too she's somebody we I mean you've mentioned her a couple times but she followed very closely in your footsteps it sounds like or as you said before we met she followed in her own footsteps tell us a little bit about your sister footsteps yeah yeah and so my sister and I were were pretty close in age and we both majored in computer science that Iowa State um and uh we've worked together multiple times and then all and really diverged because we both like very different environments where um she and I both worked at clarify the startup and then we also both worked at Amazon together and uh I love startups she loves big companies so she she's kind of collected like The Infinity Gauntlet of big companies where she's worked at Apple Microsoft Google Amazon and now meta got to catch them all wow that's that's impressive like the entire Fang basically she's literally all the like she doesn't have Netflix but once she does she's done she she's made it but but yeah so she she must get a lot of recruiters reaching out to her my goodness I can only imagine and I hope I would like to think that her recruit like in recruiting like one of the big things the signal is where they already work because if they're good enough to work there there's a good chance they're good enough to work here like I can imagine she has a very easy time getting jobs if she does have a hard time getting jobs she's also just really good at what she does yeah and so and and it's fun cuz she and I work together really well like it's it's really fun to do things with her like when we were both at clarify we would sometimes give talks together um which was a blast because that people would approach us being like how long did you rehearse that your back and forth was amazing and we were just like we didn't we're related we've been practicing this for decades um and uh yeah and when we both worked at Amazon we did like a live stream for the echo showing people how to how to work with like buttons and stuff together and that was so fun too so we we really enjoy working together but we like very different work environments yeah where uh like my my mom says like I'm like the wild west cowboy and she's the one who's like an English writer where she prefers like a lot of structure big organization all that and I kind of just don't want anybody to bother me as I do what I want to to start that's so interesting that you all have very similar like I would imagine probably pretty similar upbringing both growing up in Chicago both studying at the same school both studying in the same field working at some of the same companies and yet it sounds like personality wise and certainly in terms of preferences for career You're So Different yeah yeah exactly and like there's a lot of similarities don't get me wrong like we both married software engineers and and uh do have a lot of similar hobbies and stuff but yeah she she and I are very different in what we like in terms of what makes us productive and everything and and we both are very interested in Dev advocacy and teaching and helping developers but she approaches from a I have a big company with all of these resources if I can like play the system well enough I can offer this many resources to people and with me I like the scrappy approach where it's just like what can I do to provide these resources to people and and the we we both have varying levels of success with different approaches stuff but it it works well for both of us yeah it sounds like it um I mean you both obviously have these story careers and it's so interesting to see like how you've diverg one thing that I would like to talk about because you talked about productivity and you also alluded earlier to burnout is you are somebody who is like you have a literal baby like I think he said is like nine months old yeah and you also are a CTO and you're also creating all this content pretty reliably uh on like all these different platforms like how do you avoid burnout when you're doing all those things and have you ever gotten close to burnout and since you were getting close and like been able to pull back before you go over the burnout Cliff so to speak and have to like climb your way all the way up the mountain again yeah I've really had to learn how to say no um I think my my two biggest burnout times where um one point at venmo I I was saying yes to everything because I was like if I do a lot of work now while I like am young and have energy it'll be good for me later in very yes but it was terrible for me healthwise where like there was a period where I spoke at an event for 14 days straight like including the weekends in addition to the 9 to5 job I I just I was doing way too much and I just burnt out so hard after that I like ran off to Florida to hang out with my grandpa after that that's wild 14 man how did you like get from event to event was it just like was it all in like the Bay Area or some kind of Cal it was mostly in New York City and then yeah there was there's I think there's a little bit of travel like by train at point I don't even remember all of them because it was a bad choice um anyway so that that was a big one and then um I'm not counting College I kind of burnt out at one point in college it was fine I almost went blind but then I went moved to Spain and I was fine um and then uh the next one was at NFI I was really close to burning out and again that's why I ended up leaving where I still loved that team and everything but I was just I I had to for my health I had to I had to go um and and I think yeah now I see the signs more where I'm just like oo I need to cut back on this or that and and I think a lot of burnout it doesn't come from doing a lot because kind of like you said I I tend to do a lot but it's more doing a lot that isn't aligned with your values yeah and that isn't aligned with what's important to you we like my Weekly Newsletter it's a lot of work because it's weekly and there's there's a lot to do with it and stuff and I manage sponsors and and all of the interview practice question responses and and various content things like that but it's something that's important to me it's something that I ultimately like doing and my like goal of helping developers it works towards that goal and so it it doesn't cause me to burn out um and if I were to do something that is not aligned with what matters to me where it's it's truly just like I know I can do this but it's it's a ton of work I think that's that's what would cause me to burn out more interesting so doing things that are not aligned with your values that don't feel like they're advancing what you care about advancing that seems to be uh a theme but like are there any signs you said that you kind of saw the signs yeah uh of burnout and like what are the signs people should be looking for not caring anymore I feel like I feel like that's probably the biggest the biggest sign red flag thing that you could see where where if you start to be like resigned to this is this is just how it is I just don't care anymore I'm just kind of going through the emotions that's the biggest one for me cuz though I don't think like work should be everything to you I don't think that it should be like the thing that you only care about it it's something that you it's something that you do for so much of your life you should care about it a little bit and uh if you simply just don't care anymore it's it's kind of like the the opposite of Love isn't hate it's indifference it's it's that kind of stuff where where if you if you truly are just I I can tell when I'm starting to get to a burnout point where like if I'm in a meeting or something I'm just like none of this matters I don't know why like like you you kind of just like start to feel that and and I feel like that's for me that's the biggest number one sign more than any like tiredness or or stress things yeah I'm just trying to think of like if you find yourself in that situation where you feel you're just getting more distant from the task at hand you're carrying less about the outcome of different things uh good news resonates less positively with you it doesn't really lay bad news you feel numb what um what can you do to like shake that up like obviously burnout you you finished College despite getting almost going blind you said yeah is there is that a long story or is just like long story short I took way too many courses because I knew I was going to be moving to Spain and I wasn't sleeping I was sleeping on average like between 1 and 3 hours a night at the most and yeah almost went blind don't do that kids like you went to the doctor and they said if you keep doing this you're going to lose your vision like what like how do it wasn't so much if you keep doing this it was one day I couldn't open my eyes and they were like I I remember I went to vacation with my family and I had to wear an eye patch the whole time because like I literally couldn't open one of my eyes anymore and like we were at like a literally like a doctor in a poblo and he was just like something's wrong with your eye like the whites of my eyes were gray and and like they were just my eyes were disintegrating anyway you should sleep that's the that's the conclusion there okay yeah sleep PSA Public Service Announcement please sleep everybody sleep eight hours if you can yeah but but to answer your question though about like what you can do um first of all lean on your community I've said that before I feel like the the first answer that a lot of people might shout is selfcare but if you shout selfcare at someone who could use a community um that that's that's doing a disservice to that person it's it's really important to have people around you who can kind of talk to you and and like kind of kind of give you a reality check and and and be there for you but then also on the selfcare front do things that you like and and just say no to certain things and be just like I need to step back from this or something and build a Lego set go travel and run off to Florida to see your grandpa like do do do something that that is very unrelated to work sometimes for me it's truly just like I'm going to just watch a K drama on Netflix I I I'm gonna do K my mom loves those they're so good but but yeah like like do do something that is like just for you to remind yourself I am a person Beyond this thing that I am not like doing and and sometimes like when I start approaching that moment I just do one of those things and I'm okay like a week later um and if it's something that's more prolonged and heavy that it's much harder to to fight against that but it's now acknowledged in multiple countries now that burnout is a real mental condition that that you need to fight against and you need to try to be proactive in leaning on the people that you care about be around people who care about you and do things that you care about yeah yeah I mean I I like to say that like you can accomplish so much in your life life is so long it's almost ridiculous how long life is and I say this as like a 43y old man who like can't believe that like if everything goes well I've got like a whole another 40 50 years to look forward to uh because it feels like life has been forever especially during the pandemic when time slowed down you can accomplish so much if you just don't burn out and just put forth like a consistent effort over time that's one of the things that really inspires me about you is you have kept going in terms of your newsletter for example you have kept going in terms of streaming in terms of creating these videos like you you you're not the kind of person who seems to get bored of something and just completely starts from fresh and like jumps from one fan flight of fantasy to the next like you're you're incredibly consistent over time and that's how I know that like I'm going to be excited to watch a cuz good things are are coming to you I want to talk about advice for people out there who may not feel that good things are coming to them and may not know how to get in the Rhythm like people that just got a CS degree and are having trouble uh applying for jobs people that are transitioning into Tech having difficulty applying for jobs there's like this kind of miasma in the air like oh Tech is dead like Developer jobs don't go there go go back to like culinary school or what real estate whatever kind of crap advice people are getting in my humble op like I don't want to B like don't go to culinary school I heard from so many chefs that like nobody goes to culinary school but like but yeah like like how do you counter that and how do you reassure people that no this The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow you know it's just a rainy day yeah and that's that's the thing I feel like a lot of new devs or people who haven't been through a few spells of the oh no Tech is dying the they're they're just like oh my gosh Tech really is dying I'm kind of just like it's died before it's but it keeps coming back there like we are in an increasingly digital world and Tech is going nowhere like sure we're going there's like waves of layoffs and stuff happening economies come and go but it's going to come back and you might as well be prepared for when it does and and I already like knock on wood who knows what's going on but uh it feels like it's already coming back uh like jobs wise and stuff I was talking to a friend yesterday where she was saying I don't know if I should quit my job she saw my tweet about like the three things that you should have in a role and she's like I have barely one of these I but like I'm afraid to apply and I said I think things are coming back and she messaged me like two hours later saying oh my gosh there's so many jobs what nobody's talking about how many people are hiring right now everybody's just talking about the layoffs don't listen to the the loud people shouting that the sky is falling like keep an eye out for good opportunities because there are so many uh you just have to know where to look and you also don't have to work at a very traditional tech company you don't have to work for like the microsofts and the apples you could work for a company like General Mills which is where one of my internships were food compan company lots of tasty breakfast cereal oh my gosh I had so many snacks there it was an amazing place to work I loved General Mills um but anyway like if I move to Minneapolis Sunday it's because I want to work there um there there's there's so many companies out there that can offer you good pay work life balance that aren't tech companies um they a good culture good good learning opportunities and and you just have to be willing to look where where one friend of mine uh was so burnt out by the tech industry he was just like I I feel like I need to quit software engineering but I like software engineering but I'm just tired of this environment and and he decided to just look into health and be like well where how can I help like doctors and stuff without actually having to become one and now he works for a health tech company where it's very separate from the shouting on Twitter and and like the the what is the next thing after react type conversations and he loves it where he's able to do these skills that he has but he's working at a company that's not Tech related he's just using his Tech skills and and the stat that I've always heard is like twothirds of Developer jobs are outside of what we traditionally consider Tech General Mills is not a tech company you know I would not argue that the car companies are tech companies or that Finance is Tech you know uh we we had a long conversation about this the other day uh I genuinely believe that uh if you're just looking at the big companies that are just doing these kind of layoffs like um a lot of which is like you know fast follower kind of like hey it's okay to lay people off CU you know this company just did so we're going to do it too right um and and a lot of employers will use like the the economy as an excuse for um just basically trying to have additional bargaining power over job candidates and things like that uh I love what you say don't listen to the loud people shouting that the sky is falling like don't listen to them the future is bright and one of the things that people shout a whole lot is AI is GNA take our gerbs right I mean what are your thoughts yeah it is but um like it's gonna improve but yeah I mean like that is probably the most common question I get uh every week I get dozens of emails I'm not exaggerating because I I send like 7 million emails my email list is really big and uh when people reply they're like hey is any of this even matter like aren't the AI just going to be able to do everything the developer can do and better like uh they have this kind of old John Henry kind of like driving spikes uh thing in their mind but that's not how software works and you know I I don't want to answer the question before I ask it but like what would you say to somebody who feels like they skills are going to be quickly outmoded by Ai and that in the future nobody's going to have a job and stuff like what would you say to them because I think my my pet theory is that it's very easy to procrastinate learning to code because it's such a big ambitious Endeavor and it's it's really good like copium if you will to to just say like well it doesn't matter if I learn to code anyway because the jobs aren't going to be there so therefore my decision to play video games yeah exactly like what do you think yeah Tech isn't good or Tech is going to keep going on and AI is probably not going to take your job AI is a really good tool and I feel like you can use it as such where like I'm sure when someone invented the crane there are a bunch of construction workers saying like oh no what are we going to do this big heavy thing is going to lift a big heavy thing and and I won't lift a big heavy thing now they're just using that tool to help lift the big heavy things kind of like when Alpha go came out uh I play Go daily I love playing go it's like that grid with the black and white pieces and back in like very accurate portrayal in that uh Knives Out movie yeah that was that was so fun I made a Kickstarter for go back in the day and used a clip from it but anyway um it's it's such a fun game this Alpha go bot like beat out so many different players but that doesn't mean that people stop playing go it's it's still such a fun and interesting game and now Alpha go is great at teaching you moves there are some moves that professionals were just like this is the correct move in this scenario for hundreds of years and then alphago changed that for the first time and people were just like wait we just never saw that you can use these tools to unlock different ways of thinking and different ways of being productive where I think like GitHub copilot is a really good example where it is a copilot it's a thing that can help you write things it's not always going to be right you are ultimately in the driver's seat building something but it can help you where like I don't need to write yet another sorting function or I don't need to write yet another hello world react component that I can just add stuff to I can I can do that and you can let it be a tool that you use to get your ideas across and be more productive on things it doesn't have to be this thing that's it's just going to take your job and I don't think it's going to take your job for a while cuz some of the codes where I've been just like oh AI wrote this for me amazing has been so bad or later I'm just like wait why did I listen to the AI llms large language models are very good at predicting what the next word should look like but that doesn't mean it's the right word and they are so bad at math and I use math as an example because math is a very precise thing if you have it do like a demo function for something a lot of the answers are going to be wrong because it's not actually executing code it's not actually doing the logic just does what it thinks the logic should look like and so anyway all that being said yes it's getting better and better but that just means that you can use it to solve more interesting problems 100% agreed use AI as a tool don't use it as an excuse not to learn ma math programming computer science you should still learn these skills and um I hope that you know people will follow you and watch many of your amazing videos maybe even join your patreon community because it sounds like Community is like a big deal in cat City Williams land and the fact that you've had that Community there you've you've helped Yourself by having that community and other people in your community are helping one another um Community selfcare is no substitute for having other people who have your back and having that feeling that you're part of a tribe and you can help other people and they'll help you that General Vibe of reciprocation so I've learned so much from this conversation with you and I'm going to encourage everybody to check out the show notes below where I've included lots of links to interesting stuff about Cassidy uh and I I just want to thank you for your time because you know you're a busy mom CTO you're doing all these things and I feel very grateful that you've taken the time to come on the free code Camp podcast thank you so much for having me it was a really fun time well everybody until next week happy coding bye
