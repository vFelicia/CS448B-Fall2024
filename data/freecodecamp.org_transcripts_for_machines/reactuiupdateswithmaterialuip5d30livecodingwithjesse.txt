everybody welcome to the live coding with Jesse today we're gonna switch things up a little bit from what we've been doing this week and we're gonna get back and do some UI work we'll work a little bit with CSS and with the material UI components so I noticed in yesterday's stream when we were bringing in some of the data we tried to look at the pages and some of the data was hidden because we were pulling in the styles for another page so it occurred to me after the stream that of course we're pulling in those Styles right because we copied and pasted everything from the other page into that new component so we're still importing those same styles so I thought you know the first thing that we ought to do today is go through and maybe strip out the more specific styles and have maybe one style sheet that has some of the more you know basic things that would be Universal you know across all the pages and then I'll test out some of those pages that didn't look right yesterday see if they look all right and we can always make is we can make adjustments for specific cases you know as we see them but so far most of the page have been looking alright so I don't think we'll need to adjust too much I think it's I don't have a live setup yet so let me get this ready alright hey everybody okay all right so I guess we'll get started everything looks good with the stream whatever changes I have made in the OBS settings at the beginning of the week I think that really did the trick we've had no trouble at all with the stream quality so that's that's good there was a while there or I just wasn't sure what it was gonna be like and it's Sneaky's birthday today happy birthday so Nikki or rook from the live chat is it's actually here for the stream for that's really cool that you're watching on your birthday so happy birthday again all right now y'all can see my screen so I was doing some data migration so that's why I'm here in our migrate jas file I'm gonna switch over though and show you let's see I make it a bit bigger for you all let's shrink this down and let's bring up the N grog server because in when we're doing things like this I think and rock is really helpful because I'll probably be looking at my dev tools and so if you can look you know on your screen as well it's a lot nicer alright so I am going to paste this in all right so now that links that link is available and you all can see the same site that I'm looking at that I'm running locally all right now this is our page J s component which we made and it's supposed to be just a component that can be used for a variety of content types so that's all the problem for us of you know we were making new components for every content type and we're starting to get a lot of types and a lot of components so this will save us a lot of time and clean things up it works but you can see here that we are bringing in the news CSS so news dot CSS so let's let's try to create a new CSS page now the reason we're not using something more like styled components or anything is because we're bringing in a large chunk of HTML from our database for now that's the way we have to do it eventually we can do something different with it but right now there's not enough time to get all that data reformatted so we're just bringing in the HTML as is because of that we need to use style sheets right I can't go in and add a class to something in here because the data is coming from here right I don't really know what's gonna be there you know to add a class to so we're just going to do our best to set up styles that are most likely to look good over a variety of types and then hopefully we can test enough pages to catch most of the cases this is a very large site thousands of pages so as long as we cover the pages that are most frequently viewed and I'll probably check the analytics here soon not during the stream but I mean you know within the next week or so just to doublecheck make sure that the pages that get visited the most or where we we spend the most looks like Nikki's getting errors in the console what it's your birthday you shouldn't get errors on it for your birthday let's check this out and see see if I'm getting any errors as well I'm getting some kind of errors let me refresh this and see I'm getting all right so here's what I'm getting in terms of errors I mean I can still see everything oh here we are mmhmm we have have this one that unexpected whoops you know what I've seen errors like that before I can't remember what they were though oh you know it was it just that page let me go back this axis you know it's not Texas vanishing avoiding a connection yeah all right that's odd it must be there must be something going on with what we're bringing in here on this page because it's not happening you know in this page well we'll see we'll give it a minute maybe we'll get it but it mmhmm yeah we are getting it here on this page as well so I'm not really sure what the problem is obviously it's not affecting you know the view of things and we'll just we'll keep an eye on that all right what was I gonna totally have just lost what I was gonna do now I I think I was gonna make a new CSS file I think that's what I was talking about all right so let's see our static folder so within our static folder let's make a new file and we'll name it pick page CSS so if you notice the pattern we're naming our fight our CSS files the same name as the component that they go with and we're doing the same thing with our queries we name our queries our graph QL queries the same name as the component that they go with so it can be a bit confusing when we have pages here like a page a s and a page a s so there are downsides to doing it like that but also there's no confusion about which things go together all right so since we have this component here with nothing in it we need to bring some things in so I'm going to pull in now let me compare here the Faculty CSS and the new CSS hmm I think I'm going to bring in the faculty CSS because it does not have one problematic piece which is the displaynone for their route component so let's try that out first and we'll see how it looks weird my they get closed out my new file here there we are alright I'm going to save that and then in our page das component let's bring in instead of news spring in our page dot CSS file okay so now that saves let's check it out and refresh all right so for this particular page everything looks fine I'd like to go back to that page that was giving us the issues and you know what I'm gonna make this bigger I'm gonna make this 150 it should be a little easier to see 150% of what I set the screen to I have this set to 320 pixels because as far as I know that is the minimum screen width in pixels that that's available right now for a mobile device so we don't have to worry about anything below that which is good because the the menu here just barely fits we may have to make the menu a little bit more narrow but any less than that you wouldn't really be able to shock the menu all right so let me think about all right if I hit back we'll find it because I don't remember exactly what with the page was our mission okay just you know kind of quickly glancing this is looking pretty good I don't see okay you know there's nothing really standing out is this looks awful of course if there happens to be some data that's completely missing here you know because it's hidden or something I won't really know about that let's go back hopefully we have something it's just the film studies minor alright that wasn't the one that didn't work hurry come on alright so I can't remember which one didn't work if anybody remembers which one didn't work let me know in the live chat otherwise I'm gonna try to refresh my memory by looking at our post types her shirt says academics there was a page in academics that didn't work all right let me check what content we have in academics right now to see if I can remember what it was I don't remember what it was I don't know why I really should have tried harder to remember that good have I don't know who we even have a academics page in our history here no okay the harsh it says it was academics English okay let's try that then let me see actually no I don't have any content for English under academics if it was English maybe it was under something else under departments maybe I have a departments for English all right let's see we have for the English department I don't think it was that the I don't remember ever trying to look at that mmhmm archers let's view recording a previous dream yeah I know I can do that I just don't alright let's let's do some inception style stuff here let's view the previous stream alright so hopefully we don't cause anything crazy to happen let me try to see a messed up screen there it is Austria that's what I have academics Austria courses offered alright that was way easier than I thought it would be oops I moved the wrong thing alright let's check that out there we are alright still can't see that so you have some work to do why is it still like that check out our main content and root this is what used to be displaynone it's not displayed on anymore so where is a content this is the one all right okay this is one that one of the tags is a title tag which is crazy let's see so we'll definitely need to make sure we change title tags that that should probably be just kind of a universal thing if a title tag comes through the data we definitely just switch it I think we're pretty safe to switch titles two h2s across the board let's see there is no subtitle although we probably should switch subtitle to I don't know we'll have to see what works maybe an h4 or something but see if it displays anything at all right now okay it actually does display so we don't really need to change that I'm okay with that being subtitle for now because even that that size is okay with me all right so now let's check out these tabs oh we have a title within the tabs all right so it's gonna be a little tricky I don't think we can just go with h2s all the time all right so maybe we can get yeah so its titles are displaynone by default which is that makes sense hmm I definitely don't want to leave it as title so here's what we do we can switch it up and hmm I'd really hate to have a bunch of h2s but maybe we might have to do that for now like this is not going to be the final version of this markup for now maybe we we have all h2s and then if you have h2s that are inside tabs they'll be a little bit smaller font size so that's not ideal ideal but so I mean ideally you have a hierarchy to your structure right so changing the size is not really a big deal but having that many headings on your page and saying they're all of equal weight is I mean it's just not true right the main title should be an h1 or potentially an h2 and then anything below that can't be at that same level all right so from you know and CEO point of view we're trying to tell them what the most important thing is and I'm not sure if it has an impact on screen readers or not but I suppose it couldn't hurt to be more explicit with you know this is the main heading these are the subheadings so for now we'll do the h2s we'll switch everything h2s but it's not gonna be like that forever it'll probably end up staying like that when we launch but eventually we're gonna change it okay so see we have title all right this whole thing you're just titles titles and then write title okay so I think it might not be a bad idea to bring this up here and see what they what all this markup was supposed to look like originally well Austria is gonna need to have its own post site there are a lot of Austria pages see academics but I think it's this page this one hmm that's interesting maybe the content we're dealing with isn't even actually linked anymore uh sure courses offered where did we pull that all right well in any case we're gonna display this as you know just one list let's see all right let's do that lets go to our component now we've done something similar in another component so let's find that to find that one it wasn't news let's check our news component now it wasn't news all right let's check out directories Department no I know that I did something faculty there we are okay so here's what we did so I know Harshit was talking about pulling data and changing the changing the data like as we pull it in with a regular expression that's one way to do it but I've already pulled it in and I've put in a lot of data so there's no way I'm pulling in all that data again so another way to do this you know after the fact since we already have this data is to do something like this so here I just kind of you know created this to grab the data so that same data that we would normally input here I just made a constant here that takes that data and replaces details with div class details and then puts an ending div tag where the ending details tag was and then down here we simply put content so it's it's pretty simple it's easy to tell when you look at the component what's happening so it's not a it's not a bad solution and this is something that I suppose could be you know pulled out into its own kind of utility component if there were enough things like this going on that we could reuse for now we don't really have that going on but let's take this if we see other things like a details component you know coming in that we want to change you know we could definitely reuse this at some point we might want to have just you know all content running through something like this but we don't really know what we need until we go through more of this content alright so let's go back to our pages dot j/s component and let's put some of this in here actually let me make sure where was this faculty okay it's so inside of our return is that we had it yeah goodness was in our render function I believe it was in our render function I can double check I suppose alright here we are I don't know I must have accidentally copied but I didn't want to copy okay oops I have too many pages open let's get rid of I'll say let's get rid of what we don't need there we are faculty okay so yes within our render function and not the return function there we are and blocks what's not a pad about okay all right so let's change this up and so we have title now we're going to change this well let's change the title and then here well we'll give it a class of title just so that we can remember like when we're inspecting that this used to be a title tag it should help us you know if we have to go into dev tools and try to figure out what's going on and then we'll change it to an h2 and then here we're just gonna grab let's see we're gonna put in our content oops let me copy this and paste it here there we are oh we have alright we can't use this exactly like music because we have our query okay so we just need to change where we're where we have this then so we've used the the newer way of doing a query so we need to switch this up a bit so if we put it down here now we have access to this data so you see whereas before I had that little red squiggly line because this didn't exist now we don't alright so now that constant is gonna live here within our query and then we can change it and just use content here all right so let's save see what happens let's see okay cool so look we have all this content goodness yeah we definitely want there needs to be some styling happening here so I definitely want to see I'm assuming all this was all within title tags and now it's all h2s yes so that's an H that's an H okay we're gonna get a little creative here with without we style this this is definitely going to be something that you don't normally have to do and I don't think I started now I did not start my timer let's see oh okay yeah it's definitely time for me to take a break and go back to the live chat so I'm going to do that now when we come back from our five minute break then we're gonna get in here and we're gonna style all these h2s so that they in fact do not look like h2s but instead look like a nice list so really these should probably be like a lies it should be h2 h3 el eyes we're not gonna get that right now at some point we'll have it but not right now all right so there's one question at the bottom that I'm just gonna address right now because it's very relevant so John Hanson says for future content that will live on the WordPress database will users who input new data get a set template that will keep all things consistent with the data pool yes yes definitely so when possible it will be very specific there will be certain fields that will only allow you to input certain types of data when we need more of a like a Content area that can accept HTML that will be allowed but there's not not every user will have access to do things like that and I will put in instructions so usually what I do when I make something like this and they're going to be users that are entering content on their own is I create some tutorial videos for them so I'll have either a video or a document or usually both that outlines here's what you do you know for all these different post types and then within the post types themselves I'll have instructions so that when they go to enter something into a field there'll be instructions right there below it saying here's an example of what I want so so far that's worked well I haven't with the other sites I've done like this I it's going well so for this case I'll actually have more direct contact with the people editing it because my boss will be the primary person editing it and then the other developer who works right next to me will be doing it and then student workers that will be working right outside my door so if there's any issues someone could actually you know talk to me facetoface about it but it's I'm definitely going to be very specific with the instructions so they'll be freedom to do different things where there needs to be but it'll basically be you know the fields will only accept what I want them to accept at some point and that'll probably all happen after the launch because all that stuff's like behind the scenes stuff that I can do whenever and the the user you know the ultimate user trying to look at this site may not even realize that a change has occurred all right so let me scroll up and find some questions John Hanson says looks like the dog image has been improved using background size cover though I think it also needs background position Center Center yeah it could could be I I'm not I don't usually bother doing anything with the stock images I kind of want to see what images I need to use for real but John also says add a closing X in the corner of the menu yeah I've I noticed this yesterday and I think that would be a great idea that'll probably go on the list of it's not essential to have before we launch because like the odds of somebody having a phone this narrow are pretty small I can actually look at the analytics right now and see if anybody's using a phone that small but that's pretty narrow and it would be nice to have the X we can also make this a little bit smaller I mean really there's no reason right now but this has to be this wide but anyway I totally agree John I had the same thought brooke says isn't the menu itself swipeable on most material design apps yeah it usually is swipeable I don't I was not able to swipe this but it could be because I'm not actually on a device alright now that I think about that I should check this since we have n grok running let me let me just grab the end Rock link and I'm not going to try to type it out I'm gonna send it to myself let's see it's the easiest way to centers I'll just put it my Google keep all right so Google keep is a notetaking app and it syncs up pretty quickly so hopefully it syncs immediately now and I can just open this up on my phone because if it's if it is swipeable then that's good to know I still like the idea of having an icon there just to be sure that it's you know hundred percent clear to users but users may also if they're used to being able to swipe in they can't swipe that's going to be an annoyance to them it's not swipeable right now so when we've done things with materialized CSS that is swipeable but right now this is not swipeable also that doesn't look it's much more noticeable that there's not enough padding at the top on mobile right here so I definitely need to make sure you get some padding but that's the type of thing that I'm going to be doing in the streams for at least today and tomorrow is really working on some of those little details especially on the home page yeah we'll have to check maybe there's an issue with material I already open about being swipeable if not you know maybe that's something that we can create and maybe submit a pull request for material UI to do that I mean that that seems like a pretty common design pattern for material design apps that should be there so Niki thanks that was a yeah Niki thanks for bringing that up all right I need I need to take my sweater off because it's super hot in my office now my office the rest of the department is actually pretty like cold the right outside my door is really cold the girl who works she kind of has like an open office thing going on but the girl who works right outside my door always has a blanket because it's so cold but my office is always really warm and it's all the screens all the screens create a lot of heat so a sweater is appropriate for everywhere else except through my office I don't want to run the fan because you know it would mess up the audio as soon as it streamed over I'm definitely running the fan though alright hey in this here hey and how's it going and this will be the last question and then I'll go back to the code because my timer did run out but in it says how is your working day not too bad today I had a meeting so every Thursday morning we have a department meeting and basically everybody in my department which is about I don't know about a dozen people sometimes not everyone is there but about a dozen people and we just quickly go over what we're working on sometimes it can get a little bit long so I'm not I'm not a big fan of the weekly meeting I always keep mine short so today mine was most of what I said was just I've been working on this site so that was my day but I did get some more data transferred over which was nice I was actually up at like 1000 till 400 this morning and I I couldn't go back to sleep so I just got up got a good workout in made a latte I ate a bunch of eggs for breakfast and still managed to get my kids ready and get them to school on time and get myself into work so so not not a bad day although right now I already feel tired in a couple hours I'll be ready to go to bed cuz I've been up since before 400 but anyway thank you for asking and and I know it's it's on the live chat so I usually don't ask you how things are going but I will now so how's everything going with you you don't have to say in a live chat if you don't want if you grab their answer on insta or Twitter or something let me know but I feel bad you're always very considerate and asking how I am and I usually don't during the live chat ask ask you so anyway if you feel like sharing please let me know let's see alright a related followup question there is sim sim Ranjit says how is your worklife balance and sim Ranjit if I messed up the pronunciation of your name please let me know I really want to get it right right now my worklife balance I think is pretty good I went on home I've been doing very little work sometimes I was still like message about projects and things but I try not to actually do any coding at home right now and just spend time with my kids so it's like it's been not bad I've been reading to the kids and oh cool I got cimarron G's name right awesome so I've been spending time you know read to the kids and hold the baby a lot and I've been playing we got a Nintendo switch for Christmas so I'll play that with the kids and we it's fun because we talked about it you know you know we'll say like hey you know I got this today on this game and and that's kind of fun to have like a common interest you know with the kids so so that's cool and I've been getting my workouts in so this is two weeks on Monday so over two weeks now that I worked out every morning so I started out in some I've been doing cardio and now I started adding some some weights and things so it's not bad I actually gained like five pounds since I started working out normally you work out you want to lose weight but I I assume I'm gaining muscle because I'm working out and I'm actually eating slightly healthier than I normally do so anyway I think my balance is going well right now hopefully I can keep it up and the key for me I think the key change that I've made is I'm going to bed early and consistently so I rarely stay up past like 930 sometimes I'm in bed before 900 basically when I put my kids to sleep I go to sleep too when they're brushing their teeth or tonight I'm brushing my teeth and we all you know just go to bed so that's it I've had to sacrifice some Netflix but I think it's worth it anyway so I took a really long time to answer that but I think questions like that are important because being a developer and being successful isn't just about the code if you are great at the code but you can't keep that balance you get all stressed out you know your mental health isn't good ever your physical health isn't good then the code is gonna suffer so that can be just as important as you know you have somebody that's mentally and physically healthy who's not that good a developer right now then they have a good base to learn more but if you have somebody who's an expert but they're their life otherwise it's a mess you know I if I was gonna hire somebody I'd hire the the new person that at least has the rest of their stuff together not that I don't have concern for the other person I'd you know I'd want to help them out but if I had to choose you know for the good of a company or something that's who I'd pick so anyway I do want to make sure I have content that you are interested in so if you'd rather hear less or more about the the other part of a developer's life the you know physical social you know mental let me know I can talk about that more I'll try to make sure that I save that for the end though because there are some people that really just want the code and I know they probably get annoyed by these long breaks in the middle of all right now I don't want to make it sound like I always have everything together right I don't this just the last two weeks have been exceptional usually like for the LAT for months and months before that I just felt like I didn't have anything together and I'm sure if you asked my wife I would sound even less together than I sound right now this she sees everything from a whole different perspective so she'd probably tell you about how I bought candy a junk food for all the kids two days ago and and that kind of thing but alright let's get back to the code I'm gonna set my timer now then I'm gonna remember to bring it over here on this screen so we all can see 25 minutes we're gonna do our best to make this page look good and then check out a few other pages just to make sure we haven't like mess things up on those other pages and then we'll see how we're doing on time you know if we get it looking good maybe we'll just you know go back do some more question and answer and finish up the stream we'll see how it goes so if you do have a question or comment or anything you know put it in here now and then you know I will get to it in about 25 minutes alright so for now this h2 is fun I usually like things to be a bit thinner than this but I'm not gonna worry about detail like small details right now but this this heading definitely needs to be smaller so let's inspect that and that's gonna be at ABS h2 so let's go back to our CSS file to be working mainly in this file at this point and I don't think we have anything with tabs yet and let's see what we kind of wonder if we really need this on these pages name phone email CV link video image blockless for details right home logs hmm I I want to see if we're accidentally hiding anything so I'm gonna comment that out right now all right it doesn't look like we're hiding anything else so that's that's good I just want to see what we're hiding if we're hiding anything so let's do what was it tabs yeah tabs and then we're gonna do h2 right so in in CSS land why am i all abilities empty this is how we select an h2 that is a child of tabs and is this is this direct child I believe it's the direct child of tab so that we do want to use that we can take advantage of the cascading nature CSS here to make sure that those sub h2s that we're gonna get to in a minute actually are getting the correct styles so it won't really matter one way or another but let's let's try this let's try pixel oops font size and let's give it 24 pixels oops 24 pixels for now that may be too big we'll see and then our font weight let's go with 400 for now and I'm not worried about colors so much we may get to that but let me see what the color is now I don't want it to be solid black so as long as it's not solid black I'm okay with it where is h2 computed huh that's interesting I wonder maybe if there's no color set at all and this then is the default for the browser that's interesting all right so what I would want is color let's go yes so this this does look like it is black it it matches all these so what I really want though is to do it like this and have 87 so I'd rather have the color be 87 let's make sure okay t7 it's really hard to who uh to see a difference but that's something that I want to apply across the board I'm not going to worry about it right now but let's see tabs h2 you know what what we just did should have applied let's make sure I'm in the right file page so CSS why did it not apply with what's going on tabs h2 let me see I'm gonna check the live chat and maybe I made something different maybe I messed something up I mean soy su I would paramount uhhuh this is interesting so so does the space actually matter I was under the impression that this the space didn't matter but let's let's try it out and see so the first way I did it didn't have any effect at all now let's see let's try again maybe I was mistaken I think you all are right the space mattered very interesting for some reason I just didn't think the space mattered I just thought that was commonly how you wrote it all right cool very good to know so in case you didn't catch that originally I had written this tabs and then you know the this little was that a greater than sign yeah a little greater than sign and then h2 but I had spaces between that but that was not the correct way to do that so all right cool so that works let's see how it looks all right I'm I like that yeah I like that I think that's it's not bad I do want to see what the font size for this is 24 and I don't want them to be the same so let's drop that down then let's drop this one down to my don't we say 20 let's try 20 see how that looks alright um I still I don't really like that but I'll I'll go with that for now maybe once we drop these down in size it'll it'll look more reasonable all right also thanks to everyone that pointed out that that space matters I see several of you were we're talking about the spaces on Hill and Nikki and I'm not sure who else all were saying that but everybody who was thank you all right so let's check this now and first we'll test out some styles here and see see how we like it see if we can get mmm no it's not exactly what I want h to title alright let's go with left and put that there type that up to 22 and then we're also gonna have a right H to title alright we'll give it a quick refresh just to make sure okay that's a little bit more obvious the hierarchy that we have here and let me give it a scroll just to see what else we have going on here all right so we have another header it says fall only spring only okay now obviously we have a problem with spacing right so let's let's deal with our spacing issues why do we have spacing issues like this is that these these be ours there we go oh yeah we're gonna have to set the BR displaynone I really I hate to do that because there may be very meaningful you know break tags that are in here but it just it seems like from what I've seen of the content the break tags are not meaningful so I think we're better off displaying none on the break tags and then when we need to we'll add in padding with our CSS that's the way I prefer anyway yeah all right so this is looking a lot better not a hundred percent what I would want this there's still some some spacing issues but so much better so let's make sure we do a br nun which I think we already had down here did we we did so we already had that be our nun so I still want to leave this commented out for now because I'd like to know if we're hiding anything else but I'm gonna add that BR now so the BR set to none won't actually hide any content anyway it'll just get rid of space so I'm okay with having that as displaynone all right all right so sometimes I get a red line and I think is just delayed that it shouldn't be there anymore it just hasn't left yet all right just doublecheck make sure it works yep that works and what do you think you know what this is probably throwing me off that I haven't zoomed in alright that's that definitely looks more reasonable I think what we ought to do though is make sure that there's a bit more space so let's see what we have going on here in each tab I think each tab should have some padding or some margin at the bottom bottom and let's make it 16 pixels okay let's see what's going on it's basically done nothing there we are okay okay let's throw this in here as well all right our CSS definitely could use some better organization but I'm always I'm okay with letting that go until we get farther along sometimes if you organize prematurely then you need to just reorganize everything again so I'd rather not rather kind of wait till we get more out there all right I I don't love this this right now I think I think that there's still not enough distinction between these headings and the actual content so I either need to make this font size smaller which I don't really want to do I think 18 pixels is kind of the minimum I'd like to go here so the alternative would be to make this h2 larger and then I can make these ones larger as well so maybe I'll do that I'm just not sure I don't want to think about that let's see if you want to see how I'm on time okay so about 10 minutes left all right maybe let's let's try it then we can just try it here dev tools and see see what we want to do for 1.5 um so what's the computed all right 24 I'm sorry I knew that already I don't know I forgot all right so let's try this font size 26 pixels let's try 28 all right 28 pixels and then we can make these 24 let's see if that is enough for me yeah I think that's that's a lot more significant that stands out the only other thing that I think might work as well is let's try out let's try our font weight here we can try 300 I like that I really like that what do you all think about this these changes here I still don't like this bold being this being that bold but I really like the thin font let's see what the font size or font weight is here 700 Wow no wonder that so thick I yeah 500 is way more reasonable yeah I usually never go above 500 for font weight okay all right so let's change this then and so our h2s are gonna be CSS is so messed up it is bothering me but I'm gonna I'm gonna hold back the urge to change it and right now font size and font weights and then we changed our font size here to 24 and we changed our font weight here to 300 and let's refresh just to be sure excellent all right now it is much more obvious with the hierarchy of this pages alright cool I'm really glad that I didn't just leave that alone sometimes not being satisfied with your design is is not the right way to go because you spend too much time on it but in this case this this worked out so I don't know I think that's kind of thing is sometimes if if you work on something enough you start to get a feel for something like this isn't a big deal don't waste your time on it or this is a big deal and you don't always you know you don't always choose the right thing all the time but in this case it didn't take that long and I think the result is a lot better than what we had just a few minutes ago you check my time are at six minutes alright so now that we have this I think we ought to check out what's going on now with some of the other pieces of content so I'm just gonna go back through here the some of what we had and scroll all right this one doesn't seem to have any area here's some some headings let's see what these are these HT yeah these are h2s okay not bad I'm actually okay with the way this look I think those are fun and what's this this might not even be a H tag at all in h4 okay all right okay that's not too bad all right so it looks like we the hierarchy is there the hierarchy works I oh that's way too small notice that in H five all right so I'm definitely gonna have to take a look at the the H tags overall kind of the global settings for the H tags and then change them based on what our base font weight is which our base font weight should be at the minimum 16 all right so we do have 18 I'm okay with that actually like 18 B in the base so if 18 is our base font weight or I'm sorry font size then the h5 s can't be right now can't be 13.2 eight pixels so we they have to be at least you know 20 right does that make sense that you know any heading no matter H five or whatever it still needs to be bigger than the base want okay let me check the check because I think I asked you all what you thought about that and I didn't even check for the answer I apologize Joan Anson says looks good for the fun weights now and it says I think displaynone is a bad idea and I'd like to know why what what's your reasoning for thinking it's a bad idea would it be better to just remove those BR tags because I'm open to doing that as well I mean the easiest way to do it is with CSS but the easiest ways of course not always the best way so I would I would like to know the the thoughts behind that okay all right if you have asked a question I haven't got to it yet just about four more minutes and I'll get to all the questions so please be patient what are these they're lies okay so it looks like the Allies have a different font weight but these ones don't what are these so it our ordered lists have a different different styles than our unordered list so I'll probably want to change that at some point I don't think I'm going to try to get into it right now because we don't have that much time but and I just want to check some of these other ones as well let's see alright here's our about page so we have this this ought to be an h2o and h1 okay I'm gonna have to make a decision and see like what do we do we want to have some consistency with these so I think there ought to be if possible but other than that I like out of this shows up right now yeah that page is good this associate page I think that what's wrong with this page do we not have a title at all huh I may have to check out this page on the on the site right now and see if there's a title because that looks odd it's h3 at the top yeah I think we definitely want to make sure that all pages have a title and I'm you know this obviously this is a subtitle so I just need to make sure it looks like the title doesn't exist in the main data so maybe I will just pull in it's different for different pieces of content so it's it's going to be a little tricky because sometimes in the main content there's it already includes the title and sometimes it doesn't so I don't want to get duplicate titles so I can't just add a title in across the board like pull win the word press post title so yeah I'm gonna have to think about I'm gonna have to figure out which post types are pulling in titles automatically and which ones are and then go from there okay only have about a minute left I think we've checked enough pages now I've got h2 h3 okay not too bad all right not bad this is all these are all acceptable I wouldn't say that it's exactly how I would do it if I was doing this all from scratch and had complete freedom over how this displays but considering that we put in all this HTML from this old system that had been put in by you know a variety of different people over years by I think it's displaying you know quite well so or at least well enough that I'm comfortable with something that looks like this you know being what we launched with okay all right Anna just explained so she's saying if I want to use BR in articles I cannot because you hit it globally that's a good point you know that's a good point I just all right now let's think about that we need some way to get rid of all that space that's coming with those those BR tags but at the same time do we want to give the editors the freedom to add in their own tags and and have that be respected I'm gonna have to think about that I just I've I thought up a few potential solutions but I don't think any of them are really that good I'm thinking like potentially we could still hide our the BR tags and then just have a note in the editor to let users know if you want to use a break then use this other tag and basically we'll just invent another tag and make it act like a br so I don't like that because like now users have to remember to use another tag it's problematic if you're copying and pasting code from somewhere else and trying to use that so that's why I don't like that solution although it would work it's not great the other solution is to try to go through all the data right now and remove most of the BR tags then we don't have to hide them but that solution would either I maybe there's a way to do it in WordPress and alter the database you know with one command I don't know how to do that I could maybe I could learn then there's a possibility though of us my I guess we wouldn't be getting rid of er tags where we need them because right now we're hiding them so it's the same thing it could have somebody manually go through which is going to take a while we probably won't get that done before launch cuz I don't really have anybody right now but I know I could give that task to or I can re migrate the data and at the same time strip out the BR tags which I really don't want to do all right so those are my who is that for maybe solutions I'm gonna have to think on this a little bit more the other solution is just to leave them hidden for now and then have that on the list of things for somebody to manually do when they go through the data and then whenever they get finished with that I can then remove the CSS rule that hides the BR tags and so then they'll be okay to you again that that actually might be the best solution because there won't be I don't think there will be that many changes you know that quickly to the site and hopefully I can get somebody to go through that data soon let me know what you all think I'm not I'm not a hundred percent sure about any of them any of those those options all right let me scroll up a bit and answer some more questions that'll be it for the coding part of this so if you don't want to stick around for the question and answer thank you so much for watching but if you do have a little bit more time and you can stick around I definitely appreciate it if you would and help answer some questions and you know ask some of your own if if you'd like Aaron Arun Monterey our UN let me know that pronounce that says says hey oh hey how's it going thanks for for watching okay there's a little conversation going on here between Nikki and and on how about CSS so I think it would be worthwhile for me to put this in the video for those year watching later so let me just type a little bit in here so the question is what's the difference between this tabs h2 and tabs h2 so and this one on hell is explaining this in here so I'm not gonna read it out word for word I'll just kind of demonstrate here this first one only selects the tabs that are a direct descendant of the h2 right so there's you don't go down any more levels it would have to be tabs and then right after that h2s so even if there's like five h2s as long as they're just a child a direct child all those eight shoes will be selected but tabs h2 will select children grandchildren and greatgrandchildren all the way down so you could have tabs and then a div and then within that div in h2 it will still be selected so with the first one it wouldn't be selected if it was inside a div the second one it would and it could be inside 50 dense or nested and it would still be selected all right hopefully that makes sense to you all let me know if it doesn't but there's our CSS lesson of the day brought to you by own hell thank you very much grim reaper says why is it said that frontend web development is pretty messed up I don't I don't know I think people here's my guess I obviously don't know what the intentions are of the people who say this but based on what I've seen of people saying that and similar things my guess is that there is so there are so many different options and there's not there's usually not one clear frontrunner for how to do pretty much anything in frontend you know from you know what UI framework am I going to use to MIT you SAS les post CSS styled components glamour you know it there's so many options you know what routing am I going to use for reacts what am I going to use to manage you know data how what am I gonna have for a backend you know it's just there's so many options now and so many good options that it can be confusing to someone maybe they're coming from a different area of programming where there are clear frontrunners you know it's more like okay everybody does it this way they come here and it's like the Wild West of programming where you know anybody can just open up a git repo with a new way to style react components and they've put it on Twitter it gets a bunch of retweets and now a week later that's a legitimate way to do it and you have you know good really good developers all of a sudden using it saying it's awesome so I can see that as being pretty confusing you know it ever even your build tools are we gonna use grunt the web pack would there's there's just so many options for everything the only thing that seems pretty standard in frontend world is almost everybody uses get right get is standard so other than that it's just you know everything is is just up for grabs I personally like that I love that there's so many options because it's not boring every project we do we try something new that's really cool so we're always learning so we get better with the stuff that we've kept them on in the project but then now we've added this other thing in so we're always having to learn new things I like that about it and you know what front end it's just things developed so rapidly I don't know I think that's that's cool Harshit mentioned get is used by everyone else too yeah I didn't mean to imply that gets only in the front end I'm just saying that's an example of something that is consistent among frontend developers is that they do use get I have seen like it in where I work the IT department doesn't use get they use something different I can't I can't remember what these fault I think it's fault they use visual sourcesafe for a while and they switch the vault yeah so I mean that but basically the point is that I could see why people would think it is a mess but once you get an idea of I don't know once you start to learn more about it and you can kind of visualize where everything falls into place and where the options are you know what the options are like I think it makes a lot more sense so at first it's definitely confusing like what do I learn how does it all fit together like you know just figuring out what everything is for is is a big step right they the names don't always say what these things are for or what they do anyway that's that's kind of my viewpoint on it but as I said I I really don't know what the intentions are beyond you know everyone that says that I lost my place in the lab chats I'm scrolling through now trying to find where I was Bhupinder says which software are you using to share screen or record the screen it's called OBS so it's free and it's available for Mac and I believe Windows as well I haven't tried to use it on Linux I think it's available for Linux but some of you people use Linux let me know if it's available for Linux as well I don't want to mislead anyone but it takes a little while to get used to the settings and to get them just right but once you get the settings down it's it's really easy to use I recommend just finding someone else who hasn't set up properly and trying to get their settings and just copy it and then you can adjust them based on what you need but that's what I did I went out and watched videos from from gamers who were doing live streams and just kind of tried to figure out okay what do I need from there and adjusted it so like I don't really need 60 frames per second for what I do so that's something I can back down on whereas gamers generally prefer that so just kind of adapt it to your needs if you're interested in using it origin says what's the best way to integrate react with an external API it depends on so alright it depends on a couple of things like if you're trying to grab data from an external API and you want it to be serverside rendered then I would use something like next that handles a lot of that for you and then you can use what's built in from next to be able to grab that data and render serverside if that really doesn't matter I would just use fetch you could fetch clientside or serverside whatever you want so there's a node fetch that you can use as well but yeah just use the fetch API and I think that's that works well for for me someone mentions harsh mentions Axios yeah you people have used Axios as well I personally don't use Axios but a lot of people like it so I can't really explain why you would want to use it because I don't I haven't used it but that's another option instead of fetch that's another area where it's like the question was what's the best way and we automatically have two really good ways to do it that's like what's the best way I don't know but I'm sure we could debate and then somebody else will throw in by the time we're done with the debate we'll have even more options and no clear winner so that's just the way things are in JavaScript world right now Aniki said thanks for the explanation I assume it was about the CSS stuff you're welcome no problem Gregory says I'm new to this chat where did you get the Pomodoro timer Harshit made the Pomodoro timer so harsh it mentioned that in the lab chat yeah but our should actually made it so yeah it's let me get the URL for you it's pom pom now SH that's P om p om pom pom now SH and I will copy and paste that into the live chat so you can click I want to make sure I read it out as well for those who are gonna be watching later who or who can't access the live chat right now John Henson says globally set small zero margins top and bottom on all text tags and HR it's easy to find a sweet spot and if you have three or four media queries you can change these margins using e/m is helpful to its dynamic okay just think about that so yeah I mean I think there's definitely a lot more testing and work to be done CSS wise to make sure this all this all looks alright but as I said a lot of what we're bringing in now is acceptable not exactly where I want it but I can't I can't start to perfect this until I make sure I have all the data the number one thing now is is there readable data here for every page and have I kept the URLs intact as much as possible that's number one priority after that if that's finished then I can start to get into things like you know it business look exactly how I want it to look or you know whatever else we want to want to work on harsh asks is there anything that you use to design sites like overall color scheme and other typography and stuff I use material design for almost all of my sites some side projects I do like I just experiment with different things but for my professional projects I usually stick with material design the color schemes so I work for University the color schemes that I use for the University all come from the official palette which was developed by one of my colleagues here at where I work so I'm kind of bound to that now the way I use those colors and the amounts you know that's up to me so I've had some trial and error with that but to get to the point where we have this this color scheme that we're using right now like this you know that that was essentially just trial and error and seeing what looks good what doesn't look good and starting to get a feel for like what colors can go up against each other and look okay and which ones can't alright so like you the green color actually doesn't look good right up against a white background so it's always bordered by the gold which you can see in the footer here even a tiny Goldwater makes a huge difference so as you start to work with a color palette you do get a feel for it but then just for a lot of different things like the shadow you know menu styles and things icons I pull a lot from the material design philosophy so even like the way the way inputs behave you know Google's put a lot of time and money and there are a lot of very experienced talented people that have developed material design so I can't compare with that so I'm going to use that it provides a very familiar user experience so I love the idea that a user can come to my site and immediately feel comfortable with the navigate and the visual hierarchy of things you know based on like the perceived depth of elements on the page with the shadows so I'd like to use that for my side projects sometimes I like to be pretty experimental like I like to give a retro look to things and I kind of mess with like dark color themes a lot as well so I'm a little bit more playful and creative when it comes to that but if I happen to have a client on the side usually like when it comes to colors I am also bound by whatever their branding is most companies already have that so you work with what you have there usually if a client has it one or two colors that are just really ugly you you just use them as sparingly as possible so I prefer the use of white a lot when I'm dealing with things like that so I personally I love dark themes but I just I don't know they don't always work and clients usually don't like them that much like sometimes I've had clients ask for a darker theme but then once they see it next to the white theme they they don't like it I don't know what that I don't know why it's not every client but there's just for some reason you know people seem to like the the white all right I think I've gotten through all the questions now so cool all right innocence I like the design of the site thanks Anna I appreciate that that's that's one of the things that it's always difficult I think to work with design people by that I mean that clients and things always have a lot of opinions about what they like I think at the end of the day the thing to keep in mind is the client the user right not not not the client but the you the end user so your clients clients right that's who you want to think about and for me usability always takes a higher place than just style alone sometimes I get ideas from clients that are really cool that stylistically would look awesome but then if you say all right well how's it gonna look on a phone how's it gonna look on a tablet what if you put it in landscape you know there's these these things that you know sometimes people don't always think of so sometimes you have to sacrifice that creative style for usability and I think material design does that that's why I like it so much if it depends on what kind of site if let's say I was doing a personal site just to showcase my work or my portfolio I could probably get away with being a lot more creative and not worry so much about user experience but it's just you got to balance that so I don't think my sites most of my sites I wouldn't call beautiful I would maybe just got describe them more as like clean minimalist right they're just I try to focus them make them to the point make him easy to use I don't know I think there's beauty in that to see heart says okay thanks for the info I will look into material design I've never worked with it before yeah check it out the docks are very comprehensive so if you go to like the official Google material design Docs you know just read through some of their philosophy and click around and just look at their examples I really like the way that they they set up their their documentation harshest but sometimes you do see sites that have both creativity animations and responsive at the same time I get so jealous of such developers yeah you do yeah so it's always going to be a balance between creativity and usability but some people manage to strike that and it's the result is pretty amazing so it just takes a lot of work right so you go with something that's pretty standard like material design you can make sites faster if you want to do something that has a lot of creativity animation and stuff and still made it works on your different devices and is usable it takes a lot of time a lot of testing I can be confident that a lot of material design stuff will work on different devices because others have tested if I'm coming up with my own thing that all falls on me the odds of there being some glitches are a lot higher but anyway right now it just so happens that I don't really have the the freedom to do things super creative you know and I'm okay with that I have a lot of freedom and with the tools that I use so I'm happy with that but I don't know maybe one day I'll get more creative with the you know design side of things and we'll see I like where I'm at right now I like what I'm doing all right so that's that's it that's so add all this stuff in the live chat right now so I'm gonna end this dream now thank you all so much for watching really appreciate all the help or the comments questions y'all are awesome so I will be back tomorrow and this would be good if everything goes well tomorrow this will be a whole week of streams consistently around the same time so it's been a while since that's happened but anyway until tomorrow have a great day
