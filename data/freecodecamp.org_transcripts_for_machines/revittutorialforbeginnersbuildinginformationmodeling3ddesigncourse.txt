autodesk revit is a building information modeling software for architects engineers and designers in this university course you will learn how to use revit for 3d modeling and design so this one is going to be focused on giving you the basis for working in revit so i'm going to probably record three videos three tutorial videos just showing from start to finish how to produce a very very simple very very basic project in revit so the course itself has a website of course and as long students you already have seen the course those of you who are not fluent students can also kind of jump in jump into the website by just writing down this this address here and in the course we have a lot of information here but that's not not not that important what's important is um where is it oh my god i will need to reformat this uh what's important is what kind of a client you're going to choose your your fictional client for for the project and also uh this supplementary material right so we will not be starting from scratch we will be using a 3d model that i've made um to get you guys started to just have some sort of a environment ready for us to model in so there are these two links here site 3d model and sat format and site 3d model in rhino 5 format the reason i use rhino5 is because i just make sure that everyone can follow along you know with the older version of rhino so i have already kind of made it and downloaded it and so on once you do that and you open it up you will see this 3d model right here so the task of the course is going to be um to 3d model out some sort of a building in between these two so it's you know it's it's kind of a challenge it's it's quite a narrow one and these are called narrow buildings for a reason right um right so we will let's just take a closer look at it in arctic view there's nothing fancy i believe i just extracted some dwg file from uh lund city um and just modeled out a few few buildings from that dwg file so we are now looking in rhino but this course is about revit so let's stop looking at it in rhino and rather let's look at it in revit so in revit once you open up revit you will be presented with this window here um and basically it's asking you to create a new file right to start working so we will do exactly that i will click on new models new and here it's going to ask me what kind of template do i want to use and it asks you whether or not you would like to use imperial units or metric units so i will be using metric of course in sweden we do use metric system um and if you don't see it here you can always click on browse and then expand the top bar here go back to uh templates so 1 1 4 up or so to say and here you will see english or we just ah let's go for english default metric we can use that one so it's it's either one you matter i'll use default metric that that seems fine i'll just hit open yep sure hit ok and it's going to load up a new file for us once that's done i will immediately save it just so that auto saving kicks in and if it crashes or anything like that i don't lose a lot of information so i'll go to file save as oh can i just save i'll save yeah i can just save well here i'll just save it to my desktop because i don't have a folder for it ada15 tutorials sure hit save that's it so so you're done with that right so let's start with me showing you the user interface or either kind of quickly going through the user interface so here in in the right and the top we have a few mostly used shortcut buttons such as open file save file plot undo redo check dimension and so on right so those are kind of handy but i don't tend to use them that often if i need to save something i'll just click on this file tab and just choose to save here i don't know why but that's just how i do it and here right below those shortcut buttons you have your tabs your tabs where all of the tools in revit are located so i already showed you the file tab well it's not really a tab but the file button here for opening a new file or creating a new file opening up a file existing one saving all all of that good stuff um so that's not interesting but what's interesting is these tool tabs here we have architecture we will be using quite a bit of it of the tools in architecture tab of course uh this is like the main one structure tab uh we will almost not be wait let me see no we will not be using anything from the structure tab even though it's it's super for for engineering purposes but since this is just uh like a proposal level entrylevel project that we're doing we don't really need needed then we have steel precast and systems tabs all of these are engineering related we don't care about them insert tab basically lets you import or insert stuff that's not native to revit such as dwg files and and whatnot images we will be using a little bit of it annotate tab um actually quite useful i'm not sure if we will be using it though maybe text we will see but annotate is basically dimensions text tags symbols all of that good stuff is in the annotate tab analyze we will not be using that messing inside um in this case uh for this particular course i'm not sure if we are going to be using it but in aada 20 in the next course i believe we will so you'll need to wait for that collaborate basically it helps you if you're working in a team uh tools here help you collaborate with other people working on the same project quite a strong tool uh but given the situation of of code and not not being able all of us not being able to be in the school uh we will be skipping skipping this tab right here view tab quite um yeah we will be using it quite quite a bit um basically just is used to make sections to extract 3d views elevations and also changing the the graphics of the drawings themselves i will be revisiting it quite a bit manage addins and modify um these three tabs we will not be using that much well modify tab you will notice when we will be double clicking on or changing some sort of geometry modify tab will automatically open up with additional uh tools uh that that can be used for that precise geometry for instance if you create a floor slab and you want to edit the boundary of the of the floor slab uh then you um i believe double click it or click on edit i don't remember i'm not a revit user by the way um but it will open up the modify tab where you will have additional tools available for you to modify the boundary of the floor you'll see that in action in just a second okay so that's all about the tabs then here on the left hand side you have the the properties so these are the properties of every piece of geometry that there is if that you have selected right if you don't have anything selected that means the the properties will show you uh the settings for the view itself and in this case we are in level one so we're looking at the top of for for level one that's that's our view and it's basically the properties or the settings for that particular view uh once we have some geometry in here i will talk about the properties a little bit more uh then we have our project browser which is basically all of our views all of our floor plans and so on are going to be located here so right now since we loaded up the default template uh it already has a few a few views set up for us and actually it has too many so we don't need that many views right now and what i'm going to do is i will probably get rid of yeah let's get rid of them so for instance ceiling plants we don't really need any ceiling plants whatsoever so i'll just single click to select level one and hit delete single click to select just make sure that you are deleting ceiling plants not the floor plans right i select level two delete don't need those as for elevations we will be creating our own elevations so we don't really need that as well so i'll delete the east north south west elevations as well all right so now we we only see level one level two and site actually level two i'll get rid of that as well okay so now we only have level one and site uh two two plants i want to import my geometry into the model right sorry my geometry by my geometry i mean the surrounding environment into this revit model to actually have something to work work with to do that i will go to uh insert i'll choose to import cad right import cad which is going to basically ask me where's the model and what kind of format should i use so as you can see here it does accept rhino files which is great we we can use the the rhino file aeda15 site that's fine or if that gives you an error sometimes it does just to be safe uh there's also an option to import sat file acis sat file um so that sat file is also located let me just add right here site 3d model in set format so if rhino gives you problems importing rhino gives you problems just import the sat file uh i'll import the set file i guess so i'll select that select the set file that i have downloaded um blah blah blah import as category so that's an important one basically in revit every piece of geometry belongs to a geometry category right so revit needs to to know what kind of geometry is it is it a column is it a ceiling is it a door you know what what is it so here uh our site model is neither one of those things right so we will be importing it is it as a generic model so i'll hit on open generic model is basically yeah just anything geometry that doesn't have a type and it seems like it's import it has been imported good enough seems like it's fine okay so we have our geometry here that's great and we have these doodads right here which we don't really need so these are leftovers from where we had the elevations elevation views these were markers for elevation views i think i'll just delete them delete delete so i'm just selecting them uh just click delete click delete if you don't have them that's even better okay so we have our top view of our generic model that's cool and all but we kind of want to uh also see it in 3d right no just to understand uh how well did it import so to do that we can go to view and we can create view tab and we can create 3d view that's it that's all we needed to do um so now on to how do we navigate in the viewport in the 3d viewport in revit so you do it by holding down the shift key and clicking the scroll wheel clicking and dragging the scroll wheel you can rotate if you just click and drag the scroll wheel you pan scroll wheel right now there's not a lot of things going on here nothing too fancy um but that's fine all right so we have our 3d model here and let's start creating some or rather preparing to create some um some geometries so what i like doing is oh by the way sorry every view that you open will be shown here in these tabs so you can easily switch between them or you can just double click on the on the name of the view here level one uh so in revit you always work not always but most of the time you work in plan views like um what would be a good example like in sims like in that video game sims um you kind of work in plan view and the 3d view is just represent it it becomes like a representation of that so all of the drawing and drawing of walls and whatnot is done in plan view so in level one okay so let's start off by actually giving it a few axes that's at least what i like to do in this case it doesn't really make a lot of sense but i still like to do it just to keep it clean so i'll go to architecture tab and i'll choose grid here grid bam and as you can see immediately once i chose the grid option it gives me it it takes me to modify tab where it basically asks us how would you like to place the grid where would you like to place the grid axis so i will do that by just clicking on these endpoints and the snapping is kind of kind of nice in revit so i'll click on one of the corners of the surrounding buildings and i'll drag out the grid line here that's our first grid line and i'll do the same thing for the second one from here to here and align them perfect so that's our grid axis one and grid axis two um i could do grid axis three and four maybe we should so grid axis three um i wonder should it should we do it here or should we do it here let's do it here so that's our grid axis three oh come on there we go and that's going to be our grid access form bam done once you've done that you just hit escape that's all that's all right so now i will just clean them up a little bit so i'll click on this uh arrow key here or i believe i can just hit escape once more um and then it will automatically go to my arrow key or arrow tool i'll select let's say grid access three and i'll add this this markup three i will add it to the other side as well right here three so let me do that again you select grid access three and there's a tick mark box on the other side right which you tick and then it's basically it understands that oh okay i need to show uh the grid axis okay that's good for grid access for we do the same thing we find that tick box here sometimes it's hard to see it of course it starts auto saving let's wait there we go red x is four then there same thing for axis one and same thing for axis 2. let me drag them out a little bit so that it's nice and tidy there we go up there we go i might need to squish the scooch grid axis three and four closer uh to the to the building but that's gonna be done later for now this is good enough um so in architecture you don't really have a grid axis going in both directions being marked in numbers so if in one direction grid axes are marked in numbers one two three four five and the other one they're going to be marked in letters a b c d blah blah blah so here for grid access three where it says name let me do that again maybe it's a little bit too fast i'll select grid axis 3 and i'll say that no this is not 3 this is a so i select it once i selected the properties changes and here where it says name i will just change this to a hit apply very good same thing for a grid access 4. instead of 4 i change this to b there we go okay so now we are all set we are all set to start uh start making our building right so before um i wonder which which yeah let's start with walls right i think we should start with walls um so to to add a wall there is this wall tool the of course it's under architecture tab wall if i expand it i can see that there are a few options here but for now we don't care about those options we just care about the regular wall tool right so i will not be expanding that that tool i'll click on the wall tool and before i start just going to town drawing it i will choose instead of having basic wall generic 200 millimeters i will choose a thicker one actually the one that that we should be using is like 400 500 millimeters but we don't have it in in this drop down list so i will probably just just say yeah screw it let's do 300 millimeters who cares right but usually you when working in an office you do have a library that office itself has a library of walls that that office uses right um and and then you can just choose from from that library here it's just generic stuff so yeah sure we will just use generic stuff so 300 millimeters it is um i believe in in sweden it's it's right now the regulation is around you can't get away with walls that are thinner than around 500 millimeters due to heat insulation being so so thick but i might be wrong about that at least at least in the baltic region it's it's 500 millimeters but 300 is fine here um okay so we have our wall type then we have our location line and also it's it's kind of the mostly used settings are kind of here in the in the top row uh where it basically asks for what kind of height the wall should have um what's the location of the line so let me explain how how that works so to determine height of the wall let's do unconnected right so it's it's height and it's unconnected right and the the unconnected height from level one upwards here is set to be eight hundred eight thousand millimeters so eight meters right um and so that's fine that's fine for us right now because i'm just showing you how it works um but the nice thing about it is that you can have it connected to the second floor right so if you change the height of the second floor the height of the wall will change as well i will show that in just a second uh for now let's have it unconnected eight 000 location of the line center line so if it's center line and i start drawing a wall you can see that it draws as if that that line through which i draw the wall is right in the middle of the wall so i don't really need that i don't really want that um i want the wall to go inwards here right so instead of a center line i will say finish face exterior right and then i'll start start drawing the wall as if it's not as if but i will start drawing the wall clockwise so that the exterior is is is on the outside like that like that so i'm just kind of snapping it that's it right we have we have our wall if i check it in 3d i kind of look at it that's our wall that we just drew and it's exactly eight meters high right let me jump back to level one you just uh see a few more uh a few more settings that that can be changed so let me delete that all together um grab the wall tool again um and and continue on with with the with the settings so here we have a chain chain is basically once you finished drawing one segment of the wall it will ask you to continue drawing the other segment and then the other and then the other right so it chains segments of the wall like a polyline it basically works like a polyline rather than a line tool offset is basically let's say 250 ml offset from where we draw and that's the bad offset let's say offset minus 250 to the other side so you can see it draws the wall with an offset of 250 millimeters from our reference line so that's uh sometimes handy uh this time it's not so let me yeah okay so offset um resets itself to zero if you escape out of the tool radius um have no idea what the radius is we can actually check yeah it's a little bit laggy ah okay so radius is basically a fillet of the wall so we don't really care about the radius at least for for for my example i will not be using any fillet corners and joint status allow or disallow it's basically when you make a corner of two walls do you want them to merge into one uh one geometry or not geometry but would should all of the layers inside of the walls kind of merge together nicely so i always have it set to be allowed all right let's actually do do something let's draw something because this is getting boring so i'll go to the website and here i will just quickly read that um we have three clients to choose from right annabelle which is an arts curator uh brian which is a car enthusiast or clementine which is a musician and i think i will go for animal in in for this particular tutorial just because i don't a or annabelle um and b for brian huh so annabelle is an arts curator and is looking to expand her gallery she wants the ground floor of her house to be open to public and should work as a small art gallery exhibition area she will live above this gallery so all other floors need to be private okay her stylistic preference is minimalist which with occasional strong color accents she has she has a cat no family so that will help us determine the the the living room or bedroom area and and so on okay uh first floor public second floor private uh gallery in the first floor um all other floors are living spaces easy let's jump back to revit and let's let's plan this out so you have a street here right and you have people walking along and you have you want this area to be the arts gallery right so i will say i will say the arts gallery itself is going to be or rather the entrance is going to be pushed in a little bit from the street so that there can be like a small gathering before an arts exhibition opening or something like that people like to go outside and smoke and have a chat and not stay indoors that much so you do need a little bit of space in the front right you don't want them to just be standing here on the street so i will be insetting this uh this building a little bit inwards uh to do that i need one more grid line because i like to keep things tidy so i will choose my grid tool here and instead of drawing the grid line i will do one one fancy not fancy but one additional like thing with it which is instead of here instead of drawing a line a grid line from point to point oh by the way sorry forgot when you hover your mouse over a tool it will show you what that tool does very handy um i will choose this tool right here pick lines the clients will help me determine from where do i from which line do i create a new grid line right and then i will say that actually i will my plan is to pick line b this this grid line here right come on okay it doesn't let me but that's fine it at least it lets me pick the the street uh straight line that's fine as well so i will be using this line here and i will be offsetting it inwards by i don't know 1.5 meters something like that i think 1.5 should should do the trick yeah let's do 1.5 ish uh meters so i am picking the line with this tool and here when where it says offset i will choose 1500 for the offset right and then i just pick this line and already without clicking it already shows me where it's going to place the line if i want to place it on the other side by the way i can i can just type in minus 1500 and it's going to place it on the other side okay so click that's it create a third um why is there's uh no no no no no no sorry about that for some reason there there was um grid line d as well i don't want that again grid quick line 1 500 um come on down okay there we go so now i just created one gridline that there was a i explained it to too much and i made too many gridlines um right so we have that oh right that's why that's because i keep clicking on it without actually looking that i'm still creating gridlines so this is how you can create gridlines quite fast with that offset offset tool but we don't need that so i will just be deleting all of these and i'll be just looking at gridline e which i'll pull back i'll pull back this one here create a tick mark uh not put the tick mark down red line e that's actually not e that is the new b grid line i wonder if it's going to let me do that no it doesn't i first need to change the grid line b here to c and this one is going to be gridline there we go we're good okay so that's going to be the inset of my um of my floor not my floor but off of my first floor walls let's actually let's create the walls right so bam walls uh finish face exterior great chain great let's just do it bam bam bam bam bam and yes i know it's right now unconnected but we are fine with that okay so we have done that right and if i take a look at it in 3d view bam there we go we have our our walls uh here shown and they are exactly eight meters high which is way too much but that's that's okay we'll fix that by the way if you don't like this wireframe view it's not wireframe line uh hidden line view if you don't like this hidden line view you can always go here to the oh wait there we go you can always go here to the bottom of the window and click on visual style hidden line here and choose shaded for instance and then you'll see the shaded view i just prefer to keep it clean at the start so i just use the hidden line view okay we have that done so now i want to actually create um actually connect sorry not create but actually connect these walls to level two right so that if i need to for some reason change the height of level two i can layer down the line so i will do that by first of all i need to create level two because here i only have level one right the ground floor level uh so i need to create level two and the way you do it is by actually um describing it or marking it out in the elevation view or in a section view so to do that first of all we need to create a section view or an elevation view and this is where actually creating views before the design starts start uh actually makes sense right um so let's do that um i will go to view here view and i'll choose to create an elevation view actually i'll make two of them one for the back side of the building and one for the front side right so elevation click that's in the view tab elevation click and it's basically asks me would i like to attach it to a grid and not not really i don't really care about attaching it to the grid i'll just do something like this right place it like that and it immediately looks at the at the facade that i've made and i'll do the same thing for the side here maybe a little bit further down there we go so we have two elevations here one and two and i can actually rename them as well sorry i first want to move move this bad boy away so these are basically the points from which we start looking at elevations or rather elevation markers um i will select my table sorry my table is falling apart okay so i will select one of them and i'll just take a look at what what can be what can be done with it so there are two ways of how you can select it first one is let me zoom in first first way to select it is if you select the circle right if you select the circle there's not much that you can that you can change here right you can kind of add a type and and choose a different and you even choose yeah you can kind of choose a different style for for this markup but other than that nothing else um well you can add more elevations from that point but we don't care about it uh yes please delete it okay um but what we do care about is this little arrow here this black arrow once we select the arrow then we have a lot of things that are going on first of which if we zoom out we can see this box here uh partially dashed line box partially blue line box that's uh that has appeared so this box right here basically tells us how wide the elevation is going to be right that view that we are going to generate how wide is it going to be so i'm going to take that and i'm going to push it to be quite narrow up until here and quite narrow up until here right because that's all we need we just need it to be there and so so that's the width and these two arrows here are the depth so if i click and drag on those i can say that i actually want to see it in my elevation view i want to see the background building if it's going to show up but i do want to see it right so i am kind of describing how far we are going to see that's one i'll do the same thing for the other one i'll change the width like that and the length like that should be good enough you can change the length uh any way you want as long as you know you show the stuff that you want to show um i will just rename them because i think that's that's kind of important so let me just see which one is which actually uh yeah it will from time to time it will ask you to save the project sure i will just click on save and here i just double clicked on elevation 2a and i'll just drag it out so sorry i i'm doing it automatically sorry um when you have uh double clicked on either elevation one a or elevation two a doesn't matter once you double clicked on them uh for the first time they will generate the view right so once the view has been generated it's going to kind of load up faster um and let's say elevation one a you can see this border that's clipping out or clipping away our view so i will select that border and i will drag on these these dots here i i'm able to drag it so that i can see more of this border or within this border like that and the width i will not be messing around too much with the width that's fine and maybe we can get away with something like this so this narrow thing right here is going to be our building and if i look at it in 3d view i can see that um okay i can see that we do see a balcony here and in 3d view i can see balcony is there that means that elevation 1a is actually our street elevation and elevation two a is going to be our uh garden elevation i don't know backside elevation so i will just extend come on higher it's a little bit laggy but that's fine that's that's not a big deal there we go so elevation 2a is our back elevation so i will actually rename them because i think that's important you can right click on elevation 1a or you can just single click on its name and choose to rename it to street elevation come on elevation and then elevation 2a is going to be back elevation there we go that's it so we have that done and now back to back to what we we had before uh we we need to specify our uh levels right in in the elevations actually now uh let's let's create a section or rather two sections first and then we will do the levels so back to level one here we do have two elevations already prepared now let's create two sections so section markup or rather section is generated through the view tab as well it's under section here if i click on it it basically just asks me to give it uh a line right draw a line uh through which we will cut uh so i will draw just draw a line right through the middle of the building like so and can i click on that yes i can okay so right in the middle of that line you can see the zigzag here if i click on it then i can then i'm able to kind of drag away that section line away from the building i don't want it to be present inside of the building because i'm going to be designing uh like walls in it and i don't want the section line to get in the way okay so that's our section it kind of works in the similar way as our elevations you have you know how wide it is and also how deep it is right so here i'll just specify the depth like so yeah i think that's that's good so that's our section a a right and i can i can rename it and so on we will do that i think a little bit later uh i'll just call it section one for now i'll keep it as section one if we take a look at it it's nothing too fancy you know it's just a bunch of a bunch of lines nothing nothing more nothing fancy at all just move it up here we go perfect okay um so so that is done that's our section one and let's do section two across section so bam bam and i will be repositioning the sections uh later of course uh so that they show more uh and that that i'm not cutting at awkward places but for now just having everything here i think is great so so that you don't forget okay so we have that section two is also generated let me just make it nicer bam right now it's not it's not gonna look nice but that's fine we will make it look nice layer down the line okay almost there we will be finishing up by creating floor floors so level one is here and as i mentioned before you can add more levels as long as you're in either elevation or a section view so in elevation view i will just go to wait where is it architecture oh yeah sorry it's under architecture in the architecture tab it's level right so it's not under view tab it's under architecture tab level as a level to the model okay so the way i'm going to work with this is i will be rebuilding right now i've been using the gener generic levels i will just rebuild all of the levels from scratch which is going to be easy uh quite quite fast so level here and i will just say my first level right doesn't it snap oh there we go it does snap so there's like two lines here i need to make sure that i'm snapping to the correct one why are there two lines here let me see three oh okay so the two lines are there because my plate here my ground plate has a thickness of course so that's why in let's say street elevation or that doesn't matter back elevation uh we see these two lines right that that's the thickness of the ground so i do need the first one the top one to work as my ground floor level from here to here it says level three but that's that's that's fine that's fine uh level three is okay i'll hit escape and we will be renaming them either way that's level three then i will choose to rather than drawing i'll choose to use the pick lines tool because i have a grid line here a picc lines tool and i will say offset you know by how much will we offset from here so i'm picking i'm going to be picking this level 3 line which it doesn't let me pick that well hello let me i saw you ah there we go so we will be offsetting from this line and for some reason oh okay so it doesn't let me pick the the grid line it only lets me pick lines from the mall that's fine that's okay as well um by by specifying the offset i will specify the height of my first floor right so let's go for three meters because i think that's that's just a or maybe the gallery space could be a little bit higher the ceiling height could be higher so let's go for three and a half meters so 3500 from here up there we go level four right and then then um all other spaces will be three meters high right so the ceiling height will be three meters so three meters here um three meters here let's see let's see can i fit i'm just thinking if i can fit the the whole building into three floors so first floor is going to be the gallery space which is yeah that's just used up second floor um kitchen living room bathroom third floor bedroom work work room now we we won't be able to to fit kitchen bedroom kitchen living room and bathroom into one floor so just in case i'll add a third floor here or or fourth floor and we'll see how we can kind of work around with it so that's our levels now it's time to make them nice let's escape out a bunch of times from our tool and then let's just make them nice in this in in this particular view so here i'll just make sure that they're shown on both sides even though we don't need it actually we don't need it sorry sorry don't don't do that don't do that so let's untick the right hand side and just keep it at the left hand side and then here i'm just going to rename them so i'll select level 3 and call it hello level three why do you not yeah there we go or okay let's do it this way here where it says level three i'll just click on the name of it and i'll just call it round floor would you like to rename corresponding level and views yes becomes ground floor level four is going to be first floor yes level five is going to be ah accidentally double clicked on it level five is going to be second floor don't show me this message again there we go level six third four and then we have level seven wait am i making a skyscraper let's see uh so that's first or ground floor first floor second floor third floor oh yeah and then it would be fourth floor but i can just say yeah let's keep it consistent so fourth floor okay so that's done uh let me now delete level one and the site um floor plans because we don't need them anymore level one deleted site deleted there we go now we're good to go so that's our ground floor looks like that we'll need to kind of make it nice again but that's fine then we have our second floor third floor fourth floor fifth floor uh our first floor actually the the way it's arranged here sucks so i'll just say zero dash ground floor 3500 dash first floor i hope you you understand what i'm what i'm doing here 6500 dash this is in millimeters how high each floor is then we have 9500 dash third floor and we have uh 12500 dash or floor yes to have all of them kind of stacked up nicely because it goes along the alphabetical order all right almost there not almost there we're done with the the floor plans let's see uh with adding the floor plans so now i'll make everything tidy again by just uh putting down the tick marks where uh where they need to be and cutting open the sections so that they are not in the way uh while i'm doing that questions that you will have are well usually questions that students have can you just use the wall of this building of the surrounding building rather than build your own wall here because it becomes a double wall the answer to that is no you can't you need to build your own wall um then another question would be wait yeah can you change the style of the grid axes and the elevation markups and the section markups and whatnot uh my answer to that is yes you can as long as you download the as you as long as you download them i did the styles i mean and honestly it's too much of a hassle to find a nice one and download it and get it get it going so instead my suggestion would be to just stick stick to these ones uh and if you want to make it nicer then when you plot it out when you plot this this out as a pdf uh change it in photoshop straight up i mean it's gonna take you what 15 minutes to to change all of the drawings section markups and all maybe 20 uh to change the section markups and all of the plans uh where is the tick mark there we go um but it's it's you will have full control over the style of it um yeah yeah that that's that's about it so it created a bunch of ceiling plants as well uh every time when you create a floor uh it will create a ceiling plan as well we don't care about the ceiling plans again and just to be sure that you're not going into the ceiling plans delete them because i i get so many questions about the ceiling plants and not not the ceiling plants but something is not working and then we take a look and students are drawing in in the ceiling plant trying to draw walls in the ceiling plant never works out okay back to here ground floor bam we have our walls um and here you can see that our walls are being constrained not to ground floor but rather to level one so let me let me explain this a little bit more i think i need to explain this a little bit more every geometry in rhino almost every geometry in rhino this is not rhino this is revit goddammit every geometry in revit can be and usually is attached or constrained to some other geometry or a thing an object which makes revit quite parametric in that sense if something changes other things will follow along which is nice but also it adds much more settings for you to kind of remember and know about one of those settings is base constraint so if i select this floor this is not a floor this is a wall if i select this wall right here in the ground floor plan and i choose uh i i take a look at its properties i can see that it's a basic wall it's a generic wall nothing fancy there it does have a base constraint right and it's constrained to level one that's because we drew it in level one even though level one doesn't exist here anymore it's still constrained to it so that doesn't make any sense right so we need to either redraw it in ground floor so that the bottom of the wall all always will follow the ground floor the height of the ground floor or we can just change change it here base constraint move that out find uh ground floor there we go same thing for all other ones if you hold down the control key you can select many walls at once and you can constrain all of them to ground floor so now if ground floor moves the walls will follow along then let me actually have all of them selected then you have a base offset this is basically how high does the do these walls are these walls offset from the ground floor plane right so right now it's zero meaning that they are right on the ground floor and then you have if it's 250 they'll kind of be floating 25 centimeters above the ground floor then you have top constraint which is unconnected sure and you have unconnected height so this is basically it's always going to have the same height of 8 meters and it's just going to be floating in space if you mess around with the height of the ground floor right if you want it to kind of snap to let's say first floor right up to top constraint up to level 3500 first floor then unconnected height becomes locked right and what that means is if i drag this out it's smaller like that right um and if i go to back elevation let's say so by the way you can have two views here you do something like this right so that's my 3d view of with those walls and that's my back view right so now i can say first floor elevation this guy right here instead of 3500 i can say 4000 right and see how this moved up let me do that again from 4000 i will switch this to 1500 very very small first floor but all of the walls they follow along this is super this is very very useful let's come back to 3500 okay so that's great um and let me close 3d view that's great let's jump back to our ground floor plan and continue continue working on this so by now you already have like um the the perimeter for the first floor or the ground floor now let's do the perimeter for the first floor right here right so here i want the why doesn't it show just a second okay for now we will not be doing that you will see something like this which is okay i will show you how to mess around with the view later later in the tutorials but for now you don't really see in the first floor you don't see the walls which are in the ground floor that's fine because we have these grid axes here and they are here for a reason right so with these grid axes here i will probably specify i i will just draw another perimeter for me to work with so i will create a wall and here is going to be a generic wall it's going to start from the first floor perfect um it's going to be actually not unconnected so i can either specify it here or here doesn't matter so it's not going to be unconnected it's going to be connected to the second floor since i'm drawing it in the first floor right the second floor um and it's going to be finished face exterior that's fine yeah nothing else needs to be changed and then i'll just draw it here and this one i will draw full perimeter um oh that's not the full perimeter that's too much of a period okay let me try it again wall yes to the second floor that's perfect uh we draw it from here to here just make sure that you snap to the correct um that you snap to the correct points there we go bam that's it hit escape a bunch of times let's take a look at it in 3d view boom how it looks like in in 3d view right so i have a little bit of a of a nook here or for people to catch a catch a break during a gallery opening or something like that also it's nice it's always nice to have something inside when it's raining so that when you get a tumble for your keys and so on you don't need to stand in the rain okay so we have that done actually maybe i want this to be yeah let's do one thing so now i'm designing i know sorry bear with me i will create a grid line an additional grid line so i'll select i'll choose that i'm going to pick lines and my offset is going to be 1500 again and i'll just offset from grid line a a new grid line which is grid line d and then in the first floor no first floor is fine first layer is fine in the ground floor i will actually take this wall and i'll move it i don't know if i can yes i can there we go i'll just move it to grid line d perfect okay so the reason why i did that is now i have a possibility to do a balcony here right or for my second floor which is great that's exactly what i want okay let's jump back to okay so ground floor is fine right now i'm just blocking out the basic volumes right as as i'm as i'm moving forward with this so that's ground floor first floor is here second floor for the second floor so that's a balcony do we do one more balcony here do we make it smaller and smaller that's the question let's do it simple okay so here i'll just create a wall uh that's gonna be yeah locked to the third floor and i'm just going to say from here to here nothing fancy from here to here to here to here here something like that that's good i won't even show you that third floor and third floor i'm thinking of creating one more grid line and doing an offset of two meters uh yeah picking the line doing an offset of two meters inwards so that it kind of lines from grid line a to grid line e here and the reason why i do two meters is how did i know that it's two meters for alignment is first of all it's it's always done in increments of 50 centimeters right these kind of building offsets and so on usually around 50 centimeters and here it's mere uh one meter 500 so i just assume that it's going to be one more step so that that becomes two meters um oops don't need that grid line okay so here i'm thinking of having it okay so we're drawing a wall but it's going to be a super small one like that okay let's take a look at it in 3d oh and uh sorry i need to make sure that it's up to level four okay great so it is locked to level four now um so this is how it looks the the block out how the blockout looks like that's not good that's a pretty ugly yeah i hate that 1400 no sorry uh 1440 centimeters okay so what if we do straight up 10 meters it's probably not going to be enough huh all right that's actually yeah but then you put on a roof and so on so it becomes shitty again we will need to kind of take a closer look at that and see if if it if it looks bad with the roof on but for now this is how this is how it looks that's our block out okay let's uh create some floor slabs right because right now if i take a look at a section of it um and let's just shade it real fast shade that section dash or save the project um you don't really see any any floor slabs that's because we of course you don't see any floor slabs that's because we haven't created any the so let's create some floor slabs i'll show you how to so i'll come back to ground floor and usually you don't really need to create a floor slab from the for the ground floor for a proposal level uh project because it's already on the ground but uh whatever let's go to architecture tab and let's choose floor here floor and it's going to ask us to basically what kind of floor do we want so 1500 is a little bit thin um i'm thinking more about well let's let's see this is only three meters well yeah around three meters actually the thousand five hundred is not that thin that's fine let's use that and here i can either draw a boundary line or i can pick walls right so i can just click click click click that's easy right just picking walls uh or i can pick lines as well you know as long as you create a perimeter it's going to make a floor slab inside of that perimeter this tool does that it's really really simple how it works so yeah let me just hit finish editing mode that's it that's our floor slab right there um right same thing for first floor actually let's take a look at this section so the floor slab goes down into the ground which is fine there are going to be things that we will need to kind of investigate with with the other uh with the the first floor also why are you you need to be here and you need to be gone there we go so let's do first floor because it's going to be a little bit more tricky due to the balcony and the cantilever here first floor there we go a floor slab and here we have a balcony right remember that we hope you do we have a balcony here and we have a cantilever here so let's see how we can do this i will just pick lines for now and i'll just say this this this and this these four lines here except lines cannot intersect each other um continue okay so it doesn't let me uh intersect the lines that's fine i can just draw the lines myself that's okay let me cancel quit uh are you sure you want to discard four yes uh so i will just do it again this time i'll choose floor and instead of picking lines i will just draw my own line um like that that like that easy right so i'm just using the line tool once i'm done i hit the accept button here uh would you like walls to go up to this floor's level to attach to its bottom would you like ah would you like walls that go up to this floor's level you attach to its bottom attach i don't know okay so we have our floor slab here um this is sketchy let's look at it in this section actually looks good okay looks looks not not that bad looks fine uh this one though this should extend to the outside of well not really it shouldn't it shouldn't extend to the outside of the wall but oh me i know i know i know i know how we're going to deal with this so let me explain this wall and this wall and this floor make a very awkward connection here what we want is we want this wall to go into the ground as if it was a foundation block and we could do foundation blocks i know but i'm lazy so i'll just extend these walls so let's go to ground floor and select these floors and where it says um base offset i'll say minus 500 millimeters hit apply go to section one and now they offset downwards by minus 500 millimeters so we have foundation blocks kinda good enough for this kind of project um one two three three more or rather two more floor slabs and the roof but i will make a flat roof so it's i'm just going to use a floor slab to to make a flat roof um or should i make a angled roof i'll do both i'll show you how to make an angled roof and then i will make a flat roof afterwards so second floor there we go let's do floor and here it's going to be very straightforward it's just going to be picking walls because there's no cantilevers there's no balcony so i'm just picking floors uh picking walls attached um highlighted walls are attached to but miss the highlighted targets yeah sure okay let's see sometimes it gives you errors but i think we are ah that's why so we don't want to attach huh let's let's investigate investigation time so the reason why this happened so that's fine that's okay but this is not uh the reason why this happened is that these walls the bottom ones i think or maybe the top ones now the bottom ones the bottom walls had to move down since we said to attach they moved down to let the floor slab in but the problem is that the floor slab only reaches the inside of the walls not the outside so honestly i'm going to fix it by detaching here let me ctrl z delete let me do it again actually i could have just left it as it is but i want to show you um how to do it so floor this time i'm going to yeah sure i'll i'll pick walls again intercept but here i'll say don't attach right and now technically yeah now it's fine and in this section it also looks fine good we fixed it now this is going to be a little bit more tricky but we'll make it we'll make it believe i believe so third floor the floor slap is going to go up until here up until grid line a while the walls end here so we get one more balcony and also here we get a balcony or do we wait i don't remember yeah so we got two balconies here we get a lot of balconies we need to take a look at that later on um so in third floor i'm going to create a floor which is going to which is going to go between grid line a and grid line c with this one right here okay so let me just draw it uh it's it's just going to be faster to just draw draw it like that there we go except this time we attach i believe yep um let's take a look at it in the section yeah that's good enough i think yeah okay so that that that that looks good so we have our our volume here um can i and this is our volume with the shadows not much to so you can turn on the shadows by clicking on the shadow icon of course i wonder how do you how do you change this yeah send settings there we go send settings um top left now sign settings up left and there we go not much is going on but you know kind of helps you understand the volume a little bit better maybe maybe i don't know okay so we have that let us continue um so there are two more things that i'm gonna do and then we will finish up this portion of the tutorial um tutorial number one so i am going to show you how to make a roof so making a roof is going to be quite fun let's let's jump to let's jump to the third floor no the fourth floor that's our where our roof is going to be and i just need to know so our walls go between e and b and they reach here so it's it's between e and it's between b so here we have our floors by the way if you are tired of kind of playing detective and not seeing it you can go to view range here view range and choosing that the view depth how deep do you see uh goes a little bit a little bit deeper so let's say unlimited sure unlimited view depth hit apply hit okay and now you will see the the floors all of the floors below below fourth floor so now you see the the walls here um and we will add a roof so this is going to be an angled roof click there we go and it's basically uh it's the same way as drawing a floor slab right you just choose um for instance the walls click click click click like that and here you can choose not there we go so here you can choose what kind of sorry um having having a stroke i think here you can choose what kind of angle the roof will will have so now i'm just kind of clicking on all the walls and hitting accept and this is the roof and if we take a look at it in 3d uh it's the ugliest roof that you could that you could find let me just try to snap it there we go that's done um let's take a look at it there it is so there's a lot of problems with it right the main one being that it's there there's this kind of very weird gap where the the walls end and the roof begins that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever right so so that's that's bad of course um and other things are what if you don't want all all of these slopes to be like that right what what if you want um a roof like this right uh can can you control it of course you can right so i'm going to do it again but this time i'm going to show you how do you fill how do you not make this this ugly gap here right so i'll delete the roof and i'll create a new one roof there we go roof and i'll just choose by the way you need you can choose what kind of a roof you want is it concrete is it uh generic i'll just see generic doesn't matter um and here instead of choosing the walls i will choose to just draw a line i i that's what i prefer to do that that that come on and that's why we save by the way there we go such a mess that oops slightly messed it up but that's fine we will fix it and i mean that point there we go oh my god when you zoom in okay so while this is like when you zoom in too much it's going to redraw the whole model at a higher detail and that's why it lags um i absolutely hate that thing about revit but they insist on doing it so yeah whatever okay so here i just need to move those i'll just need to move that point but that's fine uh for now let's just accept it and this is how the the roof looks like now a little bit better why is it sticking out here why is it is it sticking out it is sticking out did i mess up i think i messed up i think i anchored it to the wrong no i didn't wait so it's not sticking out here what about section two and it is indeed sticking out here but it's sticking out here because i messed up the other side oh yeah that's of course that that's why uh that's because i i misclicked on the other side while i was right here so this is the part that's sticking out so let's fix it you can double click on the roof and then you can change the change the points where where they are that uh cancel how are you even joined don't don't lie to me okay or or you can just draw it again because it's faster oh my god to do it that way okay so let's draw it again click click this time don't mess up click click click there we go okay we have our clean room roof right uh now i'm going to click on this modify icon here so that i can select my um um lines and notice how here we have the angles so i can define um the angles of all of the slopes of each individual slope of the roof so here by default it's set to 30 but what if we do 75 for this side 75 for this side and then these are going to be dasher let's let's do 75 here as well why not why not this is gonna be fun okay so we hit uh finish we take a look at it and that's our new roof great so that's with 75 degree angle again uh not the roof that we want so let's double click on it again or not let's double click on it again there we go and let's mess around with it even further so these icons right here specify which lines define slope right and if i select one of these lines let's see this one it will have a tick mark here that says define slope so for instance if i were to choose this line and say that it doesn't define slope and choose this line and also say and tick the part that says define slope so that it doesn't define slope here as well and change this to something more reasonable let's say 45 degrees and this one change this to 45 degrees as well hit accept now we have a proper you know a proper roof just like this one right well the the walls are disconnected from it but other than that i think it's fine so actually that's that's important how do we connect the walls to the roof so what we can do is we can go to the third floor and we can choose the walls that we want to connect like that we choose these walls right and we want to say yo extend these walls until they attach to the roof so attach so i'll go to when i have this wall selected i'll choose this tool attach top base like that and then i'll just simply click on the roof so you might need to change your view or something like that or just have two views opened and click on the roof and click on the roof there we go so then it attaches and then you yeah you hit escape a bunch of times and take a look at it and uh yeah that's good that's that that's good that's uh that's a wall that's attached to the roof right so that's uh that's how you work with a sloped roof nothing too fancy right another thing is how do you work with a flat roof and this one i i prefer um i just i don't know i i prefer flat roofs so i'll delete this right so immediately the walls come back to being normal because they don't have anything to to attach to and instead in the fourth floor i'll just create a floor right i'll just create a floor i will just choose um i'll just pick walls i think yeah let's just do it super simple pick walls intercept uh would you like two walls to go up to this floor no no we don't we want to keep it as it is so don't attach uh would you like to join geometry cut the overlapping volume out of the walls up yeah sure whatever okay and we're gucci so ah battery no no battery come back i wonder it's going to be alive now right there we go hey okay good um where was i oh yeah one last thing is i am going to be doing concrete railings um so i'm going to be showing that how to do you know for these balconies of course they need railings uh so i'm going to be doing concrete railings uh you might want to do you know regular railings that's that's fine as well it's just remember that by default revit has really really ugly rails so you know take it with caution right use that tool with caution i will show that in in the next tutorial but for now concrete railings those are basically walls right nothing nothing fancy so let's take a look uh i will need a a railing on the third floor two railings actually on the third floor there and there and also i'll need a railing on the first floor yes first floor railing in the garden view and a third floor railing okay so let's start with first floor first ah that's a tank twister first floor railing uh right here right and i'll just grab a wall this time i don't need a 30 centimeter wall um i'll just be using um block work maybe now let's go for generic uh 140 millimeters yeah that that's fine so basic generic wall 140 mil um finish face exterior height this time it's going to be unconnected and it's going to be the height of the railing so um let's go for a meter a meter is a little bit low for railing but i think that's fine usually it's 1.1 let's go for 1.1 there's no um there are cats there so i don't know why i said that doesn't matter okay so we do have our railing there oh it even has an ugly hatch oh i don't like that hatch i wonder if we can get rid of it hidden line so this happens sometimes uh not sometimes it's usually the case that uh certain types of geometries have certain times of representation you know in certain drawings so this one in particular has this ugly ugly brick work hatch which we can i believe fix okay first of all let me escape no i don't want to make a floor quit i think cannot be under yes okay uh so if i select this is going to be me actually investigating how to get rid of that hatch if i select all of these walls and i add a type so i click on edit type here we have the graphics and maybe here i can choose to not have a hatch yeah no pattern hit ok hit apply yeah that that doesn't care that doesn't care at all uh there's one more thing that i could do at the type basic wall structure added structure concrete messing i believe it's somewhere here so that's thermal and that's concrete masonry so i could change change it here with this block or sorry this this that's cut pattern surface pattern i could change it here but i really don't want to really really don't want to let's leave it let's leave it as it is for now um yeah let's not mess around with that sorry for that intermission uh hope you didn't get too bored with me um let's add more uh walls here i can't look at it i'm just going to to change it i'm just going to change its type so i'm going to select these walls and just do foundation generic 200 ml i could do 200 ml or 135 yeah there we go okay so i'm i've just chose a different different type of uh wall for that okay so now let's draw a wall not masonry but rather 135 mil wall from here to oh it goes along the center line no no no no no no no so we will need to switch it push it around yeah yeah save project um so it goes along finish face exterior it goes along it's unconnected it's 1100 no yes 1100 it's chained has this type perfect that's all we need and then we just draw it straight up bam bam bam enter that's drawn and then we have another we have it in another site notice how i'm not creating any geometry whatsoever in the in the 3d view yeah that's that's how you work with revit so here i'm going to draw up am i in the floor escape out of that sorry about that draw walls from here uh oops that was my bad a long long there we go enter so we have our railing here as well all right i think we are we're fine i think we're good with with the with the geometry so far uh one last thing that i want to show you before we finish up uh for today for this tutorial is as you probably can tell i'm not a big fan of the user interface of revit and the clunkiness of it um so one last thing that i want to show you is called a a section box and for that i need to go to so so if i in 3d view if i actually don't want to see all of this crap right especially here what the hell are you delete there we go if i don't want to see all of this crap i can just create a section just a small section of the building itself right so in 3d so i can do that by going to modify yeah i can go to modify tab i can select all of the objects here all of the objects and i can click on this icon right here which is called selection box bam so it will create this kind of a box for me around my everything that i have selected and i can once i select that box i can click and drag the side sides of it right so that i only i only see my building and also that's that's a good way of how to investigate uh the inside of the building so my box is a little bit you know the angle is not that great so let me just switch it to top view here real fast in 3d by just clicking on the on this icon right here top and i will just rotate what the oh it rotates around that that point why um again we do it again rotate this time i will actually look at the tools here so i'll say center of rotation place i will place the center of rotation here perfect and i will rotate it like so bam that's good enough right um that's it uh then we can go back to our 3d view by just clicking on this you know dragging on on on this box here not box yeah it is a box right on the top right hand side and now i can mess around by just moving in the section box and looking at my at my geometry right and that's my block out for now i will change the angle of the sun do i even care i don't care so boston sure i'll just change the time lie okay that's 5 p.m that's my bad 12 no morning no even more yeah that's night time right uh summer solstice apply 9 a.m good eight that's that's even better okay so now the sun is shining inside of my um inside of my building through this section okay i think that's that's good enough for for for today uh so the task is right now after you've watched tutorial one to make this kind of a block out very basic block out of the volumes that you're going to have in the you know in between squished in between those two buildings that you are going to put function in uh into tomorrow so that's that's the task um for those of you who are not sure how you'll manage to fit in you know the bedroom and and whatnot um i would suggest just taking a piece of paper or autocad or whatever and just drawing out the plan basic basic plans you know with the staircases and whatnot just to know what you what you actually want to do right what you actually want to accomplish here i am not doing that just to save time um so my building is going to be worse uh much much worse than your buildings right so other than that i think we are um we're done here go get to work and i'll see you tomorrow so in part one we have finished doing the block out so this is what i would call uh you know a good enough block out for us to start detailing so we basically have the whole proportion going and everything seems to be in order in this regard so now uh what i want to do is i want to focus on um shall we go for doors and windows perhaps yeah let's go for doors and windows so i'll show you different techniques and different ways on how you can create doors and windows in your revit file so to begin let's add a door let's add an entrance door to our building i'll go to ground floor here and actually at this stage i really like doing like i really like splitting um this view into two so here i have my 3d view and my ground floor view right these two views if you don't see a 3d view just double click here right and it will open up the 3d view for you so we have these two tabs these two views and basically what i want to do is i just want to take this 3d view and drag it away all right like so so now it's like a separate window that is not docked anywhere and then just taking it and dragging it to the side like so will eventually show me this right this blue rectangle once i see this blue rectangle i will release my mouse button and then this 3d view gets docked so now i'm working in two views at the same time or rather i see two views at the same time which is super convenient so let me just cut away that part so that's my box selection tool remember we are using it um and i'm using it to just cut away the bits that i don't need i'll maybe even cut deeper into into these surrounding buildings just so that i only see the my almost only see my building something like that okay so that is no no now that is not obscured okay so this is our entrance area uh which is which relates to this wall right here you can see once i select this wall here it will show up here get highlighted here as well and here i just want to add a door so how do you do that well you select the door tool uh well i zoomed in so now we wait there we go i click on the door tool and here before i start adding it it will ask me for what kind of door do i want so this is a single flush door 2.1 meters high 0.9 meters 90 centimeters wide this is like a typical typical door and actually there's not a lot of options here to choose from so i will be choosing the default you know the regular doorway i think that's that's absolutely fine i'll just add it do we center it probably just do it like that bam so i have just added the door and let's say um let's say i want a layer down the line i will want to add a shelf here or i will want to have a possibility to add a shelf here so we know that the shelf width is 60 centimeters so the way i do it is i will just let me just see if i can hello i'm i zoomed in too much again just give me a second give not me give right uh rabbit a second two to catch up there we go oh my god it's quite a quite a slow program ain't gonna lie not responding huh well that that calls for a coffee break zoom out there we go and i'll just click on modify here this modify button there we go i will select the door and now i can here this this dimension i can add i can write rather what kind of dimension i want instead of zero instead of the door being flush with this wall i can add 600 millimeters enter that is wrong minus 600 that is correct so the correct way as well of course and thus we now have this gap here where we will be able to put a shelf or you know a seating area anything like that usually i i do this for for a rack for clothes rack for the entrance so that's how you add a door that's that's basically it right you you just kind of do it you just add a door um another thing is adding a window so while we're still here in our entrance i i will be adding a window here in this area so it's done in a exactly same way as the door i'll select the window tool and i will choose what kind of window i want i think i'll just go for the default one because these guys have too many subdivisions i don't want that many subdivisions so i'll just use the regular one and i'll choose this the type of it so let's say that's 90 centimeters by 1.8 meters i think that's that's gonna be okay or let's do let's do 40 centimeters by 1.8 meters i think that's going to be cooler like that and here i can specify how high the window is going to be right so that's before me clicking on the wall i can specify how high this window can be or i can do that layer layer down the line that's fine as well so let me just put it in probably maybe closer to the door there we go something like that so i constantly check the dimensions to see if they are correct and 300 ml i think is fine so we end up with having the door and this kind of a narrow window inserted let me click on the modify tool again select the window and see what we can what we can change with it so the first thing is cell height and the second thing is head height right so in terms of cell height i can say well what if it's 500 millimeters hit apply see the window just moves up and then the head height updates as well so now let's say i want the window to be aligned the height the top of the window rather to be aligned with the door the way i do it is i will just select the door and just double check so the head height of the door is 2.134 meters so if i select the window and here for the head height i type in two one three four hit apply ah yes of course it gets aligned it does get aligned with the door but i forgot the how is that called the framing the framing of the door and i assume the framing of the door is like um that looks like five or maybe ten centimeters no that's definitely not 10. so that looks like a 5 centimeter framing so i will just add 5 centimeters to this head height which is going to be a total of 2184 millimeters and that looks right i think maybe not yeah we're one centimeter away two one nine four i could just yeah probably i should do this i could just kind of select the door right and go to edit type and find the trim extension here so apparently trim width is set to be 76 millimeters so i will just change it to 50. apply so now it is indeed 5 centimeters and now if i change this back to 2 1 8 4 apply there we go now they are aligned so it's a little bit fiddly uh edit type lets you edit the type of the door itself so you can make adjustments to how the door looks like same thing for the window um right so we have that done now uh nothing too fancy but you know it is it it it is working so that's good um and that's what we will visit that partly ah no never mind that's that's the surrounding building so that's not not an issue um so that's basically how you add doors and windows right nothing too fancy by the way if you want to change the type of a window once you have inserted it you can same thing for the door so you just select the window you go to prop you go to the properties tab and you just choose a different type right bam it changes and now we need to fish out which one yeah it was this one good um so that is that in terms of let me do it again for the for the other side just so that we are on the same page and everyone is following along or rather maybe i want this to be full glass right this whole area perhaps i want it to be full glass i can do that by first carving out a hole in the wall and then adding what's called the curtain curtain curtain wall inside of that opening so to do an opening to create an opening you can either create a vertical or a horizontal opening and the vertical opening is just called a wall opening nothing fancy and the horizontal one or rather maybe i should call this the vertical one so the shaft is a vertical opening while the wall opening is horizontal right so yeah again the the shaft is is you carve away from what's called floor slabs and ceilings and roofs with wall opening you carve away from the wall so i will just select that tool which will basically ask me to what does it ask me that's a rectangular opening in a straight uh or curved wall so for that i probably need to do it in 3d right or maybe we can do it in 2d let's see click no click yes okay so it's basically two clicks uh let me do that again because this was a a bit dodgy uh wall opening click click click there we go so you select the wall and you see then you say from where do you start opening and where do you end so here it's it's a little bit wonky um you can see how what kind of hole it made but we can make a bunch of adjustments uh later um that's that's going to be easy to do and that layer is now actually so let me click on modify and here you can see that i can select the opening the shaft i can indeed select it and i can change its measurements right so here i want a precise measurement of three meters let's see if that's gonna gonna work yeah it is gonna work and i want it to be centered right so that's 103 and that's 97 that doesn't work i'll just do 100 by 100 right so 3 meters 10 centimeters 10 centimeters so we have this this opening here and the height of it right i can change the height of it as well so first things first let's check the the bottom so the bottom here the base offset is minus 19.2 for some reason i don't want that i will just say base offset is zero hit apply so it gets moved up a bit and then the top offset so that is from the from the first floor level you can see that top constraint is said to be up to level 3500 right so it's it's from this level here um it's being moved down by one point uh one meter eight centimeters right which is a very weird offset so actually for for this kind of window i will say uh minus minus 500 ml i think that's that's going to be okay so it gets moved closer there we go so we have our our opening here which is ready to uh accept or or now we are ready to put in a curtain wall inside of it the way we do it is we just create a wall we start creating a wall and in the properties you scroll down until you see curtain wall option right and here there's like exterior glazing storefront curtain wall so we will just be creating a regular curtain wall like that um and we will say that wall goes along the center line that's fine yeah all of that seems okay let's just start drawing it and see what happens right so this is the default settings top constraint unconnected that's fine and let me just try and draw it through the middle point of this wall from here to here there we go okay so that is done um it's basically it just created a single glass panel right now and you can see that that panel doesn't even reach the top so we need to somehow be able to reach apologies we need to reach the top of this hole and the way we do it i believe is by just no we can't well technically we can by just saying that it needs to be up to the first floor level right but the top offset needs to be the same as the top offset of our hole which we used 500 millimeters for right so it goes up to level one uh and the top offset is minus 500 millimeters hit apply it didn't change why didn't it change that's because we are still in place wall tool and not edit wall tool that's my bad sorry about that so we actually need to escape out completely so hit escape until you don't have any tools running we need to do that and then we select this glazing wall how is it called curtain wall sorry this curtain wall we selected and then here we can change the settings so that was my bad before i was changing the settings for the next curtain wall that i'm going to be creating so top constraint from unconnected i changed this to first floor and top offset i changed this to minus 500 and now it should be good to go there we go so now it's all tied up okay so we have our uh single glass piece here which is not you know it's okay but it's it's maybe not something that we necessarily want perhaps we want to have a little bit more divisions and so on of course it is it possible to make it like that technically yes but this would cost more than the rest of the building so instead let's let's add a few divisions so i am going to escape out of all of the tools and here in the architecture tab i'll find curtain grid tool so this is going to be actually once i hover my mouse over it it shows what it does it's going to separate the glass panels into a smaller panel right with a grid so curtain grid select that and here in the plan view um i am just going to kind of divide it up and i'm thinking of um perhaps we can do one meter here and one meter here right so two divisions right every one meter like that and then in the let me jump in here in the perspective view i will say that at 2.2 meters i also need a division this kind of indicates that i will have the center piece as a doorway i'm able to use it as a doorway and the doorway is not going to be like three meters high which reduces the costs dramatically so once you're done that escape escape hit escape a bunch of times once you've done that you are able to um well you will see that the glass has been separated into parts but there is no framing yet so we need to add the frames and the way you add frames is by creating millions so frames are called millions right i will select that tool mullion like that and it's going to say uh first of all what kind of mullion do do we want right it's going to ask in the properties what kind of million do we want and there's like a bunch of different options 50 by 150 ml is is a pretty intense one i want a little bit thinner one so i'll just use the 30 millimeter square million so that's a cross section it's like three by three centimeters it's super thin it's unrealistically thin but i think that's fine can we add the type of it yeah we can even add a type and we can add any thickness we want but i will stick to to the default one that's that's fine so we have our mullions and then here it asks me to select grid lines right so i can either select grid lines one by one and these divisions are grid lines they are called grid lines i can select them one by one or i can select all of them at the same time so i'm thinking of just going to town and just selecting all of them and clicking so i just selected that tool and clicked on the gridlines and now uh the framing has been placed and you can see it here as well right those those black dots that's that's the framing perhaps um let me undo ctrl z and instead let me actually use the bigger one just so that you can see better uh these these divisions so again i selected the 50 by 150 mil all grid lines select bam big boys right okay so we have our curtain wall here set up you can do the same thing for multiple uh multiple floors as well that's that's fine um you just make a larger shaft actually maybe i should should show you how to do it um can do i show you here or here maybe here let's do a glass facade right in the front of the of the building so i will go to my sorry now i'm just starting to design it i'm trying to figure out a nice nice design for this um so let's say in our first floor ah that's the wrong wrong side and now we need to wait for it to load up so first floor load it up on the right hand side no i want it here so in our first floor i will also create a a shaft opening so sorry a wall opening like that and i will create one from uh on this wall from here to here something like that but this one actually i want to be a little bit less wide so i'll just say something like this perhaps so let's go for 1.5 meters that's 1.5 millimeters that's my bad i keep forgetting too that i'm drawing everything in millimeters here um usually in rhino i do block outs in mirrors and then switch to millimeters once i do a detailed project 1500 right and this dimension needs to be zero uh can't keep elements joined that's fine i will just say unjoin elements ah but then it makes that mistake huh so this is where it it starts becoming a little bit just your regular revit things right uh let me undo and here instead of zero oops here instead of in this case instead of 300 millimeters let me write 500 something like that so we have a 20 centimeter gap here i think that's fine um let me while i'm at it let me make another shaft here from here let's see can i type in 500 oh yes i can but it lags so this is another way of how i'm creating shaft so while i'm still in shaft creation tool i am able to kind of continue adding shafts to this but it's not being cooperative at all oh that's that's my bad so i forgot that i'm creating a wall opening and not a shaft so i accidentally cut away from the floors not from the wall oopsie control z uh disregard yes save the project sure okay we're back i'm ah sorry let me just create a wall opening not a shaft opening i will show you how to create a shaft opening in just a second but now we are just creating wall openings like that modify select this and here we just start typing in the dimensions so this one is going to be like 600 mil and it's going to be let's say or actually here this dimension is going to be 200 mil away something like that yeah i think that's gonna look okay and now it's just the height right i need to i i need to fix the height of it so i'm just going to select the first shaft opening and i'm going to say that the top constraint of it is up to the third floor like that and the top offset is um let's go for zero hit apply doesn't cut huh that's weird i wonder why perhaps it's because i made it in wait yeah that's understood that's because these are two separate walls right and this guy this shaft opening can only cut through the one so that but that's that's not a problem i will just move it down and i will say that the the constraint is the second floor top offset is zero apply hit apply same thing for this one not for this one or for this one top offset zero apply there we go and now we just need these two uh shaft openings to go to the second floor as well so i'm just going to do it manually real fast so let me jump to the second floor that's 20 that's 20 that's 60. don't remember this one but we'll figure it out uh should be good uh so let me just drag this one in here second floor there we go and i'll do this as fast as i can once this stops lagging while opening on this wall from here to here from here to here okay we have two wall openings this one is 200 mil this one is probably thousand five hundred um oh so that then it changes this 200 and this one i don't know i don't know this dimension but that's fine because we will get it by changing this so this one is 600 that is 200 and then automatically that dimension kind of locks in place in being 700 so now we have one more shaft that's great and all we need to do is just say that top offset of it is zero like that and that our top offset is zero as well apply uh why is this higher than oh this one is also that uh so sorry we need to move it down a bit because we are going into the floor slab so the floor slab is 150 millimeters wide or or thick so the top offset actually needs to be minus 150 apply so that we're not going into the floor slab um this one come on come on just let me there we go minus 150. okay so here we have our shaft openings and i'm just going to jump back into first floor where i'm just going to create the the curtain wall again wall architectural curtain wall from here to here and then from here to here right so we have our our walls modify um so sometimes it creates a wall inwards in inside like in in the wrong direction so the way you fix it is by you don't really see it on the screen but there are two arrows here which let you change the orientation of the wall right so you can switch them up so i'll do that i will switch the orientation of these walls uh then i just need to for the first one i just i will just go to top constraint and see that actually it's to the third floor not the second floor and the top offset is actually minus 150 due to the thickness of the floor slab same thing for here top offset minus 150 up to level three apply there we go so we have our two curtain walls set up now all i need to do is just just add a grid again to them um so here i'll just add one division one vertical division here i don't need to add any vertical divisions right and then i'll jump into 3d and just hovering my mouse over the vertical edge of the curtain the curtain wall i am able to add horizontal divisions so i'll probably add probably add a division here thousand five hundred year thousand five hundred and it doesn't really let me add 1500 here but this seems okay um and then same thing here a thousand five hundred thousand five hundred bam 1500 or 1425 that's fine so we have our grids set up and then i'll go to modify tab or to i'll click on the modify button i'll click on million and do the same thing you know rectangular million all grid lines i'll choose the button that says all grid lines and see that all of these need rectangular millions right and these also need rectangular moles so now all of this is kind of done it's kind of set up right we have our uh our facade done last thing that i want to do i will not be messing around with the back side back side would also probably i would add a curtain grid of some sort i will instead just add a doorway and a window here in the in the top so let me go to the let's go here let me go to the third floor come on load up there we go third floor bam bam bam still loading there we go door regular door just add it probably 600 ml again something like that so we have our door and then click on modify window add a window also like a narrow window um 300 millimeters away from the door like that what the hell was uh well it worked out so the window is slightly too low uh we will fix that by just adjusting the head height two one three five um for for this window is actually it needs to be to 185 that's what we remember from our previous insertion of of this window that's it right that's that's it we have um some sort of a facade it's not the greatest for sure but you know it's okay it's good enough to show you the the tools um so that is that now let's look at how can we add in door doors doorways inside of the building um not put doorways walls walls and stairs inside of the building so i'll go back to ground floor and i'll add a staircase first so that's the first thing that i'm going to do is add the staircase so this is going to be a little bit more tricky not not necessarily tricky but um i will go to the architecture tab and i'll choose stair here and here is the stair creation tool right so i am able to either create a straight staircase which is just straight up that and by the way given the height of each step and so on and the width of each step it automatically knows how long the staircase is going to be and here our um this is our settings right so right now desired number of steps is 19 so this is how many steps we want and actual thread depth is 25 so it's only 25 centimeters really maybe that's fine um i like doing 28 centimeters for for for the threads but this is a pretty small house so 25 is okay and then it automatically automatically calculates what's going to be the riser height so that's one point sorry that's 18 centimeters which is fine uh 18 is okay so usually it's 17.5 but again this is a small house so when we just do a regular straight staircase it's it's pretty straightforward right we just i can say run is location of the line is on the left hand side of the run and i can just oops not the left hand side right hand side run right from here to here bam that's it that's that's a staircase i can even show it to you here no i can't i need a section to be able to show you um can we do a section no we can't while we are while we are running the staircase the stair tool so let me open up the building a bit so that you can see better what what's going on so again stair cancel ground floor so notice how that menu popped up that was because i was in 3d view instead i will create a ground floor the staircase and ground floor view so then it won't even ask me any questions so it's there from here to ah run on the right from here to here bam just creates a staircase so there's no opening and so on but that's fine that's that's something that we will we will easily easily fix okay so that is a very simple staircase without any risers without sorry without any landings without anything like that so let me delete it and instead let's see other variations of the staircase that we can do we can do full step spiral so that's that was the straight staircase we can do a full step spiral which is basically just there we go here it fits right so it just generates a spiral staircase nothing nothing fancy about it um not really sure how how it can be used in this particular project because it eats up so much space but it is there then you have center and spiral uh which is basically you describe the center point you and then you describe the end point and you can do you know you you do the spiral staircase so it looks the same but if i were to repeat it and if i were to say um something like this and then repeat it again oh my god this is annoying ah let's just do it this way repeat it again and see something like this bam or fine oh my god i can't fit it properly so i'm struggling with it let's let's try it again uh that's going to be our center point and we will start from here half a turn like that and then this is going to be our center point we will start from here and another half a turn so it's going to make this kind of a this kind of a staircase which uh yep it is how it is it looks how it looks i know but um let me just delete it so that you don't need to look at it uh automatically whatever okay so then we have l form staircase which is quite quite convenient but it's basically just drag and drop and then once you drag it dragged and dropped it you will need to align it with with the walls of course so to align you can either rotate it so you select the tool or the thing and you rotate it like that right that's super super simple or or there is an option for aligning a line so it's going to ask you to give it a reference line so let's see this line and it's going to ask you to give it a alignment line so this line here let's see or that yeah there we go so first it's the alignment line and then there's the reference line and it's just going to snap to snap to place also kind of kind of useful uh especially in these kind of uh kind of houses because then you can um move through move below the the staircase so that might be something that you would like to look into um last one that i am going to cover is the ushape winder i guess uh so it's basically this kind of staircase right again it this one is just drag and drop and again i will just use align tool click click to just snap it to place easy um right so that's uh that's the staircases uh the default staircases rather so then you have the possibility to make your own uh well not make your own but draw your own staircase which i really enjoy so you can create runs landings and support systems which we don't care about so run is basically let's say i want my first run to be only two meters long and i want my second run to be let's take let's say it starts from here and goes um on the left hand side and goes until let's see only for a meter like that and then i have my third run which is on the right so you keep switching between left right level light to goes like so it's no problem it's going to do it right it's it's not going to be tricky at all uh it's going to automatically connect the staircases with the runs sometimes it doesn't so if it doesn't let's see if if there is a disconnect between this let me show you here in 3d as well if there is a disconnect between this run and this run right i can draw a landing either by hand or by specifying that yo please connect this this and this right so just click click and it will connect them with a run or if i want a fancy some sort of fancy shape for for my my landing then i can create a sketch create a sketch and then just draw it out so i will just say i want my landing to be a beautiful little form like this come on snap there we go bam just make sure that it's a closed uh holy line hit apply bam that's that's your that's your landing and right now it's not tied to your stairs so you would need to actually uh change the relative height of it so that it is indeed tied with with the steps so um you can do that by calculating um the the height of each step and kind of getting the the correct value for it i think like let's say 2500 here apply yeah that's close enough that's close enough so you end up with this kind of a weird run where it may it does make mistakes here uh it doesn't feel it fill it in or anything like that but it is a possibility let me delete that um yeah that's that's about it in in terms of stairs so let me just create a super simple one right now just a straight staircase um and here when i'm going to be creating it i'll just go through the go through the the settings and here i kind of want to do let's see what kind of monolithic staircase how does that look like yeah so i i do like the monolithic staircase type because it's super simple right it does exactly what i want it to do it's it's a super simple staircase so let's let's do it and i'll just do a straight line for it so let's see a person who walks in um hangs his or her coat and then is a staircase waiting for them uh on this side so i just want to give them like 1.5 let's say mirrors of space to move uh 1.5 there we go space to move uh along so so that there is like a there's no awkward awkward moments here uh the width of the staircase is one mirror um i can change it here if i want to but i think for something like this one meter is a okay there's no railing but you can add railing uh to the staircase um by just clicking this this button railing uh where you kind of choose what kind of type of railing you want um i don't know what's default let's see ma'am hello railing that's weird let me just accept this ah okay so it it did create railing once i have accepted the staircase so this kind of railing is super ugly and i don't like it so if if you don't want the railing you can always delete it straight up just delete it that fixes your your problem of not having a nice railing but now you have another problem which is people falling down your stairs so to fix it let's say uh i will just make a a wall here right for for the staircase i'll just make a wall i'll just put it in the wall the gallery owner needs a wall either way so might as well do it for them so i will create a wall and it's not going to be a curtain wall it's going to be an interior wall uh one three eight millimeter seems fine uh that's a partitioning wall and just create one here uh that is not going to be a center line i don't i can't have it as a center line finish face exterior probably nope i was wrong finish face interior like that so you always kind of mess around with the alignment alignment of the walls so i think that and then that should be a okay enter so we have this kind of a weird awkward interior wall here but we will fix it by just selecting it holding down the control key selecting both of them um and then just saying top constraint is up to the first floor and top offset is minus 150. the reason why it's minus 150 is because of the thickness of the floor slab okay great now we have now now we have some some walls here and i will probably just add architecture door just because i want to i'll just add a door here like that because you kind of want to use up the space below the the staircase for storage so we have that and that is uh good enough for or for paintings to hang and you kind of just you're you're not losing uh surface area for the gallery and that's that's the key i guess um okay so now one last thing just one last thing is that the staircases uh they don't go anywhere right once they reach the second floor they you just bump your head or the first floor you just bump your head uh we need to make a hole in the first floor to let the staircase in and to do that i will just go to first floor right here i can see that the staircase ends here that's perfect uh and i will create a shaft opening so i can either create a shaft opening or i can change the boundary of the floor itself let me show you both variations on how to do it so let's say the first variation is changing the boundary of the floor right so actually changing it in this section sometimes it's kind of hard to select the floor slab so i'll just do it in 3d view selecting the floor slab there and then continue working in the plan view so we are going to change the boundary of this floor slab so if i click on edit boundary right here i can draw lines so the pink line here is the boundary of our floor but if i let's say take a let's go for a circle circle tool and just draw out a circle right in the middle of the boundary and hit accept um this is what's going to happen right it's going to make a hole uh off of that circle so let me come back here or rather undo ctrl z um and ctrl z once more to undo the the circle and instead let me draw out the opening for the staircase so this is 3.5 meters right the ceiling height is 3.5 meters so that means if if we kind of climb up to the half of the stairs it's 1.75 meters of of clearance so that's not good that means we need um at least three more steps uh for for the clearance to be okay so that we don't bump our heads so i'm guessing if this is the middle if this line if it's the middle of the staircase i'm guessing up until here we need an opening so let me just and that's good that we have an arrow just kind of showing us that um so let me just grab a line tool and just draw one two three four five just kind of clicking five times to draw this rectangle hitting accept would you like walls that go up to this floor level to attach to its bottom would you like walls that go up to this floor's level to attach to its bottom nah don't attach don't don't don't care don't care um and yeah we have our opening now right with with our steps there is a little bit of a gap there why is there a gap there ah that's because of the discrepancy of of the riser height so it couldn't fit perfectly but oh or maybe it could no it could because this height is the same as this height okay so that's sorry that that was my bad it's all good it's all good so we have an opening for our staircase the problem now is you know and you kind of continue working on it the problem now is that you can fall down here right in the in the into this hole so we need to build up some some walls yeah sure save project always save your projects by the way so we need to build up some walls from here to here to maybe here just like that enter and then i'm just going to modify select these two walls holding down the control key and say that it's actually connected to the second floor and the top offset is again 150 apply perfect so now if i make a section through the stair steps steps i can see you know how exactly this whole thing works right so we're we're making progress right so we can access the first floor and now we have access to the to the second floor and then of course you would need to figure out a way of how to access the third floor and all of that good stuff it would probably be some sort of uh actually let me let me just show you just so that you uh get a sense of of how i'm i'm thinking when i'm doing these things so you arrive here right that's that's your arrival point in the second floor in the first floor sorry from the ground floor uh so that's your arrival point and then you choose to either go up again or to go into this space right so that means it makes sense uh to have a staircase winding around here right doing a ushaped wind here so i'll create a stair uh cast in place there moletics there that's perfect and i will give it a first run after one meter i'll give it the first run of four steps right here so there is like a gap right here then i will give it uh four more steps here fail to generate automatic landing layout that's fine we'll just move uh these steps away a little bit and it will generate the landing and then the rest is going to be generated here can't make stair stairs uh why cancel cool welcome to revit okay we try again steps this time um let's let's say only three steps here two three no uh a bit closer three steps here then four steps here and then the remaining ones are here can't make stairs why why are you complaining about this cancel okay let me do let me not snap to this edge here maybe it's it doesn't like it and instead snap to like align it with these steps here like that maybe that's yeah okay so that works uh just try until it works that's that's the answer um yeah and that is basically it then then i just hit accept like finish editing bam it creates these railings which we just get rid of like that and now we have our steps to the second floor and the second floor also doesn't have a hole in it right so we need to create a hole for or the second floor uh to do that i will actually show you the other way of how to do it with the shaft so i will go to my second floor that's great that's where the steps are and i will create a shaft opening so i clicked on the shaft option there and the shaft opening basically just asks me to draw a boundary line again so i'm just drawing a line probably something like that yeah let's yolo it something like that accept bam we have our opening and yep the shaft just ate up the floor above as well so we need to change uh the height of the shaft and the cool thing about is is that with the shaft tool you can just kind of go to 3d and just drag it down you know so that it doesn't reach the that floor and you're you're you're good to go so you just kind of drag down the top face of the shaft um that's it about and of course you would need to add the walls there and then so on and kind of mess around with the railing here uh perhaps i shouldn't have deleted the railing there but who cares um right so we covered walls we covered glazing curtain systems curtain panels we cover doors windows uh columns are boring um architectural column you can just kind of place a column anywhere you want bam there's a column for some reason there's two never mind there's only one so you can place columns but i don't think you will need any columns in this kind of a building you have ceilings we don't care about ceilings floors okay we have done all of this all of this grid is done super okay we are done with this part of the tutorial next time i will show you how to actually get drawings out you know it's going to be the final tutorial so everything that that i've missed i will show you how to do it um how do i say it get to work so to begin we have covered walls doors windows all of that good stuff and the only thing left is furniture and i'm not going to be detailing this this project to you know to its full potential so to say uh this is just for me to show you um the different components so it's not going to be in my case it's not going to be a finished project but for you as students i expect you to kind of do and do a full project um right so let's begin the thing is that with revit 2021 uh there are there isn't a lot of objects or a lot of furniture pieces that you can natively get into your project if i go here to component right if i click on this component icon i can see here that there are some desks that i can choose from there's a parking space some trees and that's basically it that that's basically it uh from from the default um like default library so it's not it's far from being a big library uh so how do you get more stuff in here um well there is this button here called load family if you press it it will open up a browser for you a file browser and from here you if you have an older version of revit you would be able to choose a furniture piece or or like you would be be able to navigate through the library of furniture pieces uh but here it's just structural precast and some some weird stuff so i don't have anything here so how do you get a library in revit 2021 how do you get a library in here well you need to go to let me first escape out of this tool there we go and you need to go to insert and click on load family and those of you who are working on the school's computers i will be able to i believe you will find the library already installed but those of you who are working from home this is what you need to do especially with the new revit click on get autodesk content right here which will open up you can see it there we go it will open up a browser page uh for you uh where you can get where you can download uh the the content so this is the the library of furniture and whatnot um and that kind of content is split into different regions so english united states english united kingdom and if we scroll down far far down you will see english sweden right and here there there are these uh uh swedish libraries which you can install but there are only 15 megabytes which tells me that there's not a lot of stuff in there right so instead what i'm going to do i'm going to actually download the english united states metric libraries which is 1.2 gigabytes right much larger so that means much more stuff for me to play with so i'll click on this and it will immediately start downloading if it doesn't you might need to sign in but it seems like i haven't signed in so it should be fine right so i'll wait for it to finish downloading uh install it and then we will take a look at how to get them into your file so just a second actually actually to save time while it's downloading i will be messing around with with the furniture here so with the furniture that i have so in architecture tab i'll click on the component tab and i'll see yeah sure this desk uh pretty ugly one but who cares basically adding a disk is just as easy as going to let's see the ground floor zooming in and hello oh right uh so if you change views it will it it will ask you to to run the command again so i'll click on component desk and here i just can click and place the desk uh okay so it's thinking let's hope it's not gonna crash it didn't so okay so we we have a desk in here and i can place another one if i want to whatever so i have two desks here if i check it in 3d view i can see those two desks being displayed here even being cut one of them is being cut so let me go back to the ground floor delete one of those desks and this one what can you do with it well you can move it around of course you can rotate it so that's the rotate button right here right so from here to here you can rotate it let me undo that and you can align it as well so this desk i will click on the alignment tool choose let's see this wall here this disk line here and it's going to snap in place it's going to be aligned so that means now i can kind of move it okay let me escape out there we go now i can move it and place it properly on my inside of my building uh let's see it in 3d yeah that's how it is um if you don't see a line here um just like i don't uh that means your desk is clipping into it's it's being pushed into the wall a little bit that's fine what we can do is in ground floor we just move it slightly away from the wall one just slightly there we go 10 centimeters that's maybe a little bit too much i zoomed in too far so now we need to wait for it to do its thing i don't know what it's doing but yeah there we go so here now once i selected it i can see the dimension here saying a hundred millimeters i can change this to 50 right so it's only five centimeters away from the wall perfect if i go to 3d view i can now see that that line is present oh that's an ugly desk let me just delete it okay is it done yet yes it is okay so once you have downloaded the exe file i'll just run it so it's opening it up revit is famous for being super slow and installing stuff but it seems to be doing the trick let me hit extract and it should be yeah it's fine so it's now it's extracting all of the material that i have downloaded uh taking super long but come on come on not not the best thing for for a tutorial to wait for things to extract but who cares it's just like 15 seconds 20 seconds a minute maybe perfect time for a coffee break um while it's extracting actually it should be already loading in the the files and let me just make sure 2021 autodesk folder okay so it should be extracting into the correct folder so let me jump back to ground floor go to architecture tab component and click on load family here and let me find english not english imperial but english oh yeah there we go so there's now a lot of folders in here which is great and they are being some files could not be created please close all applications or between this and restart this installation yeah sure so basically what it's saying is you shouldn't be running you shouldn't be loading in the libraries while you are extracting the libraries we don't care we have quite a few already installed this is going to be enough to get the point across so let me repeat that step just to make sure that you all follow i clicked on components icon and then clicked on load family and here i'm in english imperial library so i just moved up one folder and found my english regular english folder which is metric and here we have different kinds of windows for instance you know new kinds of windows that you didn't see before and also we have furniture furniture there we go furniture system or furniture so let me jump to furniture let me see what kind of tables it has so once i click on one i can see the uh a preview of it so round rectangular um still not that great but a bit a little bit better than what we had before so for instance this round table i'll hit open and nothing happens oh never mind it all immediately loads it in and now i can place it right so once i've pasted it and let me escape out of out of everything and even delete this this table altogether if now i go to components tab i can see that now this table with all of this variations is loaded in to the project right so now i can use it anytime i want right just choose it and place it okay so just i mean on your own time you can investigate what kind of stuff there is and what kind of families you can load in but it's mostly tables beds um right different kinds of beds seating right different kinds of chairs even carbs just here right that and then if we take a closer look to to all of the folders in the library we can see that there's even curtain wall panels different types of curtain wall panels different types of columns different types of different stuff so one thing that i'm interested in is windows for instance because before we had to work with pretty default you know pretty regular windows so if i escape out if i have let's say let me look at the 3d model where could i add a window by the way this is this is complete garbage you can't access this area right here so my staircase is completely like nonsense uh it's it's it's a bad staircase i should probably fix it yeah for pedagogical purposes i will be fixing the staircase sorry i can't can't have that in the tutorial so that's uh my first floor let me jump in there uh this staircase blocks off entrance to the to the balcony so i'll just delete it and instead let me just quickly stare there we go let me just from here to here four steps that's perfect and then from here to here all remaining steps that's uh can't make stairs that's cool uh let me try again escape or not escape just create a landing um let's say from here to here there we go now it's fine um i'll hit accept i'll probably change the oh no it is a monolithic run but it does have the um much more call it the the the railing so let me jump to a 3d view get rid of the railing that it's not in the way um i would need to fix a bunch of stuff here but that that is okay um or maybe we keep the railing well either way first floor there's enough of a gap for here to to walk through that's fine and now we have a gap here to actually access the balcony i believe in the second floor we need to yeah on the second floor we actually need um an opening here so uh to to access to be able to access the second floor now from the staircase so i will be either adding a new shaft opening or maybe in this case i will change i will delete the shaft opening altogether and i will change the the boundary of the floor slab here so to do that let in in 3d view let me just select the the floor slab oop this one the floor slab in question uh let me go to the first floor uh nope that's in the second floor there we go and let me click on edit boundary right here wait for it to figure it figure out what i want and here i will just draw a few lines so from here to here and i think up until here should be enough so that's going to be my opening which means that this line and this line like this line segment and this line segment shouldn't be there so i will be uh using either uh no wait pick walls is bad just a second oh there we go i will be using trim extend to corner uh tool right here so i'll select this line first and then this line so now they get like trimmed together and then this line and this line and also they get trimmed together i'll hit accept would you like walls to go i don't attach don't care now i have a proper opening in 3d view if i take a look at it and this is how it looks i think that's fine so now we can move up and we actually do have a possibility for an entrance which i am going to create so let's continue uh let's jump into second floor oh wait no sorry first floor let's jump into first floor and add the door here so to add the door you click on the door tool and actually why don't we find a different kind of a door i assume the library that we downloaded should contain different doors so load family go up from the tables from furniture and let's see dddd stands for doors doors there we go doors double click oh that's a lot of doors um curtain wall double glass door that's nice it's a simple one single panel door commercial doors and nothing too too nice here maybe we can just do curtain wall single glass you know regular doorway only that is in glass hit open it gets loaded in some of all of the families cannot be loaded what that's weird i am in the doors doors family okay you must choose family files of the category doors do you want to re retry loading a new set of oh right okay so this is this is important this is important so notice how the name says m door curtain wall single glass curtain wall is the key thing here so that means that this door belongs to a system of a curtain wall rather than a door system um remember back in the previous tutorial i did a curtain wall so this is a way of how you can add a door into the curtain wall so this family uh doesn't doesn't work so instead we need like a regular door like that um let's just find one that's good enough so all of these are curtain wall doors right um double no no i shouldn't be picky yeah sure panel would yeah whatever i'll just use that one it's it's not the prettiest but it will do i'll hit open now it it actually works i hit ok sure save the project whatever and now i'm able to add that particular door and it even has different types here for me to choose from right so i'll choose the let's say 2.1 meters by 80 centimeters something like that opens up outwards like that that's it so we have our door uh inserted right if i take a look at it in 3d that's not the door that i want so i will just simply select it scroll down here oh and and just choose the interior single four panel wooden door type right so i just switched the door type so now we're gucci um let's jump to first floor and add the window just like we added the door and let's add a super ugly window so let me go to the window tool load family jump back find windows there we go and let me just find a weird one oh my god this is a no um let's just find a regular one so it's it's the types of windows just like doors it's not like you can add any type of window to any type of geometry uh you will need to fiddle a little bit with it until you you become comfortable i will add oh perfect yeah that that's excellent that's that's exactly the window that i wanted to add i'll hit open it's going to load it in and now i can just add it i'll just add it in here bam like that let me check it in 3d view that's that's how it looks like i believe i will change the sill height to a little bit higher to to be a little bit higher so i'll just change it to 1 meter 200 millimeters yeah yeah sounds about right or rather looks about right horrible anyway so that's how you add uh custom custom stuff to your your geometries uh last thing that i'm going to do since this is a gallery i should probably add wind not windows i should probably add like paintings and stuff uh so i will family load in family and where could i find paintings plumbing profiles railings furniture probably furniture right yeah probably furniture so furniture that's mirror beds storage tables there's no painting here huh oh my god so it's going to take me a while to to find it but we can find we can use a cabinet like shelving and place it there at least so i'll do that instead i know for a fact that there are paintings here uh in in this library it's just that finding them you know since i don't do it that often i don't remember where they are so instead i'll add a shelf there um i really hope that i can change the width of the shelf we will see um i'll hit open and probably need to do that in the ground floor right yeah like that and i will add i'll be adding a shelf right here so first let me place it escape there we go so now it's placed and let's see if we can edit type and yeah super so we can edit the the the shelf width and height and so on that that's that's great that's what we want um so let's make it proper i will grab the 3d view like that and i will dock it to the side like that perfect just so that i can constantly see you know the the shelf itself and there's my shelf just standing there so what i want to do is i want to make a different kind of section so let me move this section plane right here and instead let me move this section plane inwards even more uh maybe that's a little bit too much a little bit out oops that's the wrong one bam okay that's good so now we see our shelf just standing there i will align it so i will select it click on the align tool from to this edge from this edge just line it like that and we have our shelf i'll click on modify select it and now we can actually add a type and let's just hope that it it works right so depth of the shelf uh let's say 500 millimeters let apply okay that that works i will move it to to the correct position just in a second height so i know that the height between the floors the the the ground floor is 3.5 meters minus the floor slab so it's actually two eight five zero millimeters that's the height of the shelf it apply there we go that's good that's good and for width let's do a three meter shelf apply maybe that's a bit too much let's do a two meter shelf yeah that's that's good enough uh and then i will just simply reposition it and snap it in place and now i have a shelf here right to put some stuff in um right so that's how you add furniture uh pretty pretty simple now once once you've done that once you've added uh added furniture added all of the cool stuff that you want to have in your in your building it's around time that we actually start working with the graphics and extracting nice graphics from your 3d model right so how do we how do we go about it well first of all i want to i want to make sure that every view that i have actually has a proper um proper depth if that makes sense so i will be going through actually now i don't need 3d view anymore uh i will be going through every gra every floor and just checking if the depth is proper so here that seems fine that's our ground floor first floor we see the balcony and that seems fine second floor seems okay third floor wait second floor should see the balcony here right on on the on the second floor and we don't so if if that happens uh what you do is without having anything selected you go here on the left hand side and you find view range option view range and you click on edit that view range and here you will you will have this popup where you can change uh how deep do you see from that particular floor and it's also at what height do you cut but i don't change that uh so level i will just say i want to see all the way down to ground floor hit apply hit okay and now we see the balcony same thing for the third floor um where is it view range up to the ground floor apply okay there we go fourth floor floor actually does have oh wait we don't need four floor fourth floor is going to be our roof uh so we don't care about the fourth floor all right so we have all of the views done uh like that that we need and now it's all about filling in right all about making hatches creating hatches and one thing that i would probably do before before making it pretty or making it nicer i guess i will go to sheets here remember in rhino you have layouts so here layouts are called sheets and i will create create a sheet for every view that i'm going to have so i will right click on the sheets and choose new sheet click there and you can see that it asks me for a title block and by default it's set to a1 metric and no we will be using a3 and we don't have one right but you're in luck because i have created one for you to use so on the course website uh lth digitalwordpress.com 15 scroll scroll scroll scroll you can download layout sheet template in revit family format this one right here or if this one doesn't work for you then you will be able to download the old version where you will need to change the the title but that's easy an easy fix so you download this one just download there we go have it here paste it here oh i already have had it here um and i will now load it in once it's downloaded i'll click on load i'll go to desktop and i have my aada15 sheet here hit open hit okay there it is right so now if i expand it i can see that it's a0101 unnamed sheet that's fine we will be naming them in just a second so how do you get a drawing into the sheet well you do that by just for instance ground floor by just clicking and dragging in the drawing into the sheet click drag bam uh where is it oh yeah it's going to ask you for position click again there it is now it's inside of the sheet good enough good enough for now um i wonder if we can get rid of the ground floor title block i'll need to investigate so here in in in this particular view you are able to kind of either crop the view or uh change the visuals of this particular view uh i know that that's a not a tongue twister but just my brain is slow today basically you can adjust the graphics of this particular drawing in just to be in this sheet first things first since i have a title block i don't need this this title right here ground floor 1 to 100 with numeration so i will select it and i will actually i believe it's in edit type right yes so once you select it you go to edit type right like right here and you untick show extension line and you where it says show title you say no and that should be yeah that should be that so now it's done hit okay you're good with that now for this particular view it's too big right it doesn't fit in your in your drawing so what do you do well here on once you have selected it on the left hand side you can find a tab called extends and a tick mark box called or check box called crop view if you select crop view and also if you select crop region visible you'll be able to to crop to crop the view yeah for the lack of a better word so let's see how how that how that works i don't think you can crop the view in the sheet which which is which kind of sucks but once you have those two tick marks and you go back to your ground floor view this rectangle will appear and then here in your ground floor plan you're able you you will be able to move this box that the sides of this box around until everything kind of fits nicely and then if you look at your sheet again this is how it looks right so i can see that i need to crop it even further so actually i'll just go to ground floor again and crop it even further perhaps there is a better way of doing it but i don't know uh i i always used this this method and it seems to work so yeah you end up with having this this kind of a view and this is 1 to 100 scale right uh this particular view is at the scale of one to a hundred how do i know well when i select the view and i scroll up here i can see view scale is one to a hundred if i change this to one to five hundred hit apply uh it's right here right so that's now one to five hundred you can see that the axes don't scale uh which is it's natural it they don't they shouldn't scale uh with the view there we go so we have our ground floor plan placed in inside of a sheet that's great and now there's just a few more things to fix here before we move on to our other plans so drawing name i wonder why is this not okay so how do you change things here drawing scale of course you don't need to change it's already kind of reading what kind of a scale you were working in but for instance drawing name and author's information you do need to insert right so for drawing name i will just click once and click once more it's not a double click if you double click it it's bad so it's click and then click again um and i'll just say ground floor plan plus 0.000 right it should be plus minus but i don't care um and then for uh for the for my own name it's just there we go my own name um that's it right and you can see that the sheets automatically update the name here pops up ground floor plan plus 0.000 altitude okay so now we need to repeat this for every floor for every section and for every elevation and the 3d view as well um i will do this a few more times and i will do this faster just so that you can kind of see the process a few more times and then kind of hopefully it will help you troubleshoot so let's begin so i'll create a new sheet uh it's already present here since i loaded it in like that i will drag in first floor bam like that i will position it like that i will go to my first floor and here i'll scroll down check mark crop view crop region visible i'll crop it to barely fit like that great so that's now cropped i'll jump back to my sheet that's going to fit properly i'll just position it drawing name i will change the drawing name to first floor plan plus 3.5000 or five zero zero um my name is there it remembers that's good yeah that's done all right then let's do one for a section and one for elevation and one for 3d so i will create so that's going to be for section new sheet that's going to be for elevation new sheet that's going to be for 3d all right so let me grab um i don't care which section section one sure i'll just grab section one here place it uh that's fine i'll grab for for this sheet i will grab elevation uh let's go for street elevation edit bam that's done and for this sheet i will grab the 3d view wait uh no that's the section that's the elevation okay sure this one is going to be the 3d view bam click okay so there's a bunch of stuff that i'll need to fix in all three of them so first off um elevation there's uh you [Laughter] you you uh quite quite a few uh quite a few ugly bits but i think we will manage so let me first position it something like that seems to be okay let me check the street elevation um i will just actually drag this uh to be wider so our street elevation already has this uh all of this incorporated that this cropping box which is super great um and let me just drag these out i can't drag them more huh so they get locked for some reason that's fine um and let me oh my god come on just just let me i just want to select there we go okay i managed to select the the last mark and for some reason other marks just disappeared i don't know why that's super weird it shouldn't happen so we try it again yay can we unlock this so this lock means that oh understood okay so these locks mean that if i move uh for instance this um single sheet here see how all others move that's because they are locked together right so that that's what this lock means it's actually a pretty useful thing so the reason why the those disappeared was because once i select this zoomed into too close now it's calculating if i select this bottom markup i can see that it's locked with the dashed line i can see that it's actually locked to the ends of all other floors and i don't want that so what i'm going to do is actually instead of unlocking it i will tick mark here to have it on both sides i will tick mark untick here you barely can see it it's it's right here that that rectangle i will untick here to to hide that side and now i will indeed move the side out so that it fits properly here once everything is aligned i believe all of them get locked together which is absolutely fine this one is a little bit out of bounds so let me just move it back in so this is how it looks let me check check it in 3d not in 3d in the sheet it seems to be fitting quite properly the section plane the section line is a little bit out of bounds so let me fix that street elevation you are way too close or way too far be here and also i don't want this line running through the middle of my drawing so i'll just move it like so like that and like that perfect okay so that is done and maybe even i will get the cropping rectangle and i'll move it slightly in like that just to clean it up a bit um yeah let's see let's see let's see how it looks this is how it looks i think that's okay not great not terrible just okay um but i think this is this is something that we can continue on working with so that's our facade um let me rename this street assad yep let me jump into this section and actually immediately i'll rename this section to section aaa like that notice how the section is uh filled in uh while the all other drawings are not that's because if i take a look at the section um and i believe it's section one right it is filled in here and this is just the graphics settings right so i can change this to hidden line and now it's not filled in and if i now take a look at it in the sheet i keep wanting to say uh i now forgot the other one i keep wanting to see layout rather than sheet um now it's not filled right so it's it's graphic settings that you want to change if if there's a fill and you don't want to see a fill so that's our section nothing very fancy happening here and it's actually pretty damn close to being fine let me see if i can add more stuff if i can see more stuff within this section okay so there's the surrounding building right there and can i see the one on the other side of the street yes i can so i will just do something like this just to get the section of the street and the the section of the next door building um jump back to section aa this is how it looks almost fits i say i'd say i'd say almost fits um do we just do it like that ah come on by the way you can use arrow keys to kind of move it around so yeah okay good it fits the dashed lines go out of bounds but we don't care about those dashed lines so that's fine and the section line as always is super obnoxious and i will be fixing it map and just move that one in here uh until here clipping plane up like that flipping plane come on come on just give me give me give me like that there we go okay so that is done that's our section a a uh for now and then the last one is the 3d view which we will kind of revisit in just a second right now it's still well actually let's let's uh let's let's make it nice so that's in 3d i will just move my clipping box here that's fine i think that's something like that is kind of kind of neat let's see if we can add some more bizarres here that's nice i think that that that looks okay um let's see uh is it possible for me to hide this in this view i believe it is if i delete it yeah it's going to um to delete the floor plans as well which i don't want to do at all so instead i will figure out a way of how to hide it which is i believe this button right here hide in view hide category or hide elements hide elements there we go let's see if it actually translates to our 3d sheet here it does okay great so let us hide a bunch of stuff in in this 3d view so that it's not obnoxious um with information so that all of that actually hide in view hide elements okay that's good can i hide this yes i can super okay so these are hidden the shadows are a bit funky but that that's okay this is how it looks uh let's take a look at it in 3d yeah sure not 3d sorry in the sheet bam that looks actually good that that looks fine i'll just place it here my graphics card is crying a bit but that's that's normal um and yeah let's just name it um 3d exonometric 3d axonometric uh drawing scale there is no scale for an axonometric drawing so of course it's going to be empty okay that is done right that is that is okay that's done we are ready to move forward and the next thing that we're going to do is drink some coffee delicious and jump to our ground floor plan the sheet of ground floor plan and we will change the display settings here for this sheet so for instance let's start with a simple super simple example i want the walls here to be filled in black right so how do i do that well the thing is that in revit everything that you do um every geometry belongs to a certain category as i mentioned before and all of that geometry is going to be it within that category category is going to be shown in a certain way once you just look at it and once you look at a cut of it right so how do you change it how do you change the the visuals well you go to the view tab here in the top and you choose visibility and graphics so these are visibility and graphics settings right for that particular view in this case this sheet right here visibility and graphics and here it's a pretty big table where you can change different different aspects of your of your graphics right so basically how do you show air terminals how do you show areas how do you show ceilings how do you show columns and and so on all of that is being treated by this table um one important one important note is that you have two big sides here not sides two big columns here one is projection surface this is where you just look at the element and the other one is cut which means how would it show you a section of that particular element so in case of maybe that's the fastest way to do it is just to show you with wall so i just scroll down to walls and i will say when i cut the walls the lines of the cut so i'll click on override here the lines of the cut should be solid should have red color and should be pretty damn thick maybe even thicker let's go for 16 who cares hit ok hit apply and nothing changes how come is it because i'm in the sheet sorry technical difficulties please please hold visibility on graphics walls solid red 16 okay apply ah okay apparently you need to change it not in the sheet but rather in the um in the floor plan itself and then it should show up yeah then it's going to show up in the sheet so as you can see 16 is a little bit thick uh let's jump back and let's actually jump back to ground floor plan and actually change the the graphics here so i will click on visibility graphics and go back to walls and actually i do want my wall cut to be solid a solid line but it should be black and the weight should be less like five or something yeah that that seems good right so so we end up with these these this kind of cut and then for the pattern i will say overwrite and you you have the possibility to have two patterns but i would strongly suggest you not having two patterns you know one laid on top of the other foreground background instead just work with the background pattern for now so for pattern i will also see solid fill and i'll say yeah again black hit okay hit apply that's that's that right so what else can we change here in in the plan uh plan view well the surrounding buildings and the surrounding uh uh street and so on uh all of them are white and actually i wanted to kind of change not to change to differentiate between the inside of this building and everything else the outside so remember right at the start of the course we have imported the surrounding geometry the site 3d model as a generic model so now i will find this generic model type here generic models right here and i will say that when we cut the generic models it should still have a pretty thick solid line right so solid line black color weight again five oh yeah hit apply forgot so now it it kind of gives us a bolder line where it cuts and then for patterns uh for the cut pattern i will say it should be a solid fill but the color shouldn't be black because that's going to be way too dark rather let's just say yeah gray hit ok hit apply so now everything that is being cut outside of the building is going to have this kind of gray color what about everything that's outside of the building that's not being cut i want it to be light gray right so then i will go to the projection part of it and i'll find patterns generic models patterns and here i will say for background let's use a solid fill but let's use a super super light gray color hit ok ok apply there we go hit ok here so now we have this this graphics uh graphics settings done for this particular view if i look at it in my sheets i can see that it's it's there if i were to add more more walls here right they don't get filled in what oh my god come on come on rabbit is that because it's a basic wall no it shouldn't be right right that's super strange okay let's see why it's not it's not working uh let's go to view visibility and graphics this this really feels like a bug but maybe i'm wrong but i haven't seen this happen before at all but i guess it's it's nice to from time to time see i see these things happen so let me change the color to red apply it's thinking will it crack okay it doesn't crash but it's not filling it in okay we will need to revisit that part later and then figure out why the hell is that happening um if this happens just try closing and opening rhino again that's probably going to solve it oh i know i'm dumb um this wall right here this wall it its height is 1.1 meters which means it doesn't reach the section through which we cut which means we are actually not cutting through these walls but right cancel we're not cutting through these walls but rather we are just looking at the top of these walls right uh probably in the section one is going to be a little bit more clear no it's not in section two yeah there we go so in section two you can actually see these walls here all right so we are not cutting through them at that height this is why it's not filling in but if i select them and i change the unconnected height of them to let's see two meters hit apply now they're being cut okay so that was can't make a perfect tutorial um always something there's always something wrong okay that's done let's jump into first floor and see that oh crap first floor also requires us to do exactly the same thing as we did for the ground floor so then the question is is it possible to somehow save these settings these graphics settings and apply them to all other floors and yes the answer is of course yes the of course i will just go to visibility graphics right here and i will or wait no sorry sorry not visibility graphics cancel cancel that uh in ground floor i will go to view templates here and i will say create template from current view and i will name this kinda good floor plan style hit okay it's going to save it hit ok again and now in the first floor i can go to view templates again and choose apply template properties to current view and then i will find my kind of good floor plan style apply properties and hit ok and now my first floor also has the same view second floor view templates apply kind of good okay third floor three templates apply kind of good okay so that's done now the question is can we do this for a 3d view for instance no maybe not can we do this for section right because section is basically just a vertical plan right or a plan is a horizontal section whatever you want to call it so can we apply the same view template here if i go to view templates apply and i choose apply template properties from view you might not see uh the that our template here that's because uh there's a filter applied which only is looking for templates which are uh which work with sections elevations and whatnot so i will expand this and i will just say all and i'll then find my kind of good floor plan style hit apply hit okay still works but the problem with this one is that it's still i still need more to to to change more styles here because for instance floor slabs they are not being cut and also i kind of want to cut through the through the doorway so let me move that section as well so in the ground floor plan i will just take the section and i will move it so that it cuts there we go so that it cuts through the the staircase and also the doorway in the first floor let's look at section two no section one there we go so now we are cutting through the the stair which is not being hatched in properly and we are cutting through the the floor slabs which are not being hashed in properly uh if we had a roof that also wouldn't be hatched in properly so we need to fix a few things let me go to visibility and graphics settings find stairs stairs there we go cut line override solid line black color weight also five that seems to be working for us quite well for patterns override background solid fill black apply there we go our staircase is now black and floor slabs ffff floors not floor slabs just floors pattern is going to be black and solid and lines are going to be solid black weight five apply okay this is what we have right nothing too fancy but it does the trick okay so we have that going on and that's our section and if we take a look at our section in here or actually maybe we should fill in nah nah let's not uh so let's see where is our section section aa there we go here it is all all ready to be plotted out um facade actually i kind of like the style of the facade here i don't really want to change anything the only thing that i kind of want to do is add shadows to the facade so i will go to my street elevation right here and here in the bottom i will choose shadows to be turned on like that and maybe i'll click on the small sun icon send settings and i will just mess around with the sun so can i just do still still hit apply let me change the location to not boston not no not not boston definitely not boston um i think we have denmark there uh copenhagen at least will will you give me copenhagen or will you give me malmo yeah it doesn't give us malmo whatever let's lie if you can't find the city just lie we'll just choose lighting and here we will just change the altitude and azimuth so perhaps i want it to be a little bit lower so 30 degrees apply yeah that's that's a bit better and asim of 115 so it eats up a little bit more yeah i think that's that's about it or maybe uh what if it's 45 degrees with that seam as a move so it does that this is hole in the shadow this is kinda doing his thing yeah i think that's fine i think that's fine that's okay and for the actual style i want the building my building to be kind of popping out a little bit more so i will push all surrounding buildings a little bit backwards with a gray color basically so visibility and graphics generic models patterns uh no that's a cut pattern we are not cutting anything so projection surface patterns color light gray solid fill apply there we go and maybe even generic models lines i will say solid line and kinda not not black but dark gray color with kind of low weight so weight of one so though the line work is a little bit uh thinner and a little bit more towards uh gray um even more gray please i know it doesn't really matter that much but i really wanna i'm gonna make it as nice as possible yeah that's great enough okay we have that done we have our building popping up popping out um and that is good so let me just double check street facade looks like that that looks like that axo actually i will not well maybe in the axle also visibility and graphics uh generic models lines solid gray thin line patterns up patterns uh pattern solid light gray okay apply okay yo did i mess mess up generic models parents it should work okay what about the cut what if i change the cut here solid fill solid fill color red okay so apparently oh that's my bad i i i can hear you screaming at the at the screen uh i am working in the sheet and not in the actual 3d view that's my bad as per usual oh my god so let's do it here [Laughter] generic models patterns light gray solid fill generic models pattern solid color dark gray weight very low apply perfect section could be no let's keep section as it is just hit ok right so that our our building kind of pops up a bit more okay we have that going on um right so that's about it that's about it in terms of our our graphics i think it's turning out to be okay students tend to ask me about the lines how to change the style of the grid lines because the style is pretty pretty obnoxious uh and the the way you do it is you download a nicer style and actually could we so to load in a section um a new section markup for instance you go to load family and here it's it's going to be under english annotations by the way if if you can't find the folder of the library let's say you're you're in the desktop uh it's located in this pc c disk drive program data which is a hidden folder if you don't know how to see all hidden folders you need to actually go to any folder that you have on your desktop or on your computer you go to view tab click on options you go to view tab again in the options and you choose show hidden files folders and drives hit apply hit ok and then you will see the program data folder and here you see autodesk uh rvt2021 libraries finally we are here they are really hiding it from us it's under english and i believe it should be under annotations right because where else could it be yeah it's yes it should be under annotations um grid level section section head there we go section head and here we see different types of section heads and all of them are complete garbage not garbage but uh really disgusting so it is what it is you're stuck with ugly section heads in in revit unless you download one from the internet that's that's nice um in terms of editing the section head itself zoomed in to close again in in in case of editing the section itself i believe um if you select it if you select it there we go you can change with that in the type cloud tag jesus christ that's a lot of you know what let's not dig too deep in into here just have a freaking section in there and yeah you just have a freaking section in there and then call it a day that's that's fine that you don't need to to have it too too intense um right what else is there to to show you oh that's it uh let's let's plot it out uh let's plot everything out so you have your sheets ready let's see i have a few of them yeah sure save the project always save the project by the way um i have a few ready here and it's time to print out or plot out your sheets into pdf so i'll go to file print or is it export no it's print file print print or just click on this print button here that's that works as well where here we have all of the different different settings uh that you can use for for plotting out the the sheets so first things first printer we will choose adobe pdf or microsoft print to pdf i think that one works as well anything that has the pdf word in it should work so adobe pdf for me kind combine multiple selected view sheets into a single file so do we want it in a single file yeah sure whatever print range uh we will not use current view instead we will use selected views selected views sheets and i will click on the select button and i will say i want to print out this this this this this these sheets right not the floor plans not the structural plans just the sheets i'll hit okay do you want to save these settings for use in the future revit session sure yeah sure so that's going to be my set one apparently my the name and the location of where i'm going to be exporting the pdf is uh weird so i'll just be exporting it to desktop so i'll just choose desktop hit save yeah perfect and the name of the file well right now it doesn't matter because i'm going to be messing around with it in photoshop so that's that's okay um right let's see these two buttons here properties as well as the setup so properties if i click on that i can see here nothing fancy nothing special paper source whatever layout landscape if i click on the advanced i can see that the paper size is said to be letter rather than a3 that's a nice way of hiding it let me just see if okay so we don't need to go to properties here sorry about that you just go to settings setup and here we can actually change it from the the letter size to the proper a3 size so we are working these sheets are tailored for a3 its landscape format is going to be centered sure and the zoom is going to be 100 so it's not fit to page it's rather zoom 100 uh vector processing sure raster quality high colors color oh yeah you can choose either color or grayscale we'll just use color that's fine um everything else is fine seems to be okay so i'll just hit ok and i'll hit ok again you have chosen to print five views as separate files do i want to yes i do want them as separate files because i'm going to photoshop them so i'll hit yes um right let me just create a new folder just so that it's easy for me to find raw pdf pdfs raw pdfs hit save it's doing its magic saving it while it's doing it i'll open up photoshop real fast by now you should be able to kind of wait just a second uh there revit save so you will need to click save for every sheet that's not a problem um by now you should be able to uh to to work with with pdfs uh in photoshop easily um that that's my expectation because we have been doing doing it for the past four courses now or three with three or four four past four courses no this is the fourth one right anyway we've been doing it quite quite a lot so you should be able to add textures and change colors and and whatnot in photoshop of your drawings hopefully don't show me this again close uh so that's that so i will just be really quick in showing you this last bit save that and i think that's that's the last of it right yes okay so let me save this file in photoshop i will just find my folder with all of the pdfs i'll just kind of drag all of them in and just choose what which which one i want to work with and show you show you how i'm going to work with it so crop 2 not bounding box never bounding box media box you always when you import pdf you choose media box so that it doesn't mess up your a3 size other than that it seems fine okay uh media box yes that's good so it remembers at least it remembers that's good okay okay okay okay okay so we have our section we have our uh elevation we have our axo floor plan floor plan so floor plans are kind of boring i will just close them immediately won't photoshop anything there um i could work here maybe on this one i don't know i i like how clean it is let's work on the elevation instead so section also goes away sure let me just show you how i would work on it with uh on the elevation so let's say i want uh some sort of pattern here i i don't know some some form of pattern let's say metal or something like that i'll just go to the interwebs i'll go to google and i'll say what's a cool pattern metal metal sheet pattern corrugated steel or something like that um perforated diamond that's that's whatever are there any good ones licensable no yeah that's good enough right uh i will just open it in a new window i know it has the watermark this is for a tutorial so we don't care uh so i'll just position it i will cut away the part that i need copy paste um so there's one unnecessary layer that i delete um i will say do we multiply oops that's the wrong one that's the actual drawing do we multiply the the texture yeah we do we probably do but before we do that let me try to get rid of the watermark by going to levels and messing around with with the levels yeah that seems okay that seems good enough uh make it smaller like that that's perfect ctrl a ctrl c ctrl v to duplicate it maybe ctrl t right clicking and flip vertical to kind of have a much more call it uh a seamless connection between between the two textures i will just merge these two layers together merge layers place them here ctrl c ctrl v again merge the layers again ctrl a ctrl c ctrl v again but this one ctrl t and right click flip horizontal so that they did emerge more nicely merge layers now i will jump to multiply that seems okay maybe make it a bit smaller that seems fine maybe a bit bigger yeah that's sounds looks looks around right i can then select the area in which i want them uh ctrl shift i to invert the selection and then hit delete to get rid of everything else ctrl d to deselect and then just go to town and remove remove that delete remove that delete that gets removed lit also that uh what else there we go that's the the doorway here that gets removed and that gets removed so also also i want a a little bit of a gradient here right here just to show that this is like a better show that this is a cantilever so i'll just mark out where i want the gradient to be that goes from black to white i'll create a new layer just drag out the gradient there like this i'll say 21 something like this and it kind of you know this is without the gradient this is with so it just gives a little bit of a of a shadow there um right so we have a little bit of the corrugated steel it's not great by any stretch of imagination but it does the trick and i think what we can do is we can find some sort of a colored texture so cortan steel corten steel texture um yeah sure let's let's use this one uh open image oh that's that's a pretty low resolution but we don't care ctrl v paste it here i'll actually split it into parts ctrl x ctrl v place it here this one control x control up in this layer ctrl x ctrl v i don't know what i did but that's that that works as well like that perhaps that's good enough and then actually can we just do that yeah we can just do that no one will ever know um so this and the bottom one i will just add uh are you the bottom one no are you the bottom one yes ctrl c ctrl v just add it there okay so let me merge all of these together merge layers ctrl t to transform them a little bit more so that they're a little bit bigger um let's say multiply right so i think multiply will work and we already did some cutting so i'll just use the magic wand tool with certain tolerance and just select the cutouts like that ctrl shift i to invert delete nope uh ctrl shift i delete there we go okay so we deleted and we are kind of good to go with the with the carton steel let's make it a little bit less intense something like that i think that that that that's fine um and then for the windows i'll actually use the the magic wand tool to select the glass bam bam come on ah yay almost there there we go is that glass i i think that's glass at least and that is definitely glass okay uh so we have those done and i will just say let's do let's do control do we just use gradients rather maybe like that and then we switch the gradient to white and just give it like this kind of a kind of a tug here or maybe not perfect white um a little bit of of gray look like that look like that uh that that looks okay of course re reduce the the intensity of it the opacity of it something like this um and i think if we just kind of casually now select everything that's remaining and just edit fill shift five foreground color hit okay in a new fold in a new layer so that's shift f5 okay and we just move it below the whole thing why is that oh that's my bed so you can't do that this way huh uh i wanna i want to color the frames so how do we color the frames this is going to be uh now it's turning out to be a photoshop tutorial i want to color the frames but i don't want to select them individually so what i'm going to do is i will say okay first of all can we just do that not really oh or maybe we can control d um maybe we can if i go to curtain steel layer and i just select all of this right so i selected all of this and then we go to the window layer and we unselect holding down the alt key was it the alt key was it control i don't remember control shift no alt shift no uh how what's the shortcut for the subtract from selection it should be ctrl right no it should be shift no it should be hold there we go so it is the old key i don't know why why that didn't work out and tolerance needs to be like a hundred for this to work uh it doesn't really work that well maybe seems to be working okay now so we have that we are unselecting that oh messed up ah do i really need to do it again i know i i i figured it out this this this and that and this right we select this bear with me be patient or skip ahead you have the possibility to skip ahead um so i select inside of the windows and then i turn on the drawing and unselect the glass but why didn't it oh yeah that's because i need to be in the drawing layer and then i can unselect the glass panes planes paints glass glass thingies and it's a mess here but that's fine so i am unselecting and now i'm i'm selecting the shadowy bits as well with less tolerance maybe 32 i like tolerance of 32. it seems to work most of the time with most of the geometry so like that that good that looks good that looks okay and that also looks good okay so now we have only selected the frames for the windows which means we can create a new layer shift of five enter fill it with black color okay took us a while but we we we managed we managed to do it um let's change the the intensity so that you can see the line work and for the door um for the doors both of them actually this one still needs oh come on just give me the this one still needs the framing and for some reason it chooses to do it like that to select it like that so let me just for this frame i'll just do it the oldfashioned way with the rectangular marquee tool there we go almost almost now there we go um is that my frames yes that that this my frames shift f5 okay okay we're done here and then select the door somehow that that doesn't let me so i will be using a marquee tool again so the door as well as the door here holding down the shift key to select the door um so these will be blue just because i can no i'm kidding it's not going to be blue i'm just going to color it blue and change it to multiply that's color burn that's not change it to multiply change the opacity to be 33 ish 36 ctrl u hello ctrl u why can't i control u there we go ctrl u and then change the hue until i find a nice nice color for the doors um what works with corten steel yellow of course would work but that's kind of boring um pink red maybe red or maybe yeah let's let's just do do it traditional peachy okay that is that uh let's call it uh call it a day i i think that's that looks fine good good enough for for a tutorial uh control shift or rather control s straight up uh to save it uh let me go to desktop find my pdfs find my pdfs find my pdfs oh my god where are they car project raw pdfs goddammit raw pdfs change this to a pdf photoshop pdf format and then find my street facade there we go i can turn off layers right now don't need them hit save do you want to replace it yes okay uh high quality print preserve photoshop editing capabilities i usually have this turned off hit save pdf oh yeah of course i have it opened right here and also i have it opened right here so let me close it here and try to save it again oh just yikes um control s pdf pdf uh street facade no layers don't need that save yes replace it hit ok let's save pdf okay this time it worked so now once i close this and turn this off i can see that my street facade here is is nice and crispy so if you have adobe acrobat pro version you can select all of your pdfs right click them choose combine pdfs in acrobat then you just move them around so that's going to be the title page and then we have uh floor plans and then um poor plants yeah sure i that this works or maybe section goes in here it goes up up until there um we click on combine why is this so big we click on combine it does its magic creates a binder we can we take a closer look at it first second third fourth fifth page for me i hit file save as um we go to i'll just save it to desktop and this is where i go this is important you guys a a d a 15 l f i forgot my last name here they kiss save that's it you're done right you have your uh your pdfs where is it where is it there we go there it is you have your pdf saved right um and then you just uploaded it to the school server uh i already did a tutorial on how to do it before so i will not be repeating that but or maybe maybe i should okay so i will repeat that so if you're in the school then you can let me just mimic me being in the school without being in the school um ma'am bam ma'am just a second so in the school uh you just go to temp folder unprotected and you aad 15 hand in beautiful writing capital h capital h hendon there we go ada 15 handen open up that folder drag and drop or drag and drop not the syllabus the your your file in here that's it you've passed the course right if you don't have access if you can't get into the school remember that there is a remote desktop option right all of the information is in the on the course website under uh useful resources so there is a remote desktop version where you can log into the school's computer from your browser and just send an email to yourself with the file and load it in load it in through the remote remote desktop that that should be pretty simple to do as well so there's no need for us to do a separate server or a separate folder uh you just do it that way either one of the ways works alternatively you can always just create a vpn connection and that that's going to work as well okay i will leave you to it get to work and i hope to see some really nice narrow houses from you
