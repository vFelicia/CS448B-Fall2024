Hi! I'm Briana from freeCodeCamp. Today we are going to be talking about Git and GitHub how you use them, when you use them, and some of the differences between the two. To start off, let's talk about Git. Git is a version control software, which means while you're coding you can save each little time you make a change. So if you make a mistake, you want to undo something, or you just want to look back and see how it was before, you can do that with Git. Git is also open source. You can find Git to download at http//gitscm.com they also have great resources for documentation. Now let's talk about GitHub. You've probably been on GitHub before for some freeCodeCamp things, noticed it there, you probably even have an account. GitHub is a collaboration website that interacts with Git and works with it on the projects that you work on in your version control. It's hard to tell where the line is between what's Git and what's GitHub that's okay, you don't have to know. What you need to remember is you'll use GitHub to interact with Git. You'll use it to collaborate with your peers on projects using version control.
