hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse today i want to show you a pull request that was made that fixed the little issue that we had yesterday at the end of the stream and they were going to work with that new component that we made so we have a new component a new query and a new way to do routes that'll save us from having to make so many different components and queries so we're going to do a few uh a few routes with that and it should work right if it works once then it should work with the other ones but you know we'll just we'll make sure and we'll build some of those out we'll see how we look and i want to share with you kind of the the next stage of this that probably won't work on until later on in the year uh but it'd be good to you know just get everybody on board and see what you all think about it so i just had a meeting this morning where we discussed some things uh for the the future of this website that's not even done yet but we're already thinking about more so hey everybody see some of you in the live chat hey all right harshit's here good so harshit is the one that actually made the pull request so i'm glad that horseshoe is here and that way if i mess things up when i'm trying to describe what he did uh he can let me know i have ngrok running i'm going to paste that into the live chat now and i may have to paste it again after a while if we get some more viewers uh it looks like i'm i didn't get the stream scheduled until a little bit later today so not everyone you may have gotten the notification um because i'm seeing in the analytics there's not too many people in here yet and we're missing some people that are usually here um but it looks like at least some of you are getting on uh the ngrok server that if you're not familiar with ngrok that link will allow you to see on in your browser what i have here running locally on my computer so let's get started and i'm going to first go over that that pull request that i was telling you about so you can see this is what we were trying to get to display yesterday and it is displaying properly now so here's how it was done and you can check out these pull requests requests in more depth uh in the repo so if you check the link in the description for this github repo and you go in there and you look at the latest closed pull requests the last two that i closed were both from harshad so i believe it was whatever the second to the last one was that was the one um let's see all right alexia i see your question i'll get to it in just in just a minute all right where we at page okay so this is the right component so you can still see the old way that we were doing queries and some of the other components if you if you want to go back and check that out you can but here's the latest so we upgraded to the beta version of apollo to this react apollo um sorry i'm just getting myself familiar with what we did so obviously we're importing query now which we didn't we didn't have before and some of this we we had already worked on before the stream ended yesterday but so we're bringing in query and then we're using this query component down here so we're calling page query right which we made here right so here's our page query component and we can take a variable that's a type and a variable that's the name all right so we're passing it this variable type and that just means the the post type so we have all these different custom post types running in wordpress and we have graphql the wp graphql plugin running so we want to get the right post type and that's what we pass in here and then we pass in the variables and as name we're passing in the id as well and that will get a certain post of that particular post type and then horseshoe also you know has in here you know some loading something to display if there's an error which is awesome and if we do get the data back then we just you know display it as you know we're normally doing for most of the components we're just displaying the the base content here and you see now we have none of the stuff down the bottom that we did have all of it's moved up in here i think this is really nice this is obviously coming from doing it the other way this way it looks a little odd to me because i learned the other way first but trying to just think of this more objectively here i think the query component is is it's much more obvious what's going on here i don't know if maybe it's just me you all let me know what you think but i i kind of i really like it it's i mean we have a queer component and we're making a query and then we're getting we're getting the result and we're doing something with that i don't know that makes sense to me so anyway that's really cool essentially we have a pretty simple component here but i suppose if you needed to fill in different places with with data you would just add them all in here so the query essentially would be kind of a wrapper around your whole component in this case we we don't really need that for everything although you know potentially we'll see maybe you know depending on what we do later on with the site we might need something like that but anyway i like it i really like that and yeah cool good job harsha harshad also did a few other things so if you want to check that out um you know go ahead in the um in the repo i keep forgetting that it's called a repa so i said it already three times and every time i was like um uh repo uh okay let's see let me go back to the live chat now before we get started with coding all right so alexi had a question about the style uh how did you style the underline in the text field on the search and so the text field for search this would be easiest just to see so when let's see if we can focus yeah i believe that's it no that's not on this element it's on this one hmm it's not going to show i don't know which element it's on now so one of these elements has i believe it's a it's the bottom border now i can't even remember sorry sorry alexi is that it it's not the whole li hmm anyway i'm maybe gonna have to check that out oh harsh it's says it's a mature ui component oh you know what our yeah for some reason i was thinking of the old um what's it called um materialize i was thinking the old materialized components and how we did it with that yeah so but basic if you wanted to do this on your own with css you could do this and create an underline and then just add i mean we that's probably what one or two pixels i mean it's really thin and then just on focus you would have the color change so i have done that before with just plain css you know if if i need to work on something where i can't import like materialize or material uh ui then that's usually how i do it it's not exactly the effect so let me zoom in here and show so if you decide to do just the plain css underline it's nice you don't have to use any javascript but you don't get exactly the same effect so if you notice here it's very subtle and fast but it spreads from the interior to the sides even when we when we click out of it you see it comes back in so it's a little bit more involved than just changing it right and and that's closer i bel it's been a while since i've looked at the material design documentation but i believe that this is closer to the way it is supposed to be so but it's it's almost i mean it would take somebody who really paid attention to that kind of thing to notice the difference if you were to just put the underline there anyway so hopefully that at least cleared up some of how we did that oh okay was it tim says he styled the before of the search container no anyway yeah in this case it's used the the materialize component is being used so i'm not exactly sure how that is happening but i do know how you can get a similar effect with the css all right cool john hanson said that the new way that harsh it's set up here um is is a lot cleaner so yeah i definitely agree harshit also says that this is bleeding edge and um he had to set up a babble plugin to get this to work okay so yeah thank you for mentioning that yeah so since this is the the beta version right so it's not i guess normally you you would want to use stable versions for something in production i'm okay with this uh number one like we still have over a month until we were launching this so i mean it's possible that this stuff could get moved over uh into a stable release before then but also i'm i don't know i'm a little bit more open to using you know the beta version of things so i i guess it'll i guess it'll work out i hope it'll work out but i i think we've done it before on other projects uh so i'm okay with it obviously you know we're just gonna keep you know we're gonna test everything and make sure that that it all works but hopefully it all works i really like this solution and let's get started i don't know what's i might need new batteries in my trackpad i'm just having weird issues right now with my trackpad so sorry if i seem distracted that's that's what's distracting me i'm trying to test out my track pad it just seems like it just keeps cutting out but i'm not getting a low battery warning or anything yeah it's it's showing the battery just being fine that's that's just really odd okay well let's get started then and work with this let me remember to set my timer this time i'm going to pull it over onto this screen so you all can see it as well and we're going to set this for 25 minutes i'm going to work on this and then we'll take a break i'll go back to the live chat um i don't know we may only do one one coding session today i still have a lot of data to transfer over and it seems like now that we have this component all worked out it's going to just be a lot of repetitive things so may not be the it may not be interesting enough to do a lot of coding with so maybe we'll spend more time on the question and answer today uh we'll just see how it goes i mean this is all assuming that i don't have errors or anything which when does that ever happen okay let's see what we need well we're going to be working mainly i suppose in our server.js file today okay uh by the way if you do clone this repository if you've already cloned it make sure when you pull in changes that you do install the new dependencies so we've we've updated packages yesterday and harshit has added things in and made some changes uh to to babel so things will not work right unless you do an npm install or you just yarn so make sure you do that and restart the server if you already have it running all right so let's go right here where are we at is this the one i want to find the one that we just used that worked was it about yeah so we're going to use this same one as is almost you know like a template and let's go in here and set up some more post types so on my other screen i'm going to check our wordpress installation just to see what post types i have created and i don't think that i've imported all the data for all these types we'll go ahead and make the routes anyway you know we'll need to make them at some point so we may as well make them now all right i i do have a route that is about hmm okay so we have a page for our chapel so we do uh this is a catholic university so we have a chapel on campus and there's a lot of stuff that goes on there so we have a whole set of pages just for the chapel and all the things that that go on there so i believe about pages yeah it'll be chapel pages that should be the correct type chapel id page all right wonderful and i guess i can check see if we have data over here oh i didn't actually pull in those pages yet so we're not going to be able to test that so let's move on let me find one that i know i did have data for okay great so we also have academics pages and i would i need to start thinking about and if anybody has ideas let me know ways to clean this up this server.js is getting big i mean we've done more in server.js when we handle some you know like file uploads and different things so it's gotten messier than this before but i think that we can definitely clean it up so we talked about it before but it's getting to the point now where we could probably benefit from cleaning it up so let's change chapel to academics and now i think we can test this so let me just get the slug of one of these and if if any of you want to see like what i'm doing in wordpress on my other screen let me know really i'm just i'm just copying and pasting some stuff so it's not a big deal but i'm definitely willing to put it over on my screen if if you all think it would be worth it to see so when we do this we do need to restart the server so let me do that now i thought we set it up somewhere in some project to where we it would automatically restart the server for us if we saved i'll have to go back and check out you know maybe some of the package json files in previous projects because i don't remember exactly which one it was but since we're doing so many changes to our server dot js file then maybe it might save some time and be worth it for now though let's test this out so we're gonna do academics slash we're gonna go to the austria courses offered page no nothing all right well it's it's actually really cool that we didn't get an error i like that let's see if i spelled everything correctly academics pages academic okay um that is the slug actually of course is offered i wonder i'm just double checking to see if maybe there was some data and for some reason it's not being displayed yeah it's not being offered okay so what's the problem here or i'm i didn't what did i say offer this it's not being being shown something's wrong all right let's figure this out i think we have a css issue and our data is actually coming through i'm really glad that i i decided to look at that so if you remember when we were bringing in this data we were keeping all of the markup as is from the old database because that was going to give us a huge advantage in in speed we don't want to keep the markup like that ideally you know we would clean it all up at some point but that can be done later after we launch unfortunately sometimes we have weirdness like this that we have to deal with where content's just not displaying properly all right i think i set up all right so the way i handle stuff like this and other components is either i change the css well or both but or i've i've set up a like a little uh function that just changes the what did we do we ended up doing a regular expression right i think horseshoe you helped out with that so that was what we did we did a regular expression that matched up what we were looking for and then changed it so in this case like we don't want another title tag so we would change this to some sort of h tag in fact let's try to do that now see if we can get something to show up uh let's try an h2 for this all right we're still getting nothing let's see that's really weird what's going on display none all right the root is set to display none oh okay i see uh for some reason i was setting root to display none for a news.css that's really weird all right so okay so we do have something right we've changed this to an h2 so we have our tabs uh so we have tab content okay and more titles yeah this definitely needs some work wow wow okay yeah this content needs cleaned up for sure let me look at some other content within the same post type if it's something that's consistent throughout then we'll find a way to deal with deal with it a lot if it's just something that's happening for this one piece of content then that'll be something that we can manually change or have someone else manually change it all right let's see i saw uh and and andres let me know if i'm pronouncing that wrong but it looks like andres says hi i love your live streams they're awesome uh thanks for saying that i really appreciate that uh and there was an exclamation point at the end i probably didn't sound too excited when i say it but it was there but anyway thank you so much for watching and saying that all right let me find another piece of content here all right let's check out the content for online programs all right cool so the online programs content is coming through and it doesn't look too bad i mean i i definitely don't want to leave it just like this but this is not that bad all right great cool so maybe i'll have to take a look more at the structure some of this content oh sorry that was a big yawn wow this is like three days in a row now i've just been getting tired right at this point in the day and yawning all right so yeah i'm gonna just i'm gonna need to take a look at this actually this might be a good task for someone else to do like a student worker i'm just i'm not trying to push off all my stuff onto student workers but at this point i need to make sure i use my time you know very wisely to get everything done before launch so if there's some task that you know seems like it wouldn't take very much you know special knowledge of web development to do then that's a task that i could easily you know give to to anyone else who can do you know basic kind of data entry work okay so that essentially works right we're in the sense that we've set up a route and it's pulling in the data it's utilizing our page component and our page query that's what we wanted so let's check out our another post type we have admissions pages now which we have no content for but i can at least make the route and we've confirmed that this route does actually work now so we've got it to work with about pages and we've got it to work with academics pages so we should be able to use the same pattern admissions pages and so my my kind of strategy for organizing this content now is to go by um i guess like i don't even know if it's department it's not exactly a department but i'm trying to group things by kind of like larger i i you could say department right i mean academics i guess isn't but like chapel ministries i guess is what we call that department here and we do have an admissions department so we'll have we have certainly faculty departments but even within like the university their staff department so we're going to have one for uh human resources so actually i could probably do that as well so we'll have human resources which i believe just is using hr so i think we're just going to keep the hr and then that way all the urls will match up so let's go human resources and we may have some of these already pulled in let me double check see if we can work oh cool we do have some so let's try we have one piece of content and the slug is strategic approach so let's see if that works we're gonna have to restart our server again unfortunately i saw harsha putting some things in the live chat about using nodemon to auto restart the server so that's it that that's what we were using before so uh i thought that was it but i wasn't sure sometimes when i think something is the thing i just don't say it for two reasons one better just stay quiet than to look like a fool on a live stream also if i say it then it's going to be in your mind and if i say the wrong thing then i will possibly have misled some of you so i appreciate when i get that verification from uh from some of you in the live chat all right so let's try hr strategic approach yay all right so that works awesome and this is so much faster so i if you haven't watched the last like week or two of streams remember we were for each one of these we would make so for every single one that we've just done here which we've done for we would have made not only this but also a new component and a new query so really really cool we've already just i mean so much time being saved here it looks like harsh it says there's some other stuff that might save a ton of time do type those pages down i'm thinking of serving type id okay so harsha's thinking of a way to save some time very cool all right cool let me know more of what you're thinking because i'm not saying thinking server do i get and then type id all right let me know more of what you're you're thinking there server.get nikki says now go to those pages on the live site get that endorphin hit because it loads so much faster yeah let's do that because that is going to be really fun so let's go to hr strategic approach so we've just gone to it here you saw how fast that was franciscan.edu oh that was really fast for this site but still just can't compare with this now obviously it's running locally but still still so much faster awesome and i think ultimately you know it looks nicer too you know even just the basics that we've done here it it just appears more readable to me all right cool harshit says we can make a universal route for this i saw a repetitive pattern all right that's that's cool i'm i'm definitely up for you know cutting this down even more let's see let me let's look at this camp security did i do a route for campus security yet no i didn't and i don't have the content migrated over for that either so it's not really a big deal we can do that route but i'm i'm really interested though in seeing how we can how we can make this a little easier so oh cool javascript is here hey how's it going thanks for watching and let's see all right harsh is saying can i use teletype yet uh let me open adam and see if i installed telesite i thought i had it installed when it first came out obviously i'll probably need to update it if that's the case all right i guess i don't have teletype installed all right so teletype's installing now on my other screen we'll see how long that takes oh cool that was really fast let's see all right i'm not learn more okay they have a link to learn more about how to do this all right let me pull over adam on my other screen and so everyone can see it so i've just installed that and let's open up add project folder let's add projects and franciscan site is that it yeah this is it yes let's do this and let's see we should have a new icon somewhere yeah there we go so it's just uh sharepoint works just in the way people join your full device for the new id maybe i should do this on my other screen because i think i'm gonna get a portal id and i don't want everybody on the project all right looks like i have to log in at teletype.io so good all right harshit i'm sending you my um my code or whatever on twitter all right there we go it's sent and let's open this up little server.js all right so hopefully that'll work uh for what what harshit's trying to do here uh let me know i i really don't know how this is supposed to work so maybe we'll see we'll see harsh it when he starts to work on this i'm not sure uh until then i think my timer is almost up so i'm gonna go back to the we're gonna put that timer all right yeah time is almost up so let me go to the live chat now and i'll go back over here in case horseshit starts doing something with this oh there we go i can see a little picture of harshit very cool uh so i'm gonna go to the live chat and answer some questions and then maybe we'll be able to see what's going on here cool hey all right awesome so this is hardship typing right now this is really cool it's the first time i've used uh teletype with atoms so this is like google doc style coding i suppose so let's yeah let's just watch this while i i'll scroll through and see if there's any questions i can answer okay cool heart i see what you had said about nodemon earlier uh that's cool maybe i'll have to get that set up oh nikki i see you asked earlier about that graphql issue yeah check out um harshit submitted some pull requests one of them fix that issue so if you want to see the code for it you can check that out i went over it briefly at the beginning so if you you know catch the um the recording of this you might be able to see that oh all right and uh harshit says it's pr 67 so pull request 67. all right so let's check till hardships made a universal route here so we're doing a server.get and then we have type and id rendering cache page type and then we're also passing in the type here you know what horseshit this is will this work with everything human resources this won't work with everything yeah actually so this will only work with certain types right so it's still going to save us some time but it won't work all the time so like for instance it wouldn't work with this human resources one right uh so we were past we're going to the route hr but then the type is actually human resources but with here it would be hr up here and then hr pages down here so i mean i if i really it's possible that maybe i could try to make a lot of things fit into this so we could use it more like i could go back and change the wordpress plugin let's see so we're saying for hr place it above if it will come first express will render it and ignore this i mean yeah that's what i was thinking so this we can definitely use this we just have to make sure that it's it comes last so this would work let's see what we can get rid of we could get rid of admissions academics chapel about so let's get rid of these right now and now let me restart the server we'll just test it i mean it should work but always good to test all right that should still work right no no did um i didn't flip the order right wait did i get rid of hr too i did sorry about that got rid of too much all right now let's restart this and start it back up good thing i checked that and i just assume that it would work um i was planning on using that pattern of saying like like academics pages admissions pages for a lot of the other different post types that i have to make so that it should automatically work for a lot of these which is really awesome all right so let's try let's just hit the back button and let's make sure that these are working so that's academics so that's now using this so that just came through here right because we're not actually saying academics anywhere that came through here and it worked properly awesome we go back another one okay this was the one that had problems like the date is there but there's just some issues with it displaying cool our about page still works so you can see we had taken out the about uh route there so it's hitting this one awesome all right that's really awesome so unfortunately because of just the because we have to match up how the urls are on the current site we're not going to be able to use this for everything there's just too much variety and how how that you know came through i mean it's like i said i'm gonna keep in mind this from now on and when i make new post types and bring things in i'll try to follow the same pattern so it works for as many things as i can make it work for maybe i i could probably switch up some things like hr the only thing that i it's going to be a problem are hyphenated things so if things are hyphenated for instance like campus hyphen security and hyphenated in the url i can't bring even if i were to change the post type to campus security pages it would still be campus hyphen security and i can't pass in a hyphenated thing this it makes an error with the wp graphql plugin so it has to be camel case so those are the only ones that absolutely won't work for this almost everything else could work with the exception of i mean i guess we have minor but we don't have pages some of them just won't make sense to put pages on the end but we could potentially just to take advantage of using this for now i'm not going to worry about changing what we've already done because that's that's just going to be extra work we don't need to do it right now we can do it after the site launches or if we have time when we finish everything else but from now on i'm going to try to use this so thank you very much harshit since i ended up doing coding on my question time i'm going to go back to the live chat now and try to answer these questions okay uh okay uh nikki says might need some translation layer between the the type uh and the string passed into render and cache next to type so yeah that's that's right actually yeah why didn't i just think about that yeah we could do something where if there's a hyphen it changes it and i'm i'm sure there's a way that we could also capitalize you know the the second word as well okay so actu that is possible so something hyphenated it that's not really going to mess us up thanks for bringing that up nikki um it actually seems like yeah obviously we can manipulate strings in javascript like now that you say that i'm like what was i thinking but i really uh i think that's a good idea let's see the restaurants i lost my place in the live chat here sorry angel's here hey how's it going peter says i've been trying to follow along as much as possible but missed a lot of the beginning streams what's server.js okay so our our server.js file was we're using node.js which is javascript running on the server side sorry if you know all this i'm just like explaining as if you know it's it's somebody that doesn't know everything so please don't take it uh personally so it's javascript running on the server so right now what we're doing is we're listening for requests and then we're doing something based on that so if we get a get request to a certain route we're going to do something and what we're doing here is we're actually we're caching that request but and then we're rendering it um or reverse that right but uh we're sending it to the component that's the page component so page.js and then we're sending some variables so we're sending the id which is passed in here and we're sending the string human resources we actually worked on another way to do this that's that's a better way here this one's a little bit easier though for me to explain uh because they're less less variables going on so that's all we're really doing in this section of our server.js file uh we're just making sure that when a user comes to the site to a certain url the right components with the right information gets sent back to that user so the right thing renders on the screen let me know if that explanation was okay if you need me to explain some more alright rook says make a translation object pull the corresponding value from the key and pass that into the type in rendering cache then everything fits in the universal route do you use a you do use a translation object though okay harshit says this will not hurt you just have to follow a post type naming convention nikki says you can make it default to the way it's working now by using a logical or operator just thinking out loud here uh it will work right our says make route for that one that also fits in that method life and everyone's okay cool so uh nikki and harshit basically are still talking about uh these routes essentially there is a better way to do all this to cut down on the total amount of routes so again i'm going to say and i think they're saying a lot is before i said this before but i'm going to say for now everything that's there is going to stay there everything new that we add on i'm going to try to fit either into this route or into another like universal route so it's universalish right so it doesn't work everywhere um we're so either going to do that or we're going to have some type like nikki was saying of translation so that basically the type that gets passed in here gets transformed before it gets passed in here um okay harsha i see what you're saying about the javascript.af stuff yeah i'll um i'll make you a maintainer and you can like message me about that too on twitter or whatever and we can work all that out uh peter says okay cool i definitely need to jump into some node.js soon currently doing a codecademy pro intensive course for building web apps using react so i would guess node would be good to learn next yeah definitely i really like using node with react i i know you can use react with with other stuff uh but node just seems so natural uh since you're already using javascript like i don't know i i figured like why why not use full stack javascript if you're making web apps right like no sense bringing another language in i to me that just complicates things more unless there's some really good reason why you ought to use another language then just keep it simple with just one so i think node is great okay all right well i've gotten to the bottom of the live chat here and so i know we only really did one like coding session but we're already coming up on an hour of the live stream so i kind of went over into uh the a little longer than a 25minute session so i think i'm going to wrap things up here um anahil says how can i help with the javascript dot af repo okay i'm going to say this i don't want to spend too much time talking about the javascript.af thing here uh because it's not like well number one i am i'm at work and the javascript out of af is a side project thing but the other thing is too like uh free code camp is you know nonprofit so i don't want to bring bring something in that potentially will end up being forprofit into here so anybody that's interested in javascript.af check out my github so jesse r weigle i think is my github check it out you can bring up issues and things in there and we can just discuss it if we get a lot of people involved maybe we can find out a better way to communicate but i think for now github issues will work fine so right now i have two repos javascript uh hyphen af is one for the front end and then we had javascript af api which i don't think we're going to be using for back end stuff because i think we're going to use firebase so we may just be using the one so you know go ahead and check out the repo open an issue if you if you have questions or if you just want to let me know like hey i want to work on this that's cool and um let's see yeah right now it's really bare but we will be doing some things so basically something that would be very helpful right now is javascripter um has built out like front end all the design but it's not all reactified yet right so that needs to be changed into react components on the repository that resides on my uh my github profile so my account so maybe we could get something going maybe i'll make an issue or something with all the relevant information of you know bringing things over and then if you would like to help you can just pick some piece of the ui to turn it into a component and we'll i guess we'll go from there so let's see i think that's it all right okay cool so i had some other things coming up in the live chat but it's all javascript af uh things so they said just message me on twitter or something about that or put it in the issues in the repo let's see uh nirev says hello i am new to javascript i want to learn javascript from scratch and want to clear all fundamentals any suggestions you could check out well free code cam their curriculum will help their exercises so freecodecamp.org if you like books there's a book series called you don't know js and you can read it for free on github so if you just search you don't know js github it'll be probably the first thing that comes up you could read through those otherwise if you prefer videos i mean there are a ton of good videos but in particular beau has a whole series of introductory javascript and more advanced javascript videos here on the free code camp channel so you know check check those out if you can of course there's i'm sure there's probably an audiobook version of you don't know js as well if you prefer that but between those resources that'll be a good foundation for you so if anyone else has any suggestions please put them in the live chat there for uh for nirv oh cool um i should sound like using style components nikki says definitely want to learn about style components or definitely want to help awesome uh harsh saying we can't use jquery yeah yeah we don't want to use jquery for react for sure um okay i'm gonna wrap things up here if we want to continue the javascript af conversation somewhere else that's cool maybe i'll open some issues on github uh just to to get everything straight and i'm trying to think we can or else can we talk we do have the free code camp slack that we've created uh for the live chats i haven't actually checked into that slack channel in a while but uh we can also start a channel on there and talk about it more if you want so anyway let me know you know you all know how to get a hold of me all my social media stuff is out there so if anybody's interested in the project let me know somehow and we'll get it harsh it says a gator room would be good yeah a guitar room would be great as well so yeah we'll figure out some some better way of uh talking about this and then where we can all talk you know as a group i think would be good all right so i'm gonna wrap things up for today i'll be back tomorrow and i'm not sure what we'll be working on i'll try to think of something more exciting than just doing the same thing here and maybe maybe we can do some more work on the homepage and get that nicer i'd love to get that to a point where it really looks good we can start showing it off to people all right cool until then have a great day
