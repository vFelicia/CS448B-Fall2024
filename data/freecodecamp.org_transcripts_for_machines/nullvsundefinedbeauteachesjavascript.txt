null versus undefined these are both data types in javascript in javascript undefined means means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value such as as you can see when i run this in the console it shows that the variable test is undefined i have created the variable but i haven't set it equal to anything but if i down here if i say that test equals null and then i console.log it you'll see that it shows null in the console null is an assignment value it can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value so while undefined is set automatically just by not assigning a value javascript never sets a value to null this must be done specifically in your program so let's test some things about null and undefined we can see the type of null is an object this is actually for legacy reasons that it doesn't show a type of null but if we check the type if we check the type of undefined it makes a little more sense you can see this at the very bottom type of undefined is undefined oops let's clear that if we try to check if null is equals equals equals undefined you can see false now this equals equals equals is the identity operator so it shows that the identities are different null is does not have the same identity as undefined but if we use the equality operator equals equals is the equality operator if i check that you can see the last one is true so javascript does consider null and undefined to be equal now if i check the identity operator to see if null is has the same identity as null as you'd expect yes it's true it shows true down here and if i check to see if null is equal to null you will see again if you just go to the bottom true let me clear that now if i say you know the exclamation point is means not so if i say not null this is going to equal true not null is true null is is false except if you console.log null it's just going to say null however if i'm going to just put two exclamation points in front of this and console.log and you look at the bottom false so that's why you'd want to use two exclamation points one exclamation points changes it to true and then two changes it to false another thing interesting that if you try to add one plus null and i run that that's gonna actually equal ones so in math null is basically zero however if we do one plus undefined it's a little different and that's going to equal nan or not a number so undefined you can't add anything to it because it's not a number well thanks for watching my name is beau carnes the code in this video and links to more resources on the topic are in the description don't forget to subscribe and remember use your code for good
