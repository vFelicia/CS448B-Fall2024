learn advanced music production with FL Studio in this course from Tristan Wilcox Tristan is a professional music producer with over 10,000 hours in music production in this course you'll learn complex techniques that will transform your approach to cing music Tristan covers everything from mastering plugins and sound design to understanding the subtle differences between being a music artist and a music producer in my first FL Studio beginner tutorial I taught you guys how to make your very first beginner track and I didn't assume that you knew anything I basically did the tutorial as if you had never heard of anything music production related and that you've never seen the software before in this tutorial I'm going to be assuming that you have made your own songs before you have been using FL Studio and if you're coming here for the first time and you do want to learn music production but you don't know anything about it yet I would highly suggest that you go watch some uh good beginnner tutorials and I have made a very indepth one that is also on this channel so if you watch that one first You' be uh greatly prepped for uh this one once you want a more advanced indepth look with this tutorial what I'm going to be doing is it's going to go a little bit differently um and rather than make a track uh because tracks that are in my estimation like Advanced I put in 40 to 50 hours into any given track and obviously that would be just a little bit too long for a full length YouTube production and while I hope I could record that one day I think the editing would be extremely tedious so uh for now what I'm going to do is I'm actually just going to go over some categories of Advanced Techniques that I think I could cover in a more realistic time frame so you guys can still get the benefits of having an advanced knowledge of music production without uh the price tag of having to watch something that would actually take that that length um something to know and this is going to be the very first thing so even if you don't watch the rest of this tutorial you at least get one of probably the most valuable tip you'll get um or you know what I'll give you two you're lucky today um the first one is that uh you have to love the process of music production if you don't like it you're never going to be a a truly Advanced producer or an artist in my estimation um my definition of an artist um I don't know what the actual definition is I should probably look it up but the one that I have written down here is that an artist is someone who can take a story idea or emotion and express it through sound um and I know it sounds extremely basic but the idea is that I have some idea or some pattern in my mind and I can like I have it there and I want to get it from here to onto the screen like that's that's what I want to do or I guess into the headphones not on the screen but you get the point and the software is just helping me accomplish that task so that is what I think an artist is a music producer the difference between music producer and artist a music producer just knows how to use the software okay and that's not anything too remarkable like anybody can learn anything with enough time and effort making music is a completely different thing and I think that that's why I'm really happy the first beginner tutorial I decided to teach you guys how to make music because that's different than learning music production you see what I'm saying so that's one tip is that if you don't know the differences between music production and actually being a music artist you might be trying to develop the wrong things uh so for for instance like if you just think oh I just need to learn more of about music production and then I'll be a better artist I mean you could be sending yourself on an infinite Journey that you'll never finish because being a better artist is a completely different skill set than being a music producer um it's about what the what can make you better at getting the ideas from your head on into the program rather than learning more about the program so yeah that's that's one thing the second thing and it does have to do with uh loving the process is that you want to constantly be asking yourself questions in life the like the what is it called um just adding things you're like oh this would sound cool if I did it like this or what if I use this like this or what if I use this in a way that's not supposed to be used or just you're trying new things you're trying to like uh you're always constant basically you're having fun that's that's basically what I'm trying to say you're having fun while making music if you're not having fun while you're making music then if it's not enjoyable I it's going to be really hard to make something good out of it and if even if you do make something that's a good production it may not really have an emotional connection with the listeners so those are two things that I think that already will help you just speed up the process of you becoming Advanced producer because if you spend time working developing skills that you don't need obviously that's going to waste your time so you want to be focused on exactly what you want if you want to just do music production you don't care too much about making your own music then sure learn the software as much as you possibly can but if you're looking to become an artist that's more the people I'm talking to because that's the Practical use for why you'd want to learn to make music in the first place so with that being said uh let's get into some more um advanced music production techniques that can help you as an artist so uh first things first I'm just going to show you guys um something pretty cool if I open up basically any plugin here um and by the way I'm using all free plugins so you guys can completely follow along with me if I just open up fidal for instance this is a great synthesizer if you guys are familiar with serum this is a very similar synth and it's completely free and I think it's I think it's amazing so if I just click on the plugin here and then just contr L this is a I'd say this is an intermediate technique but uh if you click control L it automatically puts it on the mixer as you can see it names it for you and it colors it and puts it on the nearest mixer that isn't already taken so and obviously the reason of why this is useful is is immediately evident if you've ever used F studio for organizing because what happens is you're like okay well I have to go here and then I have to go to my channel rack and I have to put it on a mixer and then once I get it on that mixer I have to rename the mixer and you have to do all this stuff but just doing control L it does it all for you so I mean obviously that's going to be faster a lot more efficient so right there that's just going to help you keep track of where your instruments are and where they are in your mix so just an organizational tip right there um the second thing is is that um and this is just uh for all those people who wanted a sound design course you're welcome I'm going to go over the basics of sound design uh because I didn't do that in my beginner course and I think that a lot of you were interested in that so uh let's focus on the basic principles that will underly basically all music production uh sound design your attack delay sustain and release okay now attack uh basically this is think of this as a volume over time okay so what does that mean well for example why don't we just play the note and see what happens you can see that we can follow this line and see what's going on so the it's almost like a graph so the higher on the graph the more volume the lower on the graph the less volume further to the left is closest to us in time and then further to the right would be in the future so you can see what what's happening over time to the the volume of the sound so what attack is going to do you can almost visualize it in your head but also explain it can help uh you can see that it's going to start off lower volume go up in high volume and then come back down okay so that's what attack does Decay you can see how it affects the tail of the sound you can see the sustain is going to you might be like what what does this do let's see okay so if you hold the note the sustain actually will hold it at this volume it will never go lower than the than the what whatever this is saying is at it'll hold it at that volume until you let go of the note when you let go of the note the tail at the end this little release that's what happens after I let go of the note the rest of it that plays is your release so what this is typically called is your adsr attack Decay sustain and release and sometimes you have some extra ones like hold hold is an extra one that's not on all synthesizers but it is on some and then delay which is uh your more fancy synthesizers will have this not all of them do um and obviously you can see kind of based off of what it did to the visual you can tell what it would do like soundwise but if you can just know this you can make all kinds of sounds so first of all I can make pluck or I guess chords uh if I want to move the attack down I can make more pluck if I wanted more of a chord I could add a little bit of attack and then maybe a little bit more Decay if I wanted to add a more Super thing you could have it have high sustain so so there's lots of options here um and depending on which genre you're making it's going to affect the adsr of the sounds that you're actually using so for instance synth wave they have like very long release a very long Su or very high sustain and kind of hard attack so it's like a very lengthy drawn out stuff also I don't know music theory so don't judge my piano playing skills um so basically that's that's the fundamental that's the most fundamental sound production I can give you the second part is we have our uh oscillator so oscillator is going to be What wave table it's playing over and over and over again so um if you click the 2D and 3D you can see the different views of the oscillator so I have this let's go to a different one so I can show you guys really what's going on here so that's the 3D view I mean that's the 2D this is the 3D view it's scrolling through the through the thing and then this is the uh side view it's pretty cool it it kind of shows you what is happening to the wave table as you scroll through it and just scrolling through it I just left click and drag up down or you can drag this not so uh let's just do some basic sound design things so this let's make a more of a synth wav is excuse me let's make more of a synth wav is uh type thing so let's use this wave table because it looks pretty cool and I'm going to start here I'm going to drag this envelope you see this is envelope one the one that we're working on if I go to a different tab it's going to change so it's like envelope one drag it onto this uh the thing that was changing the wave tape okay so now what happens it's pretty interesting so it's actually taking the input of this and applying it to this um what's it called this um knob so you can do this All and by changing this knob right here it changes the way you can see how I'm using the the attack uh okay hold on let me say this correctly the envelope of this is sh is working on this knob in the exact same pattern okay and it's basically changing the the wave table so it's it's one of those things that like more of like after you do things a lot you kind of know what they do and what you're trying to accomplish but it's harder to explain like in words what's going on and honestly I think that the wordy definitions aren't the most useful things in mustion anyways it's just like hey here's this technique you can use this and learn it so uh without overe explaining everything uh another thing you can do is if you turn this knob the opposite direction and this works in a lot of these type of plugins uh is it'll actually go the opposite way so okay so we have some cool there I'm going to turn up the Unison so what this is going to do is it's going to play the same uh the same wave table multiple times at different uh slightly different painting and slightly different uh pitches and by dragging down the dtune it's dragging down the panning and the uh the tuning of the separate wave tables to be closer together uh less detuned and less further right and left so we have something like that so right off the bat we just have one one uh what is it called wave table playing with just a little just one envelope okay now you could see how you get so complicated with music production because you could add another uh another wave table here you could add another oscillator playing a different wave table and that could have its own envelope so I could have this have a completely different envelope put that on maybe the the volume you can see just by using different envelopes and different things you can come up with completely uh really interesting uh like sounds just by adding multiple oscillators and multiple uh envelopes and you don't need to get that complicated uh you can make really good sounds just with one just like I was showing you before so even just with this uh we're just in the oscillator section right here of vital and there's lots of things you can work with this there's filters and these filters you can also automate with the envelope so like basically just think of this you can drag this envelope anywhere you can drag a lot of these knobs like all over the place and just be automating and changing everything over time and do some crazy stuff and you might be extremely overwhelmed but the fun part is it's all just experimenting and seeing what stuff does and what sounds good and then over time just by messing around and having that Spirit of I want to see what this does and it might break my project over and over again you'll start to very slowly see the connections between different plugins and see the see the patterns in them so I don't think it's really helpful for me to go through every what every single thing in this plugin does but rather give you the principles that allow you to go through many different plugins and understand the basics of each of them so the first uh principle that we went over was attack Decay sustain and release uh the second that we went through was the idea of wave tables that change over time um obviously our basic Unison and uh Dune and then we have pitch which is pretty selfexplanatory he's just going to change the p uh pitch up a note and then this is like the fine tuning of pitch and then uh our level which is just going to be the amplitude of the of the signal uh I showed you that we can add in different uh oscillators and wave tables that you can even apply filters before it goes to the effects and last but not least I guess I'll show you the voices over here so in the bottom right hand corner uh as you can see you can change the amount of voices that are playing so if I or I mean that are allowed to play so if I just play one and I try playing another note it's going to switch to that note and it won't let me play chords anymore because the max amount of voices I'm allowing is one which means that it's going to be just a lead instrument you might say Tristan why would you want to do this well suppose I want to have my notes slide between each other I could turn up the Glide and I could turn up the slope a little bit just to affect the way it Glides I can maybe hit Legato and now when I have just my one note and I play them uh play another note I could have a completely different style of sound just because I'm limiting it to one voice so it has to slide between the notes uh like and that's just an interesting thing that you could do and maybe you want to turn this off and then you don't want to Glide and you want to turn up the voices I have chords so just different ways of working so or it depends on what you want um macros uh this is important so a macro you can control a bunch of different things and then have it all one knob controlling all of this so this knob doesn't do anything on its own but it allows you to control many effects at the same time so let's say if I want to change uh a bunch like if I have one type of sound but then if I turn this macro up it affects a bunch of these knobs you could create a second version of that sound just uh based of How High this is up or down um next Advanced thing that you you can know is you any knob that you turn in almost any plugin in FL Studio even third party plugins can be automated so if I turn this macro up and down and then go to this knob up here and click right click you'll see that it says create automation clip if I just click that it'll create an automation clip and then literally if I just drag this up and down and we go back and we play this over and over and then go back to vital you'll see it's it's actually moving the macro in my uh plugin based off of this Automation and I and it works in real time I hold on I need to put this to attached so I can show you guys so that is like just so cool it it works so fast and you like can do things on the fly like as it's happening it's so helpful to do this kind of stuff so uh and automations are huge so you think that um maybe you don't want something to be changed within the plugin itself you can actually change it through automations out here and that could essentially act as yeah like a separate controller for it uh outside of your uh VST and that that could be super helpful so like if you're making a song and I want the volume of the instrument to be low on maybe the sine wave here I have it really low in the beginning of the song but as the song progresses I have this turning up over time just some things to think about just some ideas I can give you um so this is only the first section of the plugin and I didn't even go through all of it I didn't go through lfos lfos are pretty cool I guess I'll show you those really fast so this is affecting the volume but it Loops over and over again so if I turn the frequency up you can see kind of what's happening it's basically going through the playing it's like an envelope right here like the same adsr thing but then imagine that it restarts and plays it again after it gets to the end and then we can change the different uh Mo uh excuse me change the different modes so if I go to like sync oh maybe it's not sink hold on uh oh my bad I'm being silly it's um it would be SI you could do some clever things like that where uh it the way that it Loops is differently so sometimes you can Loop it based off of the the grid that you have in FL Studio so it will Loop like uh one beat uh one step like and then like you know just I don't know what the names are for it but then this would go based off a time so it could actually be offbeat with the song so many cool things you could do here um if you ever want to take something off though uh all you have to do is right click and click disconnect from lfl1 or you can go to the lfl that is connected to it and you disconnect from oscillator one and it will give you a list of all things that things are connected to so you can like disconnect things from where they're connected to um and this is also a bunch these are also really cool this has to do with like how you're playing like on your piano uh this will affect like the the the notes and Stu there's so many cool things in this PL I I could spend so time on all this stuff but we're just I want to keep moving too because there's just so much to cover okay uh effects so with effects uh this is basically think of this you have your your wave table uh your oscillator playing a wave table it's uh going through the envelope it might be going through a few filters that signal is going to move on and go to this next section called effects and then whatever you do in here is applied after this section right here so these go like in succession so now you have I can add chorus and it will'll apply to that sound we had from before oh my bad the level's off that's why because we had the LFO and it was controlling the volume so I have to turn this back up um just for sake of uh you guys not listen my piano playing uh let's uh put in a midi a midi from one of my midi packs so just that you guys have something to listen to that's not completely terrible let's play something that's a little bit more drawn out okay this is cool so we'll play this we'll turn the attack down just slightly and then we'll start uh just you know like making some cool idea so what we'll do is I'll add maybe just a tad bit Distortion just a little bit and this will just add just a little crispiness not that much just ever so slightly I just want it to sound like it's kind of like beaten up a little bit and then we'll add a little post to that Distortion and what that'll do is it'll just cut any he so got some really like epic synth wave action going on so we have uh let me just go through each one of these so we have filter uh this is just the same thing as what this does but it's just a your a separate thing I guess it's just if you don't want to use the Distortion you can just use this filter um EQ it's exactly what it sounds like it's just your standard EQ that you know just does does the thing um it I feel like okay uh let me just say this right off the bat I might sound like I'm going too fast but if you are a beginner watching this obviously none of this will make any sense but if you're in advanced or if you're looking to become an advanced producer in you're an intermediate stage then you should know what an EQ is by now so I don't I shouldn't have to explain it if you don't know what an EQ is then you probably should spend more time on the beginner tutorial and maybe make a few of your own songs and eventually you figure out what an EQ is and then you come back anyways so I just don't want to be too boring for people who already know what this stuff is because I know that if I explained literally everything like I thought adsr was a little bit too slow for explaining but hopefully that's helpful for somebody you okay flinger uh I can't tell you what this does but it does a thing to me a flinger and a phaser feel like they're doing the same thing with different uh what would it be called like different sound it's different sounds of the same thing that's kind of my take I it even looks like they're doing the same thing I'm not sure what they're doing uh I think it has something to do with the phase uh don't ask it's something pretty complicated but all I know is it can sound cool but sometimes it really messes up your master so lots of produc producers will avoid using a flinger and a phaser because they don't want it to affect their mix too much um Reverb uh very cool the Reverb in this is it's all right it's not bad I mean the reeverb isn't anything insane like maybe aala super massive or something uh we could add that or convolver or my favorite ROM ROM is the best Reverb uh it was free I don't know if it's free anymore I got it when it was free it was on some promotion uh this is a fantastic Reverb if you were looking for a good Reverb and you're I think I don't know if it's like 40 50 bucks this is completely worth it uh and I listen there there some plugins that I'm like okay there are it's hard to come by good reverbs let me just say that like so this is this is a good Reverb like if you're looking for a good Reverb highly recommend this one it just sounds so good oh my goodness okay anyways I'm going to stop ging at uh the ROM uh so different effects what did I miss compressor of course this is a OT t uh is the same thing as this so if you if you guys are familiar I need to turn off the attach this is annoying okay if you guys have used OT uh it's just this plugin right here this is so popular uh OT it's a it's a up and down compressor so downwards compressor um basically imagine you have like a line okay and a compressor as you bring down that line and then whatever the what's it called like the waveform if it went above that line it would just squash it under that line and compress that sound now the what happens with a upwards compressor is it does the exact opposite and I love upwards compressor what it does is I have a line and let's say my uh I have like a waveform whatever doesn't go to that line it's going to get lifted up to that line that's the way I understand it so it lifts up the low points and a compressor uh does the opposite or downwards compressor does the opposite brings the high points down uh so that's the difference I yeah I can't completely tell you if that's correct but I'm like 9% % sure that that's like about what's going on on a very basic level by the way if you're wondering I think OT sounds better than the Ott in vital I'm sorry I don't know why but uh this Ott is it's it's it's all right it's pretty good it still sounds better with it I think Okay cool so I pretty much went over the basics of sound design and I would say that this get got a little bit into the advaned ter territory uh not not quite there but the thing is is that I taught you how to become Advanced at sound sound design and that's by looking at different plugins and seeing which things carry over between them and then experimenting the heck out of everything and if you really want a advanced uh tip is to go to your master and then just spend time sound designing and just messing around while you have an Edison on your master and just click the record button right here and then what I'll do is I'll go back into my uh thing and I'll just mess around okay so like let's say you have something like that and you're like I don't know what you just did uh don't worry so I have this right here I go back to my uh playlist I can go to my Edison and as I was recording that I can actually click this button and it's going to put exactly what we just recorded into my track so then maybe I want uh that to be some like weird uh starting thing that I have that's just like the beginning of a track and then I stretch it a little bit and I make it some background element with Reverb and I click control L and I add that and I put some like huge Reverb on it and then I I don't know do something like this this and then I P P that down and then maybe I add some like crazy grossy thing to it where it like has some crazy maybe I C it up so as you can see you can do so much from just messing around in your synthesizer recording with Edison on your master and it will record all crazy things that happened in your synthesizer so if you miss something you're like oh that sounded really cool and you still have it recorded in Edison and you can use that later as samples uh for your for your music obviously this was like a really random weird example I probably never use this in a in a song but it's still interesting and you can still mess around like that and I know I went really fast with that I'm going to show you guys more about sampling uh later right right now we're just focused on the south sign aspect so also I don't know why that got applied to my master very interesting okay so uh right here I showed you guys pretty much I think everything I want to do and I the reason I did s design with vital is because I think right now vital is probably one of the best if not the best free synthesizer in my opinion I've been using it a ton is a huge I I love this I love this Bing that's all all I'm going to say uh Matrix okay so the Matrix is a little bit more I don't I would say more complicated to me than it is in serum but uh it's still it's still cool uh I don't really use the Matrix the whole time I used it a ton in in serum I haven't if I'm being completely honest I just haven't found myself needing it yet in vital but I know that is a huge what is it called uh like a huge benefit if you're doing some complex sound design uh The Matrix is going to allow you to more finely tune basically everything in so like let's say you have all the UI and it's kind of all spread out between these knobs and it can be hard to see like what's going on uh a matrix it kind of just simplifies it down to like basically inputs and outputs and very like uh almost like a pro programmer like language of how you use this uh I don't use this too much I used to in serum but with this I haven't spent the time to learn it so I don't want to teach you guys something that I don't feel 100% Comfort Comfort confident in but just know that uh there are good resources for the Matrix and I don't use that much and you don't need it to make it good sounds all right with that said uh the advanced again I have not really uh messed with this at all so Matrix in advance you don't even really need to make really good sounds in vital uh they're just extra things if you want to learn them so there you go and just with these Basics that I've taught you you can pretty much make uh any sound that you can imagine in your head like or any any sound you can imagine in your head any song that you any sound that you've heard in another song unless it's some super complicated dubstep sound like you'll probably be able to re remake that sound really easily just by knowing knowing these few basic things so with that being said I think that uh we're going to go to the next chapter and sound design this is my sound design um part for this chapter and let's go to the next one from here I also wanted to show you guys uh more indepth sound design that I've actually used in real songs that I have released on Spotify and I also would like to go over some layering techniques some automation techniques and I just thought okay you going to be way easier uh than just showing you guys each of these things individually it's just to go to a track I've already made and then show you guys how I used it in that particular track so right here I have a track I've made and I actually used um the uh Nitro pack that I added for free to my sample pack uh on my on my website so uh a lot of these uh samples I'm using a lot of these presets uh I used and you can get them too and use the exact same ones that I used uh in my samp pack on my website um also uh i' go over the exactly how I made this track completely in depth on my YouTube channel where I also release uh tutorials as well and that's just under my name trist wox as uh just so you guys can uh follow if you're interested so without further Ado I'm going to play what this sounds like and then we can go over exactly how I sound designed some of the things you can kind of get a snippet of uh some more indepth sound design for actual songs that I've used it for and we can talk about what I did so I released this as part of a challenge to make a song in one hour to see what I can make and this is actually what I made so I would like to go over a little bit of this because I think it's really cool how you can see the advanced production just condensed is like quickly as possible so I'm I'm going to be doing one more hour challenges and I'm going to release the full things and I think that this will also be a really helpful way way for you guys to get to see Advanced production action because you'll see what things I think make a song sound really good in the fastest amount of times you kind of see the whole process like compressed and then over a 40 hour period of some like really long Advanced course it would basically be that process but just like lengthened and added more time to it so I could just fill out the song and do a lot more stuff so with that being said uh let's go and see the sound design of the lead I think that that's really leader base first let's do let's do the base okay so I have the Bas here so as you can see I actually the pattern here is hugely important to the way the sound sound design of the base is made I have very short notes and then I have uh ones that go up an octave that help the lead or the base feel nice and bouncy so this melody would be completely ruined if I were to change the way my base was and made it like completely sustained for instance that actually sounds really cool never mind I was wrong uh so regardless uh let's go over uh how this base works so this base basically has a wave table that changes using this envelope um let's see what that sounds like and that's literally all that's going on with this oscillator uh in the effect section I added a tiny bit of course a lot of distortion I took out the highs and I added a compressor so really not too much going on so you might be thinking how does this sound so much better uh with um with the sound with it being so simple because if you copied exactly what I just did it would not sound anything near what the final sounds like and that's because of two things one being that on my base I have let me drag this so you guys can see it uh I actually let's do this um just make sure it's in view um I have uh different things going on on the base effect rack so I have a overdrive which is just adding a tiny bit of distortion I have an EQ which is affecting the way the balance of the sound is I have a sound cizer which uh yeah you can make fun of me now I love using sound cizer I don't know why it makes it sound good and I know a lot of people say it's terrible for your songs but I digress it sounds good um so that's it that's all I added and it just really beefs up the sound uh so that's really all that's going on with the base um I know it sounds cool but there's not too much going on I just had a little bit Distortion a little bit compression EQ here and there and then just try to keep it simple and I mean the end result I think it sounds pretty good uh I just added a couple other presets here as you can see and one of them was a one octave up just to add a little bit more a midbase field to the sound so I have actually three oscillators you can almost think of it as layering three separate bases which is part of sound design is layering so uh this you could think of this uh preset as having three different layers if if you will and then I just uh changeed the levels of this to get the desired sound I want if I were to change this it could change dramatically so you can see just just by changing those around it can really affect the the sound uh next I have the lead sound now the the reason that this one sounds so quiet is because of the different automations when everything's when all the automations are turned on this lead is a lot louder but we can still listen to it so look at how many times I play the same note in a row one two three three I'm going to count that four even though there's slide five six yeah six times so six times in a row I get away with playing the exact same note so your Melodies do not have to go up and down like crazy to create a really uh cool melody in my opinion uh you don't need to make them super complicated just make it easier for the ear to follow and catchy and this works because I have a cool Basse pattern going and then this assist I play the same lead and with the drums it just kind of hits at the same time so it's like oh what's going to happen because you hear like let me just show you so like like three times you hear it hit and you're like waiting for something to happen it's like all right let's let's just turn on everything here it's like almost like you think it might you think the melody might start then the second time but then nothing happens the third time nothing happens and then same I'm like just pushing your expectation just a little bit further and you're like uh and then and then it's cool because I removed all the drums here and then it they came back in so you can see how like my entire production is revolving around like I I just made a heart uh Revol Ving around what I think would be essentially like cool like I'm like okay well if I'm playing the same three notes right here I'll remove all the drums to build up like anticipation for when my melody does start um if I was just a music producer and I wasn't an artist I would just be like like I I would never think uh I would never think of that I I might just put the drums all the way across because that's like a normal thing to do and it might just sound like pretty boring it doesn't have the same feel uh in my opinion so that's that's one thing is that like you're influencing your decisions and your production techniques based off of what idea you have and so that's the key thing to being an artist is that you're actually the process of music production changes based off of what you're trying to accomplish and so if you don't have that uh if you don't have that like okay so when you start off you might not have an exact idea for what you want to make you just start making something but then an idea that you kind of realize that there was a reason behind all the actions that you were doing and all the choices you were making and you can if if you can kind of like hold on to that then you can like make the whole song around that idea it's I know this is sounds so complicated but it's really just like an experience that you have to have making music and I have shared this experience with so many different people who make music they know exactly what I'm talking about there's something that you can kind of like feel and you're like yeah this is the direction I need to go and then once you can kind of hold on to that and like make the whole song around it that's really when you're uh making doing like doing art it's not just like uh the difference is that if you're just kind of making music and doing stuff and you're not feeling anything and there's no idea that's like kind of pulling you to to make certain production decisions then I don't think that you're really making music if that makes sense like there's a there's a a huge difference between those two uh and I know I've already mentioned this like four times but I just really want to drive it home that point because it's so important uh but anyways I digress again so let's listen to some of the cooler things I did with my drums here so I showed you oh wait I didn't show you my lead s design my bad guys okay so uh lead is not too complicated I just have uh it's it's almost the same as my base I think I took my Basse preset and literally just pitched it up I'm not even kidding and then I think I changed the wave table that was it uh so this is actually the same as my base so I literally did the exact same thing I might have just changed the envelope a little bit and that was the only difference I made and then for the second lead I just changed it so the a part of My Melody has has one has one sound as you can hear this is the a so this is like the a part of my melody and this is the B part with a different sound and again we can distinguish the A and the B parts of My Melody based off of the Rhythm that they're playing so technically this is like a b c c okay and the A and the B are kind of using the same the same melody or the same sound okay to introduce the the next part and so I actually I kind of belabor the point of my of My Melody by changing the instrument when it changes the Rhythm and changes uh Melodies is I I want to kind of emphasize that change by changing the sound so if I use the same sound the whole way through I feel like this would be incredibly boring so like I can I can show you what that sound like it would sound like this so it's sound like this I mean it's still cool I not even going to lie it is kind of cool but it's just not the same it it sounds cooler when it changes here I I also noticed that it also sounded cooler when I changed it because I forgot that my automations changed and at the end of the automation it actually shifted the sound entirely so this actually would have worked anyways and got the same thing I just did it differently here anyways uh you probably are wondering about this sound right here and if you were just watching my sound design section you would have saw exactly how I did this technique and if you are really clever you might have actually known how I made this sound so if I go into my piano roll and open up fidal you can see that I actually have this aane all the way up I don't know why it's so short that doesn't really matter though uh and I have an LFO which has my frequency on seconds so it does that exact that that thing I was talking about where it goes like and then it like lengthens out you saw me messing around with that it's doing that with vital so hold on let me go to attached view sorry I know this is like so messy here I'm trying to get it organized so you guys can see what's going on uh let's just close it thing and then reopen it back up okay okay let's go here so you see you see what's changing down in this LFO that's that's what's going on and I'm automating that uh LFO with a automation here you can see I'm the LFO frequency see going down here so as it goes down it increases in seconds so that is what I'm doing so I just want to show you a real life example of me automating a knob in vital in my song to make an effect that I was trying to get uh anyways okay so I'm going to take this off to attach because I can't say uh let's go to my drums and now I I showed you guys the lead and the bases it's so simple I literally just had one uh synth for each and then I just processed the the lead and the lead processing was so so simple what I did was I basically actually used my my base what's it called my base uh uh insert as a bus for my lead in my base and you might be going like what in the world you put your lead into your base I did and it and it kind of works so I'm not even going to lie I think the reason it works is because the compression of the lead and the base go together before it gets recompressed on the master and that's why it's so like uh kind of loud and it just works so for my lead preset I literally just have fresh air which uh kind of increases the highing gives it a little bit more crispiness um I have Crush automations which are just bit crush and those turn on and off throughout the song and kind of highlight different parts of the melody with bit crush and I have another KZ bit Crush all these are free plugins by the way delay very cool I don't think I ended up using this but it is a very cool plugin and then I just cut out some of the lows so it left some room for the base and then I boost to the highs again so that's what I did and then on my lead I also always make sure to add white noise so the reason I do this is because it fills up all that highend so I pitch the White Noise up to 48 uh and then I just have it hit on it depends on how you want it but I kind of automate it so that the white noise gives it more crispy like Snap because if I take this out and play it see how lame that sounds but then when I add White Noise has so much more energy it's like it's like not even comparable so if you're not using white noise you're really shooting yourself in the foot is terms of like energy for these type of music uh and obviously you may not be making this type of music but still white noise is is huge so let's play the drums and just listen what the sound first of all I am complimenting my kick drum by having uh these claps and ride so and then this is an example of just percussion uh that I added in I'm like oh it sound cool and this is literally me this is the process of advanced production I'm going here and going oh but happened if I took this this symbol and like Shunk it down like to a fourth of its side just played it over and over and over again right here it's like and then I increase the volume of these very slowly so it's was like and then that's literally what I'm doing I'm just like sitting here like minutely changing these things to make something that sounds cool that's like that's Advanced production a beginner they just would like pull a sample and this is nothing wrong with this I do this all the time sometimes it's actually better like you'll see over in the beginning of my song I did I just literally pulled the seatics hiphop drum Loop because I was like oh this sounds good and and that's fine but I also know how to make drum Loops too it's not like I don't know what I'm doing like I just did it because it sounded good and that's the end quality that I wanted but I I'm also capable and this is I think the thing you don't want to be using tools that take away from the skill that you don't have so you should be able to do pretty much everything but on your own and then just use the tools as complimentary things that aren't holding up your production but are like helping you do things that you already know how to do but just uh saving you time or uh improving your creative work so yeah whoops uh so I also took the kick and reversed it so it kind of like sucks it back in the kick right here you hear that going if so that just keeps it interesting just like little tidbits here and there and these this is just the type type of stuff that happens when you're like working for long times on tracks I mean this one obviously was an hour so I didn't have a ton of time but uh it was uh quite fun to add a all of stuff in so I'm trying to think what else I can show you guys so I uh added a obviously automations here and there to exemplify different parts of the melody the A and B Parts uh by automating different aspects of the of the sound and I also have reeverb automations that go in between the notes so that uh the Reverb plays when there's no note playing so it kind of fills that space a little bit and then I always make sure that I have a little bit of a background noise going in the background so that you can uh it fills up those empty gaps and doesn't make the song sound so dry so like if I take this out you can see the difference is absolutely massive so and there was other parts I took out so some things I mute because I'm like I I didn't like the way that turned out so like I I guess I had this I don't know what this was so I said okay I don't like that so I took it out so you can mute ideas overtime too and some things that don't fit and that's perfectly fine so that's just part of the process um I don't know how much more I have to show you guys I guess other than maybe this 808 was like really cool uh it sounded pretty interesting so like if I go to the beginning of the track here so I literally just took the same base and it's just automated different things to make it fit uh it's just like your standard 808 sound I thought it I thought it was really cool and I kind of reuse things to make uh make it go faster so I reuse this base uh from the drop as my 808 in this part of the hiphop song uh so that's kind of what I did um I'm trying to think what else to show you guys I use delay to have a cool intro effect here so that's why it sounds like it's repeating itself over and over you hear that like let me turn it off and you'll you'll hear the difference in like what goes on when I turn that off okay let's play now here there's like no repeating and then like let me turn the this delay back on you'll see the the effect I had I think it was huge I think that this really made see how cool that is I I love that delay effect I a friend show it to me and I've been using it like ever since um I have this really cool thing I do in the in the beginning of all my songs with convolver so if you want to steal my signature artist thing that I do go for it uh so basically this is what it sounds like I have a convolver on the master and right here what this does is it basically I put the preset on B and then I automated it from 100% to zero and and if I turn like the pink noise all the way up in any part of the song you'll hear what it does it like just washes everything out it sounds so cool and so epic I love like doing that to like kind of introduce a new part of the song so uh I showed you guys about layering I showed you guys about layering different sounds uh the one thing I didn't describe to you guys is that uh each sound that I picked in this particular track I had a specific Place board so I picked the three different um oscillators in my base because I wanted a mid base I wanted a sign subbase and I wanted a another low base so that's why I picked three different sways and they're all serving a different purpose then I picked my lead and I picked it and I'm like okay the lead will go in the higher uh range so that's why I cut the low or the highs out of the base so that the highs for my lead would fit there and you can kind of see my my head working like I'm like okay I don't want the base to have a ton of highs because I know the lead is going to have a lot of highs and so I'm sound designing and doing my sound selection based off of the needs of my track so I'm not just adding a ton of sounds throwing sounds at the wall until something sticks what I'm doing is I'm selectively and subconsciously picking sounds that fit the the ENT the entire hole I did the hard thing again uh to fit the entire hole the way that I'm looking to do so that's how you should be picking out sounds it's uh pick out sounds like you're putting stuff in your fridge from the grocery store you have like you wouldn't just Chuck everything in the in the fridge you have to like methodically go okay I have room for this here this here I need something that's going to fit here so I'll put something here and you're like methodically packing everything packing is also a great example there's so many different examples I can use for mixing it's like packing it's like you have a ton of clothes that you need to fit for your trip and you're packing them in certain spots and if you just chuck all your clothes in there there's a very low likelihood that it's going to fit together so if your mix sucks it's probably because you're throwing a bunch of random stuff in your suitcase and you're not actually deciding okay do I actually need to bring this is this useful nope going to check that out because that's just a random Pizza tshirt that I don't need so there's just like random things that you put in there it's probably not going to sound very good so just be very what is the word like intentional um and and uh it'll become subconscious over time of what sounds you're putting in there but basically try to fill everything up so everything has its particular spot and nothing's fighting for space amongst each other and you won't need to have a million eqs eqing everything because the sounds that you pick will just fit so well together that they don't need anything else um last thing I guess I could go over uh within this track uh that will show some more advanced production techniques is the fact that I used um my master I literally I showed you the convolution thing I added an OT this is hilarious I have no idea why this OT is on my master but it sounded really good for this song I don't normally endorse this I think that putting this OT on your master it probably is going to make mess up a lot of stuff for some reason it just sounds good and I listen to my mix and mono too and I think it's okay so uh sometimes the sck stuff works but I wouldn't recommend it and sometimes it can get you in hot water so I think I accidentally added this and I just kept it so sometimes that happens um happy accidents Bob R Us uh so with my fruity balance I usually have a fruity balance to just turn down everything and then I Master it uh this for some reason I didn't uh I'll show you a different example that this EQ barely boosting barely uh cutting just very basic stuff here um if you guys can't see my master chain I'm sorry I realized that is probably out of key okay there we go now it's now it's better um so I have my uh parametric EQ just barely cutting barely doing anything make sure to turn the linear button on if this is your master EQ because you uh don't want to create phasing issues or any different issues like that um fresh air I do this just to boost the highs of the entire track it fantastic uh this is a Frank pull free plugin it's called inflator it's based off of the Oxford inflator uh again it's an upwards compressor and I use this on my track to kind of bring up the low points and just make it sound more full um then I added a midside EQ so I could dynamically boost the mono subbase and I could cut the wide base on my track and boost the the side highs so the width of a track in the mono of a track I have separated in two different eqs that are both on linear mode and then I boost uh the EQ on the side in the side of my headphones I boost the highs in the sides and I cut the the base in the sides the low subbase and then in the mono frequencies I boost this sub and I don't really do anything with the with the rest of the mix and if you want this uh I have it also in my sample pack but it's so easy to make and I would feel if I didn't just show you uh just how to make it yourself so this is what it is it's just this this is what the midside splitter looks like you just open up Patcher put this here and then you just uh take one of the outputs put it to an and the other output to another EQ and then you drag it back to FL Studio like so and then that will give you a midside EQ which is probably one of the most nerdy but like cool things to do is to midside EQ everything and uh dynamically control the way your sound sounds with different uh and your mono and wide I I do I love doing that it's one of my favorite mixing techniques and it honestly will level up your Productions like from here to here if you just start using midside EQ uh in my opinion uh soft Clipper this is just my limiter cuz I didn't pay for anything so this is my free limiter is it just a soft Clipper so just goes to show I used to use pro2 I loved it and then I'm my computer crossed I lost everything and now I'm back to soft Clipper so there there you have it uh two last things I can show you is on my the C the for stands for I don't know what it stands for so I'm not going to make it up uh you click that it's not your master and I put a span on here and this just helps me see what's going on in my track dynamically with my EQ and this is pretty much the best like like as terms of a mix like if you're just like looking at that like look at this it's like it's beautiful like this is the what you are aiming for you like you have the the base and then it lowers off in the muddy region and then the mids aren't overtaking the entire track but then the highs are boosted up again to the human ear this sounds really good this sounds really good uh this is kind of what you're looking for if you have too much going on in here gets out a little bit muddy if you have too much going in here it might take away uh the balance of the track it might take away from the dynamic of it if you have a lot going on in here you're going to have a lot of energy in your track if you have a lot going in here it's going to it's going to it's going to hit it's going to hit hard okay in the in the cars so if you want to hear what it sounds like in your car without going to your car uh Frank pole has another amazing plugin called uh Inspector Gadget uh no it's not called Inspector Gadget it's called inspector 2 and you can click this on and it'll simulate different environments so I gu simulates like a really bad speaker I don't know what that is outside the club is just this is all you hear is just low it's your side mix invert the polarity swap the sides and just hear the offset left and right solo super great I love this and then I just turned it off uh and then yeah so that's my master chain I showed you my mix chains I showed you how I layer I showed you how I do my effects I showed you how how to do my automations I show you how to do rhythms with drums sorry for talking so much um and I showed you how it's okay to use samples and Loops but it's also good to make your own and that you shouldn't use it as crutches but it's using samples a completely legitimate way of producing um what else to talk about I guess Arrangement uh so arrangement I have I try to have some rhythmic element in every part of my track except for the the com the first like eight bars sometimes I'll have it very washed out and you're like oh what's going on it sounds cool and then it like goes straight into like the the Bas in go straight into this part so that's something I'll do um what else I have the buildup here obviously this is a certain style of music so you're thinking like okay this is EDM uh so or electronic dance music particular this would be Basse house maybe future house uh is um that's kind of the what your what genre it would fit in um if you don't make this type of music that's fine your Arrangements is going to just look different uh but these producing techniques are Universal and where you can take these techniques I've taught you to any genre I've made hiphop before I've made pop rock all kinds of different in learning EDM is I think the single greatest asset you can do to improve your production in all areas because electronic music production teaches you every area of music production whereas if I just do instrumentals I'm not going to learn a lot of flu because I don't need to with electronic music production there's so many different techniques that so many people use that it just you can learn so much and then and then reapply it to certain specific genres so if you make hiphop and you just practice your electronic music production I think that it will really help you with hiphop uh this is something that I learned is that I people who I make hiphop for they're like wow these songs are like really interesting I haven't heard something like this it's because I'm not a hiphop producer I'm a EDM producer who tried to make hiphop by listening to some things and so my takes on things and my Beats and stuff that I make gets out a lot more interesting and not like copy paste what other hiphop producers do because of just you come from a different place so experiment by making lots of different genres and will actually improve the overall quality of all your music across the board uh that's one thing that you can take from this so uh I hope this was help I just went through this part uh now we're going to go to the next part of the tutorial and I'll see you there in this chapter I'm going to show you uh some other tips that have to do with Melodies harmonies and just overall uh instrumentation and layering so right here I have what's called a layer if you go to plus uh you can add in a layer I forgot I already forgot where it was uh there it is right there so you can add in a layer and what that will do is it allow you to play two instruments at the same time on your keyboard so I added one Labs piano fre sampler by the way lives are fantastic and then I added another preset here but when I click my layer it plays both at the same time which is really cool so the way I did this is that I selected all of these at the same time with my layer open and you click set children and then this uh becomes a parent uh congratulations he's the father so uh we're going to go to the piano roll and we have this layer right here and when I whenever I place a note it's going to play both of these instruments at the same time so you can hear the piano at the same time so now I'm going to go through some of the uh some of the midi that I have from my sample pack uh again my sample Pack's on my website if you're interested and uh and right here I'm just going to use some of the mini as an example of different ways you can make Melodies and uh just understand uh Melody and Harmony making so let's just start with the first one I have no idea what this sounds like whoa so fast all right let's slow this down to like 110 Maybe so as you can see uh let's just uh simplify this down so uh I have this one Baseline going and this is just a normal Baseline like this is pretty much as simple as it gets and then on top of this I just added uh another uh note the compliment it another Harmony there two different notes and you see right here that I have an a b a b Melody why is that because this a parts match together and then the rhythm of these B Parts match together because these two notes at the end are matching so I have a b a b okay and then with that Melody I added another on top of there and then this uh has its own pattern to it um which somehow works in the in the process of the whole even though that they're actually kind of all different but I still say it's a a b anyways um but it's a little bit more complex uh basically I just kind of this is just trial and eror just like placing okay I have this pattern or idea or Motion in my head what am I trying to get out on here like I just kind of had this idea I'm like okay uh let's uh like here's a better example I want to start from scratch I'll just make ail you guys can kind of see what I'm doing so it's like I I can't sing but you get the idea this something like you know you can make all kinds of different Melodies and I just there's like pretty much like an infinite array of different Melodies that could be played on top of this but a lot of it comes from uh just kind of experience I guess is the best way to put it uh I made lots of bad Melodies and so by making lots of bad Melodies over and over again you can kind of see um I just want to show you a lot of Melody so you can kind of see the patterns between them and hopefully get a better sense of like what uh you can be looking at when you're trying to make good Mel so let's skip this one I want to make okay let's see what this is so again I have this uh interesting thing so these are basically just chords and then I have it playing almost like an art Melody so I can have I could have had this like this like this this was a completely valid and thing I could have done but it sounds interesting when I have it playing like an art so just experiment with maybe it sounds better if your chords are playing more of an art Melody uh maybe that leads into the melody overall as a whole um so that's another thing that you could uh try to experiment with um let's keep going and see what other Melodies I have here that's a little complicated to skip that so as you can see here I have a very simple uh like cor progression because it just it does it's not like a complicated Rhythm you know it's just playing like these four bars and it's just if I delete everything else but selected you can hear how simple this is so if I select um int selection and then just delete this a very simple core progression and then this melody on top of it is what gives it all the depth that it has and um I think that doing that is by having a solid if you build a solid Baseline you can build a solid core progression on top of that and you can make a solid Melody on top of that or you can go the reverse Direction I tend to find that either by building a strong base you can it can inspire a melody or if you have a strong Melody it can Inspire everything below it so you know what why don't we just try making a corporation maybe that that'll help you guys so uh something that you could do is just start with a Basse so I'll do it both ways I'll start with the melody one time and I'll start with a base another so let's just copy this this is very mysterious very interesting so so what if I do something like so I'm going to add a middle notes to these this is kind of interesting I'm trying to figure out exactly how to how to pars it here then you can take these middle notes and you can go up and active I'm not sure how I'm feeling about this Corporation so far I wonder what this sounds like it's interesting um it's definitely I guess I don't know what the word is I'm not 100% feeling it yet so what I might do is I might take uh these notes and just uh put them up an octave as as you can see for me it's a lot of trial on there seeing what sounds good not like good right off the bat that doesn't sound very good either somehow every single one of these notes sounds bad I like that I don't like that chord so you can see like sometimes like Melodies they they don't come too easily so sometimes like starting the Baseline didn't really work that time so like I'm going to try a melody it's also difficult and I notic this uh from recording other times as well is that uh long periods of silence for me uh happen because I'm thinking and I'm also trying to produce and teaching and producing are like two different sides of my brain so like I almost cannot do it at the same time and switching between them as you can see is a very difficult for me and also makes it really hard to make Melodies and a lot of times I'll spend even longer making really bad Melodies until something good comes up uh so it just goes to show that not every time you open up the pan roll you're going to make something awesome and sometimes you could use a different source of inspiration so for that reason why don't I try finding a sample and maybe that can uh help me come up with a cool melody or something that could help ins Spark some inspiration so what I'm going to do is I'm going to open up adsr sample manager and this is so awesome because if you download free sample packs or buy sample packs what happens is is that they can all be stored in adsr Sample manager and then I can search up different types of samples and it will sort them for me automatically and I can cool very quickly find something I'm looking for so I'm going to look up for a cool drum sample uh sample and then just scroll and then I only want Loops so I'm going to click off of that Arrow okay so 110 that sounded really cool I'm going to use this metal Rhythm and I'm going to turn it down in octave just to see what it sounds like that's really cool okay so I'm going to go back here and I'm going to search up instead of drums I'm going to find some type of weird guitar Loop Maybe and Just scroll down that's really interesting okay so now we have this okay this is really cool so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this sample and I'm actually going to put it uh why so what uh I'm going to teach you guys how to use the sampler and I'm going to teach you guys how to make Melodies so I'll just do both at the same time kill two BRS with one stone uh so except there will be no death in making this video okay so uh when I open up the sample here is I just double click on any sample and I can change different uh thing things and qualities about it so right there I turned down the pitch of the sample down an octave uh there's also reverse I could reverse the sample that's also kind of cool uh you can do all sorts of things I can change how how long it takes before the sample goes in I can change how long it takes till the sample goes out I can cross fade it uh which is really complicated but really cool um if I click not this wrench tool but if I click the other tool it lets me boost the volume of that I can clip I can clip it I do that a lot for drums and make it sound really cool um you can also add stereo delay which is going to make it sound really wide but it is going to mess up the stereo image slightly all the St image is fine right now so I'll leave you that with the stereo widened and then I'll control L with this guitar as well I'm going to add a CH to this guitar because I feel like that would sound really cool so I'm just add a vintage chorus turn that down I'm going to cut out the lows out of the and then this is just a a loop so I still need to add like drums so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to uh my own sample pack this is not the one I'm selling but this is just the one I've built over time so I'm going to just find some kind of cool clap here it's like a hiphop clap that's fine we'll just use this one so we have oh I want it I want it fast just like this and then I need a high hat so I need the high hat to kind of just play over and over again a very fast I had like yeah perfect just something like this and then I'm going to go to my pain tool and just paint across I'm going to put contr l and then I'm going to add pancake onto it and what pancake does is it's funny because I had pancakes R this morning uh pancakes is pancakes pancake 2 is going to change the St image to go left and right so it'll make it more interesting for our high house you hear going back and forth and then you know why don't we add a crazy Reverb on this and then have it uh just Decay over time it just gets uh turned down over time so we we'll just turn that uh Decay or turn the Reverb off then create an automation like this and then have it start all the way at the top and then lower over time and then we could have it go like a crazy 808 just hit really hard and then we could have a kick uh let's make a kick and clap a combo here that's perfect just use that kick so have it kind of go late just the easiest drum Loop of all time and then just copy and paste that over and over again so we'll just select uh the drums that we have here highlight them uh select that part of the song and only the drums and control bbbbb and then it's going to put that exactly over and over again for us and then to make it really interesting let's zoom in here copy this drum again paste it click make unique as sample and then go here and then reverse it and then we can just uh not stretch it but we can click off a stretch then we can turn this down oh my goodness I can't click turn this down like that like so and then that will make it so that it kind of slides uh and then we'll just take that out and then make it a little bit longer and then we'll add a base here so now we need to add an 808 so this 808 uh we want it to H hard so we are going to put an 808 Loop here uh and I'm going to go to vital and I'm going to go to whatever 808 sample I have and I'm just going to put contr l and then I'm going to go and find the exact so I save all my presets and I save all of my effects for those presets so I have file save mixer track state as so if I make any changes to this mixer I add things I like at the end of it I can go on this mixer right click go to file save as and I can save and type in the name that I want that mixer preset to be and I can go to my um the the sound that's going to that mixer and then go up here to the file go save preset as and then I click that and I name it the exact same thing so that I can open up my sound and I can open up my mixture preset for that sound every time I want it so then I have uh I can save my work from other songs and put them in in over time so so I'm never like losing my work uh and it helps you be a better producer over time because then you can have your work carry over you know so that's pretty cool uh let's make an 88 preset I don't really like the state away so we're going to change it it's just too I don't know it's not really working for me so let's find something else let's see did I make another one maybe I don't have one see if I can make something quick here we'll just copy paste this and then change the thing it hits it's not really fitting for me I'm not really deing the 808 pattern right here at all I think it's not it's because I don't like uh the patch either so I'm going to change the flex I'm just going to go to premade 808 so I don't take forever on making something but as you can see lots of ideas and lots of things that you try are not going to work first try and the point is not to try something it doesn't work and then quit because that's what a beginner producer does uh an advanced producer Tres something it doesn't work owns up to the fact that it didn't work and try something else again um and I made plenty of hiphop songs before but not every single one turns out the way I wanted to and not every idea turns out the same so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to find a different thing and see if I can make it work first of all it's because this is out of key so I need to fix that and then I can also fix it a little bit by just maybe clipping it here instead m so it's not I mean yeah this happens this is my like favorite song in the entire world um I wish I could have made something more interesting here I had an idea and I kind of lost it already because it's kind of taking me too long uh which happen so I might need to come up with a different new idea again I think that part of the issue with uh trying to show Advanced production live for me is uh that the part of my brain that explains and the part of my brain that produces two different parts and sometimes it takes me 5 minutes to make something really cool sometimes it makes me it takes me 2 hours and obviously I don't have that kind of like I don't have the luck that every single idea I come up with that hopefully while I'm making the tutorial live that it's going to be good but um that's just the way it is sometimes so uh hopefully by me not being able to make something cool you guys could to learn something too and that it's encouraging that not every time that you sit down at the computer you're going to make something but I forgot what saying it was but it's uh that sometimes that it's inevitable that you're going to make something something good you just have to sit through the production times of making bad things over and over again to get them out of the way until the good thing comes along so hopefully that's encouraging for you is that every time that you sit the computer don't expect to make something good but rather just go hey if I make something bad that's one less bad thing I have until I make something good so just think just change your mind mindset a little bit differently and then hopefully that will encourage you to make better things so uh I showed you guys about the sampler and different things that you can do in the sampler uh one thing that I really like to do also is is go to stretch Pro and then change this and this just format shifts it so you can have all kinds of really cool stuff here I still really like this beginning part it's really chill uh it's really cool so um that's just uh just another example just the format shifting I love doing that to vocals sounds really cool and then um putting this on stretch Pro also if I change this an octave down it won't change the but if I uh put this just on stretch listen into it now with stretch Pro it like tries to retain the same format it's interesting it it's quite interesting so I really like using the format shift the stretch Pro whenever they added that huge huge I love that update so much so that's just something cool uh also you can change the octave by uh right clicking on these notes this will change it so just another way for you to change the picture if you need to go a little bit further in pitch um anyways so I showed you guys how to use the sampler I showed you guys uh different ways that you can use samples in your Productions uh and I also showed you guys uh a little bit about making Melodies uh the funny thing was is that uh pretty much all the Melodies I made today were not good and then all the samples I tried using in production also weren't good but I did like this um this one percussion Loop here editing that to make it fit with this beginning part that at least was kind of interesting um so hopefully you guys got to saw a little bit of that U maybe I could pull up another production and then show you guys a different example of something that I did turn out well and then we'll go with that right now all right so I found a project that I worked on and this was something I made a little while ago and this shows a better example of how you can use samples and Melodies uh more effectively and just making a very simple production so this was just a very basic idea I made so this was a sample I made and that come from and that came from this and I love that was a weird ending uh I love uh using these samples just as quick idea starters for me um they really help me when I making music but this is something uh that I made uh it just has a few different patterns so this is one of them so you see I have multiple layers going on at the same time so I have let's just play the bass in this one so you see I have a call it's kind of like asking a question you can almost see that this this first part right here is just asking a question and then this is an answer this ask the same question again but with a different base so it's like almost like a different I don't even know and then a different answer and then it plays the same again goes over again and then add the same thing again with a different base pattern and then finishes off by the kind of completing the whole thing and then it repeats the whole thing and then I have a different completely different pattern going in the background this so as you can see I have a counter Melody here I have my main Melody here and I have my 808 base just playing a very simple Melody here and when all these things combine I with the melody and the counter Melody and the Basse you have a full uh more complete track and then what I did was I actually exported that Melody out and then messed with it around by pitching it down and changing the way it was formed and stuff and then added tons of effects to it so you see add these kind of effects I could have made it even more interesting by adding like a chorus done all kinds of stuff I could have done like update presser try that that might be a little bit too much but you know what there's like different things you can try here so uh try sampling your own Melodies so like make melodies a sample out of it by going up here right clicking going to consolidate track and then from track start or song Start whichever one you'd like and then what that's going to do is is going to consolidate that into a meel uh into a sample and then you can use that sample to either develop your own sample packs or to make your own tracks and that's what I mostly use it for so I hopefully this was a better example than me uh failing multiple times on how to make uh Melodies and how to uh make just beats and just like um uh how to use samples uh in your Productions but hopefully this was a uh a good um a better example of what can happen so uh and notice that I made this probably when I wasn't recording and when I was just kind of like oh I have this idea in my head and then it just kind of happen so um those are two different ways that you can produce and so hopefully that was more helpful for you uh you may have been wondering why it took me so long to release this course and I want to tell you I have tried recording this course so many times and just to prove it I'm actually going to show you one of the versions of this course and never got released it was me making a 1hour challenge and then that 1hour challenge I was going to take and then collab with my friend who's going to record vocals his guitar we're going to record all everything and then we're going to finish that song and then I was going to analyze the collab edit that we did together as the final uh thing for the for the full Advanced uh uh tutorial so I thought hey why not just add that onto the tutorial I've already gotten finished so I did so I'm added after this you're going to see a another 1our section of me making a 1 hour challenge just to show you what the advanced uh production technique looks like when it's condensed into a shorter time frame and I you can tell in that video I was really not feeling it I was like I I don't know if this is going to turn into anything I was just I was nervous I wasn't sure I record the video so many times I was like it's probably just be another take I'm not going to use but I am going to use it and you know what I'm going to show you what the final track between uh me and blender base turned out like and it's not even close to finished which is sad but hey it happens uh and the project file that I have is uh kind of I'm going to try to find it I'm going to try to reop it and then I'll analyze that after I show you the 1 hour challenge and then I'll try to do that as well just to kind of finish out on a strong note so without further Ado uh I'm just going to play this uh version of the song and then uh I will show you the 1 hour challenge and from there I will go into the project for this one hour challenge that is corrupted and some of it doesn't work but I still want to show you at least what we got done um so I'll play this and then you can see the one hour challenge and see how it cut to this point all right he in the front seat listening to the car and you H the horiz behind me looking at the dashboard fast FL and driving front SE listen to the G and you in Rise behind me looking at the dashboard fast forward driv to oh a anyways so that is super crazy uh super interesting a lot of it is like stuff I've never made before he's never made before it's just like this crazy idea is Just Happening uh a lot of it is like really experimental is the word I'd use it's not like something you listen to on the radio it's kind of like what is this like I've never heard anything like this but it's cool it's it's fun to make stuff like this um anyways uh so now here's the one hour challenge and when you come back from this and see what I worked on for an hour you can see what uh blend base uh helps collab on so let's let's check it out okay okay so my first attempt I forgot to hit the timer so I'm gonna have to restart so this is going to be attempt two so let me repare my notepad this is attempt two and this time I'm actually going to start the timer let's just open up a new thing of FL FL fresh and then we're just going to collapse everything in the browser all right now I'm just going to hit the timer and we are going to go so let's try this again attempt two this time I hit the timer so I'm actually doing the challenge that's unfortunate uh okay so I'm going to start off last time we started off with the drums and it's kind of sounded interesting but this time I want to start off with a piano so we're going to do a little bit different um let's see I want to pick something cool like I want to make something that's like like house drums but like acoustic so I want to try something interesting basically go here let me turn my notifications off on my phone so Focus uh can Volver I highly recommend I actually when I would produce I put my phone in a different room it was actually really helpful um but I mean obviously if you have people that you need be into contact with obviously keep your phone with you okay let's stick this here okay is this is like your stereotypical pop song if I've ever heard it okay let's get started uh this is let's just keep it with the piano honestly this is going to be just keep things simpler um the only thing that could make this more stereotypical is if I added rain so let's do that um let's go to recordings no no just kidding not there um where is it my samples rendered also if you notice I don't talk a lot when I produce this is uh the problem every almost every single time I recorded this is that uh I found that I literally barely talk when I'm trying to make music so when I start explaining I actually do worse so that being said uh if I'm quiet for most of the time uh the second half is going to be more me explaining this as I said before so that's why I'm trying to separate in my head that way I can focus on just making good music okay let's add another Labs no just kidding it's going to be I need like a really really electric guitar very electric come on that was loud oh these are Bas guitars I'm blind it's like to it's called like aggressive for I need like a a bass guitar here that's going to just be in the background and kind of oh that's nice I like that one you you'll hear my idea in a second here I'm just going to go there we go I m this B is like I was a little too um that was super cool I literally just accidentally hit the Z key on my keyboard with the the clap and it sounded so cool hold on that could be like a snare sample right ooh complete accident okay let's keep going um 140 I like that a lot using samples cuz I have to Speed it along here otherwise I wouldn't make my own own drum right now okay I want to see what key we're in 1 billion per so I'm going to take the chords here paste in the melody and see what it tells me a Maj for sure okay for sure for sure a Maj okay I can see if I have a vocal and aart major and waste a little bit of time yeah I'm going to do that okay let's go to ad adsr sample manager I can't remember if I already explained this because I know I for sure did in the first first tutorial but I mean the first attempt of this but I don't know if I have used this yet so I'm just going to look up another air major it's crazy like when I actually just focus on making music and like and not explaining everything I swear I make like 10 times better stuff okay I'm going to look up vocal there's literally only one vocal in each chart maybe I don't really like it put a major as well and I'll also do I want multiple multiple keys it's fine could be a different key it's not big deal that could be cool if I pitch it down and like you couldn't really tell so it needs to be like that oh w oh a okay so I have that so far uh okay I'm going to check my time no I'm not going to check my time I'm not going to cheat all right Focus your you need to make some type of drop some type of okay I already have an idea I have an idea okay so we're at 140 BPM I'm not even going to make a buildup straight up just going to go like just like that so it's literally going to stop right on this I need to get rid of that tiny little H hit right there oh that kind of sounds dope like if you have it like okay this is going to go this is this is going to be a little bit crazy because I'm just GNA I need a kick that just hits hard just a just an absolutely devastating kick like because I'm going to make something something loud here need a kick manager this is the best like how hard kick is like the least hard oh that's CU it's stretching the sample whoops okay that's yeah that's a lot um no too too much o was this a I just I just want the one kick and then I need a snare that's like give me a snare I need 808 808 808 that's thick I'm going use this one sampler oh this is the same 808 I made that that mixer track for bet uh speed interest in speed use speed oo no just to go like like okay so that's cool I like this a lot so I need um some type of the cord's going to hit like on the Dow beat like this make unique and I need to no I made it oh wait that's fine that's not a big deal okay let's think let's use Surge and I'm going to pick some type of cords that are like Keys artificial okay um let could be interesting uh let's use that sure just got to hurry up hurry up H up hurry up don't have I don't I have zero clue on how much time I have right now zero clue I'm just going to go like this and then I want it to just be like that it's so loud I need to add like a I don't want to add a eliminer to my master let me just turn it down okay there should be absolutely zero delay on this and then there needs to be zero Reverb on this too and then I also need this to have like no release Turn Up oh that's needs a little bit more decay okay I need some type of lead on top of here that's like something um I don't really have anything I don't think maybe like a do I have a preset maybe that sounds good oh that's pretty cool yeah perfect come on fast speed no this needs like w it's just so bad okay for okay so so far we have a fairly boring is like okay so we have like an intro I can imagine a vocal here I don't actually normally make hiphop so this is like really interesting I actually don't know what to do after this like I could try to make a drop um but I started at 140 BPM so it's like weird like can't do house um let's see I really want to look at my timer but I know I'm not supposed to okay I guess I could okay I'm going to take a second to just sit back and like think about this while I listen to it I think a vocal would really help me right now come up with ideas I usually what I do is I'll have like kind of like a base idea like this send it to a vocalist and then as soon as I get it back I like have a billion ideas this it's without a vocal it's hard sometimes to think about like what to do next um also I think the timer definitely makes me it's harder to focus on like just like ideas and stuff because you're like you don't want to waste time um since this is so unique in a way I don't really know how the arrangement is supposed to go I mean I guess I could strip it down even more in the beginning I could like move this forward just have this do something like that and then you could literally just fade it in over time that's clean you know you know it is um okay so I got that would also kind of sound cool here the chords okay so sometimes this is a great uh a great point to sometimes you need to know when to let your ideas die cuz those chords are too low pitched I knew they were I tried eqing them out but you just notice that they just weren't fitting in the mix and if something's not fitting you just need to cut it uh that just needs to be cut I should have done that a long time ago so let me listen to this again this is a boring sound I need to change it uh but instead of changing it what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy it paste it mute it so I'm just going to clone it copy it paste it mute it and then I'm going to go to this and then I can change this without changing what I had before so yeah n n I could even turn back on this um so my initial idea was that I was going to be like I should do this on piano because if I show you guys on piano maybe it would make more sense like what my initial idea was so what I really wanted to do was I wanted to have it be like uh let me sh for you by getting the melody as well here um so like my idea was it was going to be like and then it would be like like not like that like it's going to be like let see maybe Maybe not maybe not it's fine I like the I like the kind of drops where like it has cords and a lead but they're not going at the same time they're kind of like bouncing back and forth that could be cool um I could look at my time and then just call it or I could keep going and if I keep going I'm trying to figure out what I do because I can mess around with different Keys that's just way to low though now so if I go sounds really cool for like the first hit but then these these notes are too low so I need to go back up to be real with you a sharp is a bit too low I don't like to go below D sharp so yeah D is kind of lowest I like to go with my with my base dsh D that's usually the lowest you can go without it sounding like weird in the sub area I don't know why it's just that is always like that um I don't know I don't know I think it's good it's all right um let's see the timer 13 minutes I'm just going to stop it I'm going to stop it right there and you know what we'll say that that was a temp that was attempt two got get back to my Apple CIO here okay so let's talk about this for a second so um what I did was I I love doing this little intro thing so what I do is I take fic involver and I will put on my master and put it to the pink noise preset okay and then what that does is essentially like if you listen it blows everything out like in terms of the and it just creates this really warm like I could honestly I could even do this like this would probably make it sound really good yeah like this this right here yeah yeah yeah like something like this would be perfect so you just kind of take these two boom and it gives you like a hint of the future like song of like what it's going to be but it doesn't quite give it away yet cuz it's like all reverbed out so you can't really tell um I like starting in with the Basse and the drums and immediately off the start you want to hook in your listener another way we could hook in The Listener here is from the started here we could have a a reverse that kind of goes into it so um if I had like some type of uh what's it called sweep uplifter perfect just something like this very simple see how much of a big difference that makes just uh every eight bars you want to add something new this is constant so honestly if I really want to make this interesting I can probably take these vocal things for right now and then just leave it like this oh vocal thing and I think they sound cool I also speed up the base here um that's just to kind of give a little bit more movement cuz you don't want to ever stay like stagnant so like I can make this super boring like I just keep this the same too and then I like didn't do anything new in this part other than maybe add the chords like it's fine but this it just picks it up a notch I think that this is huge um and then obviously when I get into this part this is just a huge producer life hack if you just take out all the volume right before the the drop it makes it hit just that much harder so I think that's that's cool um I want to add in some saturation so I didn't really add any saturation to this that's like a million times better already I can't believe I didn't do that before um so yeah saturation to your uh subbase it just adds those extra harmonic so like we go into the sub face right here and for those of you saying that I my uh my subbase is wide uh it is not actually I'm using Bas Lane and what this does is it widens certain bands of frequencies over other bands so I'm actually widening 500 htz right here on my sub which is like really interesting because it means that the subfrequencies are going to stay low so like I could literally take a midside EQ here like if I go to Patcher and I go to uh midside uh I made this preset and I'll just straight up give you the uh guys this for free uh this is so helpful and I want you guys to have it um it so basically like that's without the wide hear the difference and then I can literally take out the the lows and the highs and it literally will sound no different because interesting huh I guess this 808 has a little bit of width in the bottom that's fine uh it still sounds good so I'm not going to fuss over it too much I mean if you really were worried about the 808 sounding wi in the bottom I guess you could always put it mon it still hits that's fine uh so yeah I like I like the way that that sounds so uh I also really like using that in general just so I could put like a Patcher here with my midside EQ preset and if you do this um like I don't know why I need to resave this preset where the stereo is on the bottom uh basically it splits the bands into a midside EQ basically means that you can take the the frequencies that are in mono and mix them separately from the side frequencies so that's what this bar is right here so when I turn this wide it makes things get wider and when I put it this way it makes this mono so the reason I have it like that is so that I can mix these separately so like listen boring way more interesting because I'm boosting the highs and that just kind of like tingles your ears okay so I would side chain the Basse but I've noticed for a lot of hiphop producers they actually don't side chain the Basse in the kick and for some reason it makes it distort when the kick hits the base and it sounds actually cooler uh so like if I were to side chain this it would just kind of lack that kind of uh messy energy like where it just like everything's just kind of hitting into each other like that sounds cool for hipop so I've kind of noticed this is kind of a thing to do if I take that and then I might just oh that's the vocal what am I doing where's the I might add it like a transpire on this and then just boost add a little bit of saturation oh that's on the wrong thing so funny that's fine I actually never put these on mixture tracks that's crazy let's put that on the mixure track here we go um okay it's funny because I'm doing like this one hour challenge but I literally like just woke up I'm just going right into it right in the morning uh I usually produce like really late at night I would like to hear when you guys like to produce I I made some of my best tracks at like 400 a.m. in the morning it's hilarious obviously it's not good for your sleep but I mean yeah um okay so what else can we can we talk about about this so uh we talked about the progression and how we just want to kind of increase energy over time but also keep the listener engaged you want to change things uh eight bars uh like keep something changing all the way through uh I think some other things that intermediate producers I notic struggle with is that yeah with one thing is keeping things interesting um hooking The Listener right away uh not having to keep everything all the time so I don't actually need this melody playing the whole time I could actually take this out like and this would actually be really good because what I can do is I could have a singer on here and they could be like singing here and just doing their thing just have the melody coming in that beginning part and then just have the singer come in here I can't sing but if I would sing it would yeah it probably wouldn't sound good so uh let's see and then you bring in the melody here and then you're like okay that leads you into it and then I could completely change the melody here too like just for for instance like we could literally just change the whole thing right here could be fun let's just try never mind we're not going to change uh okay so another thing is that be cognizant of What BPM you're in in what kind of stuff that you're making because obviously like I can't make house at 140 so like just keep it consistent in terms of like what you're trying to do I think that that's uh some people like they'll don't change to BPM during your track it's confusing for The Listener um like I would stick to like kind of one whole idea uh per track if you have like four ideas going on in a track like it's going to just confuse the listener so um I wasn't doing anything crazy here uh I started making hiphop because I was at 140 and I just stuck with it I didn't change BPM I could have I could have like maybe I could like turn it down to I don't really want to do that because I stretch everything but that's fine just leave it how it is uh I'm trying to think it's it's also harder for me to give advice with hiphop music because I don't actually make a lot of it uh I make a lot of future balance in like different uh EDM genres but I've been trying to do more hiphop because it's it's it's a lot of fun to produce um so let me let me think typically what you saw me uh mess around with these vocal samples uh don't look at something immediately and just go like no try to see like the potential and like things that you could use so you saw the vocal s pi and you're probably like e that does not fit at all but I heard something in there and I was able to pull it out to make something kind of cool so like now we have this and that adds a huge just like background element also another thing is that notice how I just because I found something cool I didn't have to use it constant l so like this crush this was like this little uh um this thing that like uh I forgot what what the term is called but it has a certain effect on the vocals that I liked but I didn't want it the whole time see it's not there and doing these kind of things where you don't do it all the time adds a lot of progression to your uh to your music so like taking out the rain sounds in in the drop here if I kept them in it's just kind of more going on if I take it out it just has that more of that drop in feel where like you're hearing a lots of sound here I could honestly I could you could even do like a fake out there there's so many potential things you could do but once you like kind of like suck everything out once it's like it's all like sustained and then like you can just take cut everything and then it hits so much harder so uh that's that's one huge thing uh one thing I didn't do which I could show you guys is if a really cool trick basically you're going to go to your master create an automation clip and then create one automation clip on on the stereo as well and then what you do is for the stereo separation you're going to put it up like just maybe like halfway and then for the volume you're going to go down like three Deb do that do that and then check this out okay that might be a little bit too much on the volume side let me one sec go like right here you don't want to do the volume too much on the master but just as the effect everything kind of goes lower and like more in in your headphones and then it like widens out last second it's super cool I love doing that so that's another cool trick that you guys can do um let's see for 1 hour challenge or I guess like a 50 minute 45 minute I mean I didn't really I wasn't really producing the last 5 minutes I was kind of just thinking uh I guess yeah uh don't be afraid to use Loops right here I just wanted to save time and it was a cool idea and it sounded nice so I just kept it in there it's not a big deal um using Loops can just give you a lot of creativity and freedom free up the mind to do other ideas um let's see here I have like AAR major I could add in like other stuff so like let's find another sample that sounds cool with this so I go back to adsr sample manager and I'm just going to repeat this part right here and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to go only on loops and I'm only going to search up a major samples and just literally play them with the song and this can lead to all kinds of ideas H this sounds interesting I know it doesn't fit in how it is but I think like if I like let me show you an example something so like let's say I have some a sample that doesn't quite fit and you can do things to make it fit sometimes so like I can take out so like maybe that doesn't work but maybe I can like take this and like pitch it up never know just do something like that maybe not I I always like to check so sometimes I'll just throw samples in there and like sometimes you get lucky and you're like oh wow that sounded like perfect and then you can just keep it as like a background element or just like uh just something for uh one half of the arrangement so um don't uh if you ever are like looking for new ideas and you're just like I'm stuck at this like try throwing in a sample or two and just see like if it spark some idea and even if you don't use the sample you can always use it to make something else that's similar or like that you think would lead to a cooler idea so uh that's like another cool trick I'm trying to like I think one huge thing for uh moving from the kind of beginner intermediate to Advanced stages is that you need uh need to feel more comfortable working faster so you probably saw in this my workflow was 10 times faster than my beginner tutorial and that's because I wasn't limited by having to explain every single thing I did I'm just kind of assuming that you guys already know what you're doing so I could just zoom through all this like like just click through everything and even though I'm going quickly if you watch How I go quickly then you are able to probably copy me later and then that'll help you guys improve as well so uh I'm trying a different method of uh just basically teaching a lesson here because uh the first way I did it in the beginner of tutorial I thought was helpful if you'd never produced before but if you are producing I think trying to think about the things that you don't know like there's a lot of things that you just don't know and uh basically how it was for me is I look up tutorials and I try to find things that they could inform me on that I didn't already know but a lot of times they were just telling me how to do something rather than telling me the why behind it and so I like like explaining the reasons of why I do things rather than giving you like a technical explanation a lot of times because that'll be more beneficial to you in the long run so let me give you a good example of this I could like one technical thing I told you guys was about the involver trick and that's practical you could use that in your own um but it doesn't tell you why I did I did this and if I explain why I did it if I if I say okay I want to give contrast from the inro of the song and then draw the listener's ear in right as the song starts so that it starts off on the beat like immediately so I have no kicks no drums going on here and then immediately that's going to draw The Listener in okay in the first five seconds of the song uh it's the same idea here where I take out everything this part and then this beginning part are the same thing they're the same concept uh and doing it right before the transition from the bridge the chorus and from the I mean not the bridge my bad um the buildups to the chorus and the intro to or I guess the starting intro to the intro gives that same effect of the the why behind it would be I want to uh create a not necessarily a surprise but something that catches the the listener's ear immediately so that's something to think about so I think that that that's the reason I like doing this convolver trip for instance another way I could help you guys with like a technical thing balance with the reason for why I do it is uh I think I explained that with the with the crush technique is that I didn't we're not just I'm not teaching you just oh use Crush it's cool fore plugin and if you do this effect it's cool uh basically I was like okay well once you find something cool um I didn't want to do it all the time because it doesn't keep the song interesting so keeping the song flowing and moving so that the listener wants to keep listening uh you want to add change throughout your song So if I just kept this the same the whole time it would just sound it wouldn't be bad it just would be less interesting so if I mean if I just keep it on I mean it doesn't the weird thing is that there's a lot of things in music that don't sound bad so you can leave them like that but then until you do something different that sounds better then you're like oh that sounds even better and that's why uh I highly recommend that you guys collaborate with artists find people your skill level and then just ask them you have to kind of just take a leap and just be like hey man you want to make you want to make a song and then just do that and I think that that would be it would be so helpful for you guys I remember I just join a bunch of discords and I'd literally just sit in a Discord with like five people and we'd all make music like dead silent while we're making music and then we'd like DM each other later like hey you want to make a song and then that's that's literally like how I learned how to make music I think it's one of the best ways too because you're matching people with your skill level and then working with them uh will help you all improve um as you keep practicing together uh and then what you want to do is just keep making friends with better and better producers and then just keep working up and building your skills and slowly by slowly you'll meet uh like people that are a little bit better than you that maybe have already released on a label and they'll want to uh be with you I mean if you're just a nice person and you're fun to hang out with um it's really easy to make friends with uh good producers and just uh learning and get better so I think one super underrated tip where like you might go on YouTube and you might look up for like tutorials on how to become a better producer and they might give you all these mixing techniques and I did I I told you about Patcher and midside Q is massive it's so helpful but it's not going to turn you into professional just knowing midside of Q what will really turn you into professional is making connections with artists that are uh bigger than you and just uh having having your name out there a little bit more and just knowing people um and I mean if that if that's your goal that's that's really the what you want to do um there was this really good artist and he gave me advice he basically told me he said the difference between um a good producer and a great producer has uh how did he put it he didn't say he basically said um it doesn't have to do with technical ability or anything he said I've seen uh good artists that are way more technically better than professional artists I've seen professional artists that are vice versa you know um but his his point was is that it's not necessarily about the technical ability but also the knowledge and the skills of uh being an artist are different than just technical ability so knowing music theory doesn't make you a professional artist uh knowing the whole all of FO Studio doesn't make you a professional artist and so that's why I would say that I I am a professional music producer but I wouldn't say I'm a professional artists um there's a big difference because I I just haven't released music so I can't really be considered a professional artist even though I've made hundreds and hundreds of songs and I made songs for clients and I've done all that I I wouldn't be technically considered a professional musician simply because I don't have professionally released Songs so I would really like to do that um but obviously just haven't figured out exactly what Nisha I want to uh start in and what kind of music I want to make I mean even you saw even this one hour challenge I wasn't really sure what I was making it like turned into hiphop but I don't really like to make hiphop all that often so um I digress uh so just trying to think of more Advanced Techniques uh in the last uh attempt of this this is attempt two in the last attempt what I did was I actually used Edison to record a sound desize session so like let me let me show you what I mean I'll literally stick Edison on my master here uh actually let's save this and just go out of the file I think that I pretty much showed also happy accidents by Ross moment when I accidentally hit my keyboard and made that cool snare that was so cool I'm like so happy I did that that was like such an awesome I'm going to do that my other tracks I didn't even know that that could sound that cool is this just on c yeah it literally is it's just one octave below so if I put these on the same yeah that's so cool that's hilarious um okay so let's go into a new template I just want to show you guys some stuff so this that was kind of like my reflection on the one hour challenge uh I also just want to show you guys other Advanced Techniques that I think would be really helpful to you so I think I'm not sure what you guys are necessarily expecting I know I've been getting emails almost every day asking me to do a second course and um if I systematically went through every Advanced technique in FL Studio we'd probably be here for like about a year because there are so many different things that I could go through and all of them are important so I'm trying to give you guys the tools that will enable you like uh so instead of giving you fish I want to teach you how to fish obviously so I want to teach you the methods that I use to become a good Producer instead of just telling you facts or telling you stuff that is helpful but you're probably not going to remember because this is a long tutorial it's going to be like probably over an hour and so I want to give you a ways of becoming better that way you can become better artist on your own instead of uh watching tons of tutorials and then forgetting everything and that and still being the same level producer which definitely happens um so I don't want to trick you guys with tutorials I want to help you improve so one thing that could help you improve is by simply just going on your master sticking an Edison on there that's aor not fector it's a cool plugin but not what I was looking for Edison just going to hit record and I'm literally just going to go to vital and then as soon as you just start messing around you're recording in here so I can literally just find some like same so we got like so as you can see I like just was messing around for a second and then uh where am I I need this so you can take this right and I can actually drag and drop this immediately by clicking this button right here and into the playlist and I could take something like this right I could copy that I like that I could literally copy and make this use a unique sample save this it's going to go into uh my backup and then I can go to tww samples I go to where is it my samples render and then this is called September 13th Part One blah blah blah I could just call this du du du and then I could save it and then I could go back to our project file that we just in and then I could literally just pull let me show you guys an example because that that was what an AAR major and I just did that in C major so need to go one two steps down and then whole octop okay that so I have this right here I'll just literally go to my samples my samples just refresh it du okay so I just need to pitch it down twice go up once stretch maybe like stretch it so it fits in like I have no idea like just it doesn't really sound that good but uh just for instance you could see how this could be cool like where you just have a recording where you could just go in Edison sound design cut a small part of it and then use that in your tracks so you never really know what you'll get like just messing around and a lot of times you miss it like you're like oh that sound is so cool and then you like don't have it every time your sound design it just hit Edison and you'll literally never miss any of those moments and then what you can do is you can have a folder like this where you just save all of those recordings of your Edison sound design and then you'll have all of those as your own library of samples and I started doing this my computer unfortunately crashed so like I obviously I didn't make this Advanced tutorial for another eight months so the reason being for that was for a lot of reasons one my computer completely failed I lost everything and I like restart from scratch and then that was like really difficult um the second thing was more of a personal uh thing with a relationship so like I was I was like really down so I just was not in the mental state to like make another thing so I was tough and then so after I got I kind of refixed my computer got a new laptop got a new setup obviously well you can't see because I'm doing a green screen but I'm in a new place right now I got a new microphone I got new everything that took about like twoish months then by that time I was thinking about doing doing personal courses uh for the people in the first beginner class but I decided not to because I just wasn't sure of how much value I could provide uh the big thing with that was that I was thinking okay well if I do personal courses for you guys how much value is that really giving to and I figured okay it's actually not providing that much value because I wouldn't want to give knowing what I know now I wouldn't have wanted somebody to I wouldn't have wanted to pay somebody to give me just oneonone advice that wasn't I don't think that that would be as helpful uh what I do think would be helpful was teaching the and the reasons of why I do things for free uh and I think that's more helpful than me doing paid courses so that's why I never offered uh paid courses um that being said another reason I really couldn't do the course for so long was because uh I literally just couldn't like I needed to work I just didn't have time so the only reason I'm I'm doing this now is because I a I wanted to make a second installment because I get emails every single day and then I also I've always wanted to do music uh to some capacity as as like a career so I mean uh obviously I don't think I can do that for a while I would have to kind of establish myself a little bit more um but I am going to be releasing the FP for this completely free um and I believe yeah all the samples I used are are free so uh you can pick up all these samples for free as well and I'll just release this FP in the description and you could pick that up um if you'd also like I'm also going to leave uh under a comment I'm just going to have uh just my my YouTube channel and I'm also going to have uh like hopefully some type of website by time this course is out or some link uh to like a pack which you could use to to help me and also help your Productions as well just improve uh what you're making cuz I know it could be hard to find samples out there it can be hard uh so I'll probably have samples and presets I'm not exactly sure what I'm going to do for that by the time this course is out but I'll have something something available and then also something for free for you guys so if You' like to support me in that way hopefully I can make you guys more tutorials and I'd love to start making more tutorials on my channel as well um I don't know how much I have to add to this uh I was going to do this in collaboration with another artist and uh he was going to do vocals so what I might do is if this tutorial keeps going then that means that he's collaborating with me and if he's collaborating with me then maybe I could do a second part of this tutorial where we have the vocals on top and we try to finish the track together and in that case I'll get back to you guys and maybe I'll do a part two and maybe we'll just keep this as a shorter version of the tutorial and just see how it goes so with that being said thanks so much for your guys support I'm glad that these tutorials are helping and I know this is a little bit different format and maybe a little less of what you were expecting uh in terms of the last tutorial I did was a lot more methodical this didn't really have chapters it was more of just off the cuff like okay let's make this Challenge and then let's explain what I was doing uh so I hope you found value in this as well I know it's a bit different um but thanks for watching guys and uh I'll see you soon all right we're here in the actual project after the 1 hour challenge and now I'm going to show you guys what this looks like so to me I uh it was not loading some some of the things which is unfortunate but I'm going just going to play it the way it is and we'll try to go through as much as we can so a lot of this stuff looks exactly the same as my 1 hour challenge obviously I absolutely love what he did here it looks so awesome that he like uh color coordinated everything I love that um props I thank you blend a base uh so we got and I feel like I can skip a lot of this because it's just the same as winner challenge uh let's go to the to the part that he did stuff with obviously this is not sound very good I'm not sure why it's not loading some of the plugins right so it's not going to sound very nice but so you can see he actually chopped up uh both the samples here and just made some interesting uh rhythmic and Pitch patterns to change it up here the funny thing is when I first uh saw him doing this I'm like this is kind of hard to follow and then after now I'm like completely vibing with it and it's awesome and I was wrong again all uh then he did this super cool thing where he he sampled and then used the channel pitch or the sample to make this one of the coolest things I've I've heard I don't know this is so cool to me that is such a that that is that is swag that's like the way that that comes into this bar that is so cool as soon as I heard him do that I was like okay that's sick um but yeah it's just uh changing the pitch of and he used the song to sample itself and then yeah it's very very creative um right here we have a really cool uh chord preset and it's kind of playing with everything else I really wanted to use a drop and make something with this I just never got the the chance to since the project wasn't working in my favor unfortunately but uh let's go so he I like how he also moves down further and further uh so not everything's on the same level it's kind of interesting uh let's go here see what he did here in the front scene to the and you so we see the way that he did his voice was super interesting so he actually used his voice as a instrument uh and the instrument isn't loing for me but he actually used his voice and then uh he forgot I forgot the way that he explained it but it's so interesting he actually essentially used it as a sample and then uh played chords with it uh under his own voice this is very so you can hear that playing over and over again that's his voice and then he has going oh the chords are working so yeah this is his voice you can hear it it's like playing his AC C capella and that's him saying it always on the run Horizons behind me looking at the dashboard fast FL D so you can see that we keep the vocals mostly mono and we have different uh different vocal layers going to different vocal buses and then eqing those uh separately is the way that he did it which is the same way that I do my vocals as well uh and then you can just apply effects those different um side pan vocals and the ones that are in the center and obviously the ones that make up the chords so that you can have a a very cohesive vocal so it's not just a a vocal is almost never just one take it's usually like uh 10 different takes and then uh doing slightly different things with each one of those to complement the whole so that's usually the way that uh vocals are done so you should never expect to just like record vocals into a mic and then just be like good for your song like that almost never happens I usually tons of vocal samples and that's how that works I think I accidentally changed some of this a way I was like messing around earlier that's pretty funny this part is so cool I love how it like drops out into this giant opens up into this like rebb area where like it just uh kind of expands the song and then it there's no rhythmic element going on so it's just kind of floaty and then it turns into a buildup which I thought was one of the most creative ways to go from an like an ambient track from hipop and then into like a buildup it just shows like uh when you collab with people you're going to come up with ideas that are like greater than some of the parts because I know for a fact like when I sent him this track he doesn't make stuff like this so like the stuff that he's going to make out of it is going to be super interesting um and just be different so it's it's really it's really cool and fun to collab and that's another reason why you should join the and then he as you can hear that this riter is slowly getting louder in my opinion in my opinion this is is my opinion I think that that it probably should have hit here it just goes for a little bit extra and I think that lose a little bit of energy that's just my thoughts but overall still really dope still really and then he completely made this part this wasn't me at all he's just like I want to make this part I'm like all go for it and then he did it was it was super sick uh and I've never heard him make this type of house music before really interesting we usually make like future balance or something this is this is super cool uh but yeah and then obviously he has the lead playing in the background I'm trying to figure out where the lead is is it this no it's a high hat it must be this right I am not seeing the lead I might just be blind but anyways very cool um I don't have a ton to add as I said the project didn't totally load for me so it's a little bit unfortunate but um yeah this is this is the project uh if you were curious and seeing a little bit like what it looks like this is what it ended up turning out like um this was going to be actually the whole uh Advanced tutorial I was going to go over this entire track uh after the 1 hour challenge so I just wanted to do a shorter version of that since this is already getting pretty long with the other uh version of the course that I did and I have recorded many versions of this course but hopefully you liked this version and without further Ado I hope that you are able to create your own songs out of this and that this was helpful uh into improving your Productions in the future so without further Ado I'll see you later and you can uh see if you want to see more of me I'm going to be making YouTube videos I'll see you there bye one of the last things I wanted to go over was one of the most Advanced Techniques I think uh that I can teach you and it's so something so funny because a lot of people learned this really early and some people don't learn it for a very long time for some reason uh and it's not really that complicated and some people might laugh and be like oh it's so simple like either why didn't I think of that before or why are you just telling them this now like this is not like an advanced tip but it will help you become an advanced producer and that's simply using reference tracks uh this is so important so I used uh I I can't play this song because it'll get copyrighted but I used this as uh there was an advertising agency that wanted me to make a song similar to this so I uh took the song and I re pretty much remade it and just change the Melodies and instruments to make my own version of it with kind of the same energy uh so this was the initial track uh I was able to use an AI to split the vocals from the instrumental and then I had the instrumental in my track and tried to make something really similar so you guys can listen to this song on your own time and then come back here and listen to what this sounds like in comparison to the original track e the funny thing about this is I also made this in like an hour like an hour and a half and I had to make it really quickly because of deadlines and so deadlines are could be a huge motivator for making things really quickly and uh this is just one example of how I had a reference track and how I was able to use that to try to copy and make something similar to that and then do my own take on it so I use the arrangement as inspiration I use the type of instruments they were using as inspiration and ultimately it can help you uh expand your music production what is it like repertoire because uh by trying to figure out how other artists did things it will help you realize things that you've never tried before and uh open you up to new ways of making things so for instance something like this guitar section I had never made anything like this before and I thought it sounded really interesting like I do not make guitar patterns usually like this so this was the inspiration so I just thought it turned out pretty interesting so uh and it really fit the track so stuff like that and then I never used to make guitar Melodies that kind of would like this all of it was really interesting and a learning experience for me and while I don't really make this type of music and I'm not super like impressed by like the final result I'm like it's all right it's like not something I release or work on really any longer um but I know that it's something that that um that they were looking for so this is something that they wanted not something that I wanted so I was uh making it for a different reason there but uh yeah use reference tracks and try to make make it as close to as you can uh and just kind of it'll help you fix uh learn how to make your mixes better because you'll be listening to professionals and their mixes and how to make your instrumentals and so that's uh one huge tip is just using reference tracks and then following and using their Arrangement as a uh inspiration for your own arrangement for your track uh and that can help you and save you so much time because if you don't know how to arrange your music because you're not listening to music that other people are listening to then your music is going to be chaotic and it's be hard to follow and yeah it'll just be difficult and you might think oh I don't want like any limitations I don't want anything to stunt my creativity it's like your creativity only works if you have limitations first to break you can't go outside of a box if there is no box so that's why reference tracks are so helpful because they give you something that you can work off of and be creative with so hopefully that that was helpful and I just wanted to quickly show this um and I don't know how much more I have to show you guys uh I really thought I went over a lot for this Advanced tutorial and I know it's not as comprehensive and maybe some people wanted um so maybe I just go a kind of speed through all the tips before we go out basically every tip that comes to my mind I'm this is going to be like a supercharged tip section where I just zoom through a million tips that I can think of uh and then we'll close it out the last thing that I'd like to say is that I do have a website with my sing pack and I think that this would be super helpful for you guys and the reason that uh I'm even offering the SLE pack and I think that would be useful for to you guys is because I am updating it um every time I make some new music or I make uh something I'm adding uh different things that I've made to that sample pack for free so as you buy it you can always go back and download the new samples I add so so there's almost no sample packs that do that where you just buy it and there's always new samples for you every time you open it up that's super cool I think so uh I just want to let you guys know that's Tristan wil cox. us with twls and then I also off all my patreon I offer personal courses uh oneonone and I give you feedback at different uh tiers you can see that whatever works for you to help support uh support me and then I also make YouTube videos for free so uh you guys can see my Productions on my own music and hopefully I can share uh some knowledge and just help you guys grow in your music producer Journey so without further ado we are going to zoom through all the tips starting now so one thing that you can do is if you have sample packs I would go through all your samples and make one Consolidated uh sample pack with all your favorite samples out of different sample packs you use rather than having hundreds of sample packs in your browser so that's something that I did and this is what I came up with I had drums extra sample packs effects uh yeah so this got kind of messy pretty quickly but essentially you'll have all the folders full of things that you have so I have drum and this says buildup Loop claps fills drum loops and then you can see that these come from all sorts of different sample packs I've downloaded in the past and samples that I've made and so what this does is effectively consolidates all your sample packs uh into one sample pack rather than having to go through a million sample packs to find the ones that you want uh so this is I think very helpful um another thing that you can do is just save literally everything save your projects save your fops export your fops name your FPS and your exported of the FP the same thing so that if I search for the FP I can find the exported file in case that FP gets corrupted save your work see where you've been I have not saved a lot of my work and that's why I lost a lot of my work so just something that I want to know uh so you always want to be saving your stuff always want to be making backups of your stuff uh something that you can do is if you have any preset you can save your presets go here go file go save as preset and then save that and then once you save that name it the same thing uh so whatever I name it here name that the same thing that you save it's it's a mixer chain as well so whatever the mixer chain is called you want to save those as the same name so when you open up both you can up both of those together uh something cool that you can always mess around with is that if you're in the piano roll you can always go to this down arrow key go to view go to scale highlighting and you can put it on automatic and it will help you highlight different uh parts of the scale that you're looking for or you can change it to the scale of the reference track that you're working on or you can just make it some interesting scale and just mess around with that and see what kind of uh creative ideas and Melodies that helps you come up with something I would really recommend uh is that when you you are uh editing your notes you want allow resizing from left to be enabled this is super annoying when it's off so I highly recommend that you have that enabled if you want uh a window on one of your syns to be open make sure that you on this arrow you click detached and it will stay open as you're working uh and that's really helpful for like if I want to be sound designing this and changing notes I can't do both at the same time unless this window is detached okay so that just means that this changing things here doesn't affect this window uh and then if I want to un attach this you'll see what happens if I change something here it'll disappear that window so that you can fully Focus so that's just another thing if you are afraid of making a change in your track and you don't want it to affect uh your overall production you can go to file you can go to save as new version and what that will do is it will essentially make the a copy of that flp as a new version so you can make any changes that you want and still have your old version of the flp without changing anything there um something that you can do is that if uh you have some there's this weird automation glitch that happens uh but sometimes you need uh you'll have a mixer track uh that looks like this where um it just no matter what you do it's always stuck at zero what you want to do to fix this is turn this mixture track all the way up right click it and then go initiate song with this position once you do that it will reset that one uh if it's still not working uh you can always reset the entire uh preset by or reset the entire mixer Chain by clicking reset select trct the default if you want to save and copy effects from one mixture chain to another what you can do is you can right click and you can go to file and you go to save mixure track St as if you click and hold and drag you can drag that to any other mixer chain and unlet go on that and will copy everything about that to the new mixer chain that is so cool to me that you can do that um another thing that you can do is that if you'd like to make a slightly different um uh lead like variant is that like let's say I have a first drop and then I have a second drop and I want to make a different lead but it still fits in my track I can actually just right click on this and click clone and it will duplicate uh that preset and then I can make slight differences in that preset so that I have two different uh things that are but both similar in style if that makes sense so hopefully that wasn't too complicated um what's another thing uh let's think I'm running out steam I I was like I was on a roll with with with those tips let's see if I can uh think of anymore um if you have uh this uh magnet on on different things it can really screw you up so I have mine on cell and that's what it's selected on so when I move things around it always clicks to the nearest cell if I had this on none it would just slide kind of all around and be very unpredictable so I have it on cell that way when I click it um it properly uh aligns to the grid the way you would imagine it would um something that you can do is that if I left click and hold alt I can I can uh I can uh play patterns in the track and then you can also do this on a different level inside inside the piano roll without playing through the entire thing so if you just want to hear what this chord sounds like at the end without having to play the hold pattern over again alt right click and you can drag through to see what that sounds like um one thing uh another tip that I have which I shared in the very beginning of the course is any knob that you see in a third party Plugin or in a normal plugin you can click and you can automate if you go here and I Chang something I can go to what I changed up here right click it and go create automation clip and it will literally create an automation clip for whatever I just moved last um as you can see that create an automation clip for that five band frequency and that's how you can make automations for literally anything that you change in the entire uh in the entire uh program um other things that I can recommend uh in the sampler uh if you want to uh play like an instrument uh you can't just do it by dragging and dropping the sample in here what you'd actually have to do is go to your channel Rack open up something called the sampler here and once you open up that sampler and drag and drop a sample onto that let's say actually I need actually like a one shot and then I need to be like a synth and then I'll drop that sampler into the sample and that will give you the envelope tool which you can use to to change the envelope of your sound and then I use the cross bait and this will allow you to sustain whatever instrument that you're playing over time so if I put the cross bait all the way up you can hear it's like still playing a little bit which is really cool um another thing that you can do is that if you want it to slide you can go to this wrench tool click mono click up and then uh Max and then you can do one is what I like to do and then you can have it uh bending like crazy like I showed you in the beginning of the sound design course so that's how you do that in the sampler um something that you can do is if this range for pitch isn't enough you can just increase the range to 12 uh that'll make it go up octave up or an octave down and then you can automate the pitch of that accordingly because you cannot as far as I know automate this pitch right here so that's just a quick tip right there also did you know that the volume here and the volume in here in the channel rack are exactly the same so you can see this thing changing with this those are the same thing FYI um trying to think of anything else that I can think of if you take hold on the sample you can also drag and then drop it in the in the uh playlist as as well so those are kind of they work together as well in that way um if I have a pattern that has multiple things going on in it I can split it so like let's say I have this chord progression and it is in this melody here and I go like here and I paste those chords and I have these kind of on top of each other I can go to this pattern I can right click the pattern and click split by Channel and then will pull out that and then give me the guitar and that chord separately in two different patterns so you can use that for arranging um and doing that um another cool thing that you can do is in the top left corner of this it gives you tons of settings for the sampler uh for samples and for uh your uh patterns so for instance I can click chop and I can go uh different things so I can do like beat Shuffle and it will like completely change the way this go and that completely changed the melody because it chopped it up and the same thing happens uh with loot base samples too so if I go to Loop and I go to like actually let me just show you guys an example by literally muting everything except for this and then going to my own sample pack and this will just be a little plug because I'll show you one of the cooler samples in my pack so we'll go to loops and go to other you can't tell me this doesn't sound sick it's so funny like I like I make stuff like this and then like you guys see me like when I'm working and trying to show you guys how to music produce and I like make like the most garbage stuff but then like when I'm alone like sitting it's like raining outside I'm like making like music like this is so funny it just depends on like the mood I'm in and like different things to be it can highly affect the way also how much water you drink and what snacks you have with you will affect different types of music that you're making cool facts okay so uh top left corner here I can go to here and there's all sorts uh types of settings like if I want to make another sample that's um high pitched and the other one low pitched but I want them to play at the same time I could go to click this make unique a sample and this uh will not affect what I changed here will not affect this so I can have a play at the same time and then I could select both of them at the same time and I could actually make changes to both of them simultaneously so then I could uh have um CH I could chop it both the same way and then I could like do something like this [Laughter] and that for some reason sounds very cool so I might use that in some type of track on day but uh yeah you could use that that chop function and that was just one of the functions here there's so many different ones that you can do and I haven't even messed with all of them so apparently you can extract stems from the sample uh I haven't even tried this yet uh it's with the new FL studio21 update they just did I forgot which one but if you up I can extract stems uh this feature needs to be downloaded before it can be used download now sure let's do that that's so cool I've never used this before so like it's just exciting like you're just messing around you're just looking at different things and you can find all sorts of new stuff in Apple Studio Poss things new that they're adding so just going to download this really quick and see what it does so this is just the advanced production process just randomly seeing what happens when you click things uh and and then not being afraid to see what happens so let's do uh there's no vocals I can just pull that out and let's extract let's see what it does I'm really curious processing processing I'm so curious if this going to get all my samples out of this that would blow me away so does it just poop him out oh my goodness it does how cool is that and this is a base that is so you can't tell me that's not cool that is really cool like they just added this too okay that's another Advanced production technique extracting your s your own from things from samples how cool is that wow that is really cool I honestly I don't even think that I could show you a cool a cooler thing let's end it off like that I know e just added that I saw that and I hadn't used it until then that is so cool okay I think that's a great place to end it I've gone over a lot of stuff and I haven't even gone over over maybe like 5% of everything in this program it's insane like if I was literally to do an advanced tutorial front to back all everything I could be here for like a year like it's there's so much to do oh it's so frustrating like I just want to show you guys everything I want to I want to help you guys and I know that I can't do it all in one tutorial and that's why I want to for the last time say I making videos on my YouTube channel now uh because a lot of people have been asking me to and I'm going to help you guys we're going to do challenges I'm going to do like uh so we'll all kinds of really neat challenges uh in my Discord Community as well that um I'm hoping will add more fun and so you can find people to make music with so if you don't have any friends to make music with uh come join my Discord uh community and we're all going to make music together I'm going to do challenges I'll be there too it's not going to be one of those things where I just won't be there I will be there and I'll help you and if you're if you want to join me uh making music then just yeah join the channel join the stuff and I just want to thank uh free Cod camp for this opportunity again and I absolutely love their Channel and they helped me so much when I was in college as well so I want to return the favor by helping them uh by making a a tutorial that could help everyone else so with that being said thank you so much for joining and I hope that you gathered at least a little bit of information and remember enjoy the process and have fun producing peace
