in this video we're going to talk about arrays and about objects quick disclaimer objects in javascript are not exactly the same thing as objects in some other languages objectoriented languages so if you're familiar with another language and you're thinking wait that's really not an object i know we're talking exclusively about objects in javascript in this video what makes an array an array are these square brackets here here we declared a variable array with square brackets that's what i want you to remember for a raise inside of an array you can put anything you can put a string you can put a boolean you can put a number you can even put another array and have a nested array you can do that as many times as you want that's totally okay as far as objects there's a little bit of different notation notice the curly brackets here in all of these strings here we have key values and the property values you might see this referred to as json json that stands for javascript object notation a lot of times if you'll be making an api call something you'll learn about later the information you get returned will be in this format and javascript object notation technically you can even have an array of objects what i want to remember from this video is arrays square brackets it's just a set of data and objects curly brackets more strings in objects you have keys and properties
