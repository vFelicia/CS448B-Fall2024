hey everybody it's Jesse and uh today we're going to continue working on our handling our form data uh which eventually yesterday we finally got the uh file upload uh to work uh so it took a while uh but we kept at it and it worked out uh so was really happy about that uh going a little earlier than normal today uh so I'll um I'll have to finish up at uh finish this up in about an hour and a half so a little bit shorter than I've uh stream uh than I've been doing lately so probably the code portion will finish up in an hour and then after that we can do like a half hour uh question and answer uh and then um then we'll be uh done for for the day and for the weekend but uh we'll see how much we can get done with this uh I want to show you some of the changes so I had some pull requests and so we changed a bit if you want to look um in the repository let's see I'll bring let me bring over the uh files changed here so this would be easier to see what what actually changed so Patrick submitted a pool request I also get another pull request from Kevin uh but it ended up uh they were doing a lot of the same things uh so uh ended up just pulling in um uh Patrick's request cuz it had a few extra things and it was just a lot easier to pool in one than to try to merge uh so thank you to both of you uh for uh for submitting these so basically uh we have um nodon I I've read like so many different ways to pronounce this but I'm going to say node Monon so um so we have that now and uh that's going to uh like watch our new like custom server uh so that we can change stuff in our server and it'll Auto uh it should Auto reload um so we have a new some new things like in our scripts here uh so different ways we're starting the server and this actually now this start server gets called when we run start so the normal start command has a little bit extra on it now and uh what actually ends up having happening is it runs basically it runs our our normal server that we've been running uh for you know for since we started this project on Port 3000 and then it runs the other one that we just made yesterday on Port 9000 or whatever Port we set it to uh and that's kind of nice because yesterday we were like kind of having to manually start it now it's just one command it starts in both um and then that way we can go back and forth uh we still have all the benefits basically of of both of them really without any extra uh extra work so there's a lot of other stuff here you can see like a lot of um uh a lot of variables added uh which is nice and I'll definitely be probably have to add some more in as well when we start working with our apis uh but you can check more of that out if you if you want um let's see and Patrick also put in some explanation as well so that is available uh in the repository also I accidentally merged this into Master instead of custom server so our custom server branch and our Master Branch are now the same uh now I'm still going to do any new stuff in our custom server Branch but I don't know what I was thinking and I didn't realize it until um it didn't say that the pull request was merged and I'm like what the heck I know I merged this and then it hit me that I did it on the wrong Branch so after that I decided to get some caffeine um but other than that there's not really been not really any changes oh I did add one thing uh let me show you so this is where I ended up at basically I added this uh on um sorry I keep getting distracted I have my secondary stream on Instagram but for some reason my phone keeps falling down uh so I don't know why every other day it stays like perfectly where I want it but today it's it's falling down so anyway um so I added uh this this part here so I was just kind of looking through um the uh repository on uh GitHub for uh node formidable looking through their examples trying to see how they do things and uh I found this and I thought oh this will be cool at least we can see uh if all our fields are coming through uh and and how it looks so now we know that we can get all our Fields here and do what we need to with them uh within here so right now we're just logging them uh but this is basically what I want to work on uh today probably let's see I don't know I don't know if I'll do that much more with the with the uploads right now uh at some point I would like to add in I like some security features uh to let's say block out potentially uh malicious files so not sure if I want to get into that today or not uh I probably want to do a little bit more research uh I had added some things in in a previous project some security features but uh I could probably do uh a better job if I spent some more time uh researching it um so if any of you have any ideas or any experience with that you know please please let me know um but otherwise we're going to work on on handling this so we need to grab this we need to do a couple things with this this data uh so we need to email we need to send two emails uh one email to uh our our project manager uh here uh in my department and then we need to send another email to the user and then we need to send the data to our project management system through their API uh when we do that we're going to get some information back and that's going to include a project ID number and then we need to use that project ID number to send the files uh and attach them to that project I think that's all we need yeah I think that's all we need in uh the current version of this we're also sending data to a Google sheet but I don't know if I want to do that I may um I don't know I I'll think about that it's always nice to have another backup but I'm not sure if I want to uh I I kind of want to set up some sort of database to keep track instead of using the Google sheet it might be overkill for this project but i' it's something I'd like to learn how to do and will possibly be using in future project so it might not be a bad idea to try it on this project uh I'm I mean the this project has a very limited internal audience so the stakes are not very high let's say if if this crashed and I didn't do it right I mean I'm not saying but worst case scenario if it if it crashed and we lost a bunch of data all we'd have to do is just call up the people who submitted you know their requests and ask them to tell us what they wanted again right so I feel like it's better to try out something new on a project like this than to try it out on let's say something that you know an external audience would be using a lot more people would be using it would be more of a big deal if it messed up so let me know what you think about that I mean maybe I'm off with my reasoning here but uh so we'll see so we'll basically postpone the decision about whether or not to back up to a Google sheet to use a database or just to not do anything uh and we don't really need to make that decision now but just to let you know what I'm thinking and uh maybe you know you you all can think about it and uh let me know um I'm going to go just say hi to everyone now in the live chat hey everybody okay cool so my pronunciation of no noemon is not so strange uh John B says are you sure you don't pronounce it as I Choose You noton Like it's a Pokemon that that's that's pretty funny my kids are really into Pokemon right now I'm going to have to tell them I'm going to have to make up some sort of dad joke about that and tell them later on and they probably have no idea what I'm talking about uh but they'll still laugh because they're good kids okay cool Kevin says that seems cool with both servers start you can test that the file upload actually creates a file uh without losing hot reloading while making changes yeah yeah actually that's um yeah that was exactly so right before I started the The Stream I was just testing it out uh and and that was like that was kind of like the deal breaker I was like wow that's that is really useful uh Rohan ask where's the file go okay and Kevin says it's in the uploads folder um yeah so the the file right now obviously is just saved locally uh but it'll be saved you know on our server at some point let's see okay so we have some some talk about the database here so yeah I'm I'm not sure what I'm not really sure what I'm going to use yet so what do you what do you all think looks like R says R rdbms all right I'm not familiar with that uh what what is that R okay bobic says Firebase okay cool yeah actually I've I've heard of Firebase have not used it uh so yeah I'm not anyway I'm still open I'm still open to it I was researching uh some okay so thank thank you uh it's relational database management system oh okay so relation okay so we're talking SQL versus nosql databases right is that so the squel being the relational relational database I think I get it now I get it I'm not like uh I very limited experience with databases uh basically just like troubleshooting a WordPress database if it gets messed up and that's that's the extent of my experience okay cool yeah I was kind of think of going with something like a nosql database uh since like my very limited database experience has been with SQL databases and with WordPress uh so I thought like hey well why don't I try you know try something like no sequel uh so I'm not really sure uh like I said I just I have no idea what direction to go with this uh so I'm open to um suggestions whatever I go with to just something really lightweight and simple to start out with I don't you know I don't need a lot for this project I think it would be better to start out with something simple uh just to get get used to it and um for later projects if I need to move move on to something uh a little bit more involved and that's cool okay cool uh Kevin uh sent me the link to a project uh that he did with a database so I am I'm going to copy that and check that out later on put it in my my list of things my big list of things pasted okay I figured out why my phone is falling over today now it's uh it's vibrating when I get messages and then after I get so many messages in a row it just vibrates right off of where I have it sitting so that's that's why and I need to this is already in there now so I don't need that I think we've used this already I don't need that we've used this we've used this okay we've basically done this okay clean up my my little copy and paste file there oh there we go now we have plenty of space let me know if the text uh is too small on this I think I left it the same size as I had it uh for the video yesterday uh but if it's too small I could uh definitely make it bigger um I did I saw one question in here that I I want to answer before I start the coding uh so I don't forget okay it was Tyler so Tyler asked the college near me just opened up a 24week boot camp what's your opinion on colleges opening up boot camps do you think they are worth it uh I don't really know I don't I don't have experience with colleges opening up boot camps so my my experience with colleges in computer science in general has been uh they're usually behind so uh wherever the industry is they're like a couple years back at least um I don't I my guess that the reasons for that are just there's not really very much incentive for professors to stay on top of things right because the the way it's structured um you know you you set up your courses you get your course materials approved uh and then you can teach the class uh without necessarily having to update it that much um you get used to a certain textbook uh you have all your your tests and everything around there so it's just like this the way it's set up is it makes it really easy to keep teaching the same stuff over and over again and really difficult to try to do new stuff so having said that I would be a little skeptical of a boot camp put on by a university and I mean I work at a university so uh I'm I'm definitely not anti University in general uh but I would be skeptical it would just depend on like who's actually doing the teaching and who's putting it on like is it are the people doing the teaching like people are actually building real stuff you know in the industry and you know Cutting Edge stuff and they're just kind of partnering with the university to have some credibility uh or is it actually like University professors that are putting this on uh and I'm not saying all universities are like that or all professors are teaching you know kind of older stuff uh but uh that's just been my experience just in general I mean there are definitely universities that are on The Cutting Edge like um near where where I'm at Carnegie melon is always is really good they're on The Cutting Edge uh tech companies hire people professors and graduates like right away from uh from carnegi melon all the time uh so I guess it just depends uh on the on the school but I would check if you can try to check out who the teachers are and uh see like do they have a GitHub profile what kind of stuff are they doing um that's what I would look at to determine you know whe whether or not it's worth it uh Ro Rohan says uh when I said there a couple of years behind he said try about a decade I was trying to be nice and uh I'm not like i' I've spoken with like some of the professors here at my University and basically like their mindset is um it's not really like possible for them to stay on The Cutting Edge and still keep up with like the the load of courses that they're expected to teach to be fulltime Professor uh so instead like they're they act they're trying to just give them the fundamentals of computer science and not try to do any anything that's Cutting Edge so it may not even be their goal to try to teach new stuff you know they're just they're trying to teach them you know good logic and problem solving uh and that's cool and then they they do it in sometimes really old languages like they might use cobal here actually uh I know like at the University that I went to I did take one computer science course and it was in C++ uh so even and even really good courses use really old languages sometimes like the Harvard computer science ined computer science course starts out with C they do a lot of other languages too so uh anyway I'm just that's just kind of would be my reservations about about doing it so it could be really good I you just need to do a little bit of research on on who's teaching it okay I'm going to grab one more thing from the live chat to copy and paste here and then we'll get started okay John B says maybe go with a SQL uh sqlite database okay that's cool yeah like I said I I was kind of leaning towards a nosql database but I really don't have I I don't really know know enough about it to know what would be better so I'm I'm definitely uh relying uh on your suggestions here okay all right so let's get into it so first thing we're going to do I guess is um maybe we'll try to send the email that seems like a better thing to do if uh if I can't do everything during the stream it makes more sense to do the email thing during the stream than to do the uh send it to project management because like for the use case of sending an email that's really really common so it will probably be useful to more people watching this or watching the recording uh I don't know how many people use our particular project management system so may not be as useful to learn the specifics of that particular API so I mean ideally I'd do them both uh on a stream but it may not work out like that so let's just try to do the email thing first uh I have used let's see what am I using right now let me check on my other screen I have the file uh I have it's a private repository right now so I can't share it because there's some API keys and things um I don't want to see what I'm using because I think I'm I think I'm using email Js I'm pretty sure that's what I used so let me know if you all have any uh email uh clients that you really like let me know like I said I'm currently using email JS where is it at H I try I even tried to clean up all my tabs in Windows uh before the stream and it's still like um a lot of stuff look I just have a lot of GitHub stuff open and it all looks the same you it's all just a bunch of code when I go in all right well I'm just going to go into my GitHub profile and find it again and that will be faster I feel legit now that I have so many repositories that I'm using the repository search function on GitHub uh so I don't know that makes me feel like hey you got a lot of stuff on here there we go I I couldn't remember what I named the the original repository so and this one's I'm really glad this is a private repository cuz it's a mess I don't want anybody to see it all right let's see yeah and it's really like the organization of this Repository it's just it's really I don't I don't even like to look at it it's making me feel bad just looking at it right now but this was um I think I I started working on this almost two years ago so I've come a long way all right so basically like sorry I can't show you this but I don't want to show my API keys to the world um um but all I'm doing is just trying to find my API keys for the email and verify that I am actually using the email system that I think I'm using also I'd like to see the format that I'm sending this data in currently and so my old project I was using Ajax there we go okay all right so I'm using it looks like I'm using email JS but it's going through send grid the reason I went with email JS is because I needed something that worked client side it was just like I had no access to any backend stuff and uh so anything I did had to be client side uh so email JS ended up being the only thing I could find that would let me send things client side so I don't need to keep using it I could probably I could probably just use send grid directly okay okay maybe I don't even have a key I can't let's let's look at email JS uh in case you're not familiar with it okay this is how to Temp okay yeah so this is It's I'm sorry I'm this is all coming back to me now I said this up a while ago um yeah so this was a way for me to get around uh so like send grid would not let me send um emails uh client side so this was like a work around for that where I don't even actually send um any API keys or anything you just liter it's just this like it's this simple and then the actual uh information for the send grid API is saved uh you know on the on the site so I'd log in and have that there and then I can build uh my email template within this okay so I probably won't need to do this anymore so I might just cut this out because this is just one more step in the process that's not necessary uh so I really I did like this this works really well uh but don't really need it so I guess I'm going to go straight with with srid so I have to let's look up their documentation then all right let's check out awesome so there's a s grid uh nodejs client awesome so we'll check okay cool okay not bad it's not like super up to date but uh it's you know within the last year they've updated this so this looks promising see for okay let's just try to do something basic just to see you know what we can send so all right so first things first uh let's add s grid to our project and I'll be I'll be bringing their documentation back and forth uh as as we need it okay so we're just adding send grid to our project all right while that's working I'll check the live chat okay uh back to the uh coding boot camp thing Tyler says completely agree with you and regard that most colleges are behind in terms of computer science but looking at the curriculum of this it seems pretty solid they teach M Stack and even jump into angular and Firebase can't find out who's teaching but it's hard situation to jump into considering it's 10K okay sounds like they work with Trinity never heard of them okay yeah I mean that is cool that they're obviously using some newer stuff um but yeah 10K that's like just to put it in perspective as far as 10K like I when when you count like the scholarships and Grant and stuff that I got I didn't pay 10K for my entire bachelor's degree so and that's probably even if you include uh everything I had to pay for books so 10K for a coding boot camp where you're not you're not even going to get a a degree that's a lot so I mean I would want I don't know for me to do it I would have to have some serious proof that this is going to be awesome and and that companies are going to recognize how how good this is on a resume um that you're going to I get like build things that are really great for your portfolio that that is that's just like that's a lot of money like who has 10K to just do that you know I mean normally like people take out a loan for that and stuff so it's going to be more than 10K when you end up paying it all back uh yeah that's just a lot um wow yeah I mean I guess it depends on where you're where you're at too like if if you have the money and that's cool go ahead I'd be really wary of doing that if I had to borrow um yeah I mean just check out there's just there's so many other options that are less expensive that potentially could work out I mean depending on what kind of learner you are are okay okay cool awesome uh so um Kevin you like guessed what I was thinking a minute ago uh so I was looking at this and I'm sure obviously you all saw it was on the screen I was just kind of going through this and looking and what it was what I was thinking was wow look at all these Vees they need to be con and look at all these semicolons and uh so Kevin wrote in the live chat here Jesse if you copy code with a lot of semicolons and ver you can uh use npm run lint to autofix some code styling issues so exactly what I was thinking I guess it's not I mean it's not really a big deal I can always just use like control fine and get rid of stuff but uh that was that was cool that you like you knew you knew what it was going through my mind when I saw that I wonder if projects like because I've I've been seeing a a lot like trying to look through different things for file uploads and email things uh I've seen a lot of the documentation uses this I wonder if that would be a good opportunity to get some pool requests in to just switch the examples to use even just to use const I mean you know we leave the semicolons alone to not bring up the whole debate over whether or not you should use them but uh I don't know maybe updating it a bit just to use es6 six because that's I mean even like browsers support cons like right out off the bat right don't I don't really know I mean cuz I always use a transpiler um but it's just so common now you would think like you may as well just you know switch over to it all right let's let's try this out so within let's require let's just require a s grid so I'm not going to copy over everything uh because a lot of the stuff they have their uh actually I might need to yeah I'll need to copy more at first I thought they were just saving a lot of things to variables and using them later but they're not they're actually creating like uh like new new helpers and stuff so okay so have the copy more over okay all right I guess I'll just copy the whole thing copy the whole thing and then uh we can rearrange it uh as needed so let's run that what was that what I need to run lint okay let's see actually I'm not sure that that that went over our server did it yeah it did okay it did first Why didn't it okay not really sure what happened but not a big deal let's just change them okay so anyway I see in the live chat so Tyler I see um like the conversation is still going on about the boot camp I'll come back to that uh whenever my timer is up here so I haven't haven't forgot about it um I'm just want to get try some stuff out here okay so let's see what we have two email from all right so let's change this to my email so I can get the email all right so we have I'll leave the subject and content as is now but we'll see if it ends up being a pain I'm definitely changing this uh this content so right right now it says sending with send GD is fun and easy to do anywhere uh so may not be true we'll see all right yeah I'll leave it like that I I just want to make sure it sends first if we can get it to send then I'll actually make the content be you know what we're collecting from this form okay and this part of it I guess is what wait which part I actually send okay this is the part that actually sends it yeah so let's let's put this part inside here cuz this is where we're going to end up it doing this anyway uh so we'll just put it inside here for now uh at some point maybe we'll want to clean this up cuz this this uh server.js is going to end up being pretty long uh once we do everything that we're probably going to need to do but for now I'm not not going to worry about it so we need an API key so let me let me log into my S grid account on my other screen let see all right so I'm going to make a new API key just for testing actually I might let's see access okay the way uh you can customize the access that the API key has um actually let's see so uh this would be a good time for me to learn this so I know that normally when you have API Keys like this you want to put them in a separate file that doesn't get sync to your repo uh and then you just pull um those environment variables uh from there so that's what I want to do uh but I actually have never done that before uh because normally it's like I'm not collaborating with people on projects so I just have private repos and it doesn't really matter about the keys so let's do that uh so normally it's like a m file I think that's let's um let's check this out uh all right so on my other screen I just brought up how to do this okay so let's first make sure m is in our yeah okay so it's already in there so we good although actually I wonder if these files are already being used by um create react app Maybe okay all right so let me bring this over let everyone see what I'm working on okay so as I said all all I'm trying to do is have a file where I can put the API keys that I need to use so that we can work on this and I can put it on YouTube and not have to worry about uh giving out any API keys so this is saying I need to install M if I don't already have it which I might I'm not sure uh are we using this okay maybe not don't have it so I can do this and store my content so sample inre store in a m file and just put the keys in there all right does that seem like the way it's supposed it's already set up okay cool that all right that's what I was wondering so Patrick says it's already set up I yeah I was hoping you would say that and I I kind of thought um that you might have done that just put it on INF I set that up to work in server JS awesome okay cool thank you Patrick all right so I don't need this Patrick already set it up so basically I just need uh the N file and we're good we're good to go cool and actually now that you say that did you put something in GitHub already explaining that to me and I just forgot it already even though I read it this morning if if that's so sorry about that all right well anyway my my timer just stopped so I did say I'd go back uh so I do want to answer uh some of the questions that were just in there so five minute break going to answer some stuff in the live chat we'll come back to it we'll set up our API Keys uh and test out mailing with send okay so to go back to I I want to go back to this conversation we're having about coding boot camps because I mean I imagine this might be a useful to uh thing to talk about um for people who uh who watch this so uh Tyler says I agree Jesse $10,000 is a lot to me does name recognition mean anything uh the um is considered a top School uh so I'm probably University of yeah what is what is we is this like Minnesota or not so I'm not sure uh is well anyway it's considered a top School uh and it's highly recognized by local employers so that's another factor I was considering okay yeah well that's what yeah take that into consideration so I think I'd mention like our our company's going to respect this you know boot camp certification or whatever you know you're going to get when you do the boot camp and if the answer is yes then that's awesome and that's you know another reason maybe why you should do it uh of course that depends on like what company do you want to work at and does that company recognize it or not uh so that that really depends on what what you want to do oh wow John B said uh Internet Explorer 11 supports cons so wow I didn't even realize it went that far back so that's that's really cool okay and Patrick brought up uh so the boot camp will probably be partnering with local businesses to help you find a job so uh yeah that's that's actually a good point you maybe check into to what what they have like what kind of help they'll actually give you to try to find a job you know after you complete the boot camp that might be really valuable maybe if there's any numbers about like how many people actually find jobs you know within let's say like six months after completing it if the percentage is really high then it then it could be worth it I mean then it could be a good investment where you could say like okay I'm going to spend 10,000 now but within a year I'm going to have a job with the salary that's probably going to be I don't know way way more than that uh so it could be worth it okay uh Kevin asks any ideas on how to get some title or experience in Colombia if I just graduated in an unrelated engineering degree um I I would say you could do a few things so obviously like build up you got to build up your portfolio um and you'll probably build up like your reputation in the industry uh possibly the quickest way is if you could contribute to some open source projects that are popular uh then you might get more attention uh from from companies who use that product uh also like freelancing is a good way to make money and build your portfolio at the same time as long as you can find projects that are good sometimes there's a lot of freelancing jobs out there that aren't really going to challenge your skills or be that impressive in your portfolio so that's good to pay the bills but might not even want to put it on your portfolio um so that that would be my what I would say I mean it depends on what's going on where you're at if there are different coding meetups or conferences or things that you could go to that's a good way to network uh and just have people you know get get to know who you are and what's your what you're into what projects you're working on uh and then that might be an end so if you you meet somebody from a company and then you you find out there's a job open then you could get in touch with with that person let them know you're going to apply they could put in a good word that really goes a long way uh for for getting hired because it's a big decision to hire somebody and if if somebody you know inside your organization that you already trust can vouch for them and say yeah you know I know this guy he's he's a good guy he knows what he's talking about that could that could help so anyway all those things will probably help uh can't really say if any one of them will be the thing that that really you know gets you to where you want to be uh but just working like a little bit at a time you know as you can on on all of them will be uh probably a a pretty like a pretty sure plan that at some point you know you'll you'll build up your reputation you know get a uh get a decent job okay uh so I'm going to get back to this and I just saw Patrick wrote so dot and so uh comes with create react app uh and so Patrick just required it in server Dodge ass okay I like I thought that I had seen it in in the pull request so let's see is it required yeah there we go so it was in there the whole time and I don't know I don't even have to say it anymore like I I look like an idiot so many times in this stream like it's not it should not be surprising to anyone anymore but uh that's how it is sometimes okay so Kevin said thanks for the advice um so he also said I'm awesome so I just I just wanted to read that part out since I just said that I look like an idiot so uh anyway thanks for saying that Kevin yeah I really hope that the uh you know some of that advice will be helpful to you um it's what did I read something the other day it was it was really funny I don't remember where it was at but it it was something like um like listening to like the a successful like founder of a startup company talk about how they did it is basically like listening to a lottery winner telling you what numbers they used uh so kind it was kind of funny a little bit extreme but it was funny because you're basically saying like you know there's so many things that go into success you can't really just follow exactly what someone else did so that's why it's somewhat hard to to give advice because I could say like well here's what worked for me that may or may not work because my situation and all the factors that went into you know what's happened to me are probably not going to be replicated so I I don't agree that it's exactly like a lottery I think you can you can take you know good things you know away from anybody's story uh but it just it was funny because it did kind of illustrate like yeah I mean you uh it's really hard to say like do this this and this and you can replicate someone's success uh but any I I think the advice that I gave is is pretty uh General enough that it can apply in a lot of different situations and uh possibly be uh be helpful so anyway but Kevin let me know how things are going too if you ever have any like more like specific questions or anything you know feel free to get in touch with me like on Twitter wherever uh and I'd be happy to help out like you've helped out me on so many of my projects like I'd be super happy to help you out with anything you need John B said an awesome idiot that's it uh yeah honestly like legitimately like I don't want to I get down on myself a lot I don't want you all to think that I really I don't really think I'm an idiot I just think I make silly mistakes sometimes on when I'm I'm recording so I actually have good selfesteem so so don't worry about that's why I can say that and still smile and be happy about it because I I really do uh have have decent selfesteem so uh I'm I'm not phased At All by messing up and calling myself an idiot okay so we already have uh thanks to Patrick we we have the M already required uh so that's great so we need to create the M file uh and then then I can pull in my API key that I was starting to set up on my other screen uh from send grid and that'll be cool because we'll need some API keys for at least one other thing we're going to do maybe more depending on how much we want to set up uh let me check the time as well okay uh let me I'm going to try to go as fast as I can to just do a test and get this working and then we'll do a question and answer and that way yeah CU I need maybe about like a half hour uh definitely want to try to wrap things up in about a half an hour for okay all right so when I set up where's my console so step one let's actually like create the file here we go okay so here's our file and I I'll I'll set up as much as I can without revealing the API key at some point I will have to move this to my other screen um what should I name this it'll be easiest trying to see what it's already there we go so what are they call on this send grid API key that's straightforward enough okay so basically at this point I'm going to move this over I'm going to put the API key in but just for for demonstration so this is what this is how you would set this up correct um let's see okay Patrick's just Patrick saying do Echo send grid API key equals your key Val oh okay so Patrick you I could just do that in the command line and it would it would put it in there for me but I'm like I could do it like this as well correct uh M mkar says Hey Jesse I'm watching from Sierra Leon first time to catch it live and I'm enjoying it awesome I'm glad you could uh you can catch this live uh that's uh that's really cool um thanks for watching so all right cool so let's let me move briefly I'm just going to move this over and then try to remember to never show it again so I don't have to change all my API Keys um and then now I'm going to go into send grid and set this up oops got to give it a name okay all right so we have our API key in ourn file so now this should give us the correct API key and let's see I want to double check to make sure I don't have to do anything else to make this work it looks like it's good yeah okay so that should be in terms of on on the srid uh admin panel uh that that should be everything I need to do uh so now I think we're I think we can do it I think we can try it all right so save this where we at let's go to 9,000 let's get rid of some of this stuff and I don't really need um actually I'm going to fill a little bit of this out just to CU I I don't think I demonstrated my awesome console log that I put in here uh also if you didn't see yesterday this if if you didn't see this in action we'll show that again so I'm going to submit and who lot of stuff going on here what a lot more stuff than I thought I'd have okay so anyway this is obviously like these are all our our keys and values uh for our uh all our inputs right and then what happened here so I'm not sure what all that is oh man now I know what it all is I did the call so uh anyway it worked I just got spammed with a ton of emails though because uh I put the actual uh the part of it that sends the email I put it in here forgetting that this goes through all the different um Fields so this ran for every field so anyway it works it works I got the emails I just need to not put it in there so uh let's see where would be a better place to put this I guess I could just put it anywhere within here will will run as soon as this is uh as soon as a post request is sent to uploads anything in here should want run right so if I put this in here it should work I'll just test it and I don't need to put anything in here let's just submit it should submit yeah Okay cool so yeah so that worked once awesome and I know on on my phone I I saw I got a ton of messages to my Gmail account so hopefully hopefully I didn't just like get my send grid account marked as spam by Gmail that would be bad uh let's see sorry if there was just a bunch of static I just had my phone right next to the mic I didn't even realize it so sorry about that okay cool so we have um the changes to um so anyway we've successfully sent an email using send grid uh from our server.js file uh on form submission we've set up a m file so that we can keep our API I key secret uh we're not committing that uh so we've added it to our get ignore file so uh we are we are being very sneaky and secret which is which is good for this um yeah so the next step would be which I'm not going to do the next step right now because I I've got to uh do a shorter stream today but the next step which may or may not be on Monday's stream depending on how much time I have to work on it uh is going to be not just sending this where's it at whatever we had whatever we were sending uh this uh default text which says send grid is fun sending a send grid is fun and easy to do anywhere and actually that was true this was pretty easy and fun so we'll leave it in there but what we're going to do is replace the subject and and the content with probably the subject will say something like uh submission uh received from and then the person's email address or to email it's going to be we're actually going to have two so it's going to be the email of our project manager and the email of the person who submitted it uh the from email will be I don't know probably our project manager's email uh and then the content will actually be all the values uh that were submitted in the form so everything that was put in there so that and that'll be it for the emails Next Step will then be uh hooking this up to our API and then after that potentially uh setting up some sort of database all right so I'll take this I'll I'll make sure that I um I push all this up to GitHub on the whatever what branch are we on um on the custom server Branch so we'll push it all up to custom server Branch uh so you'll be able obviously you can't test out the email unless you want to put in make your own send grid account and put in your own uh API key which I'm just using the free version right now which is plenty for for this uh so if you want to test it out there's a free version it's really easy to use okay now now let's let's go to the live chat actually Kevin said shouldn't it be form. on end let's see yeah probably Kevin you're probably right I'm just I'm not really familiar with uh how things work with formidable so I was reading their documentation but I didn't get very far through it uh before this video so uh that makes sense that that's what it would be so probably will move that so let me I'll I'll work on that actually yeah I want to get your questions so I'll work on that later on then uh if I get into that now then I'm never going to uh be able to get through the all the questions okay so now if uh if you're just interested in the code part uh that part is over I'm going to do some questions and answers now so um uh if you're going to quit watching at this point uh that's cool thanks for watching I'll be back on Monday uh otherwise if you have a question put it in the live chat now I'll do my best to get to all the questions if I happen to uh accidentally skip over your question or if you can't stick around to hear the answer uh please uh put it in the comments or direct message me on Twitter or some other social media platform okay so I've scrolled all the way up to the top of the chat so I'm going to try not to miss anything okay so uh Tyler we were talking about code boot camps and things and Tyler asks uh any specific recommendations in the midwest particularly um yeah I don't I don't know of anything in particular uh in the midwest so sorry I can't give it uh give you any advice in that area um Patrick says there's iron something in in Colorado let's see okay and it looks like if it was if it was iron yard they shut down yeah I remember seeing that on Twitter okay uh John B says general assembly seems to be the highest rated boot camp in Denver okay see I've never heard it I'm I'm not really that knowledgeable about which boot camps are good and which ones aren't so good uh so I've never uh done a boot camp myself so probably I'm not the best person to give advice uh my advice in regard to boot camps usually centers around return on investment so I do have a business degree and so my mind works a little bit in that way and that uh I would always be thinking what are the chances of me getting a job how much would it pay versus how much is this going to cost uh not only The Upfront cost but then the time you know the opportunity cost and how much time the boot camp is going to be versus how much you could make if you just been working so I would I would put that all into consideration uh even assuming that it actually was a good boot camp okay uh paddle says galvanized and touring are also made in Denver uh but they're 20K okay so looks like there is some discussions about some really old programming languages that I I have at least heard the names of these languages I know nothing about them though so they're naming uh Lotus mosaic links okay so Tyler did clarify what what I thought it was University of Minnesota so yeah I was I was wondering but uh then it hit me that like I do like there are people from all over the world so I'm assuming it's Minnesota but maybe like it's some University in another country and that I I had just had never heard of so I just wanted to clarify uh sand deep says and actually this was this was a little while ago so hopefully uh you're still um still watching but Sandeep says this is my first session do you think it'll be helpful for me uh I'm okay to put extra effort to understand old sessions um and Grim girl so gr RM n g RL uh says great question uh Sandy I'm in the same boat as you so hopefully you all are still still watching sorry I didn't see this earlier uh but I yeah I think that I hope at least that these can be helpful to people of all skill levels sometimes I go over uh topics that are a little bit more advanced it just depends on what I need to work on that day so on you know any given day things might be a little bit more advanced than than you might be used to or they might be like right at your level or even below it uh so it just depends on what I'm working on I do I try to have a mix of things so I think like maybe two days ago we were just doing some basic uh CSS things uh and the day we were doing the um YouTube ined uh so yeah it just depends and uh don't be afraid to ask questions either you know I I'll try to get to them when I can but then also there's so many people in the live chat that are really great at at helping out and answering questions as well uh so uh yeah I mean I definitely encourage you to um I don't know just try it out and see and if if you find that uh the streams aren't really that helpful at all to you then that's cool too uh and um you know feel free to suggest maybe some topics that would be more helpful to you and I'll see if I could either uh work them into my live streams with what I'm doing or maybe make uh another video like a a prerecorded video on them at some point uh Rohan said uh everything I do uh would be onethird the time if I never made any mistakes so this is right around the time when I was uh calling myself an idiot uh for making uh silly mistakes uh so Patrick said we all make silly mistakes and uh Patrick also said in in response to Rohan that goes very well with how I estimate I break things down into small task estimate add them up together multiply by three that's really good advice actually it seems like projects always take way longer than you would estimate because well for two reasons one things not working right the first time you know Silly mistakes and then also scope Creed which I don't know if I said this yesterday but uh this project is already going to be bigger than I thought uh I got some information from a cooworker about some extra stuff that needs to be in this project so I'm expecting I'm expecting this to be more than what we originally thought so I'm not exactly sure how much more or what it's going to be like uh but it's going to be more hope like it might just end up being that we have a few extra views that we have to put in and some text content and that's it we'll see uh Yasser says Hey Jesse hey how's it going thanks for watching okay Pat all right sorry Pat I didn't see this earlier uh I guess uh Patrick says you should be hitting Local Host 3,000 now with the changes to the start script okay so so Patrick should I be able to do all the form stuff on Local Host 3000 I thought the form stuff would only work on the uh Port 9000 okay let me try this then so I do have 3,000 open let me do a refresh so let me let's make sure everything oh okay all right so I'm getting I'm getting this error this cores error uh from Local Host so at least like it it did look like okay so if I if I use 3,000 then I still get the hot reloading um of everything in react and then also the server so I just need then to adjust the core stuff to for this to work then um John B says uh in regard to having a business degree uh says I started off doing business it was too boring for me then moved into it Network Administration and then ported over to computer science with concentration in networking and data communication that's cool yeah I was um I I guess I liked business um in when I was in school I focused a lot on economics uh within you know within the business department so I really I did like economics I thought about going on and getting like further degrees in economics uh but then I just I didn't I got married and I promised my wife that she could get her master's degree while I worked and so that was that I I never uh went back uh to try to get another degree after that um but I did I liked it but I'll tell you what I didn't like so you know a lot of people with the business degrees go on to be a manager of a business so I tried being an assistant manager and I didn't really like that I I don't know I just I didn't like that part of it so I think the uh the part of business that's more like um I don't know I guess it's it's not dealing directly with managing people but the part that's dealing more with like uh numbers and trying to figure out like Trends and things I kind of like that a little bit better for okay so let's see so anyway Patrick's trying to um tell me how to get rid of this chors error if I understand correctly in here I need to do this and then that will allow everything right the problem was it was only allowing things on Port 9000 guess there's easy way to test it let's see if it I still getting that yeah try that no it didn't didn't work I keep an eye on the time okay um maybe I could try I got to the end of the chat in terms of the questions so maybe I can take a couple more minutes and just try to get this working before we the stream um let's see would I have to change something in here then yeah I guess okay yeah Kevin says I I should need to it should be something with this uh uh res header what was the message that's odd it says no header is present on the request requested resource oh okay uh Patrick saying he read that uh people have trouble with cores on Chrome while hitting Local Host and uh nuclear Nick says there's a Chrome extension for this okay cool I mean I guess I could try it on another browser uh quickly bring in Firefox okay I didn't get an error uh in Firefox so I mean this will um at at least this will let us know if it's just a chrome thing that we need to uh to work on and let's see which one screenshot yeah this is the file that we just sent the screenshot oh wait where did I go on did I go to the wrong thing dang it I did sorry about that I went to 9,000 I suppos to get a three so let's try that again all right let's give it a different file so what's this a screenshot of punch of code okay okay so it looks like I didn't get an error for that either let's see screenshot okay cool that worked all right so now at least we know it's something with chrome so I'll just have to figure out what's going on okay cool so uh nuclear Nick said it's a allow control allow origin is the extensions name for Chrome said it said I literally had this issue a few days ago and it was fine uh for Dev uh environment okay cool all right Patrick I see now you're telling me I typed the wrong thing in okay I will check out the uh the extension and see if we can get this working with chrome okay cool um all right yeah I got to wrap things up now so thanks uh thank you so much for watching and for helping out um not bad we accomplished pretty much like what we wanted to at least kind of like the minimum that we wanted to today uh in uh shorter than normal amount of time um let's see oh today's Friday okay so I'll be back Monday so um uh have a great weekend and I should be Monday might end up being an earlier stream as well I'll have to see what what's going on with meetings lately Mondays have been kind of busy with meetings so uh we'll see so I'll uh I'll let you know on Twitter uh about when I'm going to stream uh sometime Monday morning uh so um anyway until then uh have a great weekend
