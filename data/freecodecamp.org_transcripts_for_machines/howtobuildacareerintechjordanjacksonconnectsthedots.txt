hello everyone and welcome to another episode of connecting the dots this is going to be our last episode for the year so thank you for showing up and hanging out with us today on the show we have jordan jackson jordan thank you so much for taking the time to hang out with us today of course man i love talking to everyone about the journey just because i know what it was like for me so i just love to just spread like what i went through to know like there's a light at the end of the tunnel so absolutely yeah and you know it's been it has been a long year it's uh it's been tough for i know people even even before the pandemic started it was it was getting tough to get into tech and um and so you know i'm really excited to talk to you about your story and and how you've done it um so for those who aren't familiar do you want to let us know what are what are you doing now for work uh currently i'm at twitter as a software engineer am i working in the rehabilitation and remediation team cool so what our team does is for the bad actors on twitter uh we're responsible for educating and remediating those users to kind of educate them on how they're using the platform incorrectly or how they're not uh doing what the terms of service uh what they're what they agreed to when they signed up so we're not charged with that it's pretty it's a pretty broad like problem space so uh we could be working on stuff that suspends people uh so it's like the i guess the remediation part and then uh we're working on like the remediation part later where we can be educating users uh so that they could hopefully not do the same things in the future yeah that's and that's a that's a stressful space to be in like is is that like when you're working in that kind of in that kind of space do you feel like i get i how do how does it feel to work in that space where it's kind of you you're almost kind of thrown into it into a spot where you're working with the the the worst of the bunch right so that's the perfect way to describe it so when i first came to twitter which i'm sure we'll get to i was an intern and then uh i interned on two teams so the first team was more like a library team and the second team was the team that i'm currently on and it was just kind of funny to be like an intern and coming to twitter because like you said you're working on the nastiest content so you'll be like testing and uh you'll be seeing like the actual reports coming in traffic and uh yeah you see some stuff that you probably wouldn't want to see so may have to take like a a second or two to stop looking at it but yes you do see that uh but it it's kind of bad to see the stuff that people post but i mean then you always think like it's the internet so you're going to see some crazy stuff but at the same time i do really love it because i know it is probably one of like the most impactful teams to be on at twitter which is making it like a safer place so i mean so like taking it like handinhand i actually love being on my team yeah yeah i mean and that like that's such a cool thing too because it's the important work right like it's it's not necessarily the the most fun job if you were to list out all the things you want to do every day like dealing with people who are are kind of out for out to wreak a little havoc is maybe not what i put at the top of my list but helping make that safer helping make helping make that platform more you know friendly and accessible to people so that they feel safe on it that's yeah that means a lot and i i think so thank you for does uh i just say like when i first got like into coding and like software everyone would always ask like what do you want to work on or something like that like yeah what are you building uh or even if you're going to companies like what team do you want to be honest like when you first get started i like had no clue of any of that so i got really lucky with getting on a team this in a problem space that i really enjoy being here so yeah you seem like the job description you probably like no way i don't want to deal with like all this hateful stuff all day but uh but yeah working on making it a safer space for people is definitely like i felt a lot of pride absolutely and you should that's that's a really i love that um well cool so so i would love to talk a little bit about um how you got to twitter you you mentioned a little bit you did some internships but i want to go even before that so what were you doing before you were in tech before i was in tech so i guess that would be when i joined the air force when i was i believe 19 and i got sent to california uh funny story about that is from i'm from uh detroit michigan so okay from the other side of the country so uh and when you go to like basic training uh usually everyone has like this what they call their dream sheet where they want to go somewhere in the world like i don't know italy like germany and uh by the time i went to basic training i was just like i just want to go back home you know i'm like i'm still like a teenager i'm just like i want to go back home so i put like all east coast bases on my dream sheet and then i had california and i was just like oh that'd be cool to go to california and i totally didn't think i was going to get it and i ended up getting sent to california so fast forward i'm in california i always knew i wanted to like create like a company one day mostly was just like designing like products and like a sketch pad but i never knew that i would want to start like a tech company or software company so that came as i was at my first base and uh at that time i was like 20 i just used to read like a lot of startup books and vlogs like you know like the lean startup and zero to one just reading everything and pretty much i got to that point where i had ideas i had all the startup knowledge teaching myself about equity and venture capital but i didn't have anyone to build it and so you start looking for like resources who's going to build my idea and you see like oh this could be like 50 000 to make it happen you have to pay them like 60 an hour and i'm like i'm like 21. it was like i can't afford painting on that so i ended up reaching out to a few people just just kind of like running around just shooting my shot like trying to see who would work with me but uh pretty much that ended up uh getting me to the point where i got really frustrated with finding someone to build something for me so uh that was the day i just kind of like gotten that and i was just like you know what if i can't find like a technical cofounder i'm gonna be my own technical cofounder and so that was the thought process that uh how i ended up learning how to code uh which i started doing i believe about three times um it was like the first couple times just like yeah maybe this is not for me yeah i got to the point where i was just like i should learn how to code you learn how to code you don't need a technical cofounder you can build whatever you want you don't have to pay anyone so that was step one to me learn how to code uh then the second step is uh i wasn't too fond of my job in the military i was one of the guys where you just sign up and like i want to leave as soon as possible [Laughter] and they uh they just kind of give you a job so you don't really have like any kind of say so in it so you just get stuck so one thing about the job was that we would have downtime so i was like the airport manager at the base okay so uh if there weren't any planes flying it would be super quiet so i got a lot of coding now while there weren't any flights but for me not liking that job uh that's how i really got serious about coding because i felt like it it just checked out so many boxes for me um because uh being in the military since pretty much since high school uh it was like the only thing i knew like a lot of people in the military are like oh you know like we don't really want to get out because it's really secure so yeah yeah it's kind of like it's just easy to just sign up and just keep going um but i knew i didn't want to stay in i know i wanted to build my own products and know when to start my own tech company one day so uh so coding checked off all of those boxes yeah uh and i also had a daughter uh like maybe i think it was like two years before i got out so it was just like okay need to be my daughter i need to start a company one day i need to make money to take care of my family uh pretty much like all of these boxes and then i was just like man coding kind of like like checks off all of this yeah that was the point where i got like really serious and so uh when i say serious i mean like no video games uh because like i said i've been uh like before we started the call i was telling jason i've been playing cyberpunk and it is not crashing to me but um i used to play video games but at that point i was just like i can't afford to do that i need the code so uh i discovered free code count i'm not i don't even remember how i discovered it but i mean i just love how it's just like laid out like okay like you start here from knowing absolutely nothing and then at the end it's like okay here's this calculator i built with like four different technologies so that was what i really that's what really stuck me on free code cam and yeah i just was kind of relentless uh from that point and i just if i had free time at work or at home i was coding so um that that is like from like a to to be how i got into like coding like from the start yeah i started it my daughter's name a lot of news but so that's that's actually kind of a really interesting thing like something that that i found fascinating about that is you said that you had downtime at work right and um this is interesting because i i ended up doing the same thing and i hadn't really thought too much about it but i worked at a hotel as a night audit clerk for for a long time and that meant that my job was like if nobody came to the desk which most nights nobody would i had like 45 minutes of work to run an audit at 3 am and otherwise i just did whatever i wanted so i got to do all of this coding work as like on the clock for my other job and you got to do the same thing as a as an airport manager how how much do you think that like factored in to your ability to stick with it uh so i feel like it was kind of it was too low so uh so one we were on twelves for a good amount of the time so okay we were there a lot so oh so people when you're on like 12hour shifts we'll have like maybe three to four of them but it would be like you work your 12 hours you get home you have enough time to get ready for bed and wake up and go back so so it was kind of like sometimes it felt like that was the only time i did have but i feel like it factored in a lot and uh from that like you said with my job it's like once the pilots would finish flying for the night uh i might have like a five hour gap so i mean it's like a lot of people you can watch youtube don't you do a crossword puzzle sudoku but i was like man this is like gold uh you can get paid yeah learn a different job and then uh also like i said i really really didn't like my job so it was like what better thing to do at a job you don't like than to study for a better job yeah so that was probably not only is that when i got the most time to code uh it was probably when i did my best coding because i was just like i gotta get out of here i gotta get out of here so uh just because i know it's not where i wanted to be so i said it was like two parts to it so i feel like it was a huge factor uh and that's also what i tell a lot of people that i try to get into it um i always like to tell people that i feel like anyone could code but you need like a motivator so that was my i was at work which i knew i didn't like being at work uh it was very motivating for me to like just go hard the whole time i was there it's like i'm not doing anything i need to be working so yeah yeah man that that is that that hits close to home for me because i i felt the same way you know i had jobs that i didn't like and i never found something that felt right and my my motivator was always to get something that i liked and so like learning the code was i saw that as a path out so that that's really cool and and you know this this clearly worked for you right you're you're at twitter now so how did you go from you know you were you were working you were learning code at your other job that you wanted to get out of and you've you've since obviously you're no longer in the military you're now working at twitter how did that journey happen like where how did you kind of get from from learning to having the job so i always say it's like a being at the right place at the right time one of the things when i first got started and i uh i acquired my internet and twitter i almost didn't like to tell the story because i felt like it was it just kind of like seemed like a movie moment and i was just like i mean of course i mean i never thought it would happen to me and someone else would have told me i would have been like oh yeah that's never gonna happen to me but i did but so from those long nights coding and in like my job on the military base uh there will be pilots that will come in all the time and of course we're we're at uh travis surfers base so this is probably like i believe the biggest air force base uh in uh like silicon valley bay area so i feel like a lot of the pilots they like new people like in those circles um so one night i would be coding and i would just come in and talk to the pilots and uh one thing i kind of noticed early on is the whole it's not what you know it's who you know thing so i noticed that networking was like very important so i would just talk to everyone so uh before i was coding i would talk to people about like oh i want to have a business one day uh whether or not it turned into something fruitful i would just talk about it just because it was always on my mind uh so one of the pilots uh he came here one night and we were just talking about code and stuff and we mentioned something about uh like the twitter blackburners or something and that's like the employee research group for uh for black people and uh he just said like he knew one of them i was just like oh what are the chances of that so he said he knew someone there was a black bird and i was just like oh you know can you introduce me to this person so you know just totally just uh making conversation and he was like sure so uh he ended up uh introducing me to this person and uh she was awesome we ended up like just making like this this bond brother sister bond over like i would say the course of maybe like 12 to 18 months i would say okay this whole time i'm always talking to her just letting her know how my progress is going uh telling her she has to save me from this job [Laughter] and stuff like that um and just kind of just telling her like my goals and like okay i learned how to do this and uh this whole time she's like we never had like a like a formal like plan um it was more of just she was just telling me about the opportunities that were out there uh so i just kept in contact with her and so i just kept coding and coding and then eventually we get to the point where i'm like on the last couple months of like my my listening and uh like you have to go to this class where they they uh try to get you ready to get a job as a civilian and i'm just like man i don't want a regular job you know like i want to be an engineer and so eventually she just approached me and she was just like uh okay i have this plan um if you can pass an interview i can get you an internship at twitter and so uh like what like i'm like this is crazy so uh like first uh twitter doesn't have like a program like this now we do which is actually pretty funny now we do actually have a apprenticeship program where if you're a person you come from like a nontraditional background you can come into twitter as an apprentice and uh actually become a fulltime software engineer but at this time it was just like you had to go to college um it was really like a like this is for you it's like you just passed the interview and i was just like i have to pass the interview so from that point forward i mean i was already pretty focused so i ended up having some mentors just teach me uh all of the sorts that i'm pretty sure we got like the merge sorts and bubble swords and every uh i think i did interview cake uh oh yeah yeah i was doing like everything i could a hacker rank i was doing as many hacker ranks as i could um because i just i really really wanted it was just like man this is my shot if i like if i fumble this this is like going to be the worst uh fumble in history or at least for my life yeah well there's actually a question from the chat oliver is asking um so you tackled the coding interviews by doing hacker rank interview cake things like that how was the the coding interview at twitter uh it was actually easier than i thought um i it was so it was for intern of course it was an intern so i mean i guess that's where uh like i said it's for students that just completed their bachelor's so i'm not sure like how that ranks uh for like a like another junior engineer but for me i feel like it was pretty it was pretty simple uh they did hit me with a question the interview was pretty funny because like i said i feel like i prepared a lot but um with these engineering interviews i feel like i don't really have a good analogy off the top of my head but i feel like you could prepare for like 99 of the problems but somebody hit you with that one question you like never just you never got that far to study that it just it could be like detrimental so i felt like i did really good with my interview one of the questions i remember uh was like if you have like a stack you're putting numbers on the stack how do you access the highest number in the stack in constant time um so that was one of the questions i had uh so i i definitely like had something like that before so i was able to solve that and then uh the other question that i got that i'll never forget because i knew i couldn't solve this problem beforehand and like i said it was just like uh please not this question so uh it was the one it's like uh if you have like a a n by n matrix or something okay or and by a matrix uh like how do you get from like the top left corner to the bottom right corner and i think it also includes like the just some spaces you can't go oh okay like yeah i just like admitted i'm terrible with uh matrices like when it comes to code like i do not like trying to traverse like the matrix like with the code um so that was a question i got and uh i did good on all the other questions but when i got that question it like it felt like someone could pull it up like a stake and i was just like man this is it but so so when you got that question you just told them you know like this is the you just kind of you're like look this i this isn't for me yes so yeah they definitely so like i said it was a unique situation so they were like okay we're not uh i mean everyone at twitter they were kind of like it was a new process because like oh we never interviewed someone right but you know you didn't go to college for computer science so i was like we don't know what you learned um so she just kind of uh she was nice enough to like kind of gauge like where i was at so she asked me that question and i was just like i think i pretty much just thought i was like uh i think i tried person i'm just like yeah i can solve this and uh she ended up making like a taking me like to a simpler version of the problem that i was able to say oh nice i started building my way up to uh like almost solving the the one that i couldn't solve in the first place that's cool so yeah so it was like i mean um that's one thing that it's not all about solving a problem uh it's about like kind of like seeing how you could collaborate and work through learning the problem so so yeah we had really great communication and i was just like yeah guess all that and it's okay let's see what you can solve and work up to that so you know overall it was a good result but still stake to the heart you bring up a really good point though which is like i actually think that at least for me one of the things that i'm looking for when i'm interviewing is someone's selfawareness and their willingness to ask for help and so if if i was interviewing someone and i asked him a question they didn't know the answer to if they were to kind of close down and get frustrated and and try to solve and not ask for help to me that's kind of a that's a sign that it's not going to work out right i'm looking i'm looking for what you did i'm looking for someone to say you know i haven't done this before i i'm not sure if i was going to start i'd start like this but i don't really know where to go from there and then you know what you have the conversation how do you think about code how do you how were you were going to approach solving this problem because in a real job you're not going to be solving and like traverse and n by n matrix yeah right never seen a matrix since yeah exactly right so i'm not really interested in whether or not you memorized how to traverse a matrix i'm i'm interested in how you would approach solving that problem um because like i don't think i can solve that problem like i don't work with matrices ever it's a couple problems like that where it's like i don't ever i don't ever want to leave twitter because i'm just like if i get one of these problems i'm just like [Laughter] i'm going back to my office uh the other one is like i don't know it's like find the the large the largest set of increasing numbers in like a a set of numbers and it's just like yeah i couldn't i think i've seen a solution to that one and i've watched like three videos on it and i'm like i don't get how like a dark knight at this point i'm just like oh yeah i'm gonna just keep my job and i'm not gonna fool them around with these the algorithm problems definitely get me i uh yeah and i like i feel for people who are are trying to get through that because i feel like those algorithm problems are are one of those things it's like taking a test in in school it's you're you're cramming for test taking not really for the job um so actually that's there's a question there which is uh a couple people asked adarsh asked uh how are you staying motivated especially when it's something kind of frustrating so when you were first learning and then uh probably asked like when you're moving on to the next topic uh they they forget the one that they learned before so how when you're learning how do you go about like keeping your motivation up and making sure you retain the stuff that you're learning making sure i retain so is this like in reference to interviewing or like i think i'm always just kind of curious about like learning processes in general so when you when you're going to learn anything whether it's studying for an interview or you just you've got a new problem you want to tackle how would you break down you know not getting frustrated uh and staying motivated to learn it and also making sure that as you're learning it you're retaining the the new information okay so first i would tackle like the the retention part uh so i feel like that's just the easier part for me so i definitely would say that uh when it comes to like learning how to code and learning like the different subjects i don't think i worry about retention at all just because i feel like oh if you do it enough it's gonna like stick and i always like to tell people when they first start learning you don't have to remember everything off the top of your head like we have so many resources available when you're doing your job daytoday so i like to tell people like that like i stay on google a lot at work so uh so when it comes to retention i don't really feel like you have to retain every bit of knowledge you have uh or every knowledge that you're reading about on a particular topic uh i would say you just need to keep a reference to it so it's not like a being an engineer is not like a closed book test at all like i feel like you you can ask anyone you guys google uh you could probably ask jason if he has time you guys need yeah yeah fine uh so it's not like a closed book test it's if you if you don't uh remember something if you could remember like i don't know like i remember i was teaching my auntie how to code and i forgot how to do a closing tag in html and like i'm saying this was probably like a month or two ago in html and i'm just like mass is embarrassing i'm just like i have to google it like to see like how do you close the tag html so that is something i don't feel like i would ever forget but unless you're like working with it every day i don't like you're going to just be like super fluent in it and remember it off the top of your head but i know how to google how do you close the tag in html and i'm like oh i know how to do it now you know i i honestly i feel like that is the most valuable skill that we learn is like i don't think that a a senior developer staff developer is necessarily a better developer than anyone else i think they've just learned more of the vocabulary more of the context so they know what to google like if you know if i ask um what i've noticed a lot is that when i'm talking to someone who's just learning they're like i don't know how to solve this and i'm and i'm looking at the problem they're solving i'm saying okay well what would you search and they're like i don't know i don't know what this is called and so the the learning isn't necessarily i don't know how to solve this problem it's i don't even know what to call this problem i don't know where to start looking for a solution and so the more we learn the more we build that vocabulary and that that web where we can say i've seen a problem kind of like this i think this is called matrix traversal or or whatever right and then we know what to google to go figure out how to solve that problem um i would definitely agree with that just like like what problem you're solving but i don't think like trying to retain everything like software is just it's just it's just too vast and i mean yeah i mean it's not also i mean in addition to it being gas it's evolving so it's like there's new stuff coming out and then the stuff you're already working with is still like evolving so it's just memorized everything so it's just good to kind of just keep like a mental map of like okay like i know the gist of it to where i can google for help but uh something that surprised me too when i first got to twitter uh of course this is my first engineering job ever so i'm thinking like okay like i'm just someone to learn how to code on free code camp and i'm here with uh everyone that went to like berkeley and mit and i was like oh god uh thinking everyone would know everything on the top of their head but but it was really refreshing to see like the uh the more senior engineers like and they have like the same questions i do in meetings or uh you ask them for help and like they'll google stuff that you're like wow i don't think he would know that off the top of his head or um like i'm surprised they didn't know that uh i mean so it's not like a like a slight to them it's just like it's competent to know like oh this is what being an engineer is like it's not like you have to know everything it's not like jeopardy where it's just like hey you can't act yeah so it is that is definitely like uh comforting to me to see uh for sure on like access stuff like that and then what was the second part of the question the second part of the question was about staying motivated because a lot of times especially when we're learning things like coding it's it's abstract it can feel like it's a whole lot and we're never going to learn it all which as you've just stated we never will we're never going to learn at all so how do you how do you keep from getting discouraged and keep your motivation up when you're when you're trying to tackle something that's challenging uh so i would i feel like i'm i'm probably gonna be like uh i don't want people to be like me when i was learning so when i was learning like i had a pretty strong motivator which was the military and i didn't like my situation so that was all the motivation i needed i was like hey you don't do this you're going to be stuck here so that was like that was my motivation so uh so i feel like that's kind of it's not like not that it doesn't apply to everyone right so it's like i feel like everyone has to find like a reason that they're coding because like i said i feel like anyone can do it but if you don't have like to keep you motivated i don't feel like uh it's gonna be a lot harder something that i would do differently when i was learning is i took this kind of like siloed approach where i would just uh learn like i'll take my laptop either at work or at home and i'll just learn so i know free code kind of has like the like chats and forums that you can go and ask for help and i was pretty stubborn about it i was just like look if i can't learn this by myself i don't want to learn it and i would spend like hours on a problem like but as long as i could complete it by myself i would uh i would spend the time so i would say definitely learning with others like because i mean like your team you can like keep each other accountable uh kind of keep the momentum going um so i definitely wouldn't suggest learning alone unless you have like a very extreme motivator like i did um and then uh so that was my motivator while i was like in the military but uh now that i'm uh like i'm actually engineering on that twitter now i would say what motivates me is uh just trying to figure out how to be like a better engineer um it wasn't like always the best when i first transitioned it was pretty tough going from like the military background to tech um for a lot of reasons uh mostly like being in the military and being at a tech company or like polar opposites uh so you know i couldn't even have a beard when i was in the military so you know i'm like i get to have a beard i get to say hey to the ceo at lunch you know yeah so it was it was pretty tough at first but i find just trying to figure it out and be like a better engineer is a pretty good motivator for me yeah just because i still feel like sometimes some days i still feel like a puppy uh in the engineering world so so that's a pretty big motivator for me yeah well and it's cool too like i i think there's a threshold that gets crossed like i've i've i've seen this in a lot of folks where when they're first starting to learn to code it feels like it feels like going to math class or it feels like going to you know to an english class where you're breaking down grammar you're you're trying to memorize algorithms you're trying to do stuff that you're like i don't get how any of this is going to work and then there's a threshold you cross where it starts to make sense and you go from having to think really really hard about how anything works to where you can kind of just you can just write a little bit of code and you can start to build things and when you move from that like i have to struggle to remember how the syntax works to i know the syntax now i can just kind of do that by feel and and i can just build the thing that i want to build that's where i've started to see a lot of you know there's momentum and there's motivation because now you're not it's not frustrating or as frustrating you're you're now able to like create something and as soon as you get to that point where you can create it's like oh now what else could i create what else could i make and and you it creates like a positive feedback loop where you you get to see yourself succeed and each one of those successes gives you more motivation to try the next thing um and i i love you know it's but it's also hard because you got to push that boulder up that hill to get the momentum like you've got to cross that threshold yeah so i try to trust me i try to get almost everyone i know to code yeah my wife she's been batting me away for years at this point but i always tell people whenever you get started you just have to trust the process uh if you get started on preco count it's gonna look like gibberish uh of course but i would say when i started when i got serious on precode count i would say it was maybe it could have been more than like a few weeks to where i would like stand back from the screen i'd be like whoa like i'm actually writing this like this is pretty crazy um so there's definitely like a point you'll get to where you can see the growth like you'll see yourself writing stuff and you'll be like uh two weeks ago this would have this would have never made any sense this was like like you wouldn't even know it would look like alien uh code or something like that but uh so i definitely like uh agree uh and then also i like to compare uh coding to english it's like i feel like when people say i can't learn how to code it's too hard i was like what if you would have said like oh i can't learn english it's too hard like you're a baby like you just i'm not gonna try uh it sounds like gibberish uh i'm never gonna learn how to put uh like the correct grammar and punctuation i'm just going to talk about the baby forever um so uh so that's what that's the analogy i use um when my family or friends tell me coding is too hard i'm just like you speak english right uh i mean apparently i've heard english as one of the harder languages to learn so it is yeah so it's like you can learn english you learn how to code i mean it's not uh it's not that much different you just have to trust yourself that you're gonna by immersion eventually you're gonna start coding so absolutely so like you said when you start pushing the motor you just have to realize i mean this is kind of like a boater that gets smaller as you push it so yep that's just something to keep in mind when you uh first get started yeah yeah that's such a that's such a cool thing um so something i'd love to talk a little bit more about is you you mentioned that like your path into your internship opportunity was was not like an overnight thing this was something that you built over more than a year um and i want to talk a little bit about that because i think that people undervalue this part of getting a job and you already said this but it's it's not what you know it's who you know um and so uh to just recap a little bit you you were working in the airport through a pilot you got connected to somebody who was a part of the blackbirds organization at twitter and you could have stopped there you could have said that's so cool that you know somebody who's a blackbird at twitter and then never said anything right but you asked you were like hey i can i get connected and then after you got connected you kept in touch you updated on progress and you you kept doing the work and showing your work and eventually that led to her doing some work to get you the interview right and so that i think is such a fascinating like it would be so easy to say oh i know a blackbird of twitter and then you just kind of like well right now that's somebody i know on on the internet and like i like their posts sometimes or you can put that work in you can build that network um how have you found networking like obviously in this case it played a huge role but like have you seen it play in other aspects of your life or in other aspects of your career where it's been beneficial like that uh yes definitely not uh so much like definitely not like getting into twitter but there are a few instances i have uh so for example i was on twitter uh i don't even i don't think i even knew how to code at this point right even begun to go but uh it was someone i think he is the i think he may be the cto of coinbase right now uh balaji but he uh he was like he came out with this like bitcoin computer back then uh and i just remember he came up with it and i forgot how old i was but it was like 400 and i was just like man you know i can't afford that so i ended up just like i dm'd him or i tweeted at him i was just like oh you know like i actually like a product tester or something and he's like oh um send me an email or something and he ended up sending me one for free um just oh damn with some feedback and uh so at the time i mean uh coming from like never having anything like that happen i'm just like wow i got this free it was like a raspberry pi but they were selling them for like 400 because they had bitcoin mining chips in them oh okay yeah uh yeah and he just gave me one free so that was pretty powerful to me just be like hey just tweeting i can get like free stuff uh sounds like my first taste of like oh wow you just like talk to the right person they could make things happen for you another thing is i had reached out to someone and they got me like a it wasn't like an internship it was more like a it was a startup and uh they were i forgot the name of it but uh they were doing like um problem solving like they would take problems from like companies and come up with like solutions and uh i ended up like doing like a i wouldn't say like an internship but i was like building like a dashboard for them okay it was probably like the first the first world stacked app i ever built and they were paying me like uh like 500 bucks like a month or something like that but it was kind of crazy because i was just like what um it was like i guess you can say that was the first time i got paid for coding but uh but again i was like a connection i made on twitter where i was just reaching out to people like hey you know like this is what i'm trying to do this is what i'm interested in uh do you know anybody that could help so it's just like you never know like who you're talking to or uh like what they know who they know what they can what they have access to um and that works both ways because i met some people that were pretty uh like i call them lumberjacks because i feel like they chop your dreams down but i met a few lumberjacks you know so the lumberjacks they can be people that are in great positions too but they may not just see things like you see them so you have to stay away from them yeah but yeah so i just found just talking to people and then like i said i mean don't force it but i feel like it just actually comes out like if you're coding all the time or you're trying to make a company i feel like it's on your mind so you start talking to anybody like in a coffee shop or um online like you're just gonna naturally just like hey this is kind of what i'm into and what i'm working on um so so those are two times where i got like a huge example of like hey you talk to people tell them what you're interested in and like hey i mean people i mean a lot of people say this people want to see you succeed like i mean it's like all they have to do is make like an intro and you know like i can have like what i consider like i feel like i'm living in an alternate reality i say that a lot like uh not on twitter i feel like i'm like i just i should still be in the military right now but it's like i put the work in and met some cool people and you know i'm with a better version of my life so uh so so if you can live a better version of your life and also have to do is uh make an intro people will do it i feel like like a lot of people will do that so speaking as as someone who's had the opportunity to make a couple of those intros nothing feels better than being the person who can help you know if i have a friend who's looking to hire and i have someone who's looking for a job and i can put them together and like everybody ends up happy i feel amazing like nothing feels better than being able to help two people solve a problem and you know to so when when we're talking about like make yourself available to people show people what you're doing that's not that's not selfish you are you are being just as good a member of the community by letting people know that you are looking for work what kind of work you're looking for what your strengths are like if i see that and i see that you're looking i have a bunch of friends who work in tech who are always like hey do you know a good like distributed systems engineer hey do you know a good like senior node engineer if i can see people in my network who are doing that work and looking i'm 100 going to connect them every time but if i don't know what you're working on i don't know what you're interested in i'm not just going to like haphazardly recommend you for a job so you're you're doing everyone a favor when you do that like i yeah i cannot stress that enough like how helpful it is to me yeah i have a funny fact i'd like to say that uh i mean it sounds so insane when i say it out loud but uh when i got out the military i only put in one job application oh man that is wild and that was the twitter so uh yeah i had a uh my daughter was one at the time and a lot of people like to go like to this thing called tax where like i said they teach you how to get a job when you get out and help make your resume and um it's like i put in one application uh and i'm just still like blown away like man i was really confident but like i said i was really going hard studying and everything for my uh for my interview so so yes i was like uh i mean i was just telling myself like like failure is just not an option here i mean i like that though like i think there's something to be said for for going all in on a plan um i that was that was sort of a thing that i did as well i i got exactly enough freelance work that i wouldn't like get kicked out of my house like i had enough to clear rent and i was like whatever i'll eat ramen i'm going all in on being a software engineer and i quit my day job and i like immediately that that confidence that i felt when i quit like i had a rough couple of months where i did i cleared rent and that was just about it i ate a lot of like cup noodles but man i was i was an engineer like it felt real and that let me land more clients that let me like go all in on this job and that's led to me being where i am now and so i love i love when somebody bets on themselves like it's it's one of my favorite things to see put all the eggs in one basket so that was but yeah like i said i had built that relationship for 18 months and then when it came to the interview like i was i think i was doing like maybe every other day like uh video calls like with uh here who's helping me uh she's helping me learn like algorithms and the sorts and stuff oh so you had like an interview coach yeah so i didn't have an interview that's good i guess i left a part of my story out uh so when i when the pilot made the intro to the uh lady at twitter i ended up going there for the first time and i just went to the hq and just met her um and that was uh i met like a few engineers also when i met like the first few engineers i've ever met and um like a couple of those people i just kept in contact with them so uh like yeah one of them were they were my interview coach so when i twitter was my interview coach that's really nice but yeah so i would go up there almost every chance i can get um i think i live where i lived it was maybe like an hour and a half from the uh sf hq um so it was kind of a hike but i mean it was so cool like that was one of the the biggest things that was a big motivator too so uh anyone could get i mean when the world opens back up you can get like a tour of like a tech company i feel like that's pretty motivating too um from the military with our working conditions uh not saying like they're like the worst in the world but compared to like a tech company yeah the twitter hq like they're getting uh like we were getting like breakfast every day much every day it's like four cafeterias you got these snack kitchenettes everywhere you got famous people that'll visit us um uh you get to see jack walking around which still my mind uh like it was just uh like a whole it's a whole different way everyone's wearing clothes that they want to wear uh you can have facial hair it was just like a felt like a different planet i mean some places it won't be that extreme right military tech company is like the most extreme i think you can get so i was like blown away like yeah i had like people are working here and i'm like on twelves um so that definitely like just kind of uh helped my motivation piece um yeah then that's actually kind of interesting too because when you when you made that that tour um and like you started keeping contact with with engineers that worked at twitter you had the interview coach did you feel like like at that moment you kind of started to believe it was possible for you uh like like possible to work at twitter well just like possible to have that career to be an engineer to do the things that you wanted to do um that's a good question i don't i mean it kind of sounds like did i feel like i was ready uh well i actually mean it in a different way so so there's um the the way that i mean it is like i i feel like we have a tendency to sort of put ourselves into into whichever box we surround ourselves with right so like if if i'm surrounded by people who think that you know like when i was younger a lot of my friends they all worked in like warehouses construction things like that and they all just kind of had assumed that was as far as they were gonna go and so a lot of my mindset was the same i was like oh yeah i'll probably just like you know build houses or something um and then when i when i started hanging out with people who thought that more was possible i was like wait i could do more i couldn't do more couldn't i and then i started dreaming bigger and and so i'm kind of wondering like it sounds like you already had big dreams like so i'm not saying you know like the the getting an intro was there but like where did you find that threshold really was crossed for you where you you started to really think like you know what this isn't just a dream i'm going to do this uh so like you said i do think i always like kind of thought big like i wanted to have my own company i didn't think it would be like software or building uh like an app or anything like that but i did get to a point in the military where like you said it was exactly like what you just said in the military uh you retire after doing 20 years of service so a lot of people i mean that's like oh you can get a retirement check every 20 years so you'll meet a lot of people did that's what they want to do they want to do their 20 years and get out um and that wasn't my intentions when i came in like i had a sixyear contract should have been four but i was 19 so gotta forgive myself but uh i came in and so now i'm surrounded by all of these people that just they want to do 20 years uh and i'm just like you know i don't want to do 20 years i mean i didn't know what i wanted to do so i think that was probably like a like a uh like a hindrance for me like oh i need like a i needed like some direction nevertheless it's easy to be caught up in what everyone else wants to do so there was a point where i was i remember saying to myself i'm going to do 20 years like this is something like i was like no way like this is not what i'm doing and then i remember saying that to myself and uh it was actually uh one of uh we had civilians that we worked with yeah and it was actually one of the civilians uh his name was gary and i would always talk to him because he wanted to uh buy a porsche 911 when he retired okay he was like working on his second retirement when he retired for the second time he wanted a fortune 911. i just always remember that he would uh talk about like yeah my wife's gonna let me get him when i'm retiring so i remember one day i was talking to him and i tell him i was like yeah when i retired from the military and get a porsche like yours you know just just uh joking around and stuff and um like i swear i'll never forget this he said uh he called me jj because we called each other by our initials at work and he was like jj you won't have to say goodbye porsche and i just like no logics and that took me on like a mind trip i was just like what does he mean by that and then it was like at that moment like the old me i want to start a company and build something and like just not settle for just anything i just like woke up and like from that day forward i just been like hey like i'm gonna be the ceo like my own company one day and i don't care what anybody says about it um so from that day forward like i was just like uh and then it also gave me like a pretty strong shield because after that day i kind of just realized like man if you're around like people just putting the wrong things into your head uh you can kind of get like sidetracked from like your dreams and your goals so from that day i would say yes i felt like yes i could be engineered yes i could be the ceo of my own company if i wanted to i could be i could be anything i want to so after like shaking that off uh yes i definitely believed i could whether i was ready is a different question but as far as like the box no boxes i don't do boxes anymore yeah i love that though and and like who's who's ever ready like i i honestly if you told me i was going to interview a twitter tomorrow i don't know i'd probably bomb it i definitely bombed it facebook when i interviewed back a while ago but you know i think it's one of those things like i you know i've also since worked at other startups and i i nailed the technical interviews so a lot of it is also on like just taking the chances right like i you know i worked at ibm and my technical interview there was great we like reviewed projects together and like refactored things and it wasn't an algorithm interview facebook i was interviewing for front end and they were like hey do you want to write some sql queries and i was like i don't think i'm interviewing for the right job [Laughter] yeah i write those sometimes at work but i saw i use google like i just uh just enough to get like uh like the data back that uh that's useful for me but by no means am i pro but but yes that's how that is definitely how i feel no no boxes are allowed i can't i can't go back to that i love that interest it's dangerous i mean i wouldn't be i mean if i would have stayed in that box i mean like yes i just i just moved to michigan um because of the pandemic we were allowed to move so i just moved back home um with my uh to be closer to family and stuff and i'm i still have my job and i'm just like wow i work at twitter i live i'm i'm back home you know like i'm seeing my family yeah and i'm just thinking like this would have been nonexistent you know if i would have just stayed in that box like oh i mean i think i would be let me say i would have uh 12 years left before i retired dang that i wouldn't have been happy though yeah so so yeah so that's why i said the lumberjacks are just you have to have to stay away from yeah oh man i love that so much that's uh and it's such a heartwarming story like i love i love when you can kind of draw like a point like there's there's a conversation i had that that like realigned me and uh and it sounds like talking to to gary like what a what a cool moment to be able to just be like oh yeah like i almost i almost did a whole different life i could have been somebody completely different dad yeah i don't know so i actually have i think it was that same day it might not have been that same day but he wrote me a sticky note um it says your uh your vision determines your destination and like yeah i still have that sticky note in my closet somewhere i'm gonna frame it but yeah so uh gary he wrote that for me and uh thank you like i said it was around the same time that he told me i wouldn't have to say for a portion i was just like like yeah i just i was just it was crazy it was just like man he sees like he obviously sees who i was and like motivation and the dreams i had when i first got there and for me it was just like i always say i was in a sunken place pretty much yeah yeah i like get out like i'm just like the real me is down there like just no that's not what you want so uh yeah so gary he just i can't remember what they used in a movie but he just woke me up and now she's like what oh yeah so ever since then it's been like nah uh i gotta even if they 99 of startups well i'm like hey uh i have to have to play my hand just to see what it's gonna do so um so yeah that is i never forget that moment yeah no no so i i have a couple a couple more questions before we wrap up um so i want to i want to kind of twist this around we've got a lot of people watching now who are just getting into the industry they're taking free code camp right now they're they're learning um and so i want to just kind of ask you for all the people who are out there trying to get in um like one one specific question is what type of projects did you have in your portfolio and and kind of what would you recommend folks focus on if they're if they're looking to build their own portfolio if they're looking to build their own portfolio so uh when i tell people to learn now i usually just tell them to go through retail camp and build like the portfolio stuff mostly because i feel like that's what gave me a lot of my confidence at first like you feel like i think it was like a simon game like a javascript calculator i feel like all of that is like good stuff and then um some of the other stuff that i love i love to do um and actually i felt like this was probably the best preparation i had uh to for being like an engineer at twitter and that is following projects on youtube so uh it's a guy who watches videos what is his name brad his name's brad uh i forgot his last name is it traversing media yes yeah yeah yeah so i used to watch his videos and he would uh he would go from like zero to like a hundred making like a full full stack project and it would be awesome for a portfolio and not only that but after i was finished watching brad i would go in there and like tinker and like like my own like app you know so um so i mean like you could build it and repurpose it for something and yeah probably like the best experience you're gonna get for uh like to prepare uh to be an engineer at like a big company uh just because something i didn't realize is that when you're a junior engineer you're not going to go into the company building services from scratch right oh i feel like that was a big misconception i had like i'm gonna go in here i'm gonna have to start like i'm gonna have to build like a full stack out but when you get in you realize that you're you're only going to be updating and uh building on existing code like you're not starting up as like a service from scratch like that's mostly like senior work senior level work so i mean if you could come in and do that i mean yeah you're a rock star but yeah that's the bar like i have to come in building like a whole service from scratch so uh the way i link those two is you build like a project from like brad and then uh you tinker with it you make modifications to it you learn how to code works and you'll be well prepared to get into another company where you're going to get thrown into like a super random code base uh you're just going to have to go and do the exact same thing which is learning how it works and learning how to update and extend it um so i would definitely say following those uh those videos online and building them and just uh seeing how they work internally we'll give you like a lot of experience yeah definitely way more than prepare for uh like learning algorithms and stuff like that yeah yeah well i mean it's kind of one of those things it's a it's a little bit of a you got to do both unfortunately right but um but i think to your point that's almost a skill that we forget is that a lot of what we're doing is not inventing new code a lot of what we're doing is i'm going to inherit your code and i have to look at it and understand it and then make it do something mostly the same but a little bit different or i have to patch one small bug i don't get to start from scratch and that interpretation that ability to comprehend somebody else's code that's probably the most valuable skill you can have as someone who's new yes definitely so like you said you do have to learn both which is unfortunate but uh what in terms of actually being on the job and doing work uh yes learning how to inherit code i guess is a good way to say it and learn how to work into your code oh i own this file let me figure out how can i make it more efficient um how do i extend it how do i test it locally and uh how do i review it because you're gonna have to review other people's code there's probably a close proximity to it so like i would definitely say that gives you like a lot of experience so you're going to be building a portfolio you're going to be learning how different technologies work and you're also if you follow the video step by step you're going to be able to look at someone else's code and figure out how it works um which is always not as straightforward as you would like it to be so getting a lot of experience early on would just help you just go like a lot further once you get into your job yeah for sure so uh so one last question before we wrap up uh for all the folks out there who are trying to get their first opportunity and trying to get their foot in the door um you've already talked about you know your your networking your ability to visit the twitter campus what what do you recommend for folks who maybe don't have the opportunity to go to a company's headquarters or to meet people in person especially now that we're in the pandemic how would you recommend trying to get a similar sort of networking going remotely especially you know we've got a lot of folks joining today from india or from other places around the world um how do you think they can they can get that similar sort of connection without the ability to be physically there uh so i don't think uh it needs to be physical like like i said some of the first like networking opportunities uh given they weren't for jobs but uh i feel like it still was like a example of how networking can open doors for you uh we're on twitter so like you don't really need the physical aspect so i actually wrote an article about uh how i started on free code camp ended up interning at twitter all right this article i just talked about from a to b pretty much a lot of the stuff i've said here and i think at the at the end of the article i was just like hey anyone has any questions email me you know people email me to ask questions i mean at this point i'm like full of time on twitter so i mean it's like i'm like hey i could be your connection at twitter i mean i'm not saying i could get you a for sure job but i could introduce you to people i could help you study i could help you learn yeah i'm gonna talk to you about your journey and i would say maybe one or two people email me um and then only one that i talked to to this day and she was just like really really like adamant about it like hey like you know like i have questions for you man like i still keep in contact with her to this day and she uh i forgot the company she's got a job at a company but she's like she's on it like she's reading these articles and people say hit them up she's hitting them up uh because i mean like if you if you're hitting people up i mean if you get like a 10 10 rate i mean you hit up 10 people a day some one person is going to talk back to you you know you don't know who that one person is so i definitely i mean if anything in the kind of probably made it easier you just sit in your room and probably get connected with the world well it's also removed that physical advantage that other people might have had like i can't go drop into somebody's office i have to email them too or send them a dm or or whatever yes i mean it's a different like uh like something that i never thought of which one of my good friends helped me realize is that a lot of the social media platforms they're helpful for getting in contact with people absolutely like instagram i've never had instagram i didn't have it for like maybe like five or six years and then one of my friends he was just like you gotta get on instagram you know like there's a lot of tech people and vcs on twitter i mean on uh instagram it's like you can talk to them and it's just like you know they're there and they're like you know like you can go and interact with them and talk to them and they're very influential people uh yeah i mean you could go on twitter uh instagram facebook probably not linkedin because it's just too expected there are a lot of ways to just find people and then they have like the virtual conferences now but uh but i would say the main thing is i mean you just can't be scared like just just throw throw up the emails i mean i'm not saying throw up like a canned email because you don't like that but but if you're reading uh you see like interviews and like i'm like hey you know just reach out i mean it doesn't take that long to respond to the email absolutely um so yeah so yeah like the person i mentioned like uh i forgot i would have to see how many reasons i got on that it was a lot it was i believe it was five figures so tens ten thousand no more people that's not a lot of emails off of yeah so i mean that but that's a good that's a thing like if you're out there thinking that if you take a shot you're gonna be one of hundreds of of people in this person's inbox chances are that's not the case because everybody thinks that everybody thinks that everybody's sending and nobody is like i don't get a lot of emails you're not getting a lot of emails like i don't think that that people are as flooded as you think so i think if you if you reach out and you're in you're genuinely asking not don't spam me for connections but like ask what are you working on what are you stuck on what are you excited about like we want to hear from you that's fun for us that's what we do with our friends right we're at time so um let me let me do this let me where should people go if they want to if they want to keep in touch with you is there a platform you prefer twitter of course what's your what's your twitter handle it is toothpips amazing um can i i don't know if i can type it in here but um i'll type it i have to i have to recommend that flap there it is okay yeah i spelled it right but yes so now i guess we're going to hey look i guess after saying that i mean if i get a photo dms i can't all right let me let me get this dropped into the uh into the into the youtube chat there you are all right so uh definitely go give jordan a follow um you know take a look for that that free code camp article quincy if you are in the chat if you can you can drop that um and then yeah otherwise like thank you so much for being here today um if if you all want to see more of these we've got more connecting the dots on the free code camp youtube there's a series of them they're in a playlist you can you can just search for uh connect the dots on there um jordan thank you again for taking the time to hang out with us today any any parting words for everyone uh any part in words oh yeah so my phrase that i find is protect your dreams uh you're gonna meet some lumberjacks out there that are gonna try to take you out say you can't do it uh say whatever they're gonna say but you just have to stay focused and just get to the goal so those will be my performance i love it steer clear of those lumberjacks i am i'm so on board with that made with that or something it's good man it's real good uh if you want to learn more with me i run a weekly live stream on twitch at uh learnwithjason.dev or twitch.tv uh jaylangsdorf and you can come hang out with me we learn something i i pair with people uh we try to learn something new in 90 minutes couple times a week it's a lot of fun this has been a lot of fun man this has been so much fun thank you so much for hanging out jordan thank you to the free code camp team thank you chad for for hanging out with us and we'll see you all next time see ya
