hey everybody welcome to live coding with Jesse I'm Jesse and with on this stream you all get to have a glimpse inside my day as a frontend developer at a small University so I do my best to narrate as I work and I take some time to do a question and answer session so usually we do Pomodoro sessions so 25minute sessions of code take a five minute break for Question and Answer go back and forth like that until the end of the stream and then I answer all the questions that are left over sometimes that takes a while sometimes it doesn't but today we're going to continue what we have started yesterday which is doing some styling to our react projects using the latest version of material UI so material UI is a framework for a framework of react components that fit with the material design style so if you're familiar with pretty much any of the apps that Google has come out with with the exception of maybe a few of the older ones then you've seen a material design style let's see I want to start out first with a pull request so I received a pull request just a few minutes ago or maybe 10 10 minutes ago or so from Sebastian so I thought it might be cool to start with that pull request so I'll just go through how I normally review pool requests usually in the morning I come in and review any pull requests so I don't know that I've actually gone over that process on the stream so I haven't even looked at this pull request yet I don't know I don't know what's in it or how big it is or anything so this will be exactly my normal routine when when I see that there's a pull request so let's go oops let me type let me give you the n drop URL so if you want to see the site as we're working on it and be able to see it in your browser and use your own dev tools check out that link that I just put in a live chat I'm a paste it in there a little bit later on for for anyone who's joining us later so remind me if if remind me a little bit later on to paste it again if I forget and failed to complete total fennekin okay so it didn't work what's going on here oh okay you know what I changed the let me paste a different in I didn't realize I changed the local host so I need to do it again so I restarted my installed the latest Mac OS update and restarted and when I did oh my all my local servers that I had running shut down so when I went to run this again it ran it by default on localhost 3000 instead of 2001 so that's where the problem came in so I'm restarting it now with the correct port and this link should not work okay good it looks like it's getting a lot of status 200 okay is here and the console my other screen so so that's working let's go to I don't know why it's not pulling in any data so we'll take care of that soon but for right now I want to go over pull requests so first I'll go to github let me make this a bit bigger and increase the font size so you all can see what's going on so usually I come in here and I don't know why I'm not sure why I didn't get a notification about that usually I have a notification up here so that's that's weird does I didn't get the email I guess I could doublecheck yeah I did get the email about it so for whatever reason I didn't get a notification this time but normally it will notify you if someone submits a pull request to your repository but we'll just go in oh is this bullets in I might have to check out area it's down here so good in this bulletin react and I just got a slack message from one of my coworkers I stopped at the grocery store on my lunch break and picked up a bunch of cinnamon rolls and she said she just heated one up in the microwave and it's amazing now I'm gonna be thinking about that during the whole stream all right so let's go to pull requests and here's pull request number three from Sebastian and let's check it out I love that REE factorization alright so usually I just kind of go through what was said it looks like this would be a small pull request only one file change so when I go through whatever the person who submitted the request says then I check out the files just in general it's easier to merge in a smaller pull request I appreciate pool requests of all sizes but occasionally if I get a really big pull request if I like 75% of it you know it's awesome but there's 25% that I'm not sure about sometimes like I don't really want to pull the entire thing in so if it was broken up into smaller requests I could just pull in what I need so keep that in mind I when you're submitting to really any repositories is I think you have a better shot at getting your pull request merged if it's smaller and more focused because it's less likely to cause merge conflicts and you know take the the repository maintainer a really long time to go through ok so this is in the post preview and let's see what's changed it's it's just a refactor so it should still have the same functionality looks like it looks like it's just cleaned everything up and made it and they did a bit smaller here so that looks good actually this is straightforward enough that I could just merge it right here but since we're kind of demonstrating this I'd like to show you how I would go about testing it so let's go go back to the terminal and make this a bit bigger so on a very small pull request like this where I could very clearly see all the lines of code I would probably just merge it right there in github because I mean it's just so obvious what that code does but if it's bigger and I really want to test it out first then I'll go into my my project so let's see if I need and Xcode whenever you install an Xcode update it always messes things up you have not agreed you must agree to both hit the enter key alright agree all right awesome okay so if anybody ever read that whole thing I have never read it that's not even in English I guess it's not really that long right it's anyway all right so I'm just checking the status to make sure we don't have anything that's uncommitted that on this branch so we don't and then now I'm gonna go get fetch origin and the origin pool and then I'm gonna put the number of the pool request which in this case is three and then now I'm going to name this last part after the colon is what I'll name the branch so I'm just gonna say s refactor I'm just saying s refactor because it's Sebastian and so far there's only one person whose name starts with s this submitted pool request if I had more people I would probably come up with something better now I got to do this again since I restarted all right so let's on my other screen I'm gonna get my my key let's see so I don't know this offhand I have it saved in LastPass okay let's put that in there and then I'm gonna do SSH ad and that way it won't keep asking me for it so if you ever if you have this happen and you have to keep putting in your your passphrase just do run SSH ad and then put your passphrase in and it'll stay in there for me it stays in there until I restart I'm not there's probably some way to make it stay in there all the time but maybe it's better if you don't have to stay in there all the time just in case somebody gets into your computer okay so now let's go with I guess it already works so now we'll go get checkout yes refactor okay so now we have that pull request number three locally on our machine and we can test it out now at this point you'd want to remember if any packages have been added then you'd want to update so you just run yarn or you know or if you're using NPM you could do that but we don't have any new packages added so now we're just going to check it out see see what it looks like since this didn't add any new features it should be fine basically what I'm looking for let's see why this is not loading that work my sweet it's gonna be code make sure I save that's interesting I should be working let's go to need that oh this is where it's at you know just make sure the sights okay so the site is is up let's go let's go to the admin panel and see what's going on all right so we have graph QL I did go back to the older version oops and I just remembered I forgot to set my timer so I'm just gonna keep an eye on this probably once once we get close to 3 o'clock I'll take a fiveminute break and we'll do some questionandanswer stuff so if you're asking questions right now I'm not I'm gonna get to it probably in about 10 to 15 minutes I'll check the live chat and get to the questions ok oh ok so Blake says it's it is working on end grukk ok let me try that out then wow it is ok so I'm not sure what the problem is locally okay so for now I'm just gonna look here just to test it out and then we'll worry about whatever is going on locally in a minute so I'm just going to go in and click we only have a few views available basically I'm just when I test out at this point it's really simple we don't have any testing setup so when I want to test it out I go through and just check you know the views and see if we're getting errors and so we are we are getting some errors but I doubt that this is related to the the pool request we can double check by going back to master and see if it's still there okay let's see see if we get this error everywhere this is actually we went that wasn't the right one that was still the local okay so something's wrong with my local host and then this okay great so this works without any errors here and grout so so that's cool now at this point we could merge from the command line and if I would do that normally I would merge in the master branch into this pull request branch first test it out again and then merge everything in the master but I think let's let's check and see and github if we can merge this without any without any conflicts okay so no conflicts so what I'm gonna do is just merge right here because it's it's easier to just press that big green button so like I said I would only do this on a very small pool requests where you can see what's changed and it's very it's obvious otherwise would definitely test and merge from the command line and let's confirm that all right also so I know Sebastian is watching right now but I still like to say thank you to everyone that submits a pull request so thanks Sebastian and also yeah I'm okay with this so Sebastian is asking if I'm okay with it and is to start refactoring the other components yeah I think this is that's awesome let's go it was let me check again post preview that was it yes in the post preview it looks great oops I didn't actually pull it down haha it's gonna look even better so let's go get check out the master get pull to bring in those changes alright so now we have that locally now let's check out those preview ok here's a perspi oh actually no it was the same thing because we weren't on the master branch nevermind I don't know what I was thinking okay so anyway so Sebastian that looks great if you want to refactor some of the other components then that would be awesome too yeah so yeah let's do take another like five or six minutes to do some some more styling and then we'll do a question and answer okay let me let's go back here actually first what we should do is get this working I could just run off the end Rock one I guess so I'm gonna give it maybe like two minutes to try to figure this out if we can't I'll just do everything off the end rock but I would like to see why because yesterday this was working fine so what are we getting here okay see if we're getting okay syntax error mmm check okay I think I'm probably not gonna mess with this during the stream I'm just going to do one last thing and that is restart the server because sometimes that just works so it's worth a shot I don't really think it'll work in this case but it only takes a few seconds all right hey and it works ha ha I can't believe it all right let's just read this way twice all right get out of here let me pull the one that works over so for some reason it just didn't work in that tab I don't know what's going on come on going in it it won't come up there all right are you serious so I can get I can get local hose to work in other tabs but I can't get it to work here that's insane that's so crazy I mean watch this what what would cause that that it will work here and not here all right well this is not a debug Chrome stream so I'm not gonna mess with it there we go so I did a hard refresh and it worked so I'm I don't know what whatever it works let's just keep going oh there we go Blake and put in the live chat cache and I didn't see it yet so yeah honestly this those two things probably solve more problems restarting the server and clearing the cache oh wow I'm just glad it works okay so now now let's take a fiveminute break and do questions since I just took up the last five minutes just getting that to work so I'm gonna bring over my timer and we're gonna do a five minute break I'm gonna go through the latch and then we'll do another twenty five minutes of well we're legit gonna do some some styling I have now haven't really done much so far but I think it was worthwhile to go through the pull request process so I mean if you've never hosted your own repository where people were so many pull requests then you may you may not have gone through that before okay okay cool so Sebastian says in regard to the pull request as I read something about the previous pull request he had issues with the new JavaScript syntax or something I wanted to test with just a file if everything's okay I'll do more okay awesome you know did something weird with an on click hand earlier I just use the link the read more button okay so Sebastian is interested to see about what happens with the read more button yeah definitely works so yeah I mean if we're using react router then I think link is the way to go with that so it's good of that post detail was that the one now was it post preview that was it yeah so link I would think we would want to use link you know for every navigation so I don't have the the previous version to compare it to right now but that's that's what I would have done also in regard to that via the new JavaScript stuff so we do have because of the way we're using standard Jas sometimes when we have trying to find an example of functions okay so alright so like this we have render post so you get an error saying render post wasn't defined so harsh it when he submitted his full request number two did this right he defined them here in the constructor function but what I've been doing is instead not defining it in the constructor function so I'll just give an example now so we're gonna take this out and instead we're going to use an arrow function here that will handle the binding of this and then to handle the standard Jas complaining about it or whatever I mean es lense being used under the hood for that so I don't know exactly what it is that's giving the error message about it we're gonna go into our package JSON and then down here under our Global's I'm just I've been putting everything in Global's you can also do a similar thing right at the top of the file but it's just easy to put everything right here then you can see right at a glance all the stuff so you have to add a little bit either way you either have to put something in the component or you have to put something in here I kind of prefer to just put one line here if it got really huge we could probably take this out put it in another file if we wanted to but our package JSON is not very big at all so this works and then we save ourselves what was it like four lines in here inside the component so in here I would put render post and we'll say make sure you say both of those and let's go I'm just gonna run the Lintz so we can see we shouldn't get an error yep see it ran through everything we didn't get the error but now I'm not it's not loading again that's gonna be annoying okay I should have the cash off actually let's double check that in the settings see where there should be an option to disable caching when dev tools is open yep disable cache so that's on so I'm not sure what's going on with that we may just have to do a couple of hard refreshes okay hopefully that cleared up the whole issue with the air is coming from senator Chaz let's see kazeem sorry if I'm mispronouncing name it's qaz I am so I'm going to say Kazim says hi from Kosovo hey how's it going thanks for watching and joining in the live chat and my five minutes is up so I didn't get through everything this in a live chat right now but I will come back to where I left off and after the next Pomodoro session we'll do some more questions okay so let's go you know what let's add in let's make this actually you know drop down with some options and we'll add in a few other of the icons that we need here and I kind of I like to work my way like from the top down so we'll get this app bar you know kind of how we want it and also actually I think we'll go with the newer style that we've been doing on the last project the last couple of projects where you have the white with the gold underneath so my boss really likes that looks clean so let's do that so we'll change up some of the styles here add some icons add a drop down and then we'll throw in probably a logo here in the sidebar and yeah and then we'll see how long that takes you know we might not even get all that done but if it if we can get all that done then maybe we'll work on more on this sidebar ok so let's go into our our theme right so yesterday we set up a material UI theme and I believe that was in our layout yes so in our layout we actually have so we've brought in part of the theme here so see how we want to do this I don't know that I I obviously don't want to make our primary color white so what I'll do then is override our primary color just for that that app bar so let's for app bar let's go with backgroundcolor and we'll use oops what is white FFF yeah it's amazing how light you use the thing so many times and you know occasionally you're just you're just not sure about it okay all right so that will give us our white so if you're falling along with an grok you'll see that the whites right there I have a second window of this open on my other screen so I won't have to flip back and forth quite as much so we have that and now we want to do a bottom border so border so you want to do Solid 3 pixels I think we were doing three pixels for that bottom border we can double check at some point but I think three will work and we want our color to be let me I can't remember it offhand we'll have to grab it from an existing project so I'm opening up our resource center project on the other screen just so that I can grab this this color and it was it was three pixels so that's good be consistent there okay so we should see oops I forgot my a comma okay cool so let's see so right now you can see we have white with our gold underneath okay so we're going to want to change our color of our icons and let's see let's see if we can just put a color property on the app bar it might work might not be specific enough but if it works and that'll be great color and so let's do the CL that works whoops did I forget a comma again oh man I've been forgetting commas frequently lately alright great so that that wall that at least works for this so we still need that icon to have the color but that's good that it worked here and while we're at it I think I want to change I definitely want this to be a smaller font weight and perhaps just a little bit bigger so let's change that let's go ahead we can leave all those really small changes for another time let's get this what did we say that those feet with that icon was called was it more vert I think that's what it was let's get that more vert icon with the right color there so I don't think we have anything for an icon in here let's see where we're actually putting that icon in I don't remember plotting anything okay that's interesting color contrast I wonder actually I kind of want to look up what what it does there with color contrast so let's check the material design documentation or outside material UI so we are using the version 1 and let's go to icons let me make this a bit bigger for everyone okay icons it's just not there then we get icon somewhere there we go icons what was that icon button now let's see what they have here let's try let's check out the button component then since we're actually using an icon button component it may be here under buttons icon button here we are okay so this icon button this button color okay so color contrast alright let's see our API is so color color is using the theme palette when that makes sense oh okay so it's so somewhere in the theme we define what the contrast color is and then it's going to use that okay so if we reset this to primary it should pull that green color which is what we want so let's do that then so I mean we definitely could have just overrode this dial and it would have been a lot faster but I mean just I think it's nice to work within you know the way that the people who design material you I you know set that out to work it'll be a lot more consistent that way later on if we decided to change our primary color this would automatically change the correspond to it which is kind of nice probably not going to change it but it's nice to have it all linked up like that so you can see now we have our icon and let's see so now let's I'd really like to add the drop down I don't think I've used the drop down yet for material you I and any of our projects so this will be cool it'll be the first time to implement this on the stream so let's go to back to our documentation and let me see I forgot to reset my timer so I'm just gonna have to look again so we started this Pomodoro session around 300 so around 325 I just have to keep an eye on it okay so where's I just have to figure out what it's called here and may not be called a dropdown maybe menu concealer whoops actually want the demo first so we can see it and you yeah that's what I want okay so it's I'm just calling it a dropdown but it's it's really a menu so there we go this is we won't need all these options but that's kind of what I'm going for when you click on this then we give it so let's just go with the simple example and so we're going to need to grab import this and let's see menu item to me okay we are importing that as well great so let's do that in our in our layout because this is where we have that app bar so at the top let's pull in that menu oops oh man let me move this over I'm accidentally clicking my minimap over here that's what sent me down there okay so let's do that and now right below we put it right here below the icon button oops or this icon button that way we'll keep them together I'm gonna be easier to tell you know what which is which here I probably could break it out into another component you know this whole thing but for now we'll leave it in there can always refactor later on let's see here it is here's a menu so I'm gonna copy this all in and we'll have to change it a bit looks like we're gonna have to copy in this as well okay so here's a menu okay let's pull this in yes saving needs need this button need our button to have these as well it's the icon button it's gonna have a lot here so let's bring these down just to help us read it alright let's see if that's if that will work oops haha and these aren't defined so let's go ahead and put these in our package.json so what did we have is not the fun and handle click and the request closed now states should definitely be States at work we have it in our package JSON right yeah we have it in there mmm that's weird and just handle click whoops there we go and it was the other one handle requests close all right let's save that see if we get and that's uh what'd I miss oh oh actually you know what yeah that doesn't make sense because we weren't linting there that was just a normal air and it's an Oakland maybe I did I paste this in the wrong spot let me see yep all right thanks Sebastian it's I based into the wrong place what was I thinking yeah be kidding me Wow all right so we already have state so let's bring in shoot we're gonna have to change that so we don't want that to be open let's go open open menu and we'll change it down here to open menu and select all this there we go open menu all right there we go now let's bring this in let's see if we have okay doesn't look like we're repeating anything and then we also need to do within here I'm going to make sure we say open menu okay all right I think that should work now we would have had to have had that added this the package.json at some point anyway so hey look at that it works awesome okay cool so that wasn't too bad to to implement if I could just photo just pasted it into the right spot it would have been even easier all right awesome so that works we're not going to want all of these we're gonna keep logout and then actually let me I don't remember what other options should be there let me check the time so I don't pass up the next okay so maybe in about seven minutes or so we'll do our next question and answer session so if you got any questions in the live chat and I haven't responded I'm not ignoring you I would definitely get to it in the question answer session or at the end of the stream let's see I'm just doublechecking here my other screen what I want in that menu what actually let me bring this over because I don't think I've shown how the login works so this is currently how the login works for the live version of the bulletin so if your if the login data is not saved in local storage it shows this screen so I can type and so I type in my email JY by Franciscan edu if I were to put in an email address that wasn't at Franciscan ddu it wouldn't let it go through so even if you did something with dev tools and let it go through it still wouldn't it wouldn't work so it checks on the client side and the server side so when I submit this I get a link sent to me so whoops that's not it chuna pull the link over on the screen there it is okay so I get this link and second display images alright so this link comes in if I click it then I'm signed in to the bulletin and then Oh Acts I guess I'd only had logout as the option right now all right well so I guess we can take out the other options for now and that lengthy you get is a it's a singleuse link so once it's used once then you won't be able to log in again if you try to use it again you'll get an error message so that's the current login system which hopefully we're going to be changing that soon although it does work well as long as some users do clear out their local storage often so it doesn't work well for them but for people who don't do that it makes it really easy because you can basically you stay logged in for a year as long as you're not clearing anything out okay let me but I am to do this just so we can see my stuff again alright so let me take out right now our other menu items depending on how much time we have and what we want to do with this I would like to add in some menu items like profile or my account to allow users to customize their experience a little bit but since we're not we don't have anything like that right now just going to keep things clean in here and take them out it seems silly to have a menu like that for one item but it was it was kind of always intended to have more just haven't haven't really had time to come back to this project since it wants last year okay so let's add in let me check the current version of this so we want to add a printer icon and then kind of a grid icon and a search search icon so let's go I wonder we'll probably have to go to our icons to get the name so there we go alright so if you if you want material design style icons this is definitely the place to go material do slash icons you get all these icons here and you can get them in several different formats right now we have already imported these icons so we can use them in our project but if I hadn't imported them I you like to grab the the SVG code for them and just put it in line so let's look for the print icon first alright so here we have print and we can see you know we could grab the SVG the ping or we could pull it in as an icon font we can pull it in we can use different colors here we're going to change the color of that green that we've been using so that doesn't really matter you know if we were to grab the SVG doesn't matter by I just mean you know we can download the SVG and then open it up copy and paste the code right there in line into our project but for now I just wanted to make sure of the name so we should be able to just use print icon so let's grab our icon button and I'm gonna paste it and paste it in here I'm hoping that this goes to the left of our current that's more vert icon button we'll see not sure let's see for now let's get rid of these this will probably end up having will may end up putting a link component either inside the button or wrapping the button in the link component but for now we just want it to get we want it to show up so assuming we can just do prints since we already have color primary it should be the right color I'm gonna save that and let's check it out for an icon is not defined well I don't think we imported it up here revert icon actually can we there's got to be a better way to do this than importing them all these icons separately right oh well when maybe we'll figure that out at some point but you would think that you could just do something like this right and import from icons all right so let's try it now we're actually importing that first for an icon great alright awesome and that worked just like we wanted it to you know the print icon there as well so it's time to do another fiveminute question answer and we can have all our icons there probably doesn't need quite so much space in between but that's something you know that's a little thing that we can adjust later on sometimes if you try to adjust at least for me in my experience if I try to adjust those little things early on they want to get more things on the page I end up wanting to adjust them again and it's better if I just hold off until I get like a clearer picture of the hole more things on the page then I then I end up adjusting once instead of multiple times throughout okay so let me go to my live chat and I'm gonna scroll up to the point where I left off and get through as much as I can in five minutes at the time yeah I think we'll go with three Pomodoro sessions so I know yesterday we didn't do quite as much coding as we normally do so we'll make up for it today by putting in an extra session and so we'll have a fiveminute question answer now another 25 minutes of code and then afterwards we'll have a long question answer session where I can get to everything that's left over after these five minutes so let me bring out my timer I don't know where I put it and I got minimize that I did all right here we go okay okay so James asks how do I have to be are ok how skilled do I have to be to join these live streams actually it doesn't it really depends on kind of what you want so we we go over some some things that are like a whole different range of skills so sometimes we go over things that are more advanced sometimes we do things that that aren't really that advanced so depending on what we're working on for a particular stream it may be more useful to you if you know if you're at a lower skill level so it generally it's I like to have a mix of different skill levels watching and in the live chat and then that way the people who you know really skilled can help out can help me out and can help the other people in the live chat out with any issues that they're having and help to explain and I try to do my best to explain as them as I'm going along so if I'm not explaining well feel free to ask any questions so I may not look at the live chat during the code session so I at at one point where you're streaming I tried to go through the live chat all the time and it ended up that we just we didn't get a lot of code done at all so that's why I've kind of separated them out but I will get to your questions eventually but I mean if you it kind of depends on if you want if you want like a straight tutorial that really gets to the point this is probably not the best place for that because you know we're always working on something different and it's it's not really methodical and how we teach things so it's more just to show like here's what my normal day is as a frontend developer but I do try try to do my best to explain things so you could get something out of it see Sebastian says with react 16 you can use class instead of class name right okay and Melissa says yes that's cool I hadn't I didn't realize you could do that I actually just read through some react 16 stuff before the stream today it looks like there's a lot that changed behind the scenes that make it faster and neck and smaller so that's pretty awesome okay James says can you do a beginning code that lined up the first project and free code camp yeah so yeah that one was the one so I started to do that one on my own channel so if you come in just in the free code camp channel it's I've already done a few streams at that point so you don't see you like the startup so check out I think I have linked in the description of this video the link to my channel my personal channel so if you check that out and you go to the project that is the title of the first video is building a website as fast as I can let's it ended up not being that fast but initially because of the deadline it was going to be really fast but gets on some leeway there so check that video up first if it's still not I don't remember exactly where I started out there but if it still needs like even more introduction I'm definitely open to going back maybe and you know kind of doing more of an introductory video on that but yeah check that one out I do maybe two or three streams on my own channel and then I switch over to freako cam okay John Hanson says had a hard time getting modal's to work as I would like and react even with react router looking forward to reworking modal's and react 16 awesome yeah so John have you been have you been using a framework like material UI or trying to do modal's from scratch because I think something like a framework it does make it pretty easy all right me let me mark down where I'm even off at and we'll do one more session of coding all right and I just saw right when I was working down the time so in us as hey what are you building a a Niles are going we are working on a react project with with graph Pio we're using Apollo to bring in stuff from graph qo and we're styling it today with the latest version of material UI ok alright so all right let's throw in those next there's two icons quickly since we know we know how to do it and it'll work so we just need to get the names of those icons so we want a grid not like that layouts see if it's in layout actually the me I'm gonna inspect the the current site that we're redoing and see if I use the material I con mathira khan grid button we call it a quilt is it huh wow it is called view quilt Wow I would not have guessed that okay so let's do the quilt and I'm just gonna I'm not gonna put it in twice now go get in there so let's do view quilts and down here let's figure out this and I'm gonna copy it twice in here since we know we're going to do another one and for this one we want the few quotes and I'll save that and then finally we want the search I'm almost positive search is just gonna be search so let's just try that out before we look it up search I'll go up to the top all right let's check it out awesome so we have our icons here great cool all right so let's move on and try to put the logo up in this corner I think so by default this is gonna be open so on it on a large screen let's see it look pointed okay so we actually don't have it we're gonna have to change this so that it's not always open because on a mobile that just doesn't give us enough room but so we may be able to display the logo on mobile I'm okay actually with not like you know let's say this is closed we go to a small screen and we just have something like this of course we'd want this text to be over here but I'm okay with not having the logo appear immediately and instead it appears when you click this oops and it looks like we need to change the color of this as well I've forgotten about that icon there should be a hamburger menu icon here but it's it's white so let's change that right now before you forget so anyway I think a logo right here will work let's change that color though so if we go down our icon button instead of contrast we want to give it the color primary which we if you remember from before we set that primary color as our green so now yep there we go so now we have that icon awesome all right so let's check out this sidebar component and see if there's some way to put a logo up here already builtin if not you know we'll have to make it work so where's my documentation I don't think we need these icons anymore so see the drawer see what we called that component yeah okay it is a drawer using a persistent drawer awesome okay so I don't see yeah I don't see any example with something up here let's check out the drawer API and see if there's anything anything that we could use okay so let's see anything so let's look in here and see if we can figure something out so classes from your header okay so here's our drawer header that's where we would want to put it so far we do have an icon button here we do want to keep that so let's try to put in an image into here and need to bring in I don't think we have a folder yet for images so for now I'm going to grab the image address from another site that Resource Center site so eventually we'll want to actually bring in the image but for now this will let us test it out quickly so there may see is there an image I don't know if there's an image component built into media built into material UI alright I don't see one so we'll just go with a regular image alright so this at least will give us something to work with for now to see what it looks like right now hmm there we go okay so we have the image in there right now it's way too big again it's covering up our our icon to close this so definitely need some work we can do a little bit of that right here in dev tools just make this a bit smaller and let's work on dev tools see where sidebar is there we go okay so let's give this see if we could do with percent so that's a little bit better we want to give it let's give it a margin 16 pixels it's let's increase it a bit I want to see I want to see where that button went to all right interesting so maybe if we switch the order it may work out a little better for us with that button we could try let's let's try I'd rather not mess with this button as much because you know everything's set from within the mature UI theme for that so instead let's let's try to position this in a way that will allow this button to do this thing normally what I'm thinking is if we go and do something like this well now it's messing up everything I didn't think about these ones down here all right so that might not be an option and keep that in mind though but then we'd have to position things these down further so for now it's not really an option let's see if we do if you can use flex one simply does for us nothing yeah let me switch the order then oops and I did not add my styles on this so good thing we didn't have too much going on all right so to shrink it down okay so this is giving us something a little bit more like what I wanted at least this button is visible and it's in the right spot I'm guessing what we'll probably want is for this to be up a little bit further so we don't have to move the logo down quite so far yeah under if we it's gonna check the live chat quickly as well to see if anyone has any solution actually image tag before the button saying okay cool just receive anyone had any thoughts on this okay nice image let's see I do I want to check before I start messing with this button too much I want to check the API for the button and see what we can do through the API otherwise we'll just have to override some stuff which is okay so okay so we can not but you know I don't want to override all the buttons so I'm not going to do it like this we'll just do it in line on that particular button so let's try some things out here in dev tools you check my time okay yeah we try some things out in dev tools see what we can do actually positionabsolute might not be this might not be bad for this we can just put a margin on the image what do we do before 16 yeah we definitely need it to be a bit more than that okay we'll see Outlook I'm actually not now that I see this I don't like all the space on the top but give it a shot for now and let's see why do we have all this space anyway that's good interesting I really don't like that what do you all think I'm not I'm not a fan of this does not look good to me okay you know what yeah if you're if you're checking this out through and Rock you won't see any of this right now because I'm just doing this in dev tools yes so that's not I guess the the alternative is to not potentially if you don't have to give users the option to close this currently there is no option to close this on the the version that's live right now I'm usually all for giving users as many options as possible but in this case it's something that the users can't do now and I haven't had any any requests for it so an on mobile it would open and then you would simply have to click outside of it to get it to close so you know you hit the icon for it to open so how about I'd say for now let's just take this out or we could have even commented out just so that we don't forget that it's there maybe we'll comment it out and then we'll come back to it later on if we have time because I think that's that falls into the category of something that would be a nice feature but it's certainly not a necessary feature and especially since I've I've never had a request from a user to be able to do this I think probably it's it's not necessarily worth the time to get this to work right now yeah so let's do that so I'm gonna do we do comments and reacts like this yep there we go there's not some better way to do comments and react right am i I don't to be that missing let's do this we don't take up quite as much space there we go alright so as far as I know that's the only way to do comments and reacts all right so let's say that we'll probably want to comma comment out the Chevron left up top here otherwise it'll probably tell us somewhere that we've imported this and we're not using it no I got it Judy are you really I don't know what's going on with this okay so now on our image let's go let's just add to this to these styles and let's do a logo styles and we can put with 100% whoops forget this is an object not normal CSS with a hundred percent and let's add some a set of margin I will do padding all the way around we'll give it eight pixels see how that looks but I think eight pixels will look alright we might want a little bit more maybe on the top we'll see oops and I forgot my comma and I forgot to tie it and who our component down here so let's find our image yeah it's gonna pass it up right there we go let's go to a style and what do you call that logo sis styles we did pull that in two styles right you'll find another spot where you use that just as Tyl he equals the only using it in one place all right well we can see if it'll work here nope it didn't and we're using this somewhere right classes flex okay this it's not really it's easy classes that wait a second what am I doing wrong class name clot that's it thank you Sebastian class name classes okay on my other my react native project I'm doing everything with the style tag so I'm saying style when I'm bringing in styles dot whatever that's what I kept trying to do and I don't have it set up like that for this okay not bad maybe oh yeah maybe didn't give it you so do we have if this side bar has a fixed width which it does all right let's try this 250 twofifty oops let's try 2 34 pixels okay that works the accomplice is basically the same thing so here's so basically what I did instead of doing with 100% which was not letting us get our our margins the way we wanted since this has a fixed width the sidebars are fixed with the 250 pixels what we wanted was 8 pixels on each side so we just made the logo 234 pixels which gave us that extra 16 for each side and then we had 8 pixels on the top and the bottom and then for right and left we set it to auto which splits it equally so that's how we got our positioning here so now we'll go back over and change this in the component so go back up to where we set our logo styles so you want to 34 pixels and 8 pixels of Auto and okay actually that's we're not getting our eight pixels on the top and the bottom will just happen oh oh I didn't I had switched it to margin let's see if that makes a difference yep it does okay great all right not bad and my timer went off so it's just in time we got that that done so we have our whole top portion pretty much done I'd like to make a few little little changes here and there really minor things so next up will be getting the rest of this sidebar looking like it's supposed to and then when we want to building out some of the views okay so let me actually I want to commit this now because I I've been forgetting to commit and later on so I don't want anybody even wants to maybe work on this to have you know the older version of the code so let's check our status see what's changed okay this looks good these are the things that we we did actually changed so let's go get commit we're gonna add the am flag which means adds we're gonna add all those files then we're also going to put in a commit message at the same time in line with our command so let's say icons okay that works and then we're gonna get push origin master to push that up to github it's going to do all its most Auto formatting checks and everything wait did it do all for money that was weird for some reason it wasn't automatically running that so I'm not sure what's going on with that so I guess I'll do another commit okay yeah it didn't do the normal lifting all right so that's all up in the github repo so everything that we've done is available now the link to the repo is in the description so now I'm gonna scroll back up to where I left off in the live chat so if you can't stick around for the live chat thank you so much for watching I'll be back tomorrow sometime around 200 p.m. Eastern Time but if you can stick around definitely I hope you can and help out with answering questions or asking some of your questions I am gonna try to get through all the questions I do I have an appointment at 500 so it probably can I'm probably safe to go at least a half hour with questions and so we'll see hopefully I can get through everything normally not only able to okay see James says he just seems to want to impress someone and not here to help out what are these projects based upon anyway I'm not sure is James James might be talking about me I don't see him talking about anybody else so anyway yeah James I don't know so I'm not sure how much you've seen but it's actually a probably the opposite I don't know that I impress that many people with this I frequently mess up and make mistakes that's kind of the whole point is for people to see someone who is employed fulltime as a frontend developer making a lot of mistakes and trying to work through it so yeah so if I was out to impress I would not live stream I would record and edit out all of my mistakes usually the most impressive thing that happens in the stream or the pool request that you all submit it makes the projects so much better than I ever could have made them and the projects the projects are actually based upon my work project so I'm currently at my job and I work on whatever my boss says I need to work on so that's why we have a few projects going on at once and sometimes we switch projects depending on what's what's needed so that's what it's based on the styling is based on the style guide for the University of that work at so I have I do have quite a bit of freedom in the tools that I use but there are some things that I can't change so one of it being you know we've set the styles so I kind of have to stick with that you know I have some leeway with that but we couldn't just completely change and go with like an entirely different philosophy on design let's see James says do you know skills enough to explain to people how to adjust their issues that we have with coding I never seen a coding channel in a fashion such as this can you help us out I can definitely try to help you out so if you have any put them in the live chat and you can also ask me questions on other social media things so if you send me something on Twitter so my Twitter is linked in the description as well or really anything i have i've got messages on linkedin facebook twitter instagram through email any of those i'll try to get back to you as soon as i can i can't always get back right away because i you know i have a lot going on i have four kids and my job and I'm taking a Udacity daño degree course so I can't respond immediately but I do always try to get back to everyone eventually with some help or at least some helpful links as in regards to whether I have enough skills to explain to people I don't really know that's why I say in the live chat you know anybody who if you can stick around for the live chat even if you're an expert and don't have questions I definitely appreciate your sticking around and helping to answer questions because you know in this field even if I were an expert at something I can't be an expert at everything so they're always going to be questions about things that I don't I've never used before so when that happens you know I'm I'm fine with saying hey I don't really know you know does anybody else have any input so in terms of my skills I you know I don't know you all can can tell me I have I have had some a lot of positive feedback though that people say that I have helped out certainly in regard to someone who's just starting out I'm pretty confident in my CSS my HTML skills in terms of react you know I'm still going through and learning things I'm much much better than I was even you know six months ago so you know this show we're kind of all learning together and helping each other out so you know I'll do my best to give advice when I can but then also let you all know whenever I'm probably not the best resource so you know take take what I say for what it is let's see okay okay Paul says in response to James says he's far ahead not at the beginning level you can google on material UI and he's showing us how to style using material you eye components yeah so this this particular stream was not necessarily beginner level so you probably would have had to have some knowledge of how react works and maybe a little bit about material UI so this particular shame not maybe not really good for beginners maybe some of the later on we were just doing some basic you know positioning stuff with CSS it would be project three has some stuff that it's not react based it's more like just plain HTML and CSS we are dealing some with some csharp templates but I'm gonna do some things with project three to make it a lot more beginner friendly especially for beginners to submit pull requests so I've had some other stuff that I had to work on when I'm not streaming so I haven't been able to get that ready yet but hopefully I'll be finished up with with some updates I need to make to that project one that we had done and when I'm done with that maybe it'll free up a little bit more time for me and I can get that going so as we go back into project three from time to time that's probably the best place for beginners right now okay James says sorry for beating you up but I'm wanting to get my point across oh don't worry about it yeah definitely I any questions or comments or anything I definitely welcome even if it's criticism because I want to make these streams you know as good as they can be for you also don't feel bad about you know any any comments let's see James says well well think of us let's see he didn't say that when he first started making videos about coding okay I'm not sure what I would he said at that time or what I said at that time so see okay Sebastian says you know he will answer your question when she finishes yeah yeah so yeah so if I mention from time to time but if if you come into the stream in the middle of a session just just to let you all know I'm not ignoring the live chat so I do get to the questions but I have to space it out otherwise I just can't get coding done if I'm constantly going back and forth from questions to code so I've tried doing it like that and the streams end up being really long and we don't really get that much done so we kind of split out the the question answer session from that but we still do get to the questions see I Paul says it's a series just a demo of his talent on advanced topics so thank you for that Paul but I I don't I kind of gone with what I said before I don't know that this is a demo of my talent yeah so that the point is like and I know I've said this before but for anybody who's new that's watching I there are so many great people that are doing tutorials like free recorded tutorial videos and they're awesome but the thing that I thought might be helpful that I can help with I didn't really think I could compete with the people that are already doing great tutorials but I thought at least I can help new developers out by showing them what it's like for me as a fulltime developer and just how many mistakes I make and how hard it is to work through because sorry I just realized I left my fan on so I apologize if the fan was kind of annoying to anybody I just turned it off so anyway I am I just thought it might be helpful for people to see like when you see the coding videos that are tutorials it seems like the people doing it are awesome they don't make any mistakes right which is fine for those videos because you want to get to the point you want to teach people so you don't want to leave in all mistakes but I thought it might be helpful for people to see that you know even someone who does have a fulltime job as a programmer still makes those mistakes sometimes really silly mistakes I mean if you've if you've watched previous streams you know sometimes I just make you know ridiculous mistakes and it takes me forever to figure it out so anyway that's that's what I thought I brought to it so it's not it's not really me demonstrating my skills or anything like that if I do something awesome on the live stream then that's great that's really cool but I also think it's really cool when I mess something up on the live stream and that can be more helpful than me doing it right because you know then you'll see the mistakes that I make and you know you're kind of ahead of the game you won't make those same mistakes because you've already seen me do it and we've worked through it together I need to come up with like a really brief way to say that and just say it at the beginning of all the shows and maybe put it in the description because I think I say that frequently and maybe I'll like write it out and condense it as much as I can let's see Carlos says that comma issues should be caught by the linter Yellen set on well I thought I had it set on commit to lint but for some reason it wasn't it wasn't working right so but anyway yeah what I need to set things up so that it automatically does it as I'm typing okay cool set James says I'm on myfirstproject and free code camp so awesome James that's great starting out so yes so if you have any questions about any of the free code camp stuff let us know here in the lab chat or like I said you know on some other form of social media I'd be happy to help out if I can let's see James says can you build a dating website I would like to learn about that is that hard hard work yeah so well like I mentioned before since I'm doing these streams from work I really like I need to work on my work project so I work for University so I'm not going to be working on a dating website but it potentially some of the things that we work on here could be used for other projects I know some people have taken some of our previous projects clone the repo and then change things to make it work for their use case so that's possible too you could definitely build a website like that with react I don't know in terms of like the back end in the database we don't get into databases very much at all on this stream although we might in the future so there's definitely more to it than it would be in this stream but you know in terms of all the front end you know you could definitely learn enough to build out a front end for something like that Sebastien says so we were talking about this sign let this drop down menu and saying you know right now it really only has one option and so Sebastian says it's kind of pointless why not just have a logout button and you're right Sebastian so basically there were two reasons why I made it like this initially one is I intended to have more options there and I just never had time to put them in also I wasn't sure what the proper button is for logout that's kind of universally known so one of the requirements was this had to work for people who are not really that familiar with computers so I don't know I mean to be honest with you now that I think about it would people really know that this was a menu so if anyone has any ideas for an icon that would mean logout we can go with that but I really would like to have some other options here if we could to give users you know some some customization so we'll see hopefully for now I'm going to leave it in just because I hope to put more options here but if we get closer to the time when this is going to launch and we still don't have options then maybe we'll swap in some icon and we'll just put a tooltip over it so that people will know what it what it does let's see all right James says does anybody have the heart to help me with advice as a developer X I mean I think but going to free code camp is already a great kind of first step so if you work through the free code camp stuff and try to supplement that with maybe YouTube videos knotti not necessarily these streams but there's a lot of other great streams on free code camp and other YouTube channels so like all of on this channel like Bo's JavaScript videos are great great like intro to different things in JavaScript so when you get to that part in free code camp check those videos out also for like CSS stuff dev tips is a really good YouTube channel that I've gone to for a lot of more like design and CSS things for some more JavaScript stuff and build tools and things like that learn code Academy is a great JavaScript or a great YouTube channel that I've used before and then so there's a lot of different types of videos on the free code camp channel too so if you check out some of the playlists there's just a huge variety of content so I'm kind of I'm the only one that does like the daytoday live streaming kind of thing but there's a lot of other really talented people that you do great tutorial videos and things so so definitely check those out if you're more the type of person that likes to learn by reading there's a book series it's you just called you don't know Jay s and that's actually for available for free on github so you can just read it online so check that out that's that's really good and my only other advice if you're new is like just keep working through it you're definitely gonna have some times I know I did where it just seems like I'm working on this problem and I just can't can't get through it but just don't give up keep on working and once you finally get through that problem you're gonna feel great and you're always gonna look back at you know where you were at a few months ago and just realize like I've come so far and that's pretty awesome feeling so for me at least it's definitely worth it you know to just keep going and keep trying to push through and and it's great if you have other people around so like this live chat is how we form kind of a little community here so you know if you need if you need some help or you just need somebody to say like you know hey keep going for it you can do it you know it's kind of cool to have a little community so it doesn't have to be this community for the live chat if you have some other people in your area you can meet with that's that would be amazing too but if anyone else has any advice please put it in the live chat and I'm sure some of you probably already have I haven't got to it yet let's see okay in US if I've ever used UJS and is it better than react I have never used UJS but I know some really good developers I don't mean no personally I mean like just through Twitter and stuff so I know some really good developers who loved UJS and have used both you and reacts so I don't really know I would view seems really promising and I think maybe one day I'd like to try it out I'm just really trying to get good with react at this point so I don't want to branch out right now I mean you know how it is you can know a little bit about a lot of things you can specialize and get really good at one thing so I'm kind of in specialization mode right now but if I get to the point where I feel kind of confident and want to branch out a bit I think I will definitely try view but until I try it I don't know that I really would have a great opinion on whether it's better than react I mean I'm happy with reacts so far I really like it but you know there's also a lot of people that like view so I'm sure it's good to see Samson says the hover menu completely hides the button yeah it does we could probably work on that if we do decide to keep the hover menu I mean it I guess it doesn't really matter that it hides the button because you you don't really need to click the button again but it might not be quite as weird if we push it down a bit and up we could probably do that this this loading thing is bothering me so I'm just refreshing let's see eric says react jess is the future I mean that it does definitely keeps growing so at least for the for the foreseeable future I don't think it's going anywhere anytime soon John Hansen says I'm a from scratch type of person I used to I'll be all about like trying to do things from scratch but I definitely appreciate some boilerplate now when I got to get a project done quickly you know that really helps but it is definitely good to know how to do everything from scratch and really understand you know what's what goes into you know setting things up Eric asked it has Adam gotten really buggy for you was thinking about switching back to visual studio code but want to stick with Adam actually Adam has gotten a little bit buggy so on this computer it's fine but on my laptop it's been really buggy lately I don't understand why I have the same plugins on both for the most part using the same version so I don't know I haven't really dug into the problem yet to see what's going on maybe I just have some outdated plugin that I need to get rid of but yeah I'm not quite ready to switch completely to Visual Studio code but I have been using it some so we'll see I'm right now I'm still with Adam let's see all right I'm just going to try I think I'm gonna skip some of the comments to make sure I can get to all the questions so look at there's some discussion about Adam here see see Kim says normal HTML style comment works in and JSX okay cool okay cool innocence thank you it is a pretty useful stream awesome thanks for thanks for saying that I'm glad I'm glad it's useful to you okay Sebastian said this there's another live stream scheduled for free code camp a live workshop basics of JavaScript and es6 syntax I'm not witness is scheduled I'm not cutting into it right let's try to look for I didn't get a notification about it yet so hopefully it's not I'm not taking up their time Kiyoshi says what tips would you recommend a junior developer interested in getting a job and reacts so I would say build build things with react I mean that it sounds straightforward I know but that's like build things with react having a github if you're not already on github get a github profile and put code in there just get good ideas for different react projects so just think about something like an app or something that you think would be useful and make it get ideas from your friends and family and just do it so if you if you have the time like the free time to be able to do it that's great if you need to work and actually make money you know try to get some clients and make things and react even make things that don't necessarily need to be in react but just do it in react for the practice you like employers will want to see that you can actually do the work so they'll want to look at github they'll want to see demos of what you can do so that would be my biggest thing the other thing would be if you can't network so either online and so like on your social media accounts talk about being a developer talk about how much you like being a developer try to comment in a helpful way to to other developers especially on Twitter Twitter seems to be pretty big for you know for developers so because employers will look at that right if they see and they're really interested in you they'll check your social media stuff so you know if your social media is full of things entirely unrelated to development they might think you don't really care about it or if it's full of a lot of negative things about how much you hate you know this or that about JavaScript or something then they might think you're too negative of it so just keep that in mind that anything that you put online is public your employer would potentially see so just start kind of working on building up you know kind of your online presence as being someone who is positive and excited about being a developer and helping other developers so that's kind of that's my my advice to you I'm sure there's a lot of other things that you could do but for me I know when I've been involved in the hiring process for developers and I immediately want to look at their github repo and look at projects that they've worked on and check that out and then if I'm interested I will check out their social media and I'm more interested in that than their resume so I mean I do look at the resume but if someone has an amazing resume but they don't include a link to github and I can't find any of their code anywhere I'm not really interested maybe if no one else applies I would reach out to them but if there are other people with the less impressive resume but I actually see their stuff on github and it's good I'm much more likely to want to interview that person various says which Udacity nano degree are you taking I'm taking the react nano degree so I've there there are three projects for that nano degree I'm done with the first two I just need to do the last one which is react native app and then hopefully if I do the last one and it works and everything then they don't have my nano degree so I'm hoping to have all that done by the end of this month and when I get done with my my last project oh I'll show you all in the livestream if you want maybe during like one of the questionandanswer sessions give you a little little preview of it let's see she says in 2017 what should I learn to be a full sack developer I am fluent in frontend design HTML CSS bootstrap JavaScript what should I learn to become a full stack developer Vleck spirit says no js' yeah yeah for sure I recommend no js' it'll probably be easier for you to learn node since you already know javascript then to switch to a completely different language so it kind of depends it like really on what you want to work with but if you don't have any specific company or technology you want to work with and I'd go with node that'll probably the easiest transition as you should also ask about the database vole expert recommends DB is popular with node yeah I've heard great things about DB there are some really cool things people were doing with couch and pouch DB so check that out I've seen some some cool demos at conferences with that it couldn't hurt to learn a little bit about sequel based databases because you you're likely to end up at a company that uses sequel because it's it's definitely used more often than no sequel stuff so I try to be familiar with both with both types but if you want to specialize I said Mongoose does seem to be really popular with with node various says don't wait to be an expert to code start now yeah definitely yeah the only way you get better is just it's actually code just work your way through it okay so blake has a suggestion for the logout icon let's check it out serial icons and what was that called exit exit okay we'll see what do you all think does this icon if you saw this icon would you think it was a logout icon let me know like I said we can put a tooltip over it as well so if users are unsure what it means we can have it there I definitely I don't want people to accidentally log out and now now that I think about it that was that was another reason why I did do it like this so I didn't want users to accidentally log out so I made it did you had to click twice to log out because one of the big selling points of when I presented this I did some some workshops to teach people how to use this when it first launched one of the big things was hey you don't have to worry about a password you don't even have to log in very often you log in once and you're logged in for a whole year and people like that so I didn't want it to be easy to log out because there really would be no reason for someone to want to log out unless they were on a public computer and you know didn't want to stay logged in so anyway that's another thing to consider that I just didn't remember from when we were talking about it before let's see Sebastian's or Blake says or lock open let's see what that is open yeah I'm not so sure to me this wouldn't I don't know that I think of logout when I see this but maybe maybe I'm wrong about that let me know what you all think Peter says I hate this loading thing on my screen do something about it that must have been before I got rid of it as well yeah I couldn't take the loading thing either okay okay good Sebastian said this dream doesn't start for 50 minutes and it looks like you said it less than 10 minutes ago all right so we'll be good we'll be done by then oh that's a good idea okay cool so okay Sebastian said what about a simple logout button or power settings for material okay so it looks like we have some option we'll check out some more buttons not right now cuz I'm gonna have to leave in a few minutes but all right well we'll look at some some more of these icons and see which one will be appropriate because blake has a great idea here is to say possibly after clicking it have a prompt reading are you sure you want to log out I like that I think that that makes more sense than what I was doing with making users click twice yeah that makes a lot more sense so we'll just have a little dialog come up that says that so anyway so yeah I really like that idea and yeah so we'll do that this is actually starting to look look not bad here got some row I con I mean they don't work yet it doesn't do anything can you click on them but it looks ok all right cool I got through everything in the live chat so if I happen to miss your question I'm really sorry I try to get through everything but if I did miss your question just put it in the comments to this video or send me a message on some social media thing and I'll shred you back to you soon as I can see I think that's it yeah I'll be back tomorrow sometime around 2 p.m. and until then have a great day you
