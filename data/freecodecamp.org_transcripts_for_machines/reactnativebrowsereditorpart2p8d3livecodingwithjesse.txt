hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm glad to be back it's been a while and uh today we're going to work on our react native browser editor which we started working on a while ago it's been like four or five months so uh just to give a give an intro to the show and the project since this it's been a long time and there's probably a lot of people that are new uh and this in this stream uh what i'm trying to do is work on a real project and i don't rehearse beforehand so there's going to be mistakes but that's the point is just to show you what it's really like to work on something to make mistakes and to to work through those mistakes so the format is i will do 25 minutes where i code and i don't really look at the live chat very much and then i'll take a five minute break i'll look at the live chat and i'll answer questions and i usually do like maybe two sessions like that then at the end i'll look at the live chat and try to answer as many questions as i can so if you have questions just be patient i'll get to them the recording of this live stream is available just a few minutes after the live stream ends so if you have a question but you can't wait for the answer then check out the recording and i'll probably uh answer your question at some point during the stream um feel free to ask ask questions uh if you're a beginner you know don't worry about you know asking questions about even just really basic stuff that's totally fine uh try to keep the live chat positive so um you know i will uh if there's any like harassment or negative stuff or anything like that i'll just block you from the chat so i think that's it in terms of introduction for the stream but in terms of the project what i'm trying to do is i want to get for this demo right we're just using create react app to make a a little proof of concepts so that we can edit react native code in a browser and have it display right there in the browser so very similar to what you would see on freecodecamp.org where you know you have like the split screen and you can type in html and javascript and then have the result appear that's what we want but we wanted to do we wanted to happen with react native code so i just happen to look over the stream someone says can you say the start and end timing uh the streams usually end up being like around an hour sometimes a little bit more than an hour so that's what i'm that's what i'm usually going for and i see a ton of people saying hi so hey everybody uh thanks for watching and i am gonna get started now so i'm gonna bring up a pomodoro timer on my other screen here and i wanted to get started by upgrading packages right so this is the the same project that we left off on months ago i've done nothing to it right so i want the stream to be as realistic as possible sometimes this happens you come back to an old project and i'm coming back to this project after a long time and i want to update the packages right for whatever reason it won't run so i did try to run it just a few minutes ago and i'm not even gonna mess with that error because i know that all my packages are at least you know a few months out of date uh so i'm gonna go through how to how to do an upgrade like like a mass upgrade here so i'm gonna do i'm using yarn uh instead of npm okay so that's just a um an alternative package manager for javascript packages for npm packages so we can do yarn upgrade and then i'm going to give it the flag latest actually let me do upgrade interactive latest i believe that's the that's the command let's see yep that's it all right so i'm going to make this bigger and hopefully the font's big enough i don't know that i could go much bigger and still display things on the screen so this is what happens when you type in when you do yarn upgrade interactive it gives you a little display here that um tells you what packages you're using that are out of date and how out of date it is right so it'll say like this is where you're at this is where you need to go right so and uh it gives you a little like color code right so red means there's been a major update and it's backward incompatible right so that means like there's breaking changes and it looks like all of the stuff it's showing me at the top here is red now there there is more right so as i scroll down it keeps showing me more so you can see a lot of our stuff is it's out of date wow we're almost all into the into the red here right wow i think it just keeps keeps scrolling through so we're not we don't have an endless list of packages it just keeps starting back at the beginning so um yeah see it just keeps scrolling but let's uh let's start somewhere and see what we actually want to update in reality i i really want to try to update everything and then see what happens okay since this is still like a work in progress i'm okay with breaking it right we we're using git so we can always just roll it right back so i can just run now that we've seen it instead of going through and like picking one by one uh what i want let's see better chances i think i'm gonna get out of this so i'm gonna ctrl c to get out of it and then let's go with i'm at let's go with yarn upgrade and i'm going to get rid of the interactive i'm just gonna do upgrade and then i'm gonna say latest and this should do all the upgrading without giving us an option of what to upgrade it's just going to upgrade everything to the latest okay so this is going to take probably a minute or two which is fine because it's going to give me a chance to check the live chat for a little bit now i kind of expect that things aren't going to work when we do this because there's so many breaking changes and that's okay i just now is the time to try to update you you don't want to keep your packages like so out of date all the time right ideally we would have been working on this um and this this whole time in the past four or five months and when a package went out of date we would have updated it okay but that didn't happen so we're gonna try this we're gonna see what errors we get and my plan is if we get if the errors are just so crazy that it's going to take forever then we will just start a new project and basically copy and paste what we need to over since we didn't get that far into this project right wow that was fast i expected that to take longer but that seemed to be kind of it worked well okay um in our package json should be updated so um let's let's check some of these dependencies like all right so our react dependency yeah wow that is is that the latest well okay all right so that did work so let's just try to run it if this actually runs i'm gonna be like really surprised all right so it didn't it didn't run okay um interesting all right well now we got an error we know at least somewhere to start um let's see just checking this out the live chat out just for a second okay um all right so let's check this out in our components workspace dot js i am using visual studio code uh as my my code editor workspace and movie ads workspace.js and we're getting an error on line 111 oh okay so this is a let's see experimental hts configuration oh okay so this is just the config issue so um let's see if it tells us so the experimental decorators option do we have a config i don't think i have a config for my linter right now that was should be yeah babel should be handling this okay so what we've done in this project is we've pulled in a lot of code from another open source project and we're trying to adapt that so this is some of that code from that other project they're using in experimental syntax and so that's where we're getting this this error from uh so what i'm thinking now is at first i thought okay maybe this is just a linting error meaning like our linter linters check your code for errors um and if you're using experimental things you have to tell your linter that like hey i'm gonna use this experimental stuff i know it's gonna look like it's broken but it's not right but now i'm seeing like maybe tonight it's saying parsing error right maybe i'm not actually transpiling that so if you want to use an experimental feature in javascript you need to use a transpiler so you usually it's this this tool called babel and what babel does is it takes your your experimental code and it transforms it into normal javascript that a browser can handle so um if that's the issue then we need to make sure that babel can handle that uh so i do have something in babel for um for decorators right which that's what i i believe that's what we were using yeah uh but for whatever reason this is not working so see let's see let's look at i guess the first thing to look at would be the project i want to see how they set up babel for the uh for the project that i got this code from you might just be able to copy and paste from there and and this would work right so let's do that first so i'm gonna bring over a browser window actually you know i think i have i think i have the project open yep i do there we go let's bring this browser window over so this is the no that's not it i had too many projects open that's sweet okay okay so it's a search for it or i could just check the package jason are we bringing in there we go this is the that's the person that is just doing this so just search for this person on github there we go github knew what i wanted uh okay so let's check out pebble all right that's it that's the same so we got the same babel config make this all bigger team battle config and let's see all right something to chat is saying something to just use okay let's see let's try it let's try it out who is this so uh fred will let's try it out too soon if i use it like this your legacy linter options in your vs code settings they're no longer being used oh interesting yeah i don't want to remove them right now i don't want to deal with that right now okay um all right should we change that and let's do it and it looks like we get a new error is that it i believe we did all right cool so shout out to fred because that seemed to at least get us around like our our linter is still complaining but at least we got past the the air i was afraid that we would have had like similar usage in a lot of other places and it would have been a mess but i guess we don't so that's who we have uh workspace line which is do not use import syntax to configure webpack loaders all right let's check this out and also i think so it has been a while since we've imported this code so it's probably worth checking out this workspace.js file in the uh the repo that we just brought in yeah i mean let's see components workspace uh in case this has been updated since the last time yeah it does it does not look like it's been updated you can see it's june 5th 2017 right so definitely not not updated all right and my lost track of where i put my pomodoro timer that i had set there it is all right cool in about five or six minutes i'm gonna take a break and i'm gonna answer some questions so just hang in there if you got any questions in the chat all right so let's search for i believe i did copy and paste the the error yep oh cool it looks like it's just a linter thing so interesting okay so esl so i guess i could just disable that for a line how do i turn off all right so i'm going to stack overflow this seems to just be a linting thing and so i don't remember how to disable eslint for a line so yes i'm disabled oh cool swedes so we should just be able to eslint yes lent disable line and then put the name of what the rule that we want to disable so let's try that out oops there we go yes oops all right let's see if it is nice all right cool so that that actually did work so good to know you can disable a single line in eslint and just disable that particular rule import and body reorder the top all right that's that's easy so let's go to our index.js which it's kind of weird that i had that in there and it ever worked right all right i might just i might have to deal with this this issue because it keeps popping up and annoying me all right we're getting through we're getting through the errors um unexpected use of history no restricted that's weird i would not have thought that that would give i would give this error but i guess so all right let's see if we just can disable this line as well yes disable i already forget what the what i just typed in the other one was what am i looking for what was this eslint disable disable line here's a disabled line no restricted nice uh i took it to take us back to that uh looks like that the little switch that we put in here and is still not working so we're going to take a little break and i'm going to answer some questions and then when we come back we're going to go back to this decorators decorative legacy isn't currently enabled um we're going to look at this decorator issue all right so i'm going to scroll all the way up to the top and go down through and try to answer some questions as many as i can it looks like i may not have access to the questions at the top so there's been a lot of activity in the chat um so if you ask your question like super early like before the stream started i may not see it uh of course of course this is i'll get a question says can i get an eightdigit salary after doing this course probably not eight digits is pretty it's a lot let's see all right so uh oncon says um a very big um beginner and react js want to learn very enthusiastic about the course uh thanks hunca and i just want to clarify so this this live stream is not exactly a course right so this is um it's it's not meant to be a tutorial that where i'll take you through like from beginning to end and you'll learn concepts and things like that this is a look into um like a real project it's a lot of troubleshooting right like we like we have right now is you know we're trying something that you would normally have to do right like projects get out of date you have to update packages this is what happens when you update packages when you wait too long you try to update packages you get errors the errors are in code that i didn't write myself right which is this happens like really at you know you come into a project you inherit someone else's code right so the idea in the stream is to try to be as close as possible to a real developer experience right because um that way uh there are things that you learn from just doing that you wouldn't necessarily learn from a course and that's i think the value in this in this live stream is when things don't go right and there aren't instructions for how to fix it like what do you do so that's what we're doing here so it's it's not exactly a course but hopefully we'll all learn something as we as we could okay it looks like um there were some discussions and like some questions are getting answered like in the chat by other people so i'm going to kind of like scroll past that um abishak is asking about what's what's best software or ai so artificial intelligence and i'm assuming for for a degree so what's best for a degree software or artificial intelligence um i'm not really sure about that one i don't know enough about it to know what what a better degree would be um i mean i do know if like you don't need a degree to do software work but probably if you want to be on like the cutting edge of ai research like in a university they're probably going to want you to have a doctorate's degree i'm assuming i don't know for sure of course there are companies that are also on the cutting edge of ai research that you wouldn't maybe necessarily need to be a doctor have a doctorate degree to work on it saad says what programming language should i start with new to programming which should i start with really you can start with anything uh javascript is an easy one to start with because it can run in the browser uh so and and you can there's a lot of free resources for it it's a nice one to learn it can run clientside and serverside but realistically if you're just starting out just to learn the programming concepts you can start out with anything and you're going to learn the same the same concepts and then switch to you know whatever you you need to but if you want to go the route of like freecodecamp.org and with those lessons then the first programming language you'll learn will be uh javascript all right cool so my timer my five minute timer is up i'm going to start a new pomodoro session of 25 minutes and we're going to get back to the code i'll come back to the questions looks like there's a ton of questions which is awesome so but i'll come back to those questions after after this next coding session all right so i'm going to copy and paste this part so when i get errors like this oh you probably can't see let me you probably can't see the whole message here so um yeah my face is blocking out the entire message but basically when i get an error message uh i i want to try to copy and paste the part that doesn't have uh reference to my project in particular right because when i search for that nobody's gonna have that right so so the name of the file workspace.js i don't want that and i don't want the um like the location of the error in terms of the the line in my file right but if there's anything that seems generic that's what i want to copy and paste so we'll see in a second what i'm what i've decided to copy and paste so i'm going to leave this linting thing up so i can keep referencing it because i'm sure i'll um i'll forget the syntax again all right but i've what i've pasted is this decorators support for experimental syntax decorators legacy isn't currently enabled right and hey there's a whole medium article on it that's interesting i'm going to open the stack overflow as well because that's usually the most helpful but i'm interested to see what is there's an entire medium article that is titled the exact name of the error that we got so that's awesome i don't know that i've ever had that happen before so let's see what we need to do let's see how old this is first okay so it's from this year it's from may 4th so that's relatively new all right let's do this so let me make this bigger so you can kind of see this but this is great i can't believe whoever wrote it who wrote this patrick so shout out to patrick for writing a medium article all about this error all right so we're going to install this new battle plugin and try to use that instead of the other battle plugin that we had so it's possible since so much time has elapsed that the old battle plugin it just isn't supported anymore maybe that's that's why we're having some issues so we're installing that and now let's bumble plug in i think we have a babble rc so that's let's use this one so there there are two different types of configuration files for for babel so that's why there's two different here so you can have a babble.config.js and the syntax is a little different for each one so or you can have a dot babel rc so i believe we have a dot babel rc yep and we do so in our plugins i i'm guessing i can just get rid of this this transform decorators legacy and all right it doesn't like the um the difference in and the quotation works so here we go what is this incorrect type expected oh it thinks i'm trying to use typescript all right and i believe it did say in that thing to restart so let's try it oh no we still getting the same error yep all right let's see so let me double check this shoot all right let's try let's try the stack overflow one looks like is there no all right so i don't think they actually selected an answer that worked but this one does have the most votes which this seems like the same thing the other thing i can think of is maybe since we use create react app it's not picking up this um babel rc file so let's check that out so um create react app is a great tool to start a react project but it does limit you a little bit in stuff like this um so in in like anything that has to do with a custom webpack uh configs which we're starting to get into like webpack uh stuff here so or at least related to webpack so let's go let's see so i'm just typing in um use dot babble rc with the cr with create react app so when i do um any search i usually try to say i just want stuff from the past year because i don't want out of date out of date stuff there we go using custom let's see what this is this is for a different project but you might have to use cut okay i wasn't sure if we'd have to use this or not but it looks like we might i might have to use customize create react app let me make sure i'm not already using it uh where's our package json yeah all right so let's do that this is actually this is gonna be fun okay so if you need to modify your um create react app um like your webpack config or your babel stuff for create react app there's a plugin you can use called customize create react app actually customize cra right so we're gonna go to their github page so that we can see what we need to add so it does use react app rewired okay which from what i understand react app rewired was like the first way that came out that you could do stuff like this um but it's now customized create react app is kind of sorry this like built on top of that so that's why we need both so let's do this so this potentially could cause problems with create react app projects so only use it if you really need to use it i've had success using it on projects it hasn't like messed up anything before so um but just be aware that you know it can throw things off all right so now that we have that in there let me let me double check to make sure there's we don't need to do anything else usage config overrides all right so we do need a config overrides file and actually oh it doesn't have it i was hoping it would have that would have something in there so sorry what's the name of this file config overrides.js there we go so let's make a config overrides.js file and so we're going to make this just in the root of our project config overrides.js and i'm going to copy and paste just to get us started there we go and a lot of this we don't need like really we i want to add this decorator's legacy and actually disabling eslint is probably not a bad idea since we're getting ldts and errors but this is just in webpack um that's cool whatever is i'll need that and i don't need this all right and so now we don't need these and all right let's see if that'll work i'm gonna manually restart this ah decorate his legacy it's still not working okay hmm i wonder why why are we getting this hmm alright so we have all right it looks like we have everything that we've seen hmm all right let's go back let's get rid of that one and this is about focus okay we haven't looked at this one yet this is just in general how you use babel plugins with create react app so probably not a bad idea to look over this just to make sure that we did it right all right we do we want to use our babble rc okay this might be this might be it so we don't we're not going to pull this in directly we wanted to use battle rc now now it should actually look at our battle rc file oh and i need to change change this all right i can't believe i forgot this okay so before create react app actually starts how did i not see this in the documentation like this is not in here that's kind of weird um okay anyway so uh let's check our package.json file here so we want to run instead of running when our when we run our scripts um instead of running it through react scripts we want to run it through react app rewired and that was that was probably our issue so stuff this may have actually worked before the way we had it and now it so now it will run through react app rewired so let's see on x force override bevel rc is not defined use valve or c is not defined yep you are correct he's battle rushing now it's going to use our new stuff all right we got a new error sweet so let's go back to our code our new error is plugin preset files are not allowed to export objects only functions whoa this is actually a problem in our node modules that's wild that's pretty crazy because like this is it's a node much uh all right let's look this up and let's get rid of some windows while we're at it maybe are we using we're not using a new version of babble all right eight seven six five five you could probably uh what um i hear my kids in the background so that's it they're on their way to school uh there's a question here isn't react native browser just react.js no it's not so what we're trying to do is is say that you can type into a browser window like a like an editor an in browser editor react native code and then have that code actually run and display in the browser right in a little like window in the browser right so we need the code to be converted into something that the browser can understand like on the fly in the browser and so it's it's not um it's not running react native so that it can go in the browser right it's not just that it's it's actually trying to convert the react native code on the fly in the browser the the use case for this is being able to have online tutorials online react native tutorials where someone doesn't have to go through everything necessary to run react native on their local machine and they can just go into the browser and type it in and type in actual react native code and then see what the result would be right um so you're making a thing kind of compiler to javascript yeah basically yeah yeah it's it's like it's going to be like an inbrowser compiler of react native to normal javascript okay sorry i got kind of off track from the coding but that was i think i needed to clarify that otherwise what we're doing is not going to make that much sense okay so it looks like babel preset es2015 okay so this is is um i believe related to like a new way that babel's doing its stuff so like you see that it says at sign babble right so this is the way we should be doing it and instead we're doing it this this older way so we need to switch things up so instead of like for instance a set of reactors should be at battle reactor you need to install uh preset react so that's what we need to do next right now my timer is up though so i'm going to answer some questions okay well you need to pull them out and what um you need to answer some questions and then on our next live stream this is where we'll go so actually if i have time i might try to sort this out before the next live stream um but otherwise then we'll kind of just pick up here with switching over our babel stuff to use the latest and it looks like the reason we didn't see this error before is because our create react app was just completely bypassing our babble rc so we had it in here but it this was never running which i mean that makes sense so anyway let me go to the chat and i'm gonna scroll up to where i left off at i'm gonna try to get as many questions as i can in um so i may not be able to get to all the questions since i do have to start my my normal job so i i'm a software engineer and um so if i don't get your question you can always put it in the comments to the video um and then i can try to answer it later on okay all right so we have a question what is react all right so react is a javascript library um for building apps and so it just it gives you this um it helps mostly with state management and it gives you an html like syntax called jsx that lets you kind of mix together html what looks like html with javascript and create create apps so that's super high level but basically like if you want to make web apps then react helps you do that okay uh dragon stone creation says the fan is noisy can you reduce speed i'm sorry about that you know what i'm right now i'm set up uh in my basement so i believe the uh the heater was running um so apologies for that i i have plans to put up some walls around my work area and uh like soundproof it but hasn't happened yet uh so i'm hoping i can get that done soon and um then the noise won't be an issue so i'm sure you can hear like the garage door shutting now and you could hear my kids coming down so uh not an ideal situation for live streaming but um if i waited for everything to be ideal then i probably would never live stream okay i got a question will you save the stream yeah the stream the stream does get recorded and it's available to watch uh on the free code camp channel and dragonstone creation says if so many packages are outdated in a short time when building a huge project uh won't it be a problem yeah it's definitely a problem uh so i actually yesterday at my my job i went through two of the the apps that were building and i i upgraded all of the packages and i do that pretty regularly because if you wait like we've done here in this project until you get so many things outdated you can see there's a lot of errors that we're working through so it's much easier to say like okay i'm gonna go through and you could just set a time for your project if you really want to like all right once a month i'm going to check or you know whatever amount of time you set you can say i'm going to check the projects if there are some packages that are like really like key packages that you're using you might want to just say every time there's a new release i'm going to read through the release notes see what what is happening if there were less packages we probably would have done that we probably would have read through the release notes on github and seen if there were any breaking changes and then tried to fix those according to the instructions uh that the the um package maintainers set so in this case there was just too much so i thought hey let's just go for it see what happens um also you know this this isn't like um a critical application or anything like that so we could afford to break it okay but yeah in a big app that's like actually in use you'd want to stay on top of this and not let your stuff get out of date um servant says are you coding with expo uh not for this particular project but i do code with expo pretty much every day i do i like expo uh if you're not sure what expo is it's uh it's a set of tools i guess that help you build with react native react native is a way to use react to build mobile apps primarily mobile apps you can build other stuff with it too but the number one use case is android and ios anderson uh silva says i'm a software engineer at google that's awesome i um i did interview with google uh this was probably a year ago and i made it all the way to like when you get on campus and do like uh you know i think it's like five interviews on campus in a day uh but i didn't make it past there so maybe one day i'll interview with him again we'll see but um that's cool i did actually i did a video about it too so if you wanna if anybody's interested in what it's like to interview at google you can check it out uh so i i think it's on the free code cam channel it's also on my channel so uh if you like this stream and want to see more stuff you can check out uh my youtube channel the links in the description uh fred mentioned my node version that i need node 10 plus so i think this is when we were dealing with that that first error that decorator error okay so uh i'm not exactly sure what node version i'm running on my machine right now but i don't know that that would matter would that matter for because i think because we're trying to use it clientside it wouldn't necessarily matter serverside it definitely would luisi's his eunuchs and diamonds are forever actually that's pretty much true eunuchs is everywhere uh cherry vanilla asks what language this is javascript says can we add babble rc to normal react projects oh well i wish i would have seen that earlier because um that that actually was part of our issue is that you can't just add a battle or c to normal recreate react app projects right you have to do customize create react ad so good catch on that one uh charbelle says how will the web editor compile code that's a great question and uh so actually we're using uh service workers so like the compile stuff happens here in our babelworker.js so it basically like we're taking what what happens like on your local machine when you so uh there is a there is a package called react native web which takes react native and converts it into um basically html css and javascript that a browser can use but it does that right locally on your machine so we're taking that and using it in a service worker so that it happens every time you type in something uh in your browser right so like it's it's really cool but that's basically that's how we get it to work is like in place of your local machine we have a service worker running okay uh anderson silva says why are you using a dark theme github uh i just i like dark theme so yeah i have the dark theme github theme so it's i'm just using a tamper monkey script it's if you look up github dark i think you'll um you'll see like instructions for how to do a github dark theme i just prefer it especially when i'm coding like i have the dark theme on my code editor and to switch to github like it's just this flash of bright uh it when you have the white background so it's better to have as for me at least i prefer to have as much stuff as i can on the dark mode easier on my eyes anderson silva says you don't like linux i like linux oh man and fred fred came through with the uh syntax to disable eslint disable next line so thank you for that i didn't see it in the comments but that would have been helpful um i need to get back in the hang of live streaming since it's been a while of like glancing back and forth at the comments um i'll get there uh looks like there's a lot of discussion about in the chat so i'm still i'm scrolling through looking for questions auggie says hello jesse i'm from indonesia i love to watch yuko's awesome thanks thanks for watching uh let's see you have a question wrote ronique not sure how to pronounce that for sure so apologies if i'm mispronouncing that but anyway it says which platform is easier to deploy from react native or expo i have two mobile apps i want to build i am familiar with react and i have created a simple react native app right unclear all right one clear which is better um i think expo makes it uh easier to deploy like in terms of actually deploying to the app store to deploy and update uh so i would check out expo in general when you're using react native i recommend always using expo unless you have some reason like something you need to do in your app that you can't do with expo and even then you could always start with it and then eject but there there are so many expo handles so much for you um that it just kind of makes it a nicer developer experience so definitely recommend using that for react native um that boss says do you have a telegram channel or group i don't think we have a telegram i'm not 100 sure like i definitely don't for the live stream i don't know if free code camp does does anybody know free code camp has a telegram it's possible that we do and i just don't know about it um if i want to be an effective full stack developer should i take a cyber security course to be an effective full stack developer uh i don't think it's necessary to take a cyber security course to be full stack um if that's with what you're into and you want to like specialize in that that's fine it definitely wouldn't hurt you but i wouldn't say it's necessary uh santo says can you please use dart mode for browser dark mode for browser i thought i was using dark mode in my browser i'm not sure santu could you elaborate on that question uh jamal asked would getting a certificate be better than getting a degree because i'm in college and a little lost because of it uh it it depends on what you want to do jamal really um if you want to do like web development then you probably you know don't need a degree you could get and you don't need a certificate either you just need a portfolio you need some experience uh but different different aspects of like coding it it it just depends so like it depends on where you're at what country you're in certain certain places or certain industries still prefer a degree um so you would definitely need to i would need more information let's say to be able to tell for sure right like can you get a good job without a without a degree yeah definitely in in uh some in some type of coding um but if there's something you really specifically want to do then it may be more helpful to get a degree maybe not uh thomas says do you all understand what he's coding i'm new to coding and i have no clue uh thomas don't worry about it like feel free to ask any questions we did just we like we just jumped into this project so um it's it's definitely okay to be a little bit confused like in reality like this is like i'm a little bit lost right we're trying to work through bugs and everything uh so that's uh totally understandable um to be a little lost all right we're just like jumping right back into a project that we haven't some of you have not seen it all before i haven't looked at it in four months so um that's a that's a legitimate uh feeling to have uh let's see just trying to scroll through and find actual questions there's a lot of a lot of comments and stuff uh thomas says uh not a question but just wanted to say thanks for teaching me a lot of concepts that i know now uh your videos have been very helpful thank you i appreciate that um lupendra says is there any relation or similarity between react js and react native uh yeah definitely so um a lot of the concepts are the same um so like the way you handle state uh is the same in react.js and react native uh like the structure of the the jsx syntax is the same uh so uh honestly they're react native and react in terms of how you develop things like from the developer perspective uh of trying to build something with them are very very similar so um you know you're just you're using components to build apps the differences are mainly in what components you can use right so in react you can use what we call like dom primitives so divs spans p tags h h tag stuff like that you can't use that in react native so that's that's probably the biggest difference when you're developing right so there are other tags that come with react native that you would use in in that place but like if whether you start with react native or if you start with react switching from one to the other is not very difficult uh gavin says have you used ionic with react what do you think of it i've never used ionic with react i did use i've used ionic but this was probably like i don't know six years ago i used ionic so i thought it was really cool when i did use it um i probably wouldn't use it now uh ionic is a way to build um mobile apps with javascript so i probably wouldn't use it ionic with react if i wanted to build a mobile app using react i would just use react native so i don't know unless there's some benefit to using ionic with react that i don't know about that's which way i would go if i if i wanted to use java some other javascript framework to build a an app then i probably would go with ionic all right i'm getting down towards the end of the chat so let's see i'm trying to find the questions here okay here's one um why most of programmers are arrogant i don't know i don't know are programmers arrogant um maybe i don't i don't really know maybe that's a psychology question that's not my my area so i hope i don't come off as arrogant if i do i apologize uh there's some uh i saw a few questions about people saying i just joined the stream what are we doing um check out the uh recording and you know go back to the beginning and then uh you'll get a good explanation of what's what's happening uh the i.t thinker says where are you reading the questions from i'm just reading them from the chat so i'm just scrolling down through the chat log and uh and reading the questions decoder says hey i cannot find any of these questions in this chat um yeah maybe it was because i was way back at the beginning of the jet okay is it possible to convert angular to react developer okay so you mean like you you're an angular developer and you want to become a react developer yeah i mean that's definitely possible if the question is is it possible to convert an angular app to a react app then that that would be pretty difficult you would have to like basically rewrite it okay and now the question is which is better angular or react um that it just entirely depends it depends on what you're trying to build um what your team is good with or what you're good with already so that's that's a tough question to answer without any other any other information let's see uh abby scheck says i'm not able to run c plus in windows 10 what should i do i don't i don't have any experience with trying to run c plus in windows 10 so i unfortunately i can't answer your question yeah i don't i don't know the last time i did anything with c plus plus i was in probably in 2009 yeah try 2 000 and no it was before that it was probably 2005. so it's been quite a while since i've done anything with c plus plus so uh sorry i can't can't help with that um how many days to learn react oh i i don't know it depends on how much you already know um how many hours per day you can you can dedicate to it uh jaeger says why is common.js and import syntax in that file like both of them to take truth i'm not entirely sure why they're both in there i don't remember if i did that or if that was some code i copied and pasted in i don't know uh truong says uh could you teach us soft skills um i don't know about in the stream uh but i guess um i could talk about soft skills maybe not maybe that would be like better for a video like on my channel i do more like um recorded video tutorials maybe that would be good but it's hard to teach like i could talk about it but teaching it would probably take like a lot of actual like practice and experience and stuff uh carlos says i just want to say thank you for sharing your time and knowledge keep up the good work oh thanks i appreciate it and thanks for watching um abhishek says can you assure can can you talk about the stability of a job without a degree um yeah honestly i here's the way i feel about job stability with or without a degree it seems like at least so i'm coming from the united states um i live near pittsburgh in the united states so it may not it's it's probably different in other places but it seems to me like like i personally don't count on stability uh in my job so um i i'm always trying to be ready like try to keep my res my resume my linkedin updated try to keep my skills updated and because i don't count on always being able to work at the same place that i'm working uh so you have companies like if you're at a small company small companies got a business or get bought out like all the time right so you're probably not going to have much job stability if you're at a startup or a small company but even large companies they they change things they restructure they you know they fire employees things change so frequently that i just think it's better to assume that no matter what you're probably not going to have much job stability right so my assumption for myself is that i'll probably change jobs every few years um and so i just try to keep myself prepared for that so just making sure that i keep track of like what is the most in demand uh what are the most in demand skills right now what should i be learning like trying to go to conferences and um talk to people like in terms of networking and stuff so that's how i i feel i don't i don't know that having a degree would it like in the software engineering field i don't know that having a degree would make you have more or less job stability in other fields like in general just in life having a degree probably would help you to get more jobs because there's still a lot of jobs out there that they just want a degree no matter what even if it doesn't make sense for you to have a degree but if you want to stick with software engineering once you get to the point where you have some job experience the degree really doesn't matter that much for most software engineering jobs hopefully that answered your question um donae says what is best between an android app or a single page app um that that really kind of depends like um on what what you're trying to do uh a single page app would run in the browser um obviously so like an android app is gonna be a mobile app for the phone so it it's i don't know that it's a question of what's the best in general it would be like what what is the goal like what's the what is the app which is supposed to be doing what's the goal um visager says what's the best place for finding a job online for angular or react um this is the places that i like to go for finding a job online so uh believe it or not twitter is a good place if you like let people know on twitter that you're looking i've had a lot of a lot of good luck with uh people contacting me about jobs on twitter uh linkedin uh there's a place what is it called zip recruiter zip recruiter um i like it because they show a lot of like salary information which is good to know like up front and then stack overflow has a job site so those are probably the places that i would recommend uh looking it but that's coming from somebody in the united states if you're in different parts of the world i don't know how helpful those places are there might be other websites that are better but that's where i would i would check uh amir says react native or flutter uh i haven't used flutter so i don't really think i could give a good comparison i do really like react native i've heard good things about flutter but like i just i don't know enough about it i think to really do a good job of of talking about why you would want to use it or not use it compared to react native jmo vlogs says what's your favorite coding language i like javascript i mean it's it's what i code with most often not that i don't like other languages but if i had to pick a favorite i'd probably say job is good um or do novels says can can we watch a recorded version of the session yep the recording will be available probably just a few minutes after i end this one let's see um all right abby scheck says who gets more salary a person with or without a degree and this is from india so i to be honest with you i don't know very much at all about the job market in india so i don't know that i can answer that question so uh if there's anybody from india that has any experience with that please you know maybe uh throw an answer out here or if you're watching the recording maybe later on in the uh in the comments um pat patsell says uh great job how can i how can i become a good programmer can i do that by reading people's code yeah reading other people's code definitely helps give you more ideas about how to do things but i would say more than just reading it is like actually working with it so like if you see an open source project like i think it's even more helpful instead of just reading it try to actually contribute to it then you really start to understand it like how it works and i think that will help you to become a better programmer because you'll hopefully pick up on all the good ideas that other programmers are having and like start incorporating that into your project i know like i i worked on an open source project recently i did some streams on it on my youtube channel it was the react native async storage package and that package was using typescript and so i had to learn typescript to contribute and now i've incorporated typescript into my other projects so it's like i kind of absorbed some of that and and just you know it's made my code better by contributing uh to this other project uh let's see i gotta make sure i keep track of time so i can work all right so we'll do a few more questions uh before i wrap this up um let's see he had a job as a junior dev for eight months and left on good terms i know front end with ujs would you learn back end to go full stack or just look for another frontend position um honestly like if i needed to find a job i needed money i would just look for a frontend position and like try to learn as i go uh if like i really wanted to go full stack and i didn't need a job right away then yeah maybe learn learn back end but so it kind of depends on your situation um can you talk about coding bootcamp thank you i have never done a coding bootcamp so i don't know that much about it my wife did do a coding boot camp and she loved it and she got a job right away um so she did the flat iron school boot camp so i think boot camps can be really helpful but you got to make sure you're going to a good boot camp so do your research first and probably like see you check out where the people are working that have gone through that boot camp right because that's the proof of whether or not the boot camp is gonna get you ready for a job like have people already gone through this boot camp and gotten jobs uh and don't just look at what the boot camp says like look at their people who've actually gone to the boot camp you know and like maybe try to reach out to him on twitter or something and say like hey you did this boot camp like what did you think of it um jmovlog says where's the best place to find conferences talks networking opportunities um let's see you can uh so this might be a weird way to look for conferences but if you go to papercall.io you can search for uh conferences and events and you can search by keyword so you could type in like javascript to react and you could find a bunch of conferences and events um uh there i think it's just tech conferences that they have on there so that might not be a bad way to to check it out andre says i'm assuming this is the question is do i really need to use redux in all react projects you definitely don't need redux in all your react projects so i i rarely use redux in my react projects i only use redux if it gets to the point where it's really the state management starts to get very complex and i feel like it could be helpful to use redux let's see xeno says for half hour i just listened and watched slot of nothing um yeah the at the end of the uh stream we just do question and answer so um yeah so if the coding is the first part of the stream second part is question and answer uh cyberworld asked to when do you start your coding coding is the first so like we're done with the coding at this point so um uh mulik says can you tell me the learning curve to be a front end dev for example html css js likewise yeah i don't know i don't know exactly how to explain the learning curve i guess but yeah like that's that's the way you'd want to go right like if you want to be a frontend developer start with html css javascript then uh maybe check out some sort of framework um like once you learn html css and javascript i would like start building stuff don't wait to actually build stuff and then then you'll start to get a feel for like oh you know i'm doing this this thing over and over again maybe there's some library that does it for me right that's kind of like um i think you kind of naturally need to branch out or want to branch out and learn other libraries and things okay yeah zeno um so i'm yeah i'm not going to code anymore for this stream so like for the first hour we code and then after that we uh do question and answer all right all right last question and then we'll be done it says why react and not view um i i work with react i know react i don't know of you i mean that's really it like i so i work with react at my job and i've been working with react for a while so um that's what i'm good with so that's what i'm gonna work with um if you use a good framework as well i haven't done anything with it but i've heard good things about it so but yeah that's why we're doing we don't react stuff you wouldn't want to watch me do a view stream because i'm no good with you i don't know anything about it all right so anyway thank you so much for watching i'm going to try to stream more regularly um now and get back into it and um yeah so i'm trying to put us today friday yeah so have a great weekend hopefully i'll stream again next week and uh yeah if you want i don't know if i have this up on github yet yet or not i was going to say if anybody wants to try to like load this and work on these bugs feel free but i'm not sure if i have this up on github if i do have it up on github the link will be in the description uh if not i'll try to get it up there and throw the link in the description at some point soon so anyway until next time have a great weekend thank you so much for watching
