hey everybody welcome to live coding with jessie i'm jesse and today i have katie here with me because it is administrative professionals day and she is my administrative professional so i just wanted to have her on and say thank you thank you very much she's awesome and she handles all of my travel arrangements when i want to go to conferences and does a great job because i don't understand how all the credit card system works here there's a lot of paperwork um also she's awesome she's like right outside my door her desk is right there so she can hear me streaming and uh she's super fun and nice so thank you thanks jesse i've been listening to the show now for a year outside of his door i feel like i've learned a lot and um i could maybe do some coding but i really couldn't um you could do it but i got a nice plant from everybody that i think i could keep alive i'm gonna try really hard it does look nice yeah a geranium which likes sun and water so i don't know i'm gonna try but it's beautiful so jesse works with a good team here um he's smart when he shows up he works from home a lot so we don't get to see him or sometimes he'll be in here for hours and he'll have his door closed and we won't even know he's here so when he does emerge he's he's no thank you for watching me i feel like a star even though i've been on here for 30 seconds so all right do your thing jesse awesome thanks bye everybody all right so yeah so katie is really awesome and uh she was a good sport about coming on um coming on the show and uh yes you don't get to see my the rest of my team here but we do we have katie and um brian sizemore is also he he works um as a developer as well and he's just an awesome guy and my boss tom and liz doesn't work directly with the programming but um she she works on a lot of our marketing campaigns and there's just so many awesome people in our department we got video people photographers graphic designers uh writers so there's a lot of other people that provide content uh and support for what i'm doing so uh it's just i don't know it's kind of cool maybe i'll make more of an effort to get them involved um but uh since today was administrative professionals day i thought i'd bring katie on and um all right so let's get started today is going to be a little bit different than normal um because we're going to work on an old site i try to do like more new stuff we try to keep our packages up to date we even use some beta stuff but i need to make an update to something i built about two years ago so i thought i'd start right from the beginning and i'll go through um cloning the repo installing all the packages and starting it up that may be helpful for those of you that are new to github and git and looks like we have someone new uh vish vishaka vishaka welcome let me know if i'm i'm not pronouncing that right um so just uh joined free code camp about a week ago and i'm already in love it's awesome oh so glad you like it and i'm glad you're uh you're watching so you know see a lot of other other people are saying hello so um yeah so we're gonna do if you're new to the stream which there are some new people here i break things up and i do 25 minutes of coding where i i kind of talk through what i'm doing and then i take five minutes and i answer questions in the chat we do another 25 minutes of coding and then at the end the whole rest of the stream is dedicated to question and answer and um so if you have any questions please put them in but be patient i will get to all the questions eventually um let's see robotvilla says hi and that is let's see i believe robot villa is the company of um i can't remember if you don't mind what was your name i know because i saw you on the momskin code thing and i follow you on twitter and instagram why am i blanking out anyway um thanks for watching francesca that's it francesca all right uh so sorry i can't believe i forgot your name i see your stuff all the time um all right cool who has harshit's in here all right let's get this let's get started with this and then i'll come back to the chat so let me show you my screen and you can see i'm starting out with just my terminal right so i'm in my projects folder and i want to get this project which i'll bring over i want to get this project onto my computer so you can see most of this was from two years ago i have made some minor updates since then i want to go to the clone button and i want to just copy i have my ssh key set up so i copy this if you don't have your ssh keys then you'll want to use the https link and my github looks dark in the background this is just a theme that i have running on top of the regular github so um don't worry if yours doesn't look exactly like this um who else inn is here hey anna how's it going and jeff asked if we were going to do ngrok today um i'm not going to do engrop today because the site i'm working on you have to have a login for so even if i shared it with you you'd still need a login so um it wouldn't really work so oops forgot a step let's go um we need to do git clone so you have to have git installed on your machine already which i did do a video about installing um git and cloning a repo so if you want to check out like how to do that um the video is on my youtube channel the link is in the description uh so we do a git clone and then i paste in that um that address that i just got from github and we hit enter and now wow that was really fast so really really fast uh so now we should have a folder called fus bulletin in our projects folder so let's do an ls just to see everything and we'll see f fus bulletin so now we're going to change directory cd into fus bulletin and we're going to do i'm going to open this in visual studio code so if you have the command line stuff set up for visual studio code you can just type in code and then in this case i'm just going to type a period and that's going to open up everything in this folder in visual studio code so after this opens up we'll be able to see our folder structure and we're going to go into our let's go into our package json first just get an idea of what we're using in this project so we had do have this running with gulp so gulp's not quite as popular as it used to be everybody's using webpack now but you may remember gulp and let's see we are using some babel stuff so we're able to use some of the newer things and looks like we're deploying this with flight plan awesome so not really a very complex project and actually i can update this because um sorry it's really hard to type and talk at the same time so evidently i copied like the starter for this project from a previous project and i never bothered to change the package json so we'll change that now that'll be one of our changes now our next step is going to be to actually load these packages and this was so far back that i hadn't even used yarn yet so you notice in most of my projects i use yarn instead of npm and i want to view the integrated terminal so we could do it all right here in one screen so if you are using visual studio code this is a super useful tool i want to split this as well because we're going to run um where i can actually run it in one screen once we get this going so let's do uh npm oops npm install that's going to install all these packages and the dependencies for all of those packages and it's going to put it in a folder it's going to be called node modules so we'll see that appear soon and then we're going to be ready to run the project locally and start working on it it looks like is my audio out of sync with the video it looks like it to me okay now it looks now it looks okay again it looked like it went out of sync for a second okay cool yeah let me know if um i i had some problems yesterday but i was on a different machine with the audio and video getting out of sync as you can see this is doing its thing sometimes it takes longer than others depending on how many packages and what packages you're bringing in and while that's going i'm gonna go to the chat um just so we you know make good use of our time and i'll i'm going to look through the chat see if there's any questions i can answer uh while we're waiting uh tovo says just signed up two weeks ago awesome awesome i hope you're you're enjoying free code camp and thanks for watching the stream as well oh cool harshit who is in the himalayas says the time is is 7 pm there so it's a good time to stream oh michael said i missed the intro who was that if you missed the intro you can always go back and watch it again but i had one of my coworkers katie here for the intro so if you didn't catch that you can go back and catch it's just the first you know maybe two or three minutes of the stream john doe said can a newbie do this knowing nothing about coding i'm going to do my best to explain everything so if you feel like it's a little bit beyond what you can do now you still may be able to get something out of this stream uh you know ask questions and you may be able to pick something up i will say though for this stream when i built this i used you know the techniques that i knew best at the time uh that was two years ago so even if it was cutting edge two years ago which i don't even think it was cutting edge then um it it's still outdated today so the techniques and things that i use to solve problems will still be helpful no matter what but i don't think um like the actual code and stuff may be a good example of what to do all right it looks like it worked so you see now we have our node modules folder which has lots of stuff in there so so awesome that npm which is node package manager handles all this for us can you imagine having to manually load all this stuff it would make me not want to do this job if i had to do that for every project so that's in there and we should be able to use gulp watch i believe that's the command yep all right gulp watch so now it'll say that we can view our project locally at localhost 3012 or 3012. so let's try that out you know let me move let me move some things around so we get a better uh idea what's what's going on okay and it already opened for us so i think we can well let me see okay so let me show you what what exactly we're going to be changing and if we see anything that's weird along the way we can change that we can refactor depending on how much time that we have um but right now we have these categories and we need an extra category here so it's going to be a somewhat of a basic change but we also need to make sure that our data gets categorized properly as well so we're going to i guess temporarily miscategorize something just to make sure we can get it to show up so this is actually pulling the live data from a wordpress installation we're using the wordpress api for that even though this is you know our local version this project by the way is a private repo so that's why i did not include a link to the code and we have worked on a react version of this before we just didn't finish it so once we finish that we'll be replacing this old jquery version with react all right so we're just to give you a visual on what we're going to do we'll be working in this area now let's go to the code and let's go at our app one good thing to know uh if you ever get like a premade project structure don't do any work directly in the dist folder make sure you're doing it in the app folder or you know whatever other folder but just not dist i once made the mistake when i was first learning angular a long time ago which i didn't i didn't learn it well that i did a ton of work in the dist folder and then it all went away because the disk folder will get rewritten um you know when you when you go to build it so uh that was very disappointing when i was just beginning and um i it took me a long time before i even attempted it again because it was just so devastating uh for me uh let's see all right this the uh the stream um just dropped for a second so i was worried it looks like it's back again so let's go into our app folder and i guess i'm going to go into index i think i do have this oh and just everything is in the index page all right so we'll scroll through and i'll go through a little bit i want to let you see my code uh so one of the the major things about the stream that i think is helpful is to let you all see my mistakes and so this is an example of i don't want to say mistakes but work that i did two years ago that worked at the time i was proud of it at the time but now it's embarrassing to me so you all a lot of you have seen my work that i do now so this is a good comparison of where i was two years ago so this part up here is just doing some checking for for different browsers and basically telling people to update their browser if they have an outdated browser we're using a service called auth 0 to log people in so that's where all this is coming in and then the rest here should should look like basic html to you also here's our body tag right and so now we have everything in here um that we'd have you know normally we have headers you know unordered lists divs all right we have our nav component right so now we're getting closer to where we need to be so in our so here's our side nav and here's our filters it says filters go here interesting all right i assume that i hardcoded these in but i guess i was a little smarter than that and i'm actually getting categories from wordpress and putting them in there interesting okay just a quick overview of the other things i have in here before i i try this other thing that might make this a lot easier you can see we have i have like this loading spinner thing here and uh i use materialize css as a framework so if you're familiar with bootstrap materialize is the material design version it's not it's not affiliated with bootstrap but what bootstrap does materialize does but with material design styles so got the spinner from there and we have some containers where we're actually putting in posts using all jquery for that and we have some modals that open up with some forms in them for people to submit bulletin announcements okay um yeah so there's the markup it's not there's not a whole lot with the markup because we're loading so many things i mean really the the modals and the forms take up uh half the markup on the page uh everything else is being pulled in through with javascript all right so our app.js and yeah let's let's shrink this up and let me make this a bit bigger i'm afraid i might be too small all right so our login stuff was there we're doing some filtering based on dates and i just want to show you maybe one example of how i'm loading things in i have some different buttons that change the the layout as you can see we're using fetch so i just made a wrapper around fetch called get json right but we were using uh the fetch api so even back then but i believe we were using polyfills with it as well and so you see we're getting data here from wordpress and then we're pending and this this actually is is right where we're going to be working in so you see we're getting categories we're getting all the categories and we are appending lis for each category so some of the categories are already hard coded in there so you can see like current bulletin take action and all are hard coded and then everything else gets added after that it gets appended so you could see you know here's those first three and the rest of them get added on now since i did it like this what this means is i should be able to just change the data in our wordpress installation and then it should come over and automatically be added into there so i think we'll try that let's see oh okay i see so this was just starting this uh let me explain this a little bit i don't know i guess it's not that obvious if you're just starting out so what we're doing here we're using jquery that's where this dollar sign comes in and we're selecting the element on the page with that has the id of mobile demo so that's kind of a bad id i probably just had it left in there from some example that i copied and then we can use jquery.append to add something to that element so what i'm doing here is i'm using template literals so when we have this little back tick that's template literal syntax so when you do that think of it like you're making a string in javascript so if you were to use a single or double quote same thing except when you use template literal syntax you can have multiline strings and it still works uh normally that will give you problems uh but you can you can also um put in some little snippets of javascript in the middle of this without having to use like the plus sign to concatenate it all together so it's really great for templating which is basically what i used here so instead of using something like handlebars which would have been really popular when i did this um as for a templating engine i just made my own templates using template literals and then adding in with jquery to insert them into the page so down here is where i actually get the categories so you see we've we got the data right and then we're doing a dot then so right we get the data then we want to pass the data in right so now data is available to us under the name the variable name of data right so inside there we have a function where we're taking data so we use we're using um a for loop so we're going to say let and let is uh es6 so our es 2015 so if you're used to using their so var um you can use let in its place and it has what's called block scoping so you're you're less likely to accidentally um overwrite things if you use let and const all right so there's a there's a lot of other good things in there but i'm not going to take time to explain them all right now if you'd like to know more about using let and const instead of there please ask it in the in the live chat and i'll be happy to explain it later on but this means basically we're looping through every category that's come to us and data right and that's json format so json format um correct me if i'm wrong but it's basically an array of objects so it's going to loop over each object and it's going to grab to work we're calling it category right so each one is going to be category and we're using let's see category id equals category's name what have i made i'm i must have made a variable somewhere called categories all right in any case when we get to here we are appending onto um the elements that has a class of filters were appending and so this is i believe a drop down we must have a drop down somewhere as well um so we're adding all the categories category id category name and since we didn't i didn't show the drop down let's just skip that and we'll go to where we have our mobile demo and we're appending li's so for each category we get the id we get the slug in the name from that data and we create an li with an a tag inside so link tag with this data all right and once that's all created then we go on and we add some other things um let's see do we add yeah we do add quite a lot uh but we're not gonna talk about that right now so i'm not gonna go into that um but that's how we're building up the template we're just taking that same mobile demo and we're appending things onto it and you can see this is how we're we're pulling in javascript into our our string right we have that template literal this is obviously a string but then once we get to here we have a dollar sign and a curly bracket and then now we're back in javascript land and we've actually put um some data in there so this part is not a string and then we close that curly bracket and we're back into string land and you can see inside this we can even use double quotes and it doesn't mess anything up right just like you can use single quotes inside of double quotes and it doesn't mess things up okay so let's let's do something now because i think i've been explaining for quite a while so let's make something happen i am going to go on my other screen into wordpress let's see there we go okay let me add on my other screen all i'm doing is just logging into a simple wordpress installation and i'm just going to add another uh category in here and hmm i don't remember what that category is supposed to be so let me check my phone uh because i'm i'm not currently logged into my email on my computer so it'll be faster to check out my work email on my phone see the email i got during yesterday's stream to see what the category is supposed to be called council minutes okay right so let's add a category called council minutes all right so i've added a category called council minutes and now i'm gonna empty i'm going to empty the cache so i have a lot of caching going on so uh let me empty that first and then when i refresh let's see if we have it no i also i have so much caching going on so let's inspect this and let's go into application and we're going to go in here to local storage and you see we we have some stuff huh maybe we don't have it okay normally i was storing a lot of stuff in local storage am i missing this let's just do a hard refresh hey council minutes we have council minutes but we have no matching posts yet so my timer just went off when we come back i'm going to try to add a post here and see if it will in fact show up here and where's my timer i lost it there we go it's over here oops sure we'll take a short break when we come back uh we'll do a little bit of testing and then we'll go over how to um we'll go over how to save this commit uh send the commit to github how to get our dist folder ready and then how to push that up to our production server so we'll do all that on the stream so you'll get the full range of from cloning the repo all the way up to updating your production server alright so let me try to find where i left off all right joe matthews says pomodoro technique 25 5 25 yeah so i do i do 25 five and then so i do four 25 sessions with fives in between but then on that last one i do a 10 10 minute break uh realistically though it's it's rare that i get four uninterrupted sessions and to be able to even get to that 10minute break but that's how i use it says will you be using some kind of framework um for this one uh not exactly so in terms of the styles we're using materialized css uh but i i've basically done everything else from scratch using jquery so all the routing is jquery um like i said the templating is done using template literal syntax so it was way more work i think than it had to be like had i been had i known react at the time i think i could have done better and potentially done this faster in react so if if you want to see any of the code for this let me know or if you want me to explain how i did any of this let me know i'll do my best to remember uh jason asked if i attended any web conferences in ohio i have not attended any conferences in ohio yet uh so jason's from columbus yeah i'd love to find out if there are any good conferences going on and go i mean because they'd be pretty close i'm i've attended conferences uh syntax con in south carolina um i attended that twice i spoke at november in nashville i will be at the google i o conference in pittsburgh which is soon and i will be speaking at pittsburgh tech fest which obviously is in pittsburgh as well and i'm attending revolution conf that's in virginia beach and i believe that's next month so those are where i'll be uh i i frequently apply to speak at different conferences so i never i never know exactly what conferences i'll be at and so i find out whether i'm accepted or not i should ask is that the same bulletin that was half written in react yes yes it was and i just never got a chance to keep working on it because other projects came up and we're still working on those uh this vishaka says i haven't attended a live stream before what's the goal here um so yeah basically uh the goal is just i i i wanted to give everybody a glimpse of what my daytoday work is like especially i wanted everyone to be able to see how many mistakes i make and how i try to work through that i i especially thought people who were beginners may feel intimidated by watching a lot of the normal tutorials because people don't make mistakes in tutorials they're edited as they should be right they're to the point but that's not really how it works at least not for me i mess up a lot and sometimes i try things and it it doesn't work and we gotta i just gotta try something else uh sometimes we don't have time to do like the ideal solution so we just do the good enough solution and we're still able to you know release websites that do their job they function well and that people are are happy with so that's kind of the goal of it so it's not exactly a tutorial although i do hope people learn and i learn a lot from you all so it's a little bit more interactive than a tutorial um but it literally is really like my real life job you know if i wasn't streaming this i would be working on this right now for my job so i don't rehearse things because i want you to see as close as possible what it's really like the only difference is i don't narrate what i'm doing to myself when i'm alone but other than that it is pretty much exactly uh what i would usually be working on and how i would be working on it okay um let me i'm just gonna take note of where i'm leaving off at and let's go back so if i didn't get to your question yet i'm sorry i will get to it after this next pomodoro session so let me let me go through real quick i just want to see if anybody wanted to see any part of the code who knows okay um let's go back in here now and oh i know i i wanted to take one of the posts and i want to add a category to it let's update and uh where's our stuff let's move this over here okay um let me do a hard refresh yay okay so we can get it to show up now i want to very quickly get rid of that because that doesn't look good when we have two uh categories wonderful no if i update again great no matching post all right so it works right we get the functionality that we want and i think i just i don't understand why i had options for a drop down in my code but i don't know where that would be um here i'm thinking maybe maybe that was something that i wanted to add and i ended up not adding you see where here where it says filters i do not understand see i mean there are some parts of this code that i just i have no idea what i did i don't remember it this is a good case for making sure to uh document what you do really well hmm i'm interested to see let's just take a minute just to see if we can find this filters oh of course it's it's gonna be like this um let's see if i can go with there we are okay so it looks like the only options i'm seeing here let's go through see if we can find it here okay we have years and that's it okay so whatever i was trying to do here evidently i i never did or it's just somewhere where i i have no idea where it is so i'm just gonna leave that alone that's sort of the the dangers of dealing with this old code is uh of accidentally changing something like right now i could say oh it looks like i'm not using this at all maybe i'll just delete it and then not realize that i've broken something so i'm just going to leave it in there and i'm not going to attempt to refactor this because as i mentioned before we have kind of halfway rebuilt this and react so no no sense in fixing this up so this works we've saved it now let's go back to our terminal and let's do let's update our dist and uh so dist is short for uh distribution so basically what it's going to do is go through everything in this app folder and it's going to basically we'll do what we tell it to do in gulf so we have a few things running in gulp uh we are going to take all that es6 syntax and change it to es5 syntax so uh older browsers can handle it it's going to automatically take our sas and change it to regular css and then it's also going to automatically minify our code and i don't remember i may actually have it set up to concatenate some files as well i can't remember if i did that on this project okay so that's what it's going to do all that for us and it's going to put it into that dist folder and that's the folder that we want to run on our server so that when users go to our site you know they're given these nice tidy bundles of minified code that is regular css and es5 javascript and it'll be you know usable by as many people as possible so that's what we're going to do and in this case i have it set up so that my command to run all that is just gulp dist if you'd like to see the gulp file where i set this all up let me know i just know you know gulp isn't as popular as once was so i'm not sure if anybody's even interested just had a question gulp is more or less the an equivalent of webpack yeah it's well webpack is different but it does do a lot of the things that gulp did so i don't want to say that they're the same exactly but for the purposes that people use it for it's it's it is very uh similar okay um now let's do a get status to see what's changed actually i forgot we only changed our package json didn't we because we didn't have to make any changes that is true okay well anyway um i still want to go through this process just to show you how we would update it so let's do that so we're going to first do a git add and then we're going to do a git commit now you can combine those steps if you want to by doing commit am but in this case i separated them out and we're just going to use m for message so now we can write our message and we're going to say update package info and i'm going to hit enter so now we have our commit and now we can go get push um a lot of times you can just do get push and it will work but if you're working on another branch for different things you got to do a little bit more so let's just do the full command now so we're going to go origin master so we're going to push master which i we may only have one branch actually right now so doesn't really matter but now everything is on github so we can go back to that github page and give it a little refresh and we should see our update already yep 40 seconds ago we updated these two files so there's our update and if this wasn't a private repo you all could see that and you know work on it on your own i would say at least 90 percent of the projects we work on are in public repos so this is just one of those weird ones where this was before i realized how to use uh environment variables so there are like api keys and stuff in this project that's why it's private and now we're going to use flight plan and if you're not familiar with flight plan let me just explain it a bit flight plan will take your code and copy it over so it will it will look at your code it'll look at your your get files to make sure of what exactly changed and it will only copy over those files that changed to your server all right and then it will even run commands on your server that you tell it to to make sure that those files get in the right folder so it helps with deployment and it's it's kind of it's very simple simple to set up so that's what we're gonna we're gonna try i say try because it doesn't always work so let's do fly production so the reason that we did our dist first and uh committed that was because actually you know what i didn't even need to do that i don't know what i'm thinking i did want to demonstrate it but actually i don't we don't actually commit or package json we don't push that to the server so this is just an example of what we would do but the reason if you're using flight plan you do need to make sure that you are tracking your disk folder in github which you don't usually need to do but because flightplan uses git to determine what has changed if you're not tracking with git your dist folder it won't it won't work it won't know what's changed unless somehow you build your stuff on the server afterwards but in this particular server that this is running on uh we don't have access to node uh so we can't we can't do npm stuff on it um so anyway basically you know what it's done is it's connected to our server it's moved the folder to the root and then it's run some commands right to copy our dist folder over to our bulletin folder which is this this is where that uh runs from this is the home directory for our bulletin site um and that's it that's that's everything that's done so this could have been done by going into like filezilla and logging into the server and then manually copying and pasting things or dragging and dropping things you know which is fine it would take you know an extra minute or so but this end up this in the long run ends up being much faster you know we just run it and then check back a minute or two later make sure everything worked um and i can run let me go to the site franciscan university slash bulletin uh you can try to go there if you want but like i said the um it's it's login only so you won't be able to get in unless you're you're a hacker or something and try to get in in which case let me know how you did it uh yeah so that works let's check yep there should not be any posts so that's what we want there we go uh just to show you some cool things that i did with this uh you know again this is all just jquery we have updates for our views we have a print view we have a did i get rid of classic view i think i did i used to have a classic view but i think i got rid of it uh it was it was kind of a joke because i made it look just like the old microsoft word bulletin that everybody got emailed uh we actually we have a live search feature um so if i type in the wake stuff we can get you know the same thing so it does the search um so there's a lot of the same functionality that we have with some of the react stuff we've been doing um we have it here as well oh that's a little ui bug isn't it interesting huh wow okay so i don't know what i did but evidently if you click the right things you will mess up the z index of these okay and this is just um you know regular form just do like a submit via fetch so we don't get a page refresh or anything and this is an upload the file uploads on the back end are just with a basic uh php file upload that i that i wrote um yeah we have some emails get that are automatically sent and i believe am i using google i was using google docs for that i think i ended up switching and using sendgrid or something like that so um anyway so that's it let me check my time i think i'm probably almost out of time for this pomodoro session a lot 10 minutes left all right let's i'm gonna go back to the questions see what questions you all have you know it's basically mission accomplished for this one uh it ended up being a lot easier than i thought it would be i didn't think it would be that hard but um i basically i built it the way i thought it should be built so in my mind i'm thinking like why did i hard code this stuff i should have just made it automatically pull from wordpress that's what i thought before i looked at the project then when we looked at it and i realized that is exactly what i did i just thought hey i'm a pretty smart guy two years ago so i did take the time to do that um all right i don't remember where i left off let me see oh okay um anna says jesse how was your weekend not bad i went to a wedding and that was fun but i wasn't feeling really well so i was super tired uh so the kids had a lot of fun um you know dancing and eating lots of cookies and stuff um got to see a lot of my family uh so that was uh that was fun and then all the all the little ones so all my my cousins are all having kids now and they're all around the same age so it was really cool you know i have all these little ones running around at the wedding and playing together and uh so that that was really fun uh but unfortunately i didn't get to stay as long as i wanted to because i was just so exhausted um but yeah it was um it was a good time good time this weekend uh thanks for asking anna how was your weekend i'm trying to i'm trying to scroll down and find questions michael says you were looking for ways to make your streams better katie is a step in that direction yeah katie is awesome i don't know if she'd be comfortable being on the stream all the time though but actually let me know would would you all like it if i actually had someone in here maybe someone even who's learning how to code uh that would be here with me and would ask questions and i don't know i that's definitely possible i mean i have another chair so i could have at least one other person and yeah if you think that's something that you might like seeing i'll definitely try it out i know there there are some students who may be interested and some of my coworkers who may be interested as well if i'm streaming from home i might be able to get my wife to do it she is learning to code as well she usually doesn't like to be on camera but maybe she'll do it let's see um vishaka says thanks uh so the stream should be watched in continuation she was saying thanks to phoenix so this live stream should be watched in continuation you know what they can but there are quite a few of them so it may be really difficult if you do try to watch a lot of them i definitely recommend watching them on twotime speed because it's just so much to get through so don't don't feel like you you have to go through step by step to understand things uh there's i don't think you do necessarily um and i think it's just way too much material for a person to reasonably be expected to go through i mean we have almost a year of i need to look up when my first live stream was because we're coming up on a year of live streams uh so it might be fun to actually acknowledge that when the day comes if i haven't already missed it but there are you know well over i believe 100 hours of live streams for sure michael says wow is that on uh geo's uh geocities no it's not that old how many people had an old website on uh on geocities or was the other one like angelfire how many had a site on one of those like free hosting plans back in the day i definitely did harshit says this has sentry error as well i saw the raven script tag yeah yeah so i do have some error stuff error reporting um with sentry on this so um i i was pretty thoughtful about all what i was doing on this i'm i mean i i liked it when it came out but you know i i just think i don't know i've i've come a long way at coding so there's so many things that i think now like i could have done better um but you know at the time it was it was probably the best thing i had ever made i just said the site looks great um yeah it's stylewise it's not really that far off from a lot of the newer things that we've been doing uh don xavier says hey uh and we all have our treasure trove of depression code it's implied and nice to take a walk on memory lane sometimes yeah yeah it is fun it's fun to check out the the old code hey john hanson's here hey john how's it going all right michael said the um i thought of was relatively new um to like the four of loops so you're forward thinking even then yeah i i mean i did use some newer stuff and i had the um the babble like transpiling set up so that i could use that john says is it worth it to reconfigure a site that uses jquery and then change it all to javascript i guess it depends on what the site is and what your goal is for the site sorry i'm a little tired i'm i'm trying to quit drinking coffee for like a week just to like try to reset my tolerance because i was getting to the point where i could drink coffee all day and still be tired um you know i could drink an espresso and go to sleep so i think that's a problem so i'm trying to just cut it off but i am quite sleepy um let's see yeah so john i i don't know i mean if for this site in particular if i wasn't already halfway through rebuilding it again in react it might be worth it to try to change it um to use vanilla javascript but i don't know i mean it works right now with the jquery so is it if it's working and it's quick it performs well and it gets the job done you know maybe there's not really much reason to want to change it uh from jquery to vanilla javascript i mean there's still a lot of jquery out there and there are a lot of jobs for being able to use jquery like there has to be right because so many sites use it so not that there's i'm not trying to say that jquery is wrong in every situation i definitely don't want to use it with react but with other sites you know it's a valid option harshit said what is the need of uh push if you added the post in wordpress yep you were entirely right harsh and i did not need to push anything the only thing that we actually changed was that package.json file so in terms of functionality i did not need to push anything uh glad i made those changes to package json though because i i did want to go through the process of it at least for for those of you that are learning git uh jason said i saw one of your sites was for college in ohio assumed he might have been from ohio oh yeah i currently live in steubenville ohio um i actually live like right outside of city limits but it's still the address is still stevenville uh i am from west virginia though uh right at the very like northernmost part of west virginia near pittsburgh um but i i now live um just across the border in ohio francesca says what no talking to yourself yeah all right full disclosure here i do sometimes talk to myself when i'm coding but it's usually when i get upset and then i say things that i might not say around my children so uh that's when i will i'll talk to myself or if i do something really awesome and it works then i may like uh have exclamations of joy and uh usually like jump up out of my seat i throw my headphones down and i like go out the door and look for somebody who i can tell and uh usually i find somebody who i'm like trying to explain what i did with the code and they have no idea what i'm talking about they're but they're usually really awesome about it and congratulate me anyway michael says you don't talk to yourself when working on a problem that's when i work the best because of the stairs from coworkers it's why i'm better at working on my own but because of the stairs from coworkers that's why i'm better working my own yeah you know what you are right whenever i'm streaming and i get to talk through step by step what i'm trying to do i often find like problems in my logic or in my code so maybe i should start talking to myself more even when i'm not streaming it might not be a bad idea i have had my kids like sitting with me when i'm coding before and i'll try to talk it through with them and it's helped me and i found like errors that way oh michael says just found out about the bracket pair colorizer extension for vs code oh yeah you know what i heard about that um that's a really cool plugin so if you've ever tried to figure out what's going on with your brackets like which brackets go together and if you've missed one or not that can definitely be very helpful oh yeah harshit says i got in already yeah you did i don't remember how you did it though harshit um and i remember i wasn't that worried about it because we were gonna switch it over to react and then we didn't have time uh phoenix says oh yes totally so i had asked like would it be cool to have other people on the stream like right here with me in my office if phoenix said yes totally you can also do pair programming it will add a whole new dimension to these streams yeah that i haven't thought about that i guess that would be cool i'm gonna yeah i'm definitely gonna think about that i'll talk to some people around here to see if i can get somebody like physically in in the office i don't talk to my wife see if she's interested and then you know maybe i can do some remote pair programming as well this shaka says new coder seems like a pretty good idea but you did a great job of answering questions oh cool thank you yeah um cool yeah i mean most likely most of the streams will still just be me because it's a lot to ask for somebody to take this much time out of their day but you know maybe occasionally i could you know have somebody else on the stream let's see all right anna says my weekend was great i walked in the force with my family oh awesome you know and i think i saw your uh your instagram post a picture of the forest it was it was really beautiful um cool thanks for sharing uh okay phoenix says may 3rd 2017 was the first stream okay cool off to see because i did start streaming on my own channel first but if we want to count like the first free code camp stream you know maybe we'll do that because if i check my we may already be past the date when i started on my own channel that's cool i need to check and see how many videos i've done and like how many hours it's been because i i have no idea john hanson says i had an old yahoo website css tables anyone oh yeah for sure i remember doing the layout and tables iframes uh john hanson says so gamer noob says if it isn't broken right like it isn't broken don't fix it john hanson says true though i'm not against jquery i do find reading javascript code um it makes more sense to me than trying to read some old jquery code i've written yeah that's that's true i mean if you do write in jquery anybody that's not familiar with jquery may not be able to read it and i before even just a few years ago like everybody at least i was familiar with jquery it seemed like even if people were against jquery at least they still were aware of it and knew about it but it seems uh like newer devs especially like if they're coming through boot camps if the boot camp just goes like vanilla javascript and then straight into react or something like that you know they may have never been exposed to any jquery and will have no idea because it definitely is is different you know you try to make things happen on a screen or buttons function and stuff and react it's a whole different mindset than the way you do it in uh in jquery so you know i i think like moving forward if that's still the case and it goes like that where you have people just completely skipping the jquery because it i don't know it seems to me like it used to be the way the tutorials always went at least the ones that i did you know a couple years ago where you learn html css then you jumped into jquery uh and after jquery then you got into more like vanilla javascript stuff so people were learning jquery first just to be able to get some uh some sites like working so you know now it's i just i don't see that as much anymore with some of the newer boot camps and tutorials john hanson says talking to yourself is a sign of high intelligence or so i keep telling myself i like that one okay hard i see your message about authentication and stuff so just maybe uh if you get time let me know like in a dm or something um or if you already sent it to me just tell me and i'll try to look for it uh this shaka says what kind of topics do you speak uh in the conferences so let me think uh i have done a talk like on my live streaming so at um at november my talk was about my experience in live streaming and like the amazing community that's been built up around the stream and how it's changed my life as a developer i mean really it's changed my life in general not just as a developer you know being able to you know hang out with you all and uh and just share experiences not just coding experiences but being able to share things about my mental health and my family and just you know everything and learning about you all like i mean there's also there's a lot of interaction that even goes on beyond the stream you know on on instagram and and twitter and you know different social media networks uh even through email you know where i get to communicate with with a lot of you all and um yeah so that was my talk and that one is uh if you want to watch that talk it's on my youtube channel the link to my channel is in the description uh so it's it was um actually live streamed uh from my channel so you can check that out if you want uh i'm giving a talk i just did a talk for the moms can code virtual summit and uh that talk i believe is only available uh if you're a member of moms can code so i'm not sure how much it costs to be a member so um i i i can't say now what it uh what it costs but uh if you're already a member or you want to be a member you can check out that talk that talk was about my experience of coming from a background of being in business and then being a teacher and then transitioning into you know being a web developer and kind of like what i went through and uh that was like i i tried to keep the talk really short and i have a lot of time for question and answers and there were so many questions it ended up being you know really good um and that was interesting talk because it was you know mostly women in the audience i think they were like 160 or so um women so usually i think my audience for the streams are mostly men um so that that was really uh actually interesting um to like what kind of questions i got and um so i did like that uh and i'm gonna speak in at the pittsburgh tech fest i'm gonna speak about building a using wordpress as a content management system for react and using graphql and apollo with that so that our project five that we've been working on it's basically going to be a mini demo like stripped down to the basics of what we've been doing there oh cool francesca says moms can code is only fifty dollars a year if you get paid for a whole year up front or five dollars a month okay so that's that's pretty for at least for for the united states that's pretty affordable um awesome thanks for that and uh francesca i see it says you got to get your kids from day daycare i said thanks jesse talk to you later uh you're welcome thank you so much for watching and um yeah go and uh uh get your kids and uh let's see i lost my place where am i at oh hey oliver's here oliver says hi hey oliver how's how uh how you doing okay and michael says um actual serious question for once do you have a base package json file you use that has all your usual modules um actually yet for my old like jquery projects and just you know basic websites i do and that's that's pretty much this package json file so this one was frequently copied where i have gulp and you can see i have babel so i can use the newer version versions of javascript i minify my html i have a package in there to minify images um this inject lets me put um like analytics code in after the fact um obviously we're going to minify our css this lets me use sas uglify is um minifying our javascript um uncache uh basically adds like you can see it on the screen it adds like a string of numbers to the end of your file names so that browsers don't keep old versions of your code cache like if you just name your your javascript app.js it might be aggressively cached by browser and so you your users might not get the update uh the browser will just keep using the cast version and it's the same thing for css um and then usemen let's see your place is not optimized scripts or style sheets in this set of html files views i had to do username for something oh okay all right that that basically takes like my um development site uses references to the unminified untranspiled versions of my javascript my css and then when it goes to disk it automatically changes the references so that it starts referencing the optimized files uh in the disk folder so that's what that does so this is my base thing it automates a lot and it lets me get started really quickly i haven't used this in a while because we've been working with react stuff and i have a whole different set of things for react but this is really helpful if you just want to make a basic like one pager or just something really simple and you don't think you know you need to use a larger framework for um i you know i recommend this and i'm sure all these are out of date so there's probably a lot of updating that could take place since this was from two years ago but i probably have this available on some of the other projects so if like if you wanted to copy this from github just check out some of the other you know jquery one page projects and you know feel free to use that if you'd like uh vashaka says any tips for submitting proposals for conferences um i'll try to get some tips but to be honest with you i i i feel like i'm pretty new at submitting to conferences um i def i get rejected by most of the conferences i submit to so i don't know if i'm doing a good job at it or not but i will say um submit when you are submitting i my strategy right now is i have a talk that's more like they consider as a soft skills talk right so i talk more about my live coding and my experience there and then i have a talk that's more technical um so when i submit i always submit multiple proposals depending on what a conference wants because sometimes a conference you know they may want something that's not so technical where they you know so you don't always know what they want ahead of time so i like to submit at least two and um you definitely want like you want your title and like the beginning of your description to grab their attention you know like be honest about the title but definitely don't be afraid to have it be something eyecatching like my november talk that i did get selected for the title of the talk was how live coding changed my life so it's kind of dramatic right um i mean it's it's true it's i'm not lying about that but it's definitely a dramatic title so that kind of would stand out to somebody that maybe is getting a ton of talks they're just saying like i don't know like optimize your like your webpack build or something you know really like kind of more bland things so that's pretty much my only advice i really ought to um to study up more on how to do proper proposals and i just you know how it is you just get busy with everything you know you got family and work and everything and uh sometimes stuff like that just gets pushed to the side and you just do the best you can i do recommend going to paypercall dot io papercall.io has a bunch of conferences there it'll tell you info about the conferences you can get notified when new conference uh calls for paper calls for papers open up and you can save your proposals and then just auto submit them so you don't have to keep typing all the same stuff out again so uh try it you know check that site out that's i think papercall dot io uh andrew says is it okay for a front end dev to learn back end as well oh for sure for sure yeah um i think it's good i mean i think it's good for people who do back end to learn a little front end and front end people to learn a little bit of back end uh because sometimes they they bleed over into each other uh like i'm sure you all seen during this you know during my streams sometimes we do a lot of backend stuff because you know although i'm a frontend developer by title realistically i do what i have to do to get projects done so depending on where you work you may need to do that as well if you're working on a project like on your own you're going to have to do everything regardless of what you consider yourself front end or back end you're going to have to do the work so at this point i mean honestly i like i've applied for and been offered jobs for full stack um because i i can do that so when i go into interview i say yes my title is front end developer but we we don't have a um you know a back end developer uh that works on our projects with me so like realistically i am full stack in what i have to do michael says if there was only a way for for me to see that talk in pittsburgh about graphql react apollo hopefully that'll be streamed somewhere yeah i don't know what the plans are in terms of recording but uh i'll probably ask the organizers if there's any way like if they're not gonna record or stream it i'll ask them if i can and uh then i'll just get somebody um i'll have to get somebody to to stream it maybe i'll find somebody in the audience to hold my phone and stream it and i don't think my wife has tickets to that one maybe i'll see if she wants to get tickets if she doesn't and she'll come with me she my wife's actually the one that got me tickets to the google i o conference which is really cool divesh says can i please know what exactly web developers do and what kind of work is assigned to them um all right so i'm gonna be very like general um in this because there's a wide range of different types of things web developers do and how they go about doing it but basically a web developer would be assigned work to either build or update a website or web app and it would be their job to make that happen and there's a variety of different technologies that they would use and programming languages that they could use on the frontend side of things they're definitely going to be using html css and javascript that's pretty standard but on the back end there's much more variety in what they could use they could use javascript it could be php um python i mean i don't i don't really know i've never used anything other than javascript and php for back end but there's a variety uh you know we did do some c sharp now i think about it so c sharp um there's a lot of different things that you can use there so it's hard to say for sure what they're going to be doing but that's basically what what they what they will do so if you have any like more specific stuff i could give you get into more specifics but you know it's just such a broad thing that it's hard to say uh for sure what any one web developer would be doing and that's it that's the end of the live chat so uh unless any other questions sneak in there in the next minute or so i think i'm gonna wrap things up and uh thank you all so much for watching and uh for all the awesome questions and comments it was really fun today hopefully you all you know liked me going back and doing this you know sometimes it's nice to have a little break from the project we've been working on for what it seems like so long so um if if you really hate when i do this kind of thing let me know if you really like it let me know if you don't say anything at all i'll just assume like it was okay um and uh i i you know i'm not gonna do this all the time but occasionally it might be nice um so let's say it was a wednesday thursday all right i'll be in the office again on thursday i should be able to stream let me think later i don't know what my schedule is like thursday so i can't i don't know when exactly i'll be able to stream so i'll put something on uh twitter and probably on instagram and then if you turn on your notifications for this youtube channel the free code camp channel you should get a notification as well so uh if you're active on twitter or instagram you know maybe think about following me so you can get updates on what i'm going to stream as well links are in the description for those accounts um so should be back oh we had one more question uh ariane you got it in there just in time um can you tell me one thing to start so i can do freelance um if you want to do freelance stuff uh honestly uh depending on what you're into i would say like uh start with your local businesses and i've i've never done this but i've heard people have success with this they actually build a website for local business before they get a job like a demo website and then show that to them and say look how nice this website is it'll bring you you know whatever new customers it'll solve this problem for you or something like that and then you can potentially get them as a client and even if you don't get them as a client you have something in your portfolio so like i said i haven't used that in particular but i've i've heard other people have been successful with with that strategy so you may want to give that a try yeah and michael says by the way if you can sneak me into the conference in new orleans i'd be okay with that yeah you know what i'm actually not going to go to that conference so um i ended up after i looked at what the talks would be i realized you know what this is geared towards like upper management and not really towards developers so i decided like you know what although i got free tickets i'd still have to pay for my own flight and my hotel so um or my my employer would either way i would rather spend that money going to a conference that i would get more out of so there was a lot of really cool stuff about that conference but i don't think it would help me that much professionally so i decided against it but it really it would have been really cool i think i wanted to see new orleans more than i actually wanted to see the speakers at the conference so i just couldn't couldn't really justify that all right so now i'm done with the questions i'm going to get out of here for real now thank you so much and have a great day i'll see you tomorrow
