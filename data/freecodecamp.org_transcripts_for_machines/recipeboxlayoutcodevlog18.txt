this week I'm taking you to the kitchen because I'll be implenting the layout of recipe box app I was wondering about using material design and file materialized CSS would be quite nice for that I think that especially if you do the project for yourself if it's not for a client um you can easily change some stuff um if it's a better for the project if it's better for the final user if it's better for the final performance this situation is a great example uh when uh fastly designing it I thought I will build everything with flexbox but later when you um think okay what about fob what about this uh um these animations uh is it easier is better to build them on your own uh is it the challenge that you need right now because if not maybe there's an easier and faster way to build it of course it would be perfect if you know everything in the beginning but that's life and the life is that sometimes you you get the new idea out of a sudden and uh if it's really bad for a project why not turn into this direction if it was the project for a client for sure I would have to discuss everything with them and explain why uh and convince them to this solution uh convince them to choosing some you know slightly different way communication and being on the same page as the key he this is what I did uh this week with the recipe box project I introduced um the basic layouts let's start with the homepage I implemented it according to the designs I prepared earlier right now you see one photo but of course there will be different photos each of the card is the link there's the FB where you can always add a new recipe this is mobile horizontal View mobile vertical view on smaller phones such as iPhone 5 it looks like that iPad View and iPad horizontal View and desktop view each of the the card is a link so wherever you click in the area of a given recipe you will be redirected to recipe view this is the recipe view on desktop so there when you enter any um any recipe you can see it details so the big photo and you can also add it or delete the recipe the the TX here I change it a bit from the previous design a user will be able to search here and also uh come back to the previous page on mobile it looks like that so it's almost full width of the screen and mobile horizontally and let's look at some iPad view whenever a user clicks addit then we go to edit view of the recipe uh where uh we have uh the title to edit the text to delete or to add a new tag there is also a place where you can addit the ingredients and instructions later a user will be able to save uh the changed recipe or resign from the changes by clicking cancel also here there's a chance to change the photo and the last view implemented so far is the create view where a user wants to introduce completely new uh recipe by clicking the fob with plus icon they will be redirected here and the form is with float label pattern H so the labels do not disappear when you start typing but they will stay at the top the whole thing here is a link so it's not important in which point the user clicks wherever they click in this area they will be redirected to uploading a photo this is the mobile view and bigger mobile view so tablets so I introduced the basic layout and right now all of the views are in separate HTML files if you want to have a look at the code uh I will put their repository Link in the video description below when I come back to this project I will start adding react functionality I started with implementing the layout once again because I think it's easier for me to do first the basic View and later uh to see how it works uh while I start implementing react the separation into implementing layout and uh functionality in react helps me also in deciding on the final version of the design and on the final version of the look of the product and test whether the first decisions when it comes to layout were really the appropriate ones that's it for this week when it comes to coat because Christmas time is coming this week we are from in Christmas time and uh whether you are believer or not I wish you really the best time in the year and relaxing a bit reinking also what you did in this year and what you want to do in the following year that's some people who do not believe in New Year's resolution but uh I will tell you on my example how it worked last year in December I planned few things when it comes to code one of them was learning JavaScript the second was writing more blog posts about code and the third was learning more about user experience and thanks to this planning and thanks to having some expectations uh I really developed without the plan I don't suppose I would get the same results there are at least three things I learned about learning to go this year the first one is to be careful about your choices and abundance of things because there are many of courses but if you don't stay focused you can really get distracted and learn simply nothing the second thing is to refill your motivation everybody will have different way of motivating themselves but for me uh this blog turned out to be one of the great sources of motivation and the third thing I learned is taking small steps into the right direction so whenever appears an occasion to learn something new uh that's connected with your goals that is according to what you want to achieve uh generally go for it but don't exaggerate with the size of the project don't exaggerate with the responsibility don't exaggerate with the with the complexity and doing everything at once because whenever we want to make something life and implement it but we don't divide it into small steps uh or whenever we want to learn something new but we don't do it step by step but uh want to take the big bite it can overwhelm you that's why take the small steps hopefully the next year we will learn together even more than this year and we will keep on doing keep on developing I wish you that and I wish you back free Cod and awesome designs Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year keep on cing and see you next year
