In this video I'll be giving an example of a nonrational number. if the square root of two were rational number then by definition it must be expressed as the ratio of two integers. If we then square both sides we have two equals a squared divided by B squared. If we multiply both sides by b square root of 2 b squared equals A squared and from this we know that A squared is even. A squared is even because we have two times some integer which is B squared. Since A squared is even, we know that is even because a squared equals two times a manager the integer I chose was 2k squared that means that a times a can be expressed as 2k x 2k which is to say that A equals 2K. I can now substitute 2 x 2k squared or A squared and that leaves us with B squared equals 2K squared once these twos cancel out. Now, this also means that B squared is even because b squared equals 2 times some integer which is to say that B is also even, following this same logic. Now we go back to our original premise the square root of 2 equals A divided by B where a divided by B is an irreducible fraction. But since A is an even number and B is also an even number we can express these numbers as 2k and 2L. But these 2s here will reduce meaning that will have the square root of 2 equals K / L but since this reduced since this is no longer explicitly represented as A divided by B and it reduced to K / L we know that we do not have a rational number. Now, there's a more specific way to define these numbers or classify these numbers but we need set operators in the next video
