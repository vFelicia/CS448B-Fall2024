Jason or Json depending on who you ask however the creator of Json pronounces it Json stands for JavaScript object notation it's a Syntax for storing and exchanging data Jason that's how I say because Jason is my middle name has the following characteristics data is in name value pairs so here's the example here's the name here's the value here's the name here's the value and here's a name and here's a value d is also separated by commas so you have a comma after each piece of data curly braces hold objects so in this name value pair the value is an object also the entire thing is an object so you can see the curly braces and square brackets hold arrays like this adjacent values must be one of the following data types A String a number adjacent object an array a Boolean or or null Json values cannot be a function a date or undefined that's one of the differences between Json and JavaScript objects since the Json format is text only it can be easily sent to a server through URL when exchanging data between a browser and a server the data can only be text that's why Json can be very useful there are two important methods for using Json and JavaScript the stringify method if you you call json. string IFI and pass in some Json it converts it to a string so we just have a string right here often you'll stringify some Json before sending it to a server and the parse method whoops got this Comm in the wrong place so when we do json.parse and put in a string that's also in Json format it's going to give us an object it's going to convert it to a JavaScript object well that should give you a good introduction to Jason thanks for watching my name is Bo KS check the description for links to more information and to the code don't forget to subscribe and remember use your code for good
