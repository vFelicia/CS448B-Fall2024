hey everyone quincy here um i think you all can hear me i think we're we're starting um so first of all i want to welcome you to free code camps may 2020 summit this is a very exciting event for us because we haven't had one of these summits in like a year and a half two years because we've been so busy working on other things but i am thrilled i'm over the moon to announce a lot of the big things that we've been doing today uh we are working in public as you know on our open source project but a lot of things that we're trying to do we we try not to make too big of a deal out of them because we don't want a whole bunch of speculation and a whole bunch of you know gossip uh because it's much like the biggest challenge in running a big distributed organization like preco camp is communicating things effectively so what we're going to try to do during this oneish hour summit is communicate as much as possible about what we're doing and as candid a way as we can uh we are not going to try to build up tons of hype this is not going to be like one of those steve jobs types uh talks this is going to be super casual and i can see that we have a lot of people in chat um i can see that uh a lot of you are probably joining maybe this is the first live stream you've watched here on youtube we have tons of live streams uh we we have jesse weigel uh who's in the uh in the chat right now he streams a lot after this uh summit we are going to have a very special live stream from floren pop who's also in the chat uh if you join and you want to become a supporter you can talk to them in there they are going to be streaming or flooring is going to be streaming a whole lot of project oil problems which if you haven't heard of project oil or it's this 20ish year old website that has a bunch of coding challenges that tens of thousands of people have solved and we've taken a lot of those uh which are creative commons we've taken those and we put them on free code campbell we've added a bunch of tests to them and created like a nice ex a better experience than project oiler.net no offense to them they're they're great but it's just kind of tedious to to do the the challenges there so we made it easier to do that so we have this new challenge the project euler 100 hashtag project euler 100 and it's solving the first 100 project weather problems and floor and pop is diving in and attempting it and we've had dozens of people at this point who've started it uh i don't know of anybody who's actually finished all 100 yet but we just started it a few months ago so people are working toward that so be sure to stick around for that i am very excited i'm gonna just start by talking about this youtube channel that we're on we have grown dramatically in the past uh in the past two years really this youtube went from for the first four years of free code camp's life we were just publishing as many uh little short tutorials as we could on different topics like big o notation and uh get and things like that and then we started to publish these big long full courses at this point we have hundreds of fulllength courses that we're showing ad free because we don't run ads on this channel i think we're one of the biggest channels that doesn't run any ads at all you can just find a fulllength course you can work through it almost all these have like code samples and other things so while you're here on the channel be sure to subscribe be sure to also um consider supporting the channel we have this new join button if you click it you'll become a member and you can do things like chat during our live streams which we restricted live stream chat because if we don't we just get a whole bunch of you know hey how's it going you know like really quick casual uh messages so this makes it a lot easier for us to moderate it because otherwise we just streaming by like lightning speed so be sure to join uh all all proceeds above the 30 that youtube takes the the 70 goes to our nonprofit and helps us operate um and i'm going to be talking a whole lot about other initiatives that we have going on today too but i'm i'm going to get out of the way in just a minute for the main people who are going to be talking and that is abby beau and regesh so all i want to say before i hand it off mr gesh is our community is growing really fast we have a ton of new people joining the community helping one another learn to code it's fantastic we now have a forum where you can ask questions and get help we have a series of discord discord chat rooms where you can go to get motivation and hang out with other people and just it you know during this pandemic when we're not able to talk facetoface it's great to be able to talk to people virtually and precode camp has a giant community online where you can do just that and and feel some affinity for other developers and get get picked back up when you feel down so hang in there we also have a subreddit if you haven't joined it yet it's our free code camp uh thank you very much to ariel leslie and her amazing stewardship of that community and we have a giant facebook group if you're on facebook still in 2020 join it it's it's called free co camp earth so if you just search free code camper earth you'll find it and a lot of really helpful people over there as well at this point i'd like to also mention that we do have merchandise i don't see it showing up underneath this video but when you're watching youtube videos on free code camp you will see videos that uh like this shirt for example this is actually three years old i've watched it more than 150 times i know because i wear it every week and uh it's been about three years since i bought it so even after three years you can see the lettering is it still fits great uh you can see like the the elasticity of the bands are great that's because it's a triblend shirt it's uh polyester uh rayon and cotton and it's like it's just a really really nice shirt it like hugs my body really well and it doesn't um stretch out and it's super comfortable so we if you do look and get a chance to buy like a shirt or a hoodie or a mug or a cap we're shooting for like the highest quality that teespring this this company that does the production and fulfillment uh we're using the highest quality versions of all the products that they have so the prices are a little bit higher but it's worth paying an extra five bucks to get a shirt that lasts for you know 150 washes instead of disintegrating after 50. that's my philosophy so you can support us that way you can support us by joining the chat you can support us by doing a super chat which i see some people are doing thank you for doing that by the way um and you know together we're going to keep this organization going keep it growing and keep producing awesome courses now i would like to hand it over to mygesh magesh is going to demonstrate uh the new contributor site and talk a little bit more about our infrastructural challenges as we grow dramatically uh murgesh is a seasoned developer i think he's the only person on the free code camp team who actually has a computer science degree but he he is from bengaluru or bangalore as it was called recently um and he is just an amazing developer he is the main person whom we all call if we have some sort of dramatic outage or if we have a major infrastructural decision rage uh thanks quincy for that introduction and uh yeah so welcome everyone to uh the may summit of record camp we really hope to do this you know like more often like she already said uh uh and yeah if something breaks on free code cam probably i am the person to blame uh but anyways uh let's let's talk about uh you know uh some of uh our growth uh in in these recent times uh as you we we are about 400 we have about four million registered users on our learning platform which is the coding platform that you go to and you know learn to code and on various certifications we have about 400 18 k users on our forum and uh just to show you some stats uh here's our alexa rank uh we are doing about 1100 you know globally and we have gained about 633 ranks in the last 90 days alone and to show you something even more fun uh in the past 24 hours we have had about 400 k unique uh visitors on the uh on across all of you know free code cam uh and uh at the minute we have at least four thousand concurrents uh you know across various uh platforms so those many people are you know like actually there on free code actually it's even more than that because uh we don't register all the server side requests and you could be working on your own uh but yeah that gives you a quick idea of you know like how big precode champ is then you're going to say that hey british they are all just big numbers and what do i make of it the thing is these dramatic growth that we have had in you know like these obviously trying times uh is because of you know like people seeking more opportunities to learn uh to learn to call when they're at home and just seeking resources to be able to skill them up when this these lockdowns get over to find jobs or you know uh do something uh with whatever skills they have earned build a project or you know start a startup the thing is even though free code camp operates at such huge scales it does not have as much operating budget our total operating budget is 1 200th of wikipedia and that's less than some of the salaries of some of the some of the developers in the bay area you know and that's that includes everything it includes the payroll for the staff it includes servers it includes everything so you know that's the entirety of free code cap so every time when quincy asked me that hey our forum's getting slower you know the news site is getting slower just pin up another server in the back of my mind i have to think that hey we have 4 million users we have 5 000 people donating to us if i spin one more server i'm probably going to cost 16 develop 16 uh you know uh people who are contributing one more you know one more month's worth of uh you know donations so it's it's it's a cat and mouse game you know like all these big companies they have this huge huge infrastructure where they auto scale they have you know blue green deployments and roll backs and fancy pipelines and all that we could do that it's not it's not about the you know the ability it's more about you know the constraints that we are operating at uh so i just want to give you a quick uh you know like uh uh you know mockup that i have built up of our of our network chat this is this is not close to you know whatever we have in reality but it's it's an approximation so we have you know all these different apps uh they learn uh slash news slash forum uh uh you know like people visiting us from all across the world we have cloudflare as our cdn and our dns provider so you know we are managing all our traffic through cloudflare at the minute uh we use odd0 to authenticate and then to give you you know how nimble and tiny our stack is we just have a couple of engineering instances which are load balanced these are uh there are a couple handful of you know api instances a couple instances for our you know frontend static sites and one instance because it's a monolithic for ghost which is you know like serving our news app and of course we have our database instances and this is the all of a free code camp and you know that's that's uh that's how small of a stack this is we do want to scale this up rapidly and uh doing so is quite easy now that we have improved upon the scaling in the recent times uh what we can do is for instance if if you know like we see the concurrence getting bumped up on our nginx instances we can just spin one more add it to the pool and the load balancer will take care of you know like serving the traffic so what this means uh oh yeah we also have our forum instance which is probably you know one of the most visited uh platforms uh on forum we at any given point of time we have about 600 to 800 people there uh and it's uh you know thankfully sponsored by a discourse huge shout out to them jeff amazing guy and uh the these things these things you know the the architecture or you know they these things take a lot of our time uh when we are trying to develop features we do not want to be maintaining stack we want to be building features for you and you can help us by obviously donating and you know helping us scale up to a place where you know we don't have to worry about you know like getting spikes and you know spending sleepless nights to you know spin one more server just to have all the resources available to you uh that said uh let's jump to the other part which is contributing to freebootcamp all this is good you can donate to free code cam but there are other ways if you cannot donate you can definitely contribute to free code camp in various different ways and i am really happy to announce that we have this brand new contributing site you just go to contribute.freecodecam.org we'll tweet it out and you can even check it in our you know the article that quincy published even in the description the link will be available there but it's just contribute.freecodcam.org and that's going to be your central place where you can go to you know help us in tiny ways for example you can help people by answering their coding questions on our community forum you can give them feedback on their projects you can add subtitles to our youtube channel videos you know we we want our youtube channel videos not just to be available in english but various world languages uh and of course uh last but not the least you can contribute to our code base uh and this guide uh it's it has everything that you are probably going to need to be able to contribute uh to the code base you can you know work on coding challenges you can work or help with help us with adding you know subtitles and you can help us with adding uh multiple choice questions to our video challenges which bo will talk about in a minute uh you can set up free code camp locally if you wanted to work on you know like the platform side of things uh you can learn about how we deploy free code camp you know like it's uh everything is deployed from you know like uh pipelines we have built uh we have ci cd integration of course and you can read all about this you know like uh on this guide we even have some flight manuals uh for our staff and mod to you know like help them do their daytoday jobs like moderating uh you know the chat rooms and all that and uh most importantly you can uh you should check the links right here in our community these are links to seek help about contributing so you can hang out us hang out with us on our you know community forum we have a dedicated contributors category and we also have a dedicated chat room where you can you know come say hi and ask questions about contributing uh you know just say what you're doing uh these days and we'll love to hang out with you uh so yeah that's that's mostly uh how free codecamp operates it's very tiny team but it's possible because of thousands of kind volunteers like you so come hang out with us uh yeah do you want to take your vacancy yeah absolutely um and while we have your screen up here just a real quick since you have those tabs let's go ahead and show let's show everybody what the subreddit looks like real quick so this is of course the free code camp subreddit we have tons of people asking and answering questions here so be sure to check this out if you're on reddit just join this subreddit uh and i think you'll find it's helpful and and occasionally cool stuff will come up just in your normal reddit feed if you're subscribed to this uh subreddit um next the freecodecamp earth facebook group there are a lot of people in here this is a really cool interface are you using the mobile version of facebook um no this is a version this is the web version itself but they updated it i think it's available to you know like i don't know how it's made available but i think you know i'm signed up on the early thing i don't know how i got this it looks very similar to twitter if you notice what there's a trend toward going to like single column layouts or trying to reduce the amount of noise on the sides we'll get to that in a minute when abby talks uh but this looks way better what facebook currently looks like this is cool anyway um free code camp birth be sure to join that group uh really want to shout out to all the moderators we have like this amazing moderator team on facebook uh so thank you all for everything you're doing next of course uh the free code camp forum which merge mentioned earlier uh there are a lot refresh it could you refresh this yeah this this is a pretty active forum and you're gonna see that there are a lot of people asking and answering questions and even though it's a forum and it feels asynchronous you can see like just in the past uh 20 minutes we've had like six or seven posts so it may feel asynchronous because you're like asking a question you have to wait to get an answer but this is the best way to get answers in my humble opinion forums are way better than like chat or social media or anything like that if you if you can wait you know an hour typically you'll get a response within about an hour if you if you post a question or if you want to get feedback on your project so do be sure to uh create a forum account currently you have to kind of sign in separately with the forum uh we're working on marrying those two accounts uh and just getting everything behind off zero which is what we've been using for our authentication on the on the the main learn curriculum so uh and then last but not least of course we recently launched discord uh which is a big chat server and there's my announcement in there wating watengi uh people were gonna choose waiting but i think somebody needs to upload the i one so that it uh is in front of the t i'm not sure why it's in that sequence but if you uh if you come in here we've got a whole lot of chat room we don't have a whole lot we try to keep the conversation relatively constrained so these can be like more productive and we don't have a bunch of ghost town chat rooms that nobody talks in if you join any of these chat rooms over here you'll find that they've got their own vibrant communities you'll also note for later reference that there's a project euler 100 chat room here there's also an aws certified chat room these are two different challenges we have going within the free co camp community uh so these are places where you can share your wins like if you get an aws certification you can talk about it here johann marine just got the hardest one i think the developer associate won a couple days ago so this is a really great place also to just chat in real time and many of us are working from home uh or just hanging out at the house because school's out for the most part jump in and find your tribe right here online we're going to give you the tools in a very friendly community they're around i think 6 000 people or so that have joined this discord server in the past three or four weeks since we launched it and uh we have great moderators everybody follows the code of conduct uh people who don't get banned to be completely candid like we're not shy about banning people who don't buy the code of conduct because we've found that for every toxic person you know ten nontoxic people will get scared away so we're very aggressive about enforcing our code of conduct and uh we we really mean it when we say that we're a super inclusive community so next uh i would like to hand it off to abby abby is a portlander she's from portland uh which is an amazing and interesting city uh up in the pacific northwest in the united states and we have a lot of contributors from portland and there are a lot of really exciting uh open source projects coming out of there as well and of course you know washington and so it's not just california on the west coast we've got awesome cities like portland and seattle as well so abby is going to talk about a number of things but the big thing she's going to talk about is a very invisible process that's been going on that's going to make your life a lot better that you don't even know about yet so i'm going to let abby talk about that hey abby hey thanks quincy um hi everybody it's really great to be here with you all today thanks for joining our live stream yeah i'm here in sunny portland today a nice change in the weather so yeah excited to talk about this sneaky project that quincy mentioned so some of you might be familiar with free code camp's guide so the guide is a collection of a whole bunch of articles that a bunch of really wonderful contributors have put together over the years um and it's a great resource you know if you google something oftentimes you'll get a guide article but you know it's not necessarily the easiest reading experience so or the easiest user experience and so we have been working myself and one of our other team members chris have been working on transitioning all the guide articles over to free code camp news um news is our main publication that you also might be familiar with which we'll look more at in a minute um so you can see the guide here you know it's it's very functional it just has tons of information but now we are taking all these articles and we are transferring them uh first we kind of we go through we clean them up um we're making sure that all you know everything has nice syntax highlighting in our news interface and everything like that and so we're basically cleaning these articles up and putting them into news so you'll have a better reading experience a cleaner interface news has syntax highlighting it has all the great features that you'd expect wanting to just read a technical article so chris and i have been going through and um transferring these articles from the guide over to news now there are thousands of articles on the guide we've been working on about um the most sort of uh red thousand or so and you can see what an article looks like on news now compared to guide it's nice and clean it's easy to read and we've taken some articles from the guide and combined them if they're really short little articles like this one on array methods in javascript there were a whole ton on the guide so we put them in one article so that you have all these array methods and all this information about arrays all in one nice clean place news also has amp accelerated mobile pages so you'll have a much better reading experience on your mobile phone so i just want to emphasize again that these articles are a product of thousands of individual creators and contributors so thank you for all those contributions and now these articles are just going to be easier to read and more accessible and more helpful to more people so this is not live quite yet i just want to note it will be hopefully in the next couple weeks we're just finishing up a few details but in the next couple weeks you'll have a whole lot more articles on news to help you with all these uh you know detailed searches that you might be doing um all that will be available on news now so that's a really exciting project and i want to thank chris koishigawa who's probably watching this stream and he's in south korea as a one of our team members and he's just been instrumental in making this happen so that's really exciting for us um so next i want to talk a little bit about something else that chris is very involved in and this is uh searching on on ghost on free code cam news um that uh we run on ghost so you might not realize that you can search on free code camp news um so for cash we just want to go to one of those news articles that we talked about we can kind of demo search and then look at the articles themselves so there's a search bar up in the upper left corner of news and there are over 6 000 articles indexed on news we use algolia and that also provides our search bar super great service um it's really fast so you can see like right when regress started typing results instantly started appearing the results are based on the headlines of the articles and they're sorted by relevancy so the newest articles will be at the top and if you want to see more results um you can either just hit enter or you can click on the little like see more results down at the bottom and then you'll get everything like for example python you know there'll be probably hundreds of articles um the other great thing about this search feature is that if you like mistyped something accidentally like if myrgash was to leave out the y in python or whatever um it'll still come up tada with all the python results so it's really good about fixing like spelling errors or typos and you'll still get what you're looking for so that's awesome and i just want to give a big shout out again to chris he's the one who manages search and indexes all the articles um he just does such a great job making sure that there's everything that you need in there so go forth and search in freco caf news you'll find a whole bunch of really great stuff so the last thing i want to talk about is just some of the articles that we've been publishing lately on news news has been growing we have a whole bunch of authors that just publish really really good stuff and lately we've had some really good indepth articles and this is sort of the direction that we're going with news we'll continue to publish all different kinds of content and on all different kinds of topics but you can see like with this first example phoebe wrote this article on computer programming software development very broad topic but it's an incredibly indepth article it might be like a 20 or 30 minute read or something like that but it really just gives you a great foundation about programming if you just need to kind of learn the basics it's very well organized so we're really encouraging people to publish um indepth beginner's guides like that so people can really get started and just learn the basics another great example of an article what do we have next let's look at uh tk's article on um so we publish a lot of these really great indepth um technical guides so tk's written this article about um you know building this great uh pokemon web app so if you're a pokemon fan it's great check it out but again he includes um lots of images and code snippets great stepbystep um details helpful headings um so we have we publish a lot of really great technical articles like this you can see the beautiful syntax highlighting um so that's another type of article we really enjoy publishing um we also publish a lot of basically like programming language guides or intros to various programming languages like we have an example from um a new author um renon or rain on i'm not sure how to pronounce his name that is about python so this is just a beginner's guide to python so you can just learn all kinds of the basics of python from this article and again it's it's super long but it has a nice table of contents at the beginning helps you get exactly where you want to go in the article a lot of authors are doing that and we have a lot of other beginner sort of language guides which are really helpful and then we also like to publish articles that are sort of helping you prepare for interviews i know you know job searching is stressful but we have articles like this article by one of our authors zubin that is on system design you know very popular topic for like big tech companies and interviews and again this is just a super indepth guide on how to prepare for a systems design interview so there's a ton more articles i could talk about i just picked sort of a sampling of some of the really ones that we're really excited about so i just want to thank these authors all of our authors for sharing these articles with us and you know it's really meaningful to them when you share the articles and tweet about them um and get excited about them bookmark them save them for later um you know they really appreciate it um and these articles just help so many people uh you know it's just really it's really exciting for us to see them and see what great resources they are so we really encourage our authors to publish these kinds of great indepth articles um and and thank you to everybody reading them uh for sharing them they're really helping a ton of people and that's our mission here is to help as many people as possible and just to help as many people learn to code as we can so that's all from me today i hope you've gotten a little bit more familiar with news and how it works and what we're doing here we're just really excited to continue sharing these high quality articles and lastly i just want to say if you are interested in becoming an author on free code camp news um we have a lovely style guide i don't know if you have that still pulled out my gosh but yeah here's our style guide and it kind of gives you a little bit more about our editorial philosophy um how to write a good article um yeah i mean just read it for your own purposes also but there are instructions uh sort of hidden in there about how to become an author so do read through that you'll find a link to a form to apply to become an author on news and we would love to see your application and love to have you contributing your own wonderful articles to our community and to everybody so thank you guys so much and enjoy the rest of the stream thank you so much abby uh and yes abby for all of you who don't know she's edited at this point probably thousands of articles she joined us after having uh she volunteered and edited hundreds of articles and i was i mean maybe a thousand and at that point i was like wow i i've been doing most of the publication oversight myself so we brought abby on and she's been just completely overseeing the publication and chris koishigawa in south korea whom abby mentioned a couple times he has also been helping uh edit articles as well so if you publish an article with ricoh camp there's a very good chance that well it's certain that either me abby or chris went through your article line by line and and did what we could to optimize it and make it as clear as possible for readers um the last thing i want to say is somebody asked ryan reed asked in chat like is news live yet and is there a difference between the free code camp medium publication and news and the answer is uh back in july of 2019 we moved 100 of our articles like everything off of medium and over to this new news platform and uh because we wanted to have like full control over how things were presented and we didn't want like mediums weird banners and stuff popping up so um we didn't want to deal with mediums trend toward pay walls and all that stuff medium's great it's a good place to publish if you don't already have like an existing community like we do but we outgrew medium and we're thrilled to have the news be uh at this point we're getting significantly more readership of articles now that we're on our own uh instance of ghost which is the really cool open source uh mit license you feel free to use it liberally it's it's got the most liberal license you can get the most permissive license you can get just like free cocaine does um so if you want to spin up a blog mediums are great er i'm sorry ghost is a great tool for that um and we've we've heavily modified it and uh i think we're one of the biggest uh ghost instances on the web even though like apple and a lot of other places have them i don't think they're doing you know um millions and millions of uh readers a month like we are so um we're thrilled that we've like after we moved off of medium there was a little bit of a drop just because medium is such a huge gravitational force in you know google search and everything like that but we're now way above where we were then so uh we overcame that and it was thanks to the many many writers in the community who've continued to write these indepth thoughtful insightful articles so i just want to thank them now the moment a lot of you have probably been waiting for beau carnes uh who by the way runs free cocaine's youtube channel uh and does a whole lot of other things he does a lot of instructional design he was working as a teacher for about five or six years in middle school and uh he's based in michigan he and i were talking about youtube and he'd been contributing to free code camp and i was able to convince him to come on and take over the youtube channel and also help with instructional design and help design curricula and he's been working on the python curriculum since at least five months ago i think uh like december 2019 and we've made a whole lot of progress on it and a lot of this is ready to go into beta so i'm thrilled to hand it over to beau carnes to walk us through some of the big improvements to the curriculum and the python certifications bo okay thank you quincy yeah we're super excited to share this first look at our new python certifications that we're adding to the curriculum so currently our curriculum has six certifications but we are updating it and now we're going to have 10 certifications um we can you can actually see on the screen right now that we have a here's our new list of certifications and there's there's 10 certifications now so what we did is we broke up one of the certifications the the old one called quality assurance and information security we broke up into two different certifications in addition to adding more to adding more content to each of those certifications and also we are adding three new certifications that are all focused on python so if we go into the let's go into the scientific computing with python certification so uh there there's three parts of the the certification so what we have the the main part is the certification projects which you can see open right now and these are the projects either these are the required projects you have to do to show that you understand python and something that we are still yet to come out with are practice projects and the practice projects are going to be used to teach people python we have a lot done on them but we don't we're not yet ready to beta test those practice projects but we are ready to put into beta test our new type of challenge which are video challenges so if we open up this python for everybody here you will see a list of new video challenges so this is the first time this is a brand new thing for a curriculum and this is the entire uh python for everybody course created by dr chuck from the university of michigan and uh each sec we've broken up into a lot of different sections so when you go to the challenge it has an embedded video right in there so how it works is you watch the section of the video and then after you watch this video section there's a multiple choice question so each section here has a single multiple choice question and if you see on the question we can see we have sometimes we can embed code on the question we can book bed code on the answers and so the idea is you watch the video challenge and then you can answer the questions to see if you understand the concept now we only have a single question for each video challenge so just because you can answer this single multiple choice question doesn't mean you understand every single element in the video so you shouldn't just go through the questions and say oh i know this question so i don't even have to watch the video you still should watch each video to get all the content the question is just a a small thing to to make sure you understand everything but you should still watch the whole video and then if you get the question right you can go on to the next challenge until you eventually go through every single video challenge and then so for instance if you go through all the python for everybody challenges you will have a really good understanding of python now like i said eventually we're going to have more of an interactive coding uh practice projects to teach python but we're still going to continue to have the these video challenges so for each section for each of the new certifications we have our our practice projects what no we don't have we have our certification projects and we also have the video challenges so let's take a look at some of the certification projects these are pretty much completely done and ready for people to start using and just so you know currently all the certification projects we are you're gonna access this on a a on a thirdparty website so for instance this one we're gonna access on replit now eventually one thing that we're working on is adding the ability to complete all the projects right on freecodecamp.org without ever going to any other websites but for now you can complete the projects on replit and so to do the projects you go into the you click the link on the challenge and it opens up the replit and then you can go into the the readme so if you go into the readme what you can see the files on the side this will give you um all the instructions for the challenge and what you're supposed to do so it's going to give you the assignment all the things you have to do and so once you kind of understand what you're supposed to be doing you you can go into in this case it's the the budget.pie because here we're creating a a budget and this is basically just an empty file where you're going to put in your code and you're going to solve the challenge and then once you solve the challenge uh we're we're going so here's we've uh just pasted in the code so this is actually the solution here and so when you click run it's going to to run and then it's going to also run all the tests so you can see here this is the solution code so it passed all the tests if you go if you go into the test module that pi we can look at the tests where the tests are are stored now when you're working on the projects something that can give you a hint of how to solve the project is to look in the tests so the tests are available for anybody to look in into so you can see exactly what we're looking for and these are all the tests your your project has to pass for it to um to be able to pass this this challenge so if you go over the the main.pi file the main.pi file is the file that runs when you click the run button so you can see in the top center there's a run button when you click the run button it runs this main dot pi so you can make updates to this main dot pi um to update what's gonna like when you're testing it when you're when you're testing your code you can update this program and you can see it also automatically runs the tests so once you think that you solve the this the challenge and you have all the tests passing you can go and click the share button so if you see in the top right corner there's a share button and so if you click that you can copy the link now one thing i forgot to mention is before you even start working on the code you're going to actually have to create your own account on replit and you're going to have to fork the project so you can see there's a fork button when you click the fork button it allows you to to create a copy of the project in your own account so after you do that then you can you're able to copy the link to your project that's right in your account and once you copy the link you can go back into the the precode camp curriculum and you can paste in your solution and then after that you just click i've completed this challenge and you can go to the next challenge and then once you complete every single project in this certification then you can claim the certification so currently we are just one completed but once you complete all of them you'll be able to claim the certification so all these certifications are going to be uh are all ready to be possibly claimed so as long as you if you complete all the certification projects you can claim the certification when we add the practice projects those are going to be optional you're you're not going to have to do all the practice projects to claim the certification but they help in just learning the content but besides the the scientific computing with scientific computing with python certification we have the data analysis with python certification and the machine learning with python certification so you can see in this machine learning with python certification the first two sections here that tensorflow and how neural networks work these are all video challenges so there we have a whole course on tensorflow and these are these are all video challenges and all these will help you prepare to do the the certification challenges so if we go back over to the um yeah the certification challenges we have the machine learning with python project so these are the certification projects that once you complete all these projects you'll be able to claim the certification now go into the we'll go into the cat and dog image classifier as an example and we'll see that uh when we go into here uh this time instead of opening it in reply it's gonna open in google collaboratory so if you click on the first link it's gonna open the whole project in google collaboratory and the reason why we use google collaboratory for this one instead of replit is because it uses uh jupyter notebook files and these are becoming pretty industry standard when you're working on machine learning projects and so on these jupiter notebook files it goes between showing you instructions and code that you can actually run so if you follow all the instructions there's some code that we've given you but there's some code that you're going to have to complete uh yourself to be able to solve the the challenge so if we look if we look at this code section here that shows um the train image generator equals none validation image generator equals none uh they're not eventually they're not supposed to equal none so part of your task when you're completing this is to figure out what these are supposed to equal so currently we have it set to equal none but the people going through this challenge will have to figure out what they're supposed to equal and once you've completed all the instructions and added the code that you're supposed to add you can go to the very bottom of this notebook and there's a final cell of code that when you run it's going to run all the tests to see if you pass the tests so if you run the final cell you'll be able to find out if you pass the test now one thing that's similar between this and rep repellent is that you're going to uh rebel it is you have to create your own copy so to create your own copy you are going to have to have a google account and you go to file save a copy and drive and you create your own copy and drive and then that's where you then fill out all the code that you need to fill out and once you've passed the test you can share it so you click the share button in the top right corner and then you're going to get a link that you can share so when you get the shareable link and then you just make sure that anybody with the link can view it you copy the link and after you copy the link you can go back over to the free code camp curriculum and you can paste in the link now like i said eventually you're going to be able to do all this right on freecodecamp.org without having to go into a separate website like google collaboratory but until we got have that working we're using these thirdparty websites and once you have done all the challenges you can claim the certifications now one thing i should add is that so we have the video challenges that are going to help you and prepare you to complete these certification projects but you may have to do some additional learning on your own so these video challenges are going to teach you a lot of what you need to know but some of the what you need to know to complete these certifications these certification projects is is going to involve doing some extra research and extra learning on other websites and that kind of uh simulates what it's going to be like when you have a job where you have to kind of learn to to learn how to learn and figure out how to get the the res how to get the knowledge you need to complete different projects uh so that's what you would have to do in a in a real world situation and that's what you have to do on these and uh once we release the practice projects they'll probably they'll probably be a little less that you'll have to go to other websites for but this is pretty much an overview of our the new curriculum that we're going to be rolling out for beta testing very very soon so it's go and very very soon you're going to be able to go and see all this stuff on the the beta site for freecodecamp.org and you'll be able to start trying out all this on your own so that's all i have to say about this i guess we'll go back to quincy and see if quincy has anything else he wants to add about it hey thank you so much bo uh for giving us that excellent overview of the new python certifications and also thank you for uh all the time and energy you put into developing these over the past uh five months so we are still working on finalizing uh exactly what the tests look like in the projects and getting all that done but as bo said we're hoping to get this live this month like may uh so that you all can start diving through and getting earning these certifications the general flow and by the way i'm going to go ahead and put out a call for any questions you all have that you'd like to ask about just go ahead and ask in chat again if you're not if you haven't joined yet there's a join button it costs like five dollars a month or i'm not sure how many rupees but it's scaled to your currency and it'll be less expensive in certain places than others uh but it helps us a lot and that way you'll be able to ask questions and also chat on other streams so what we're planning to do uh is just roll out the updated the expanded curriculum in stages uh our first step as both said is to get these these four new certifications live then our next step will be to try to get it to where all these projects including the projects currently people are doing on like codepen and js bin and places like that we're going to get it to where you can complete all the projects right on freecodecamp.org so we're working toward that that's challenging it's challenging to run python in a browser it's challenging to have full stack software development done clientside without it you know dramatically exploding our server bill and that's one of the reasons we've been a little bit slower to do that and that's why we still encourage people to use glitch and a lot of these other uh services to build the projects and host the projects and then just link to them in the free code camp uh in the curriculum where you where you submit the link to the project that you built uh a lot of that is also just because we're a small team and we don't have the resources to directly moderate every single piece of you know every single project and if you want to read a little bit more about how hard it is to successfully moderate you know a site where anybody can just create anything read the the guy who created jspin created this great article about the hell that is running js bin is an amazing story i'll try to find a link for it but there are a number of reasons why what we're doing is very difficult uh i just want to reassure you all we're doing everything we can we're working as fast as we can but a lot of these are genuinely hard problems that we're working on and of course we're working with very limited resources as murgash pointed out wikipedia's budget is about 200 times greater than free code camps even though free code camp is rapidly i mean we're not anywhere near the amount of traffic and and a number of people that are using precode camp as are using wikipedia but we're definitely more than you know one two hundredth of the way so um anything you all can give us helps a lot uh helps us pay for servers it helps us enlist you know seasoned teachers like beau carnes uh to help design these uh projects and and help do other instructional design so as both said we're going to start off with these video challenges these are excellent video courses that are coming from free code camp's youtube channel where we have fulllength courses such as the one we just published yesterday on pytorch which is a really important machine learning library we we have tons of fulllength courses over there that you can use you are going to want to be googling around you're going to want to be supplementing everything you learn on freecodecamp as bo said there is no onestop shop any website that says all you need is right here well i can tell you there's no such site because free code camp probably has dramatically more instructional content than any other programming related site and yet i'm telling you as the person in charge of free cocaine we're just scratching the surface technology is a notion or having an openended question and being able to ask on the forum or just google around and find some blog article or some course video on youtube and use that to fill in the gaps in your own knowledge we're gonna do our best to explain everything within freecodecamp but realistically there's just so much to teach and there's so much to learn that you are going to want to get really good at googling things and really good at coming up with questions and asking them on the forum so uh we have some questions from the audience and just real quick like the general we don't use deadlines a lot of people ask me when's this coming out when's that coming out we don't do deadlines uh within free code camp because we want to get things good enough before we ship them so sorry uh somebody says something in chat and i just wasn't sure um so we are going to um we're going to continue to just chip things as we feel they're already there's a great quote from shigeru miyamoto the famous designer of zelda mario all these famous franchises of video games and he said a rushed game is forever bad a delayed game is eventually good and that's how i feel i feel that it's much better for us to do things right than to just rush them out the door and send tons of people to a unfinished experience so what we're trying to do is we're using google's collaboratory we're using replica we're using a glitch we're using all these um so phase one of course get these python certifications live with the video challenges phase two is going to be us getting it to where you can go through the entire curriculum uh right on freco camp without having to use these external services phase three is going to be us creating the practice projects for the python curriculum and for eventually for the existing uh the first six certifications so all that will probably happen in 2020 uh but i'm not gonna promise anything because again it'll be done when it's done please give us the uh the patience that we're gonna work as fast as we can one thing i want to emphasize to everybody watching this is you don't have to wait for any of this everything we're doing like all the existing certifications will continue to exist we don't destroy content we don't destroy certifications once they're alive we'll always support them and we've done that like we had the old uh curriculum the old certifications those are still live everybody who's claimed those certifications still has those certifications the links are still valid uh we don't want it's it's like playing a you know a game of of go you put you put the piece on the board and the piece stays on the board right and the rest of the game is kind of shaped uh going forward by that piece and that's how freako camp is we want to put things down and we want to expand from there so the curriculum is linear you can work through the entire thing from top to bottom quality assurance certification is being split into two certifications but the projects associated with those are still in the curriculum it's just that two of the projects from the uh information security quality insurance are being moved from the quality assurance to the information security certification and the information security certification is being included to include a lot of linux and python as well so we're very excited about those updates as well and and we think these are sound from a pedagogical standpoint we think this makes more sense to employers who are looking at your resume or your cv and trying to decide um how to make sense of the certifications you've earned so eventually we'll have 10 certifications and you'll be able to go through all those uh but right now if you're working through the first six certifications just keep going nothing is going to change that is substantial yes we're replacing the lessons with practice projects later in 2020 probably but that the lessons are all optional you just have to complete the projects in order to earn the certifications and the projects for those first six certifications are are not going to change dramatically all right let's jump to questions so uh first of all i just want to let's see uh people people ask i'm new to computer program and i want to know where to start what i would recommend is just work through the free code game curriculum from start to finish top to bottom that has it baked into it all of the knowledge all the wisdom we have uh and another thing you can do is if you google like coronavirus academy i just put together an article somebody can probably share it in chat but it's a comprehensive article saying what you know courses and what in addition to the free cocaine curriculum that you could use to kind of learn as much as possible during this lockdown period and during this period of social distancing zully asks what do you think is the popularity of python as a web development framework over javascript i am someone who i want to learn python but i don't uh i don't want to have to learn javascript as well okay well um i'll go ahead and answer that for you zoli and i am going to give some of these over to uh to abby bow and merge but for this question i'll just say javascript is absolutely something everybody should learn it's the lingua franco of the web i think it's a much better place to start than python python is a good second language javascript is the best first language you can absolutely learn python i learned python first but if i could go back in time especially in 2020 where javascript has progressed so much i would definitely learn javascript first so if you look at our curriculum we teach javascript comprehensively you spend a whole lot of time with javascript before you even get to python and that's by design they're both highlevel scripting languages everything you can do with python you can do with javascript python has better libraries for certain things then javascript does javascript has better libraries for certain things than python does you ideally want to know both but if you could only learn one you'd want to learn javascript so i definitely recommend that you do learn javascript and i'd say it's unavoidable if you want to be a developer in 2020 you're going to have to learn javascript it would be like trying to be a business person and not have to learn english or something in 2020 i just don't think it's it's very viable so um we've got some other questions um let's see okay i think does anybody else have any questions i think we've answered all the ones that i see in the chat so i'll give you all a moment to ask the questions but what i want to do right now is i want to talk a little bit about flooring pop who is about to take over the stream this guy's a legend if you haven't heard of him uh he did the 100 days of code challenge boom like no big deal right 100 days of code by the way hashtag 100 days of code check it out if you're new to coding it's a great way to stay motivated while you learn after 100 days of code he did this challenge called 100 projects in 100 days amazing if you look at the different projects he built they are awesome and it shows his genuine breadth of creativity and a lot of other uh cool things he's done uh like there's so many really cool projects many of which we're hoping to eventually convert into take home projects in the interview preparation section of freecodecamp then flooringpop went on his on i think it was on his youtube and he worked through the entire free cocaine curriculum from start to finish building like doing all the lessons and building all the projects and that he did the entire thing in 28 days now keep in mind he's he's a professional developer he's been working as a developer for a while he'd already learned most of that stuff so uh he is not a typical person like a typical person is not going to be able to just sit down and work through a free code camp in 28 days as far as i can tell that's the world record but the fact that he streamed it is really freaking cool and so he's been streaming a ton and now today after this video ends we're handing it over to him on the same stream you don't have to go anywhere you just stay here and he is going to work through the uh the first 100 project euler problems it's it's called project oiler 100 project euler 100 challenge so if he um if he's able to complete the entire thing i think he'll be the first person to complete it formally since we started the pro the challenge now many people probably tens of thousands of people at this point over the last 20 years have completed the first 100 challenges but they are very challenging i mean these are this is when you hear of competitive programming where people get like a you know a vague assignment like here's a data set figure out how to do turn this into this you know things like that that's what project euler is you use all your algorithm all your data structure all your system design all your mathematical knowledge you bring that all to force and you spend a lot of time looking things up and if you watch him stream this you're gonna probably find that he spends a lot of time scratching his head and a lot of time looking things up because that's what real programmers do uh people don't just sit down and bash out like a perfect program like you see in the movies in real life there's a lot of thinking so we're gonna get to watch a lot of that real time uh on this channel so uh there are a few more questions uh i just wanna make sure that i answer them all uh quincy there's one which is has been asked quite a few times is uh what is the prerequisite to start learning python which is you know like it's a very good question i think bo if you want to take that yeah go ahead bro yeah so if you especially if you're going to be using our new curriculum and the using the video challenges we have the python for everybody video challenges and there is absolutely no prerequisites to start going through that it's taught in a way that will it's it's geared toward people that are completely brand new to programming i mean it it's always helpful i mean anytime you know another programming language is helpful but you can go through the python for everybody video challenges on this new beta curriculum with absolutely no prerequisites excellent answer bo so again there are no prerequisites for learning python uh you can just grab uh python for everybody the the free codecamp youtube video or you can just use the free code curriculums new we like broke it down and we added comprehensive comprehension check questions um so if we can show ragesh's screen real quick and by the way i want to thank matthew potter who's been engineering this entire thing he also did lockdown conf he's in the control room here so somebody asked uh are people hiring free code camp grads it's a great question so i am thrilled to announce this is an announcement it's right on our landing page but but if you look we i've gone through and analyzed a lot of the people in the freco camp alumni association which has about 300 000 followers but it has uh i think 55ish thousand people who've claimed certifications here and who who've taken the time to list their certifications on their uh on their linkedin profile so i've gone through and analyzed these and uh from these there are at least 40 000 people who've gotten their first developer job after completing at least part of free code camp 40 000 people so uh just keep that in mind like that's that's like as many alumni as a university might crank out over the course of you know 50 years or something and we've done it in five years now i'm not comparing precocity because they're completely different things but i'm just trying to drive home the scale of the number of people who have used freecodecamp as a tool to prepare for uh the job application process and to get through coding interviews and all that we have an entire section of the the freecodecamp uh of learn bragesh if you want to pull that up it's called interview prep and we have hundreds of algorithm and data structure related challenges that you can go through those are precisely the kinds of things that if if you apply for a job at like amazon or microsoft you're going to see those kinds of uh those kinds of questions come up and we also have a lot of additional projects you can build for practice and things like that and we've got most of rosetta code's major projects rosetta code is another big open source um creative commons licensed project like project euler and we also have just a ton of data structure type things that that our community has built and if you have ideas for projects you'd like to contribute to this or algorithm challenges you'd like to contribute to this this is something we're hoping to dramatically grow over the next year we could go from thousands of hours worth of algorithm challenges to tens of thousands of hours worth like the idea is you should never run out of programming practice on free code camp you can always expand your skills a little bit further all right i don't see any other big questions in the chat people asking about switching from java to a full stack role if you are learning if you've already been working as a developer using java using.net using some of these other tools that are still used widely especially large corporations it shouldn't be too hard to learn javascript or python these are most new projects created are created using you know javascript ecosystem tools like if you go if you look at like linkedin or walmart or netflix these are all websites that heavily use node.js and yes some of them will be using even newer tools like um rust or like uh golang things like that and at certain levels of performance like i think i think they use like haskell or erlang or something so there are real world implementations of all these different languages but if you learn node.js really comprehensively that will open you up to the maximum number of potential jobs and one thing i always emphasize is don't try to specialize before you get the job just be a really strong generalist then apply for jobs and then specialize once you're on the job and an employer is like hey i want you to work on this project for this project you work on 10 devops related projects and suddenly you have a devops skill set that you learned on somebody else's dollar in the field right uh you don't sit at home and say i'm going to become a devops and and just crank through a bunch of linux tutorials and expect to go out and get like a really advanced devops type career generally it's you get in as a more general developer role and then you progress from there or you transition within your current company if you're fortunate enough to still have a job in this massive recession you just talk to people in your engineering department and you gradually do more and more work there and next thing you know you're in the developer bullpen or what will hopefully become the developer office suite post pandemic and you are able to work for that company in that capacity as well so um i just want to thank everybody for tuning in i want to thank everybody who became a member uh or who did super chats during this we are going to have a whole lot of live streams that's one of the final big announcements and we're going to go ahead and hand it over to florian popp who is going to start streaming his amazing attempt at project boiler 100 so stay tuned for that i will still be in chat i'll still answer questions and again just be sure to check the description of the chat we've got a whole lot of uh notes from this if if you want uh and i just want to thank you all for being a part of the free code camp community for making use of these learning resources that so many teachers around the world are contributing to free code camp i want to encourage you all to uh subscribe to the youtube channel if you're not already subscribed and tell your friends and one of the biggest ways you can help is just tell your friends if you have friends who are out of a job uh during this massive global recession if you have friends who are in school who are like i don't know if i want to spend a whole bunch of money to go to university next year if it's just going to be a bunch of zoom calls and google hangouts and stuff like that be sure to tell them about free cocaine because it may pro i don't think free code camp is an alternative to university but certainly if you're looking to take a gap year this could be a really productive way to use that time while you're hanging out with your family or while you're working on different things that you do at home we don't know when social distancing is going to end in certain countries like the government may open up the the open up the economy but maybe a lot of smart people will just stay home because they don't want to get this horrible disease that's going around so whatever happens we're going to be here to help you make the most of your time and your energy and we're going to try our best to make sure that you keep moving forward with your skills and with your career thank you again
