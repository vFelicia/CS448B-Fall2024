hey everyone what's up welcome back to css3 in 30 days also known as code 30 things in 30 days with css3 for the last few days we've been coding some really cool things in css3 building actual practical things and widgets and buttons and clip paths and all these fun little things and we're going to be adding more and more as we go over the following or over the next 30 days and so the purpose of doing this is to help you just build things just jump in and sometimes go in over your head figure out survive and just make it happen make it work and the cool thing is that i'm here to help you the people in the course are here to help you and the final css files are here to help you so you can reference what's going on why did that do that and and that's the purpose of this to push you to help you build things so that you can actually learn how to make things in css and css3 so today in day four we're going to be building and styling up a sexy registration form so jump on over here into my browser and we're going to use css css to style the following web form right here into something visually attractive with a great user experience and of course refer to the final result for some help so this thing doesn't look so nice you know it's it's a form it's not functional but in theory it's functional let's say it created an account you know you enter your name and your email and then or your your email and your password and your create your account you know it's a form it's html it works in theory but it doesn't look good it doesn't have a good user experience or a good user interface so if i scroll down this final result is much more attractive it's got a nice background a cool gradient in the back to pop the the login create an account widget pops up off the background you can enter you know it gives you instructions it's very clear the conventions of this form look very much like what people are used to you know it's very nice and appealing you know you click on an input and it fades in a little bit it's just it focuses it looks nice the button is cool you go to click on it and it kind of has this really neat like kind of a striped effect that grows in the background and then even when you hover over this uh widget itself it almost like shuffles down paper like cards almost like you're holding a deck of cards so it just all around has a neat user experience and user interface so we're going to be doing that in css and css3 over in our code editor i've got a for a folder called sexy registration form it's number four in this module there is a link to download number four sexy registration forms open that up in your code editor of course we have the index with all the markup that you are more than welcome to reference sandbox.css where we are going to be coding our styles and final.css that you can use for reference to see how the final result is built so if you have any problems or mistakes then you can you can go there refer to that and fix up those issues so enter sandbox at css let's get started now before we write a lick of css let's go to our html i know i'm jumping you all over the place here but hang with me and let's see the markup the markup's super simple we have a div with the class of a register wrapper within that we have a div called register block and then in there we have a level three heading a paragraph and then the form itself with three inputs within it an email password and a submit button so very very simple markup just at 4 8 9 10 11 you know like 10 or 11 lines of css very very simple markup then our sandbox is where all the magic is going to happen in our css so let's start off by selecting the register dash wrapper and in there we're going to do the background image and we're going to give it a webkit linear gradient and it's going to be at 135 degrees the color we're going to start with 0 e f f 0 at a 30 color stop and then the next color so comma separate 0 8 8 f 90 at a 90 color stop so those two colors the first color value and the second color value that starts at 30 percent and then uh 90 so that gradient will use those as color stops to give transitions to create an interesting gradient that happens in those specific color stops so what i'm going to do there is i'm going to copy that and make sure we semicolon paste it and instead of webkit linear gradient for the second we're gonna just use linear gradient same values don't worry about changing anything there semicolon and we're gonna say position relative and then the z index will be three padding let's give it 100 pixels on all sides the font size i don't think we need to play around with font size size actually color is going to be triple nine the color of the text within it is gonna be triple nine now save that let's see what we got here in our there we go so check this out we have 135 degree angle it's going down kind of from top left to the bottom right slightly off it's more so going from like here to here i believe you know so whatever 135 degrees is and change the value to see what what happens and then the we got the gradient at the 30 color stop around here and then the 90 color stop here so you could see how they you know if you were to change those color stop values or add more you would see how the gradient changed or if you added more colors with different color stops feel free to play with that just to become familiar the color is triple nine 100 pixels of padding looks good let's go back to our code editor and get back into it so register wrapper and then the asterisk which is basically a catchall it it selects every element within the register wrapper did and we're just going to say box sizing is going to be border box basically the reason why we want to do that is to so that the padding doesn't add any value of any of the elements within there when we add padding we don't want it to add any width to the container we want it to stay within the border box rather than when we add 30 pixels on either side of a 100 pixel box we don't want it to be 160 pixels now because it's added some weight some size we want it to stay within there and just work with this the fixed width so that's the border box property box sizing property rather and then now let's go below that we're going to say register wrapper form and then input so we're selecting all the inputs there's three of them display inline block the width will be 100 percent the padding we're gonna go zero on top and bottom 20 pixels left and right the line height uh is going to be 50 pixels the height will be 50 pixels so this will center the vertically center of the text the background color is going to be white the border will be solid 1 pixel e6 e6 e6 the border bottom width will be three pixels so we'll have a larger bottom border the border radius we're gonna give it something subtle like five pixels and we're gonna do webkit transition uh all 0.3 seconds and ease we've been using that a lot and then copy that paste it and just make it transition all 3.3 seconds ease save that head back to the browser check it out so we have this 100 width like big nice inputs when you click on it it fades some things in there with the transition it fades in the border but that outline kind of messes up the effect a little bit so let's head back and we're going to just probably under here say outline none save that head back over here now that should have taken care of that outline very nice okay so now what we're going to do is head back to our code editor and we're going to select register wrapper form input and then colon and it's going to match not so it matches an element that is not represented by the argument so what are we not selecting here this is a cool css trick here so form input not another colon last child so a virtual element here so matches any element that is the last child of its parent basically we want to select the inputs that are not the last child don't select the last element uh the last input element within the form which is the submit button so that's just an interesting css selector css3 selector way of just saying don't select the input we could have just given an id and just said don't select that or something but this is just a little bit more of a fun way of doing it it's a bit more dynamic margin bottom for the two inputs are going to be 20 pixels save that now head over to your browser you can see that it affected only these two and not this one there's no margin bottom for the create my account button cool now head back to the code editor we're going to select the register wrapper again the form input and then in square braces we're going to select the type attribute and email and then focus separate by comma copy that paste it out three more times change the attribute the type attribute to email and then active as the state and then the third value here is gonna be oh sorry password and that's gonna be focus and then password active remove that last comma curly braces border color let's do triple c save that check it out in the browser when we focus we get this triple c darker kind of gray border and active so you can see that that covers basically when you click on it it changes the border color and gives it just a little bit nicer of a focus which takes care of the fact that we removed the outline created our own outline essentially now let's select the register wrapper again form input but this time we're going to select the type uh and the value the attribute will be submit so we want to select that submit button and change the style up for that one so let's go ahead and say position relative we're gonna go z index one display inline block padding zero and twenty zero on top and bottom twenty left and right pixels of course let's go background color just the background is going to be actually do background color because we're going to be selecting background image later we're going to go f 2 3 9 5 a background size 100 and then we're going to play around with something cool here background image we're going to do the webkit linear gradient and give a little space there because we're going to do something interesting we're going to create stripes now normally what you would do to create stripes you don't have to know this stuff off by heart is you just go to like a linear css3 linear gradient generator online you google that and then you just play around with it and you can do different code snippets and paste it in and you're off to the races no need to reinvent the wheel but here we're going to manually code this out so you can create the striped effect which looks like this over here in the browser so this striped effect so the first value is going to be the degree in which we want the val the stripes to go so 45 degrees first value is rgba we're going to use that because we want to say 255 255 255. 0.15 which is like 15 and then 25 percent color stop now if i left it at that all you're going to get is just one single color we won't see any change there now if i go back to my code editor and add another value say rgba zero zero zero and then zero basically that's like black but you can't see it so it's creating just like kind of an empty chunk at twenty five percent color stop save that let's see what's gonna happen so go over here you're going to see now we actually have a bit of a stripe there it's kind of created at the 25 color stop on the 45 degree angle a bit of something something's going on there now if we change this to like i don't know like 0.8 go over here to your browser you can see that this part is actually the black part it's at 25 to 25 color stop at the 45 degree angle you can see the black but because we want it at zero we don't really want to see it it's going to create this effect uh right there all right so let's just keep moving we're gonna do another line here rgba we're gonna do zero zero zero zero again at the fifty percent color stop save that and you're not gonna see any change there yet until we get to the next value so go down to the next line rgba 255 255 255 comma 0.15 this is white at 15 50 color stop save that head back over to the browser now we got a stripe going on so you can see that at the 50 mark we're starting to make some stripes so carry on carry on back in the browser or the code editor here rgba we're going to go 2d525 do a device 0.15 again at the 75 color stop and let's continue to the next line we're going to say rgba we're going to do that space again with the zero zero zero zero the black at the 75 percent color stop and then last but not least we're gonna do one more rgba zero zero whoops zero zero zero zero at just we're gonna leave it that's just the end save that so if we head over here we can see in our browser it's just pink so something went wrong let's go to our code editor i can see it here i put a comma you might have caught that instead of a decimal just typing too fast not thinking save that head back to the browser put that obviously put that as a decimal head over here you can see the stripes now but they're a little bit large and that's because of the background size so head back here in the code editor we can change that right here in background size we could do something like 20 pixels and then 20 pixels so two values so 20 pixels on the x and y head over here to the browser you can see we've got we've got our stripes that looks cool so now let's continue we're going to say border solid 1 pixel we're going to go f02146 and then we're gonna do border oh border bottom width we're gonna do three pixels again we're gonna say the color is white the outline is none we don't want any outline on there as well cursor and pointer sometimes you need to add that for input that are inputs that are buttons and then webkits transition all 0.3 seconds ease copy that paste it out change it to just transition save it head back over here to the browser we've got a nice neat button that looks nice and consistent beautiful head back to our code editor here now let's play around with the effect when you hover over this button so we're going to say i'm going to tab this in i'm going to say register wrapper form input submit so we're clicking that we're getting that button again but the hover the hover state and we're just changing the background size to 40 pixels 40 pixels so we're going to increase that background size so head over here to the browser hover over that button it just you get that effect so it creates the it transitions the background size to double the size of what it was before you could change it to something really big if you want like 80 and 80 and see what happens so pretty intense a little bit too much to you know i like subtlety so 40 and 40 works for me and now we're gonna go to the next line and we're going to say register title so we're just gonna tidy up a few of these things here register title font size let's do like two rim and then padding bottom 20 pixels margin 0 0 20 pixels border bottom we're going to do dashed 1 pixel e6 e6 e6 save that let's check it out what it looks like nice you know nothing crazy it'll look better once we have a background on the whole wrapper there which we'll do here so let's go down the next line we're going to say register block and now we're going to style that up we're going to go position relative we're going to say display block width is 100 max width is 300 pixels so that's like so it can be responsive up to a maximum of 30 sorry 300 pixels margin and we're going to just say zero auto because i don't think we have any yeah zero auto so it'll center it padding will be 30 pixels background we'll do white box shadow let's add some box shadows 0 0 and 50 pixels and rgb a there we go 0 0 0 0.2 so it'll be like a very subtle black box shadow and then border radius 5 pixels save it let's check out what the register block looks like check it out looks nice already looks nice and subtle i like it i like it however when i'm looking here the font size is a little bit too big all around so let's go up to the top of our css here and we're going to go register wrapper and change the font size i'm going to change the font size let's do one ram and see what that does does it make it smaller uh it does make it smaller over here in the browser except for the headline is a little little bit large which is down here in our code editor we did that in the register title 2 ram let's make that 1.2 ram 1.2 too small maybe 1.6 ram there we go that looks much better here in the browser okay back to what we were doing in the first place so we did the register block now what we want to do is create that cool effect check this out when we hover over it we get that kind of like shuffling card effect let's go to our sandbox again and we're going to create that so the register block i'm going to tab this in because it's related register block the before pseudo element and comma the register block after pseudo element we're going to style both those up position absolute z index negative one because it's going to be behind the parent container zero top uh left uh right and bottom are all going to be zero and now we're going to say display block width 100 height 100 so it matches the original element the register block elements height and width content needs to be an empty string so that uh so these pseudo elements will actually appear if you don't have that then they won't show up that's something that a lot of web developers beginner web designers and developers forget background we're going to say white border solid 1 pixel e6 e6 e6 okay and then we're going to do border radius we're going to match what was uh we're going to match the rest of it at 5 pixels now what we're going to do is we're going to scale them so if i save this and check it out you won't really see anything nothing's going to be there so we're going to scale these and then we're going to create a hover effect that makes them appear so we're going to say webkit transform scale 0.9 it's a little bit smaller translate 0 and 0. copy that paste it out we're going to change that to just transform beauty and then transition is going to be all 0.3 seconds ease all right so that one is done you're not going to see that at all yet until we create this next effect which is going to be register block it's going to be hover so when we hover over the register block we're going to style the before pseudo element let's say webkit transform scale so i'm just going to paste what we had there scale but we're going to change it to something slightly larger 0.96 so it's not the same size as the as the original register block and the translate this is the x and y offset 16 pixels down on the y axis this one's just gonna be transform and copy this out right below register block hover and after we're gonna make this one even just a little bit smaller than the than the before pseudoelement and this one's gonna be 32 pixels down now i'm going to save this but i'm going to comment this out first and show you what that first one does so save that check this out in the browser hover and that first that before pseudoelement pops down and that's pretty cool so now what we're going to do is head back here uncomment what we just coded up save that and let's see what happens so watch this do you see how the after pseudo element is appearing in front of the before suit element that's because it is after cascade in the cascading style sheet and it's going to appear in front so that's why we use zed index so that's where we're going to go here for the before we're going to say z index is going to be negative 1 because that's what it originally is and for the after pseudo element we want this one to be z index negative 2. so it's actually behind the before pseudo element back to the browser hover there it is just like that now if you wanted to do another really cool effect here let's try something i want to do this ease so that i'm going to try and make it so that they both don't come down at the same time i want to make the after pseudo element come down just a little bit later so let's see if we can try that we're going to say you see here we have before and after have the same transition let's just add one more line here and say register block after and we're going to make it have a different transition time all you can even do something like transition delay yeah let's do the delay we want it to delay by oh very very subtle like point two seconds that might be well let's just see what happens okay check this out here in the browser with the 0.2 second delay watch what happens it's kind of a little bit weird so let's make that delay really small like maybe even 0.05 seconds and now let's check it out see how it has kind of like it's like it's chasing i like that cool it works for me so that's just a cool little effect and so there we go there we have our sexy registration form that we built in css and css3 using a bunch just css css3 no images no photoshop none of that i hope you enjoyed this lesson it was a little bit long thanks for hanging in with me there building a cool sexy registration form i'll see you tomorrow in day 5 of css 3 in 30 days bye now
