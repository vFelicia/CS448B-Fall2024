hey everybody welcome to live coding with Jesse it's good to be back I know it's been a while since I streamed maybe glass Wednesday might have been the last stream so a lot has happened since then the first thing I like to do is just catch you up on any all the changes in the site and then we'll move into the routing so just to let you know I've currently broken a lot of stuff on the site I have not committed the broken stuff obviously but that's we're gonna jump right into me being in the middle of setting this up so I'm gonna explain how I got to this point but just wanted to give you all warning so since last week or at some point at the end of last week I gave another presentation about this site got great feedback from that as well everybody who was pretty happy not really a lot of big changes needed to happen so the site still pretty much looks the same if you really want to know about any little details that may have been updated you can always check out the github repo try to have descriptive commit messages when when I can but the updates have been a pretty pretty minimal at this point I've been doing a lot of stuff with just getting links to go where they're supposed to go and I've been working with the routing so not a lot that would actually change the look of the site but I like when I present to a different group I like to try to get the links that that group would be interested in working otherwise I went on I did an interview for a fullstack engineer position I actually made a video on just like a recap of my interview and some advice that I have so that's on my channel so links in the description if you want to check that out it's it's available I that just went live it took awhile to upload and process so it actually just went live a few minutes ago and I think I think that's it for my for my recap I thought there was gonna be more than that alright so let me switch over let me switch over to my other screen so you all can see what's going on also for everybody who's new here this stream is just me going through my daily job as a frontend developer I'm employed fulltime at a small University and although today we're gonna be working on some you know backend stuff occasionally we do occasionally we go full stack here but primarily front end so today the way this is gonna work is I'm I'm gonna set a timer for 25 minutes and we're gonna code for 25 minutes then I'm going to take five minutes I'm gonna look at the live chat answer any questions that you have and we'll probably repeat that twice then at the end I'll answer any questions that are left in the live chat so you have questions go ahead and put them in there and just kind of you know be patient until I can get to them also this is very interactive so if you see that I'm doing something and you have no idea what I'm doing ask a question or if you have a better idea put it in the the live chat I frequently end up changing my plans because someone in the live chat has something better so feel free to to join in and there are a lot of people in the live chat that are more experienced than I am so if you ask a question you may get an answer from one of them that that's you know pretty awesome alright so let me set the timer I'll put it on here on this screen so everyone can see when we go back here someone set that 25 minute timer and I'm also going to set this n grukk server now I did let everyone know at the beginning so if you didn't catch it this the site is currently in a semi broken state because I'm messing with some ideas that I had for the router and that it has basically it worked to solve the problem that I was trying to solve but it caused a bunch of other problems while when I did it so now I'm at the point of like how do I make this work in a way that doesn't break other stuff so I'm gonna paste a URL right now onto the live chat and if you go to that URL you'll be able to see the site as I'm working on it and just in case you can't go to that you are right now I will show you what's going on with that I'd say here and this is this is what we have so you'll notice it's going to be hard to see but the URL right now is localhost / academics / ug / majors and we haven't had any URLs like that so far where we had like three three things at the end of the URL the most we've been able to deal with us so that's why I had to mess with the router to try to get this to work but you can see since I did that our style sheets are coming through and our logos are coming through so basically everything we're trying to bring in from that static folder is not working so at least we're at a point where we know a lot about the problem right so that's a good good starting point so let me go over and show you in the code what's happening so we'll be focusing mostly on on this area here just to make some more space let's get rid of that sidebar we'll shrink this up as well and so this is what I've I've done I've taken this universal route and let me know if this is too small and you can't you can't see what's going on also hey everyone I forgot to say hi everybody's saying hi in the end the chat so so say hello then it just says sup Jesse Pinkman that's a reference to Breaking Bad if you've never seen the show that's why I was definitely not in the show but there is a character named Jesse so I took this Universal route which right now just grabs the type and the ID so in our example here you know the typing the ID would be academics and then ug but then what happens with this majors over here so what I did was I copied and pasted this entire thing and I put in type sub type and ID so now we're getting all three parts of that URL and then I went in and I change did I change I'll know what I changed it back I I did change some things in here and then I realized that I didn't have to change that much so I undid it so basically I copy and pasted that and then now what happens is when I go to see what page I was trying to get to oh that when they when it picks up that the type is academics it tries to send the data to the page component which is what we wanted and I'm still only sending the type in the ID so I just completely skip this sub type here which for this use case works going forward we may run into a situation where that no longer works and we'll have to figure out something better but for right now this works and it just goes through and it does exactly what this other one had done which is simply past the type and the ID into the component from the component we make a call using Apollo and graph QL to WordPress which we have the WP graph QL plugin installed there and then WordPress sends the data back through the WP graph QL plugin and then react can render the page and then that page gets sent to the browser to the users browser so all that's still working the problem is somewhere along the line and we can see it here in in the terminal hopefully it's still up here so what's happening is Wow okay there's so much stuff let's see if we can get it okay so we we have this is a good example so anytime we're getting a static file it reads it a static image in an ID because our our routes here in our file so we have the static file and then image everything within our static files is two levels deep so that gives us a URL with those three parts so I I guess what's happening is it's it's trying to take those and treat them as you know our usual route so I have an idea and let's see if we can if this will work if this idea works then this is gonna be like a very special stream that that my idea for the fix actually works so what I'm gonna try to do is just wrap everything in and if stamen so let's say if type so this will be rec params type equals static whoops is sorry is not equal and I'm silly because I already have that if statement right here alright so there we go so nikki is actually the one that created a lot of this so I've done very minimal editing to his original routing function and I forgot it in so he had already come across some of these issues before and put in this as statement so because there were some other things that are doing this so now we're just going to add that at if statement and say if the type is equals static we're not gonna go through this let's see if it doesn't mean let's see if it works oh you know what Nikki's apology apologizing for the spaghetti nassif the code don't even worry about it this is this code is awesome this definitely did what it was supposed to do and you know we've just come across some extra use cases that we didn't even realize at first so we're just gonna have to keep adding on to it I think to handle this AHA yes okay cool so that worked now I'm going to try to go to another page and see if it broke our other pages so first the home page excellent home page seems to be working and now let's go to I think this works yeah this works excellent excellent okay very cool all right cool so that part of the routing works now I'm sure this can be reflected somehow because we have a lot that we're just reproducing here so I don't know that I'm gonna be refactoring this right now during the stream but just just so you know I wouldn't I really would rather not leave it like this that adds quite a bit of length but for now this is working so before I had to do this what I was working on was trying to edit our object here that allows us to put in a lot of different routes and get some more of these pages working so if you weren't if you haven't joined us for some of the previous streams you might not know what we're trying to do here but we're taking an old site and we're completely redoing it so the entire back end the database content management system front end everything totally redone but what we need to do is try to keep the URLs the same because we've this site's been around for a long time it's built up a lot of links some you know external links pointing back to the site so we need to keep those intact and in fact one of the things that the the vicepresident of admissions here at the University asked about and he was very positive about the site but one of the things he asked about was is this gonna break any of the links so he was very pleased to hear that we're doing everything we can to make sure it doesn't break the links but that's definitely a concern and that's a legitimate concern you know there's a lot of materials that have links to different parts of the site so emails that go out and printed brochures and things like that those and all be changes because we got a new site you know it can't be changed right away that costs a lot of money and takes time and you can't exactly recall what's already out there if it's already been given to people okay so let's go to the last thing I was working on and this was this this academics link so here's what I was let me just walk you through the last few steps I did so we're all on the same page and I just realized my Spotify has not been going for I think since I started my playlist just ended and all right let's put on something those alright I'm gonna let you decide what I'm gonna listen to so I have some old school 90s rap I have some like dubstep and I have some old school 90s rock music put in the live chat right now what you think I should listen to 90s rap 90s rock or dubstep and I'll check back in the live chat just a couple of seconds whoa looks like rock rock rock rock rock alright cool that this seems pretty all we do have a dubstep we have alright so we have some other things in there but it looks like 90s rock definitely one James s if 90s rap includes Tupac it does it most certainly includes Tupac but I think Rock one out so I'm starting it up now and looks like this is one of those playlists as Spotify just makes for you so it looks like I have Pearl Jam sublime REM Nirvana Red Hot Chili Peppers looks like a decent playlist so far cool all right so here's what I was doing I was tryin to get this route for the majors so it's been a long time since we even checked looked at the routing but basically to get to a page that displays information about a particular major for like a prospective student who wants to check out our what we offer here you just type in the URL so in this case would be localhost / and then like economics or accounting or whatever major we have which is a little bit weird that it's not we it would make more sense if it was like local o slash major slash whatever it is so it made it a little bit difficult so what needs to happen is we need to add routes for every single one of these so for some reason I could not get these routes to work and I worked on it for longer than I want to admit this morning and realize that I simply did not have any piece of content that had the slug of economics that I could grab from WordPress that was probably my problem all along and what I had which is basically this probably works right away it would have worked so anyway so that's what I was going through here but then I also have a page to display all the majors unfortunately when I brought the data over that was in an entirely different category so it's it's like under academics so that's what got me onto this academic section and eventually got me onto whatever that page was that we were just on so let me go back there we go academics undergraduate majors so now that's why I even had to mess with this page I don't like this URL but for now like we have to keep it active so what I should be able to do now since I have well let's go to economics since I know that data is correct I should be able to good economics from here and the link was supposed to work cannot query field economics pages it shouldn't be clearing the field economics pages it should be majors unless it's case sensitive I don't know why it would be but I guess we could try it it might be case sensitive no it's not yep I think it's casesensitive all right so we're gonna have to fix that you know in our routing so it seems like some of the links that we've just brought over from the old database have capital letters in them and all of our lengths here we're checking for lowercase so let's find I want to try to figure out where we can do this so we only have to do it once or maybe twice so let's take it out referenced maybe I'll just make another let's make another like a variable here I think that'll be the best oh you know what I can't I can't just set type here so what I wanted to do is said let type equals no type let me let me check the live chat quickly here let's see Nicki says at the end where the options object is construction constructed you can lowercase there thank you awesome I knew there had to be there had to be something type so we can go to lowercase to lowercase and I'll also need to do it down here since I now have double and there the ID you know what maybe we ought to do it for the idea as well I don't I haven't come across the case would that be an issue but doesn't take long to put in another to lower case alright so I'm gonna save that and then we're going to give it another try what is the difference here well this is silly and I shouldn't have to manually restart the server but maybe I'll try so let me hit save see Ikki says that an entire object can go and be inlined into rendering cache by the way that's for when it gets refactored okay cool Thank You Nikki all right so I'm just shutting down the server bringing it back up scene if we have now that's that's silly okay so I'm just I'm gonna do this just to test it out and make sure that I'm actually worrying about the right thing so I'm gonna make economics like this so we'll also have the uppercase version and it should work if that's really the issue okay yeah that is the issue so it seems like our to lowercase down there is too late okay I'm gonna check my timer all right about two minutes so about two minutes I'm gonna go back to the live chat so if you put any questions in there just hang on for a few more minutes and and I'll get to those okay so you know down here when I'm changing it to lowercase that's that's too early because it's trying to look things up in this translation object here and it's trying to look up economics with a capital e and it doesn't exist so we need to move that to lowercase up higher this seems like something this really seems like something that later on could be done at the level of nginx which we're going to use as our reverse proxy on the server I'm assuming that we could do something in nginx that would take everything in the URL and make it lowercase before it even gets to this point but I would like this to be functional for the demos coming up the more the site that is functional the better it will seem to the people I'm presenting it to so we can think of something it doesn't have to be a spectacular solution because ultimately it'll probably be temporary until we get this on a real server so that's what we'll do when I come back from this break so let me go back over here have about 15 seconds left so I'm just going to start this break right now and go over to the live chat and I'm gonna start way up at the top so if you asked the question just a minute or two ago I may not get to it in this five minutes but I'll do my best all right so have a question from I'm gonna have to use Google Translate on this because this is not in my normal alphabet so let me get Google Translate going on my other screen bow Don so bow Don asks can I incorporate view will react in one of my simple HTML pages with further upload to basic hosting without changing the web hosting plan I think you can I think there's a way to use react I I don't know very much at all about view so I really can't answer that but in terms of react I think there's a way that you can bring in react to your project just like with a script tag I've never done it though but I kind of remember when I was going through like the tutorial phase of react like the beginner tutorials that there was a way you could do it so if anybody has any experience with that please let bowdoin know and if I yeah I can't remember exactly I suppose the the official react documentation would probably have something in there about it so I would check their IB Shaykh says was that the one you're going for in the last coding session I assume you're talking about the interview thing yeah yeah so I think the last time that I talked to you all in a live livestream I was talking about going on that interview hmm sorry yeah so that was the that was the interview so I'm not gonna say a lot about it in the stream because I just did that video so if anybody I'm sure a lot of people in the stream don't care how the interview went so I'm gonna save and then if you do care check out the video and you can ask me any questions you want about it as well I'm you know I'll answer those michael says congrats on the interviews thanks thanks I appreciate it Alexi says Wow everything is looking really nice yeah the site is actually looking you know pretty nice up maybe I'll go through and just kind of scroll through some of the stuff that that's working I can't remember how much I had done the last time we strained I know I had done some things like before a presentation it gotta make it look nicer and I'm not sure if I showed you all that let's see buhbuhbuh John Shay I'm sorry if I'm mispronouncing your name let me know I'm supposed to pronounce it but it says why so much hardcoded stuff in in the router or lots hardcoded we're really it's because I have to keep these routes from the old site and so far this is the best way that that I've been able to come up with that we you know it's not just me we've other people who've been helping out with it especially Aniki but it's kind of the best way we've come up with to try to keep those routes so we can't really use the default routing system that comes with next jazz because we need to try to keep these routes working from the old site and if you're referring to some of the other interior pages why the charge code is stuff for right now things are hardcoded just because I needed to get them in for presentations but at some point there'll be very very little hardcoded and nearly all the data will be pulled from from elsewhere I John Hanson says have you heard of github probably marked down to JSX bring over the marked up data from WordPress you can override markup to a consistent style and I believe it won't be dangerously set innerhtml okay interesting all right well maybe want to check that out I'm not yeah right now I'm not worried about using dangerously dangerously set enter HTML because I'm pretty much aware of what's what's in the data but yeah at some point that might not be a bad idea to get away from it sorry I'm yawning so much I wasn't feeling well yesterday and I think I'm still not a hundred percent I just kind of sluggish and tired I didn't have any coffee this morning I I'm gonna mark down where I'm at in the live chat and the timers up so I'm gonna have I'm gonna go back to coding numb and then I'll come right back to where I left off and get through the rest of the questions but I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you just I'm gonna take a couple seconds here and tell you why I didn't get coffee this morning and I'm gonna sound like one of the laziest people I'm sure but in the morning usually I drop off my kids at school around like 8 a.m. so I did that this morning if I'm being honest though it was like 10 after a day there I was a little late this morning but so I dropped them off about 10 minutes after 8 a.m. and then I have to drive by a McDonald's to get to where I work and I downloaded this new McDonald's where you can just put your order in the app and then sit in the parking lot and somebody will bring it right out to you right which is which is really cool especially like the weather has been really cold lately so it's nice to not have to go walk through like a slushy icy parking lot you know in my dress shoes right uhhuh and I know I could just go through the drivethru but this is even better I can just sit there right and I just saying this that sounds super lazy but anyway the app wasn't working today so instead of just going through the drivethru like a normal person I thought well you know forget this I'm not going I can't use the app and just sit in my car I'm not going so I didn't so I didn't go I didn't get any coffee this morning it's like so I all day I've been wanting coffee and I just haven't had coffee because I'm I was too lazy to actually just sit in my car and drive through a drivethru anyway I sound so terrible know that I said that out loud but if you haven't used that a bit if the app is actually pretty nice it takes all the pressure off like when you go through the drivethru it's like you don't want to take too long for your order because people are waiting in the same way if you're in the store like you're in a line and but if you're just sitting in the parking lot on your app like you can take all the time in the world to figure out what you really want I check on my coupons against anyway enough about McDonald but the coffee's not too bad and it's pretty cheap so that's why I just stop there sometimes all right so we all right this is where we're at we need to fix this right so the idea is I just got a little noise in my headphone so we see so Steve I got a message from work okay I don't think so I think it was just Twitter okay Michael Chris's firstworldproblems yeah most definitely a first world problem I just the more I told you about that the more I just felt like dude like I'm so terrible that I'm even complaining about this this this this is not a real issue okay let me get rid of this thing on the side just give us some more space okay so we need to do then is add our to lower case higher up so I guess we can remove it from here so let me just kind of hit undo a bunch of times oops there we go all right so we're gonna get rid of our to lower case there Oh what's up all right is this it's Ju Li oh is it Julio or Julie oh let me know I want to pronounce it right server set k sensitive routing true or case sensitive routing false awesome okay so app dot set case sensitive routing false so cool so you're saying I can just do should I do yeah apt outset or server right now I think probably sir if that's for Express I'm calling Express to the server so let's try it this way first oops server dot sets okay whoops close see if that doesn't Rubin says looks like you have a scar on your face did you slay a dragon yeah I don't know if you could see of like right there is the scar no unfortunately I didn't do anything quite as cool was that although I mean if the dragon was pretty chill I don't know if I really want to slay it but my daughter Cordelia who's one thinks it's hilarious to just like slap you and scratch people right so that's that's what she did so she was just being so sweet sitting on my lap and all of a sudden she's just like BAM and and got me like all down here and then she just smiled laughed cuz I guess that makes sense to a oneyearold actually you know what here's what I'm thinking though the casesensitive routing might not this still might not solve our if our issue like I mean assuming I did this right and didn't mess something up I still don't think it'll solve our issue because the problem isn't really with the router the problem is in how we're you know we're calling this this object and trying to look up and match things so what we really need to do is make sure that whatever gets passed into this object is lowercase so I don't know that this would would switch everything to lowercase or not if it is and I'm mistaken please let me know but otherwise I think we we ought to manually set yeah we need to manually set this all right I'm gonna try something that right now to me seems really silly like there's no way it would work but we'll see so let's go and type equals I'll try it out hahaha it did work Wow okay I can't sometimes stuff that's just like us there's no way this will work this just seems too easy here's the thing I want to make sure that this will still this will still work so I guess we're always gonna have a tight though aren't we yeah yeah we'll always have a tight should we do the same thing with ID I guess but maybe we should say let's let's make this conditional so whoops so if this exists then we're gonna make it this otherwise it's gonna be null and we'll do the same thing here okay does this make sense so I want to check first because I'm not sure if I would get an error on this but if I try to do to lowercase or something that doesn't exist I'm assuming that that's not then it's not even let me do that oops what's going on here it doesn't like it without it it needs a space there okay and then I can take this and copy it down into our other one down here and yeah so that would work all right Nikki says that that definitely will cause errors so it's good to have the check Michael said that that second one so I did catch that one in the second one so I had typed here and I shouldn't have all right Nikki says type is required so the check should pass always fast in that case that's what I thought that it wouldn't even come through here unless there was a type but I'll leave it in there now let's see I don't think you need that before equals what if it's so we have some some questions your says ah mrs. what if it's not a string it's I don't know I mean it should be a string so it's coming through the the URL I mean can we put anything in a URL I mean yeah technically I could just put numbers in but wouldn't it still come through as a string if it's in a URL I don't know I mean I was just assuming that anything coming through a URL would be a string and ducks she not sure I pronounced that let me know how you'd like it pronounced says I think you don't need that before equals and and null I'm not exactly sure what you're saying I don't know why I'm not I may be I'm just missing something so if you can clarify a little bit I'd appreciate it okay so I'm not sure about this whether or not this is doing anything for now should we I don't know if we should leave it or just get rid of it let me think if there's a case if all our routing is coming through yeah I think we'll probably be fine without it but we can put it back in if we we need to later on I wonder what the default is for Express if the default is is case sensitive or not case sensitive okay here we are and I would like to check out a page that uses both type and ID just to make sure we haven't broken anything so let's go to let's go to our student profile this should use as student profiles yep yep this still works okay cool all right since we have that I did say I'd scroll through this quickly so you all could see what we have so some changes that you may have seen depending on when the last stream you watched was we've gotten rid of all the social media icons up top and our our button up here it's a lot more clean we have you know just four menu items and our our search we've gone to a larger version of the logo that actually says the word Franciscan instead of just F us we still using the F us in this menu and on mobile we've changed up some of the names of the menu items so not not really a big deal but some of them are changed we've added in this xsf us was up here in the button and now it's here I think we've added a few other things and change the name of some things and then on here I did change the buttons so the buttons are now this is I I call them inverted buttons I'm not exactly sure where I got that from I'm I probably got it from somewhere I'm not claiming I made that term up but I've been using it for so long that I can't remember I got it from so anyway these are nice because they show more of the background which is kind of cool I think I'd still like to mess with the fonts and things probably needs a bigger font we've added in a little section to explain a bit more about the university about it in this kind of banner section as well and then I've just taken some of these these student profile cards and instead of using them just for student profiles we've used them for other types of information and that's about it and everything on mobile of course is still you know very much the same I think it actually looks nicer on a phone than on a desktop at this point which is I mean that's how we've been designing it okay let me see all right cool we've got about nine minutes left here all right so I was I believe I was showing yeah I was showing this page and then it didn't work because we had gone yeah so I was showing the majors page and then clicking the links and majors and realized that that didn't work if the URL was capitalized so that's how we got to here but it was I'm actually really glad that we found that bug better to find it now than you know for someone else to find it in one of my presentations it would have been the end of the world you know I I definitely let people know it's still work in progress but still it's good to good to make the mistake live here in front of all of you on YouTube than to make the mistake in front of 12 people in a conference room on campus right I'm not sure that that's actually better one way or the other all right well actually I just got some feedback on this so let's go over this feedback while we work here and that way you all can contribute here let's see oh Michael did say even though you already did the interview I'm still going to work on the seating manager I've almost got the lube for requested seats for missing something okay cool Michael that's awesome actually for the react version of it I opened up a bunch of issues for stuff that I'd like to do that didn't have time to do so I don't know I keep going back and forth on whether I should keep working on it and I'm trying to think of some like useful thing like if it could fulfill a purpose that you know people need this then I think it'd be cool to you know finish it and they get available to people let's see Michael crew any of Michael was referring to the project that I had to turn in before my interview so if you want to check that out check out my my github account and it's a CD manager so I have nodes seating manager which is the command line version of it and then I react seating manager which is the web app version so you check those out and you know just do whatever you want with them they're definitely available for you to take the code or contribute or do whatever you want they're just kind of fun projects now so Michael says I didn't notice Evangelization I'm starting like faith and life better yeah this was I I usually don't have much of a say and in decisions like this my only thing is please keep them short because it's easier to work with shorter menu items so yeah I don't know if it's going to stay evangelization or not I kind of hope it isn't I did ask in in the meeting where this was decided I said you know is there another word that's shorter than this that we could use so we'll see how it goes yeah I'm with you I'm just not sure I have to be honest with you I think a lot of rethinking of what's actually in these menus needs to happen and I'm not really the person that's gonna be doing that it's gonna be my boss most likely so I kind of hope that happens but right now I I can't really do much about it and Nikki says maybe make the apply button not seethrough and the other two inverted the button hierarchy primary versus secondary okay that's interesting so we could have apply so I would kind of look like this so apply would hmm I'm have to think about that and look at that what do you all think does it does it look like to at a place to have two different button styles right next each other or does that make sense and it definitely makes a ply stand out compared to the other ones yeah I'm not sure about it I definitely if the goal is to make apply stand out it definitely achieves that goal I'm just I don't know ix the more I look at it and more I kind of like it alright to think more about that okay cool well let's go all right at about four more minutes Sean saying maybe the logo colors for the button colors yeah we did have the buttons were colored they weren't the logo colors so they were are the this yellow color that's also in our color palette something we definitely could go with colors this is the kind of thing that I actually think this would be great for a be testing so once we do launch try out different variations of these buttons and see which one gets the best response like the most clicks I think yeah I think I'd like to do that so whatever whatever you end up going with for presentations and for launches I guess it won't matter that much because I think it would be worthwhile to test out different variations on our audience so it looks like don't make them transparent maybe a light green background yeah maybe we can mess with different different colors I've got to be careful here though because now that we're talking about different colors and transparencies and things I could spend a lot of time on this alright so I'm gonna make a decision here and just say I like these ideas but I think these are good ideas to implement after we launch and to test them so that way we'll have data if somebody comes back somebody I work with comes back and says what do you do to the buttons they look terrible I can at least say we're testing them and you know based on this data these buttons give us the best response I think that'll be that'll be easier in terms of like right now trying to explain why we do buttons one color the other is just going to be pretty much based on why I think this looks good and that's really kind of a hard argument to win against other people too but if we have data to back it up then you know you can't really argue against that if I say hey we're getting twice the amount of clicks on these buttons and you probably can even if someone thinks the buttons ugly if we're getting more clicks we get more clicks let's see Michael sit no don't do that looking on mobile change the border color and font colors let's see yeah actually let's check this out on mobile to mobile I think is where you really get the benefit of these buttons because the buttons cover up way more of the image on mobile so an inverted button actually is nicer or a you know button with a transparent background Roland says the one filled in is more readable yeah it definitely is more readable I am gonna increase the font size I wanted to increase the font size before but when I did it through these out of alignment and I had a hard time getting them aligned and so I just quit messing with it because I had to go to a presentation and I never got back to it let's see Sean says are the harmony says the font color blends in with the lab coat yeah you're right you're right it does blend in with the lab coat I did put you know the I kind of dark in this image a bit to try to you know combat that but you're right it's not it's not really I mean this image will likely not always be the image in the background so I shouldn't worry too much about it but yeah we do want people to be able to read it now on a phone it's it's harder to tell but like on a desktop you hover over it and then it's it's readable so it's not as much of an issue on a desktop but you don't have that same hover effect that wonderful I guess you can click but at that point it's like why would you click if you can't Sean says yeah true my final thought was maybe a white apply button in the bottom buttons green and then on hover invert well seems like we have way more options than I even thought of so yeah so I think I'm just gonna make sure that I save your comments and then that way I can refer back to them whenever we start doing our testing Michael says didn't we do this last week we were coming up with a bunch of redesign ideas an hour before presentation yep yeah that's true I remember that now yeah some of it was really helpful though and I did actually say in the meeting like oh yeah you know the people on YouTube told me to do this so I didn't take credit for it act my the head of my department actually really liked how clean this looked and I know it was you all that suggested taking out all of those social media icons so during the meeting I took them out during the meeting and and everybody really liked it okay so my timer is up and let me commit this good it's we're gonna add and then I'm gonna do a yarn CM right and that's gonna give us let's make this a bit bigger I don't know if Onis it bug fix let's do a new whoops did I yeah feature so let's say and roster three parameters alright that that's good no okay all right cool so I'm gonna make I want to make sure that that gets up so that you all can check out what we've just done and I've you know what I tell you the truth I see that Michael says it was a bug fix the lower case I didn't remember about the the lower case thing and so after I started typing the message so you are right that would have been better categorized as either just a completely a bug fix or part of it not in part of it but since it was all in the same file we couldn't really couldn't really check it out oh yeah nikki says and the static checking the route Wow it's I should have split everything that we did up into three commits because we did do three like very different things even though it was all based on routing so that would have made it much easier to categorize it and pick a good commit message so I'll have to remember to do that next time to maybe do smaller chunks it was alright so now everything is available in the repository the link is in the description so y'all can check that out if you want you can contribute if you want comment on what we did or you can take the code and use it in your own project if you like it's all you know an open source freely available to use let's say ok so now I'm gonna go through and answer all the remaining questions so if you have any questions please put them in the chat right now ok and I'm good to go I have in about 50 minutes I have a meeting so I don't think there's enough questions that it'll take up 50 more minutes but just to let you all know definitely can't go longer than 15 minutes all right so I'm going to scroll up a bit and keep going where we left off the last time Aleksey says this is still the Franciscan site looks almost done yeah it is still the Franciscan site and it looks pretty good at this point the thing that so the big things that aren't done right now are all the data is not migrated over and then even the stuff that is migrated over isn't linked up properly so that you can actually get to it from the website so I'm going to be focusing most of my time when I'm not streaming on moving data over and getting that router full of all the routes that we need also Harshit set up for us a file I are actually I really want to show this to you all and because it's it's kind of an important thing we have now that will let our clientside routing work where's my data is it in here I thought it was in there let me shut some of these menu all right here it is so we have this as URL now so not only do we have a link URL but we're also kind of manually passing in some of these things that go into the router so you could see like the the type so we have the page what is going to so basically like what template component do we want to render this data so in this case we want the page component the type meaning the like the graph QL type that we're requesting it's academics pages and then the ID is majors right so that's how we get client side routing to work otherwise I think we are still getting a page refresh when we were clicking that's not what we want so it we should be able to get server side rendered pages on the first load but then after that we shouldn't have another page refresh so in order to make that happen we now have this extra thing so in any of our links we need to add this so for now like we're pulling in data but if we were to manually add a link somewhere like hardcoded and you know we'd have to add this you know it's kind of extra information in so that was pretty good work I didn't even notice what was happening Harsha noticed I believe it was hard to notice it and came up with the fix for that so that was pretty awesome I assume Harshad is sleeping right now he should be is it's pretty late in in the Himalayas right now but anyway our should if you end up seeing this at some point thank you for that but as you can see I don't I don't have it all filled out so I'm gonna have to do that as well Rufus's URL end points aren't dynamic I'm not 100% sure would what you're asking so I let me answer what I think you're asking please let me know if it's not a good answer to your question but the URL endpoints so essentially some of them are and some of them aren't right so like these are going to have to be like there's going to be some like this where you know we're actually hard coding in these routes but then there's also going to be some more like let's see so like HR these human resource pages we have a bunch of pages that are going to be HR slash and then something and that's where the ID comes into play so as long as we have content that matches up with that ID in our WordPress database it can render out thousands of pages that would be like /hr slash you know whatever you want at the end so it's kind of a mix of some hard coded routes and some routes that are I've been calling them parameterised so that's that's kind of where we're at right now and I think I mentioned earlier the reason for that is because we have to keep URLs the same as we've had them before so if we were able to just build the site from scratch and have our own URL structure we wouldn't need all of this stuff unfortunately we we do have to keep the URL structure so we're gonna have kind of a big messy object here and a lot of stuff down here as well but the result is going to be well worth it right we don't want to lose out and have broken links and lose out on SEO and all that so I mean that takes years and years to build up so if we have to spend a few extra hours keeping that it's definitely worth it netskope says I know this is web development but do you have any ideas for a csharp project I could do I'm almost one semester ahead of my class and completed my extra projects I got to Wow I'd say truth I don't I don't know I don't have ideas for anything that would be like csharp but specifically good for csharp what do you all think what's a good csharp related project I mean I just kind of know there are always basic ones that people do like do a todo list or a calculator or you know but those are all kind of boring and really basic rubenesque do you work out a lot I've been working out every day for like five or six weeks now I kind of lost count but pretty much every day one day I just kind of did some stretching because I didn't really have a lot of time but other than that I've been working out every day this morning I did not work out I was tired and my three all just wanted to cuddle so I just counted with him and but I do plan on working out when I get home to keep my street going oh I've been working out I make sure I do a little bit of cardio like at least a half an hour and then I have been doing some weights and things like that so this is all kind of new for me though before that it was very much like I worked out sporadically you know I'd do a couple days here and there and then I might go like two weeks without doing anything so I'm trying I'm trying really hard to do that mostly for my mental health really I mean it's nice to you know be a little bit stronger but it's it helps me with with depression to get that workout in so in addition to medication and counseling you know the workouts a big thing as well so I've been trying to keep my sleep schedule you know on target eating a little bit more regularly and better and then also with with the exercise so so far it's it's pretty good tell you truth lately I've it's like I don't know I haven't been I've been a little bit more down than usual lately I'm not sure why but for the most part over the last month or so I've felt really good okay we have some questions about there was a question a long time ago about react and putting it in a regular HTML project so we'll have some followup to that so where do you put react other than a script tag that is don't you just source react start Jess I think it depends it depends on how you're bringing in react so like on a project like this you know we are bringing in react here we're importing it right into the components but we've used create react app on a regular HTML project I suppose you could you could use the CDN like as was mentioned in the live chat as well so I suppose you would just use the script tag and link to the CDN that would be the easiest way to do it BBJ says hello all the way from Nepal hey how's it going thanks for watching Michael says by the way don't use that camera angle for the recap again the gray hairs in your beard really stand out yeah I am so he's referring to the video that I just put on my my chin my youtube channel that was the interview recap so yeah I that was the first time I tried to do a video with my phone so my phone camera is even the frontfacing camera is much better resolution than the one on my iMac so I decided to just do that so I literally like just took my I've like a standing desk thing where my keyboard can go up so I put it up to like right here and I put my phone here and so that was the angle that I ended up getting so it wasn't ideal I just was like hey I would rather have like a 1080p quality video so I mean when I record with OBS I can scale up to 1080p but it doesn't look like 1080p because the camera can't capture that so anyway I will take that in consideration and yeah my beard is getting some gray headers in it I look a lot younger I think when I shaved my beard maybe I don't know maybe it does have something to do with gray hairs of course but yeah I'm like maybe a few gray hairs like down here in my beard my wife thinks it's funny suheib SS UHA Y B not sure how to pronounce that very sorry if I mess it up let me know how you'd like me to pronounce it but anyway they say I am 13 and I'm watching these videos awesome that's that's really awesome if you're already taking you know coding that seriously that you're watching YouTube videos on it and especially these videos because I know they can my videos can drag on a bit and be a little bit difficult to watch you know but just they're long and sometimes it can be boring especially for working on stuff and it's just not working so anyway I think it's awesome that you're you know watching these videos and learning about coding so feel free to ask any questions I'll do my best to answer and keep at it Aniki says I know what I'm gonna be focused on while watching that video not yeah so everybody go and check out the gray hair in my beard and you know it'll get me more views so it's it's fine if I gotta use my gray beard here to get views then so be it I'm scrolling down and find more questions I'm scrolling through all the discussion about the button colors Kemal says which visual studio code theme are you using the theme is called SETI so SETI it's the SETI theme so it's the same theme that I used when when I'm coding an atom so I've been using this theme for years it was one of the first things I tried out and I just I really liked it and so I've never switched oh I see that Niki already gave the answer thanks for that Niki Jonah says you got any experience deploying to a sure it doesn't work for me with no js' apps I've never tried to deploy an odious app to Azure so I have deployed something no you know what I did deploy note but it was part of like a workshop so I took like steps that were already plotted out for me to do it so I've never tried on my own but I'm it's it's possible I know I'm you know we did it I like so my only experience with it was in a workshop so I'd have to go back and look through all the steps again and that may or may not work in every use case but um I mean it's possible sorry I don't have enough experience that I could give you more you know advice on on that kukuku so CH you KW you let me know if that's not how you pronounce it coo coo says do you know a school available for me I don't I don't know it depends it depends on where like where you're at how much you you have you know time and money you have to be able to dedicate to the school I mean there are some good online you know tutorials and programs available that you could do from anywhere as long as you have an internet connection you know well free code camp is free you could go through and do that it's not exactly a school Udacity has some grade like nano degree courses my wife is just finishing up with she actually just finished this weekend Flatiron school she really liked it so I guess those are theirs so my options if you're looking more like a normal school like a university or something like that then that that probably depends a lot more on on location and you know how much money you have and you know what you want to do with it as well I'm mission says how is the react part being sent and used I you know what I'm not sure what I was talking about when you asked that question so I'm mission if you could clarify a little bit I'd be happy to answer for you Joey says I have an idea for the hero do feel free to ignore if you at a time background color with background blood blend mode soft light let me see let me see if I could if I can try that out let me see where I have that hero components there's my components there we go all right let's see all right there we go so let's see you know what I may have to I don't know if this will work like this Joey so the dev tools much more readable okay so Joey just did it in dev tools so Joey was that for the entire curative or just for the buttons okay it works with the background image all right let's check this up then so yeah let me try it in dev tools as well that's that would be much easier that definitely is we're readable what do you all think about that Ali says 23 and watching from Turkey lots of thanks for free code camp are you welcome thanks thanks for saying it thanks for watching now michael says the stuff that doesn't work is the best part of your videos we all get to yell out solutions cool Michael says I'm out I got to figure out the loop issue and then work on my Simon game that I haven't worked on for three months to get the front end cert all right well good luck with that Michael John says are you ready to learn webassembly coming to a react environment before one can say supercalifragilisticexpialidocious webOS yeah I need to learn some webassembly stuff I keep hearing so much about it all the time all of us says I would give the apply button more top space yeah it does it could definitely use a little bit more space it doesn't look as bad on mobile though but you're right I think you definitely could use I think this whole thing could use some redoing of space and font sizes I think it's just a little out of balance Aniki says good idea in in that UI details Twitter thread as well d saturated photo plus bold color plus blend mode multiplied great for hero banners and creating high contrast for text Joey says the image gets slightly brighter if you take the gradient out okay cool John says I don't think CSS image blend mode works across a lot of browsers at this point or we can check it out with with browser testing as well so I'm gonna keep this in mind actually I want to kind of let go yeah it's so much more like the text stands out so much yeah I'm gonna bring this up I'm gonna show this baby to my boss and see what he thinks this is the type of change that I can't just make I think I'm definitely gonna because enough people have seen this hero image and stuff and really liked it so I can't really just slide this change in here but I really like what it's done for the for the readability here and John yet we're gonna have to do some browser testing at some point maybe we could have like a nice fall back as well I'm mission says what I meant before about react was if all your react components were being sent in the public folder do I have this already I don't think I have this compiled or anything oh yeah I do have a look forward now I'm not sure I'm not sure what all ends up being in the public folder once we build it to be honest with you Joey says it could be done in or Photoshop to avoid compatibility issues yeah you're right I I'd rather not I'd rather do it in the code if possible because that way if if we have people who don't know how to use Photoshop or try to upload an image because eventually I think this image you'll be able to change the image just by uploading a new image somewhere so maybe WordPress maybe somewhere else and the image would change I think it'd be better if we kind of automatically get this this effect but love to test it out and yeah it's at first I need to see if this is acceptable and we can even do this and then we can worry about you know browser compatibility and things like that but I am I have a meeting in a like a half an hour and my boss will be in the meeting so maybe I'll just bring my laptop and show show him then all right well I've gotten to the bottom of the live chat so I think now's a great time there in the stream he gave me just a few minutes it's a relaxed before my meeting and get everything ready it was it was really cool talking with you all again I miss you oh I miss I miss streaming and we we actually worked out a lot of stuff so I'm really happy with what with what we've accomplished as far as getting the router working and got a lot of feedback on on this this area of the UI as well which is always welcome because this is the first thing people see you know this could determine whether or not they stay on the site whether they click they scroll down you know so I've said before I think spending the most time on this area and on this page is definitely worth it right so I I think I'll be back tomorrow I haven't checked my calendar for tomorrow yet so I figure though I should be able to get in at least an hour of streaming I'll let everybody know on if you follow me on Twitter on Instagram or if you follow this YouTube channel you should get updates at some point I've been updating on all those places the notification on YouTube will come up automatically if you turn on notifications for this channel so that you'll know whenever I'm going to stream and thank you so much for watching and have a great day
