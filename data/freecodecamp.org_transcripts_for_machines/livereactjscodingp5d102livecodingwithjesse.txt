hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today is my birthday so this is my birthday stream i'm 33 years old now and my main camera stopped working so i that's why the angle is a little bit weird so i switched to the camera on my secondary display my my good webcam is at my house i didn't bring it into the office today so i'm going to do my best to try to look at this camera when i can but you're probably going to be seeing a lot of this side of my face just because of habit of normally looking here so today i think we're going to do a little bit of coding we're going to look do a little bit of question and answer so i'd like to be done before three because i have a meeting at three and that's eastern time so i want to finish this up maybe in 50 minutes that that would be good uh so we'll probably do about 25 minutes of coding and then the rest for question and answer i'm gonna assume we'll have a lot of questions since we normally do uh if we don't then i'll just keep on coding and oh let me give you an update on my job search so it's been a while apologies for not streaming as much as i normally do and you know what i need to i keep looking over to see the chat i'm just going to move it over right under this camera so that i can see it and look at the same time i see a lot of people saying happy birthday thank you so much wow this that's a lot of happy birthdays i really appreciate that thank you um so here's what's up with my job search i've gone on a lot of interviews now i've done a lot of technical interviews and takehome coding challenges i have received four job offers so of the four offers um i'm pretty i'm considering three of the four right now one of the four is a little bit low so um i've kind of declined it and so then basically there's three offers still in the running but the the really really exciting news i mean i'm excited about all the offers but the news that i didn't think i'd be able to share is that i made it to the next round of interviews with google so i um i took the uh over the phone technical interview i passed it and now i'm gonna go in for five inperson technical interviews at mountain view at their headquarters so i'm just i'm so excited i've been studying a lot now and i'm gonna keep studying uh it looks like i might be out there this thursday so it's not for sure yet but i think thursday will be the day so that gives me a couple more days to to get ready and then there's one other job that i'm still in the interview process for so i need to finish i actually i didn't think i'd have enough time i'd kind of give it up on that because i thought this interview process is going to take too long i'm going to have to get back to these other companies but i think it's going to work out that i might be able to get through that process so there's potentially two more companies so maybe two more offers but i have to get through the process so i plan on making a video of that and putting it on my youtube channel the link to my channel is in the description uh and i'm gonna summarize this whole process and explain what the interviews were like and how i make my final decision so that'll come out after the whole process which is taking even longer than i thought but in a definitely in a good way also uh if you want updates on my interview process i've been putting some updates on twitter so my twitter link's in the description as well but i've been doing a lot of video updates on my instagram stories so if you're on instagram and you want to get those those updates uh check out my instagram i believe i have info about it in the description of this video um so i have i have all my stories saved on my profile under job interviews or something like that so you can kind of catch the backlog of everything okay enough updates i want to make sure you actually get some coding and question and answer stuff so if you have questions about that process let me know but i i will go over it in more depth at some point so uh hopefully i'll cover everything if i see a lot of people are interested in one certain part maybe i'll spend more time on that part okay let me move this i'm gonna move the chat off the window for a second and then get the code up here and then switch over where we at okay here's the code you can find a link to this github repository in the description and you can also find the link to the live version of this uh this site in the description as well so we have a a basically a demo live version of this site and right now first thing i want to do and the first thing we should always do when we're starting up a project that we're using uh git to track is we want to do a get pool oh i need my my uh the power went out yesterday i think and so my computer restarted so bear with me one second here while i get my uh get my ssh uh passphrase in here okay cool so that worked let's see what happened um we got a bunch of new branches from greenkeeper which lets us know when a new package a new version of a package we're using has come out so we got a lot of updates to do at some point we're not going to do the updates right now on the stream though also if you don't want to have to keep typing in your ssh password or key or whatever you can do ssh add and then paste in your key and then now you won't need to do it again for as long as uh your computer is on all right so now that that's taken care of i think okay i'm in sync now it looked like i was out of sync with the video a little bit apologies i know that's that's kind of annoying okay so now we're in sync let's start up our dev server start i've got to double check dev yarn dev some projects it's set up to be start in some projects it's dev okay so we should be ready on localhost let's start a pomodoro timer and let's get localhost 3000 running okay i'm not going to start the ngrok server right now which i'd normally do so if you want to see the site just check it out on the link in the description i'm just i'm not going to start just because we have a tight uh schedule at this point and there we go we have our rotating pictures now so this one happens to be the university president father sean so we've done a bit on the home page i don't remember if if you all have seen some of these updates but we've had a few updates here but the page we're gonna work on today is admissions let's see what it looks like now okay not so great right now right yeah uh so i recently found out that uh the people in admissions were not happy about how this page looks and to be honest with you i can't blame them right this page doesn't look great um we essentially put all the relevant admissions information on the front page and then link directly to the programs okay so although we got all the we did get all the information and where we wanted it to be optimal for people to actually click on we we didn't quite finish this but the good news is we already have a test page that makes us look a lot better so my next step here is going to be to go to github and check out the history for that file because i don't think we made a separate branch for that which we probably should have i think we on the master branch changed it and then reverted it back because it wasn't quite finished before launch and it's it it was almost the same as the home page at the time so we made a decision to revert it back and then work on it but now things have changed on the home page so i think we can just use that same format make it the admissions page and it should work great i see some activity there in the chat uh i will definitely get to read your comments and your questions here as soon as the pomodoro timer is up which will be why am i so far over here okay uh wow i've still got 23 minutes all right so let's go to franciscan react and uh the link to this is in the description if you want to check it out and so i want to go to our pages folder we're using next js so our pages folder uh our actual routes we do have some custom routes happening here so um we're kind of overriding a lot of the default behavior of an xjs but just a little explanation for what this pages folder does and where we got admissions.js okay so for our admissions oh hey we still have this page yes okay cool we don't i don't have to copy and paste anything now i remember what we did okay let's check out here's our server.js file let's find admissions uh let's see okay so admissions our default we set to page right and so it's pulling in the data that's currently in wordpress uh for this page but what we can do is set this to admissions right so this is that custom routing that's overriding the default behavior that i was just talking about so now we're saying if you go to admissions and it's the default meaning it's just the bear uh admissions with no slash something else at the end in terms of the url then we're just gonna have it render this page admissions okay so let's save that we see we're running nodemon so it automatically restarts our server when file our files change so now it'll reload and here we go here's our admissions page so we start out with this hero section all right we have an image there uh we could make this image change like the homepage image does uh we could we could do some different stuff with it basically so we're uh but we have the basic structure here now we have it set up okay yeah now i see why we didn't make this live because it while it looks nicer it's definitely lacking some information i remember now this was a while ago i i remember not having discussions about what exactly should be on this page and not really coming to a conclusion okay that makes sense all right that makes a lot of sense okay so here's what we're gonna do all right we definitely let's take these out and move them to the bottom of the home page and let's move in some more admissions specific data into this section okay all right so we'll go back here and we're going to put on on one side we'll put the admissions page on the other side of the screen we'll put the home page since we're going to be copy and pasting quite a bit both those pages share the same basic layout so we should be able to just swap in pieces and components and they should work if you're interested in how we we got to this point the project this is video 102 of the series so you can check out the entire project 5 playlist uh on on this channel on the free code camp channel it's quite a lot uh so i recommend you just skip around and watch the pieces that really interest you but you can if you're interested in a certain part you know you can definitely uh you'll get more info and i'm going to get rid of some of these all right here's our home page i'll move this over here for now and i'm going to get rid of some of these just to make things a bit easier and here's our admissions.js great let's get as much space as we can in here okay okay so our homepage is here and i said i'm going to scroll we're going to go all the way to the bottom and we have this section here that's just we're using material ui as our ui framework and we have this builtin grid component that lets us do some nice nice things with the layout so it within this this grid we have our components so actually we have a larger section here and we're using the grid inside it but this is our cost and financial aid section and for right now i think i'm going to throw in i'm just going to throw in some of these uh profiles let's make sure i get all of them okay so this whole grid here is what we need uh oops let's do some center a little bit too far okay here we go so let me copy this just completely get rid of it there we are and move it over here so this is a section yeah let's do it after this let's name sections with two do's okay let's see how that looks on the home page here oops and we need to import our profile cards that's where we're getting this little red thing here so up here let's take let's just copy and paste this make it a little faster but instead of text section and these are custom components that we built throughout the the course of this project um profile card okay whoops did it automatically add that for me i guess it did oh well i forgot that i had that package so evidently i have a package that automatically adds imports whenever i add these components so that's pretty cool all right let's just check really quickly to make sure this didn't totally mess up the home page and then we'll go back to this admissions page okay cool didn't mess it up it looks alright there i'm okay with that for now i you know i would definitely not want the same uh student repeated over and over again but i'll fix that a different time now let's go to that admissions page and actually oh you know what i didn't yeah i didn't save that that's what i was wondering why those are still there okay so i didn't save it now we've kind of cut this down okay and we have this text of our our mission stuff on the home page so let's actually you know um let's open this twice so that we can see what on the home page might be good to move over and perhaps modify uh for this other page so we have this mission stuff so probably take that out uh but let's see i think we definitely want this cost in financial aid section for sure um okay yeah let's do the cost and financial aid we'll move we'll take that whole section and just copy it so we'll copy that over the people are going to admissions page they're interested in how much it's going to cost right so we'll do we'll put it down at the bottom so let's go back over here and copy it there we go okay so we have did i go too far i did i went too far all right here's where new stuff ended so let's start with this div go all the way up and get this section here we may have to bring over some classes we'll see if we have these classes already and oh what we have here we had some content here that we ended up taking out looks like it off to check that out later all right so after this grid section in admissions we're gonna put this inverted button oh we need invertebrate typography let's see if it if it automatically pops up let's take out profile card now too since we didn't need it oh it's not going to do it automatically now oh okay i guess we'll have to do it or i can just copy it from here integrated button and i don't remember what the other one was typography that was it typography okay so inverted button is a is a component that we made which is based on the button component for material ui actually material ui has their own kind of like inverted button i don't know if they call it that but you'll see what it looks like in a second so newer versions of material have their own since we already had this made and customized exactly how we wanted i've continued to use it but if you're using the latest version you will have that option just on your regular button component typography comes built in in material ui all right let's see what this looks like oh yeah we definitely need to bring in some of the classes so let's do that now let's just check what classes we have going on here so it looks like section inner container section text hero button inverted button alright so let's see what we can pull over in terms of classes and let's compare here let's see section do we have that nope okay so let's go with section enter container section text hear about inverted one yeah all of these down here so we're copying a lot probably not the best way to deal with that all right but first thing is get get it working right then we can make it better okay so let's see if if those styles will fix it yep and that fix it so here now we have our cost and financial aid and this is what i'm talking about with that what i call an inverted button i don't remember exactly where i first heard that term but i'm pretty sure i didn't make it up i think i saw it listed as an inverter button somewhere uh so basically you just have an outline usually i have a hover effect on these so that when you mouse in uh it the background actually would go in this case it would go like green and then this text would go to white so i'm not sure why i did it like this for this one without the hover um okay all right so there we go we have that section now so i'm going to check my time about 10 minutes okay so we have about 10 minutes and i think in terms of bringing stuff from the home page there's not really much else that i do want to bring what i think we ought to do now though is check out the old side to see what was on there it's i think it has pretty much the same content that we saw at the very beginning before we changed our router you can see it's the old site's very slow i'm on a really fast connection and it's still so so slow i think this is this is really happening oh you know what i bet it won't even work because for some reason on campus you have to put the www in off campus your you can do it without it it's weird still really slow though okay all right wow that that was so slow okay hey i know her she's really nice um let's see see like uh part of the reason why i didn't bring over a lot of the existing pictures on this site is that they're really old like she graduated oh it's been a while i mean i think she graduated before i started working here so i started working here over three years ago um so she's this this photo is probably at least five years old all right so here's the only difference as to what we have on this page contentwise we we basically have all this content right we had these we had these lists before what we got rid of were some of these old pictures this is actually my boss let's picture my boss there he's a good guy um he's also a good guy i know him i know his professor uh i've been to his house he's pretty cool okay um it really this page is just a bunch of links so i i don't know that we really want to try to copy this page because i mean do we re do we need a bunch of links i don't think so let me know in the um in the chat i mean should we salvage anything from this page i mean we could certainly add some of these videos but again these videos are very old so i might add something in just as a placeholder and then maybe see if we can find a newer video i mean i could see maybe for admissions this video may be you know discover truth franciscan users yeah i mean this is pretty much a general advertising video for the university this austria program is a little specific but it i from what i hear it is a a big bonus for students students really like it i'm hesitant to put up a video about the science programs though uh because that's very selective for just one group same way with theology stuff this these two videos are more general so i think those would be okay and honestly i think this set of videos appears on multiple pages so i'm i don't think this was ever meant to be specific to this page anyway okay so basically we have apply buttons these all take people to the same place anyway um visit campus which we already have that button just to show like we have our apply inquire and visit buttons which are the most important things really on the whole site that we want users to do so we have that we have a link to our cost calculator we have links to our majors our institutes chapel stuff yeah in terms of information like bringing over information from here uh that's the most important stuff so at this at this point i don't think i'm gonna bring any of these other things over unless you know there's something that basically what i i'm not worried that much about content like that's not my thing i'm worried about building this out so i'm not gonna i'm not gonna fuss about the content anymore we could grab some of this text what is this linking to all right this list is online we could take some of this text and use it yeah we could definitely do that all right let's do that let's make a text section here and then i think i'd love to have this quote up here but then i'd need something else for there so i'm going to leave it leave it alone for right now and let's add a text section up here we don't really have anything already made so instead of copying and pasting let's just all right let's do as much as we can in the three minutes that we have left so what i'm looking to do here is get this grid so this is already a grid that has three columns which is what i want so let's grab this let's grab this grid and then just kind of take out everything that's in it and add in some text okay so in our text we have our sections our grid stuff yeah all right let's get rid of this and instead put we're going to put this typography element in there and that's what we're going to put that's where we're going to put our our text content in there by default the typography will just go to a paragraph tag so that's what it'll render to so that should be fine for now we'll see how it looks but when we do it in typography all of our our styles the material design type styles should should work they should just be there okay so we're not going to copy the read more tags i'm just going to copy the text for now and what this should give us is on large screens oops on large screens they'll have three columns one on a small screen they'll stack so it's just it'll just be one column because the majority our target audience is teenagers our primary target audience is teenagers so they're most likely going to be using a mobile device to look at this so we always want to keep that in mind first all right whoa all right something's off about this we definitely don't um maybe we're overriding something it just happened did i forget hmm all right let's see what these classes are doing for this grid item i may have to take that class off okay it's taking out some padding you know let's let's take out all of the custom classes yeah this class name here i do not want because that that's probably the lack of padding is is probably not helping and then i don't know what content containers doing we'll check that first we'll see if this did anything did we get a refresh hmm that did not do anything so let's check on what content containers don't want here with let's check it out in dev tools well let's check oh my timer went off i did not hear that go off uh since i already have this up let's check out the this div is our grid why is this div not giving us any margin or padding oh yeah all right well i will figure that out at some other time we can check it out how it looks on mobile oh yeah it's still it doesn't look good because there's there's enough there's no space i'd want some sort of spacing also this this font size is too small i want that to be bigger so basically uh what i would do here so what i would do up here is maybe i could possibly use the same image i don't know we'll see for now i'll leave that image in there i would change these obviously to make some padding make the font size larger switch this out for something more admissions related and then the only other thing i might think about doing is adding in some videos i think some videos would be good um yeah and then this page i think would be good to go live it's already definitely a large improvement over the other page so in that sense it could potentially go live and still be better than the current page um but for me to be really comfortable with it i would make the changes that i i just talked about first but um let me check my time okay um let's uh let's commit this so we're going to do a git add we're at everything we can do a git status again to make sure so now we have all this in green this stuff is is ready to be committed so we're going to run yarn cm because we have it set up that like a custom little command line program to help us craft a really good commit message so we're going to say we added a new feature and uh let's write a short so a short imperative tense description of the chain so we're going to say add let's see oh we'll say add profiles to home page and content to admissions all right i'm not going to do a long description right now sometimes that's good if what you changed is a bit more complex probably want to enter a description of it we do not have breaking changes so no is the default so we'll just hit enter and this does not affect open issues as far as i know we do not have an issue for that so i'm just going to hit enter because the default is no now it's going to run through our tests our unit tests our end endtoend tests to be entirely honest we don't have great test coverage right now so i don't think anything that we've done actually would affect anything that's being tested right now we did have tests on the homepage but it changed so frequently uh that the tests were just kind of getting annoying because they would fail every time and we'd have to recreate the test okay everything worked so now we'll just do a git push and that will push it to github so now everything that i've done here will be available for you to check out on the the github page that's linked in the description now uh i'm going to flip back over to the full screen so that i can pull over all the chat and just kind of check it out without the reason i don't like to show the chat is in case someone types something inappropriate in the chat i don't want to be on the stream uh right away i could block it and then uh hopefully like it won't be visible in the chat even in the the replay i think that's how it works okay i'm gonna try my best to keep an eye on the clock let me move my phone over actually i got the new uh pixel 3 pixel xl3 so it just came in kind of excited about that okay i'm starting way up at the top i'm gonna answer as much as i possibly can okay i was just double checking to make sure everything was still going good with the stream status uh does react.js help over normal js while making projects in express what expression yeah express is really a back end thing so uh it you know reacts i think react is easier for a lot of types of projects than normal js or vanilla js as some people say so it doesn't matter whether you're using express or not i think it's it does help okay there are certain very basic projects that were probably easier in vanilla js i guess it just it just kind of depends on your project mohit says is it wise to go from view to react uh is there anybody here who has tried to taste of both i have not used view so i'm probably not in a good position to answer that question all right lots of happy birthdays thank you thank you someone asked if i'm a scorpio yes i am a scorpio i don't really know what that means in terms of what i'm like i don't really go in for astrology that much so uh not i'm not really sure whether being a scorpio is a good or a bad thing um lauren says happy birthday you look 30 years though cool well i that since i'm 33 looking 30 is is good i guess hey steven says what's up what's up steven uh sriram says what's the google processor frontend interviews um so i'm assuming the process i've gone through is pretty standard so what i what you'll do normally so i got contacted by a recruiter so my process was slightly different um so i didn't go through the normal you apply process like i talked to the recruiter we already lined everything up and and then i i went to a different i think i went to a different length to apply um and then i also had uh someone referring me uh within google so i had to enter their information as well so slightly different but the first step is well the first step for me was talking with the recruiter i if i had just applied i don't know if there'd be another first step where i just talked to somebody but anyway the real first test was this over the phone uh technical interview so i had to code in a google doc and talk up talk while i was coding kind of like i do on my show to the person who was interviewing me uh it won't really do any good for me to say what the question was because every interviewer will ask different questions so the best thing is just to study for a lot of stuff and then after that the next step is to actually go in person to a google location where you will have in my case it's going to be five interviews that are all 45 minutes long in person where each person will ask me a question so five different interviewers will ask a question and i will have to most likely on a whiteboard answer write out the answer to those questions uh lauren says happy birthday uh from london cool actually i'll be in london next week i'm gonna be at the doc fest conference in munich but uh on my way back from doc fest i'm gonna have really long layovers in iceland london and dublin so if i know anybody in any of those places let me know i'll be in iceland for the longest period of time so like 22 hours uh i'll i'll only be in have a few hours uh to do anything in london or dublin but i'd like to at least see a little bit of of those places uh before i fly back all right sgk asked for a quick rundown of the project is about what you're using at rehab i don't really have time to give a good rundown right now um i'll give the very very quickest thing it's a react project and we're using headless wordpress for the back end we're grabbing the data with graphql we're using apollo with react to help us out with that and we have a custom server using express and node js i mean that's what the project is technologically in terms of what the project does it is a website for a small university and yes it probably is overkill for a website for a small university but uh why not do great work uh when i we can when we can so let's see sriram says what's the goal of this session uh the the channel has a lot of different videos but for my videos my live streams the goal is just for you all to see me doing my normal work as a developer messing up trying to recover from those mistakes and then you know i i just want to try to be as honest as possible about what what my work is like uh mohan asks if i'm using uh es6 yeah we're using some es6 stuff in here um we had a request for translations into arabic um i do not know arabic so i can't translate but if anybody's interested in translating my live streams into any language that would be awesome um i'm sure that quincy you know who's in charge of free code camp would welcome some good translations oh cool steven says inverted buttons are kind of like a logo in a style guide you have the regular logo and the inverted logo right buttons are the kind of the same way you have your primary secondary button and then inverted button airbnb has it okay so cool so it is a thing so like i thought i didn't make the word up it is really a thing to have inverted buttons uh steven says the problem with updating is this colleges really need to update all videos images etc every four years unless you can link that person to some kind of alumni group it's out of date yeah for sure and that's the the main one of the main reasons why i decided to start with a clean slate and not bring over any of the old videos or images for the most part was because i knew if we brought them over people would still just be okay with it right but if i brought them over and they they look at a page that's all text then they'll immediately say where the image is at and people did that some people freaked out were like why aren't there any images or videos well that was the point the point was we can't just be lazy about this and be satisfied with five sixyearold videos you know possibly even older uh and images uh we need to to get new stuff in here and i knew it would speed up that process so uh i still i still stand by that i think that's absolutely necessary we're not going to start a brand new website with old stuff um jenya asked about my visual studio theme i think i have it in the description so it's the seti theme but check the description for uh for details more details on the theme uh steven says your lack of padding is just quite disturbing said in my best darth vader voice that's awesome uh nissar says join late i may be missed but my question is is react changes a lot in life cycle and get back to function component so my question is there any issue with that for this project um in terms of the changes in the life cycle methods no i don't think we have any issues with this project in case you're not sure what nassar is referring to with some of the newest versions of react they had to make changes with the lifestyle life cycle methods because there are some async issues and they're getting ready to have the suspense api come out so they need to fix those issues first so some of the life cycle methods they're saying you shouldn't use them anymore some of them are changing so just be aware of that if you have some older react projects you you may need to change some life cycle methods maybe you want to hold off on updating react until you figure out exactly how it will affect your project sgk asks if uh i was using graphql in this project i am carl asked about the job honey carl go back and watch the beginning of the video uh i would normally repeat it but i have i have to end the video really soon so check out the beginning of the video i i let everybody know about the job on and again uh if you want to stay more up to date on the job hunt i give the most updates on my instagram i also put some updates on twitter uh and i will put a video update a video summary of my this entire process on my youtube channel which is linked in the description after i make my final decision uh umberto says for someone who's interested in going into web development as a career what technologies would you most recommend learning so web development uh html css javascript for sure start with those all right and that that it should take you a while to get good with javascript if you want to jump into some sort of javascript library or framework reacts very popular right now angular is also popular view is a lot of people like vue uh if you would like to get into some back end stuff as well you can use node.js that would probably be the easiest thing to get into if you're already using javascript on the front end uh if you have some specific area you want to go into like let's say you want to be a wordpress developer then you should learn php um you know so just kind of check out what you like and what what you want to do definitely learn how to use apis graphql was great but there's not a lot of people using graphql so you'll need to learn about rest apis as well so that's just a very quick overview uh after clap asks what frontend languages are there how many uh javascript is the frontend language so that's the i know like with web assembly you can use other stuff but like basically in terms of what's used 99 of the time javascript um uso says do you think python is an okay first language to take up programming as a hobby oh yeah for sure uh i would say as a first language i would recommend either javascript or python if you're not really interested in the front end then python is wonderful if you do want to do frontend stuff javascript might be a little bit better because you can't really use python on the front end you know by natively in the browser uh moosa says i really want to do something in programming but i don't have uh any time at all because i've just started medical school this year yeah that's going to be tough uh my advice to you would be maybe try to do just a little bit every day if you could even do a half an hour every day at least it would keep you keep your mind on it you know maybe start out with some free code camp stuff just just do just work on free code camps curriculum half hour every day even if it's 15 minutes every day it's still better than nothing jesse you're amazing hi from your russian fans hey how's it going i was so close to being able to come to russia for a conference i i was almost picked i talked to the organizers did like an interview thing and so i was i was a little bit bummed i was going to be coming i was hoping i'd be in russia at the end of november but it's not going to happen now maybe maybe someday i'll apply for the conference next year hugo says hey i'm new to react and i would like to know what is the proper way of navigating through different layouts um i'm not i'm not exactly sure what you mean by navigating through different layouts so maybe um you know i won't really have time to answer that so if you can uh message me on twitter or put a comment to this video maybe i can answer answer that question okay it looks like there are some answers in in the uh chat already so thank you for that uh christian says what's best python or javascript uh i think i just answered that before i'm not i'm not gonna say one language is better than the other but uh it just depends on what you're trying to use them for uh mario says are you moving to angular i'm no i'm not moving angular um for most of my job offers i'll still be working with react obviously for the google one probably not but for all the other ones it's it's react and for some of the offers i'd actually get to keep doing my stream uh with my work so that's that's a big plus oh all right stephen has a call and that's your that's your interview awesome yeah for sure let me know on twitter what happens uh musa says thank you you're welcome okay and i have a meeting in four minutes so i'm gonna wrap up the stream sorry it was the question answer was so rushed and quick uh hopefully i'll be able to do another stream uh but i i might be traveling hopefully i'll be traveling out to google headquarters

know i'd be really interested in like getting some coffee together or hanging out or something okay so if you want to get in touch with me my instagram info and my twitter info are in the description
