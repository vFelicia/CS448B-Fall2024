welcome back to the free Cod Camp podcast I'm Quincy Larson teacher and founder of freecodecamp.org and each week I'm bringing you Insight from developers Founders and ambitious people getting into Tech this week I'm joined by the legendary and prolific Andrew Brown he's a CTO turned cofounder of exampro doco he started the exam prep website with another guy named Andrew who's also from Canada who also loves Star Trek Andrew welcome to the podcast thanks for having me and you know I just want to point out that uh even though it's we have theca it just doesn't sound as uh as nice when you say it so yeah yeah well um it's such a cool website you've got so many resources on there and uh you've shared those resources so abundantly with the global developer Community using free C free code Camp as a conduit for helping people prepare for various Cloud certifications you know your AWS CER certifications your Azure certifications Google Cloud uh even like a lot of the uh like uh I guess more advanced like kubernetes certifications things like that uh so it's so cool to finally have you on the podcast after knowing you for like six years uh collaborating on all these amazing courses yeah I think I just showed up one day and I said uh you have to publish this course I had this I had this big course like I like I always wanted to make free content um and you know when we first started out I was I was pressured into monetizing it which I really didn't want to do um and so I had to I had to do that and fail and luckily that failed which was great and so then I was able to take these giant courses that would not normally be free and make them free which is which is really exciting yeah yeah we're all about free and uh I just want to take a moment to thank the 8,562 kind folks around the world who support free Cod Camp our charity each month by donating some amount of money to our charity and uh these donations are a huge help and they make programming like this possible they make it possible for me to work fulltime on free C Camp and for uh like nearly three dozen other folks Engineers teachers around the world to also focus on creating free learning resources for everyone so thanks thanks to everybody and again thank you to Andrew for just supporting free Cod Camp through this amazing wealth of learning resources that you share uh I I mean it seems like you published probably five or six courses a year at least like it's it's amazing how quickly you develop like updated like the the moment one of these certifications updates uh it's like you're right there right or the moment a new certification launches we'll talk about like the GitHub certifications in a little bit yeah that was fast the moment it comes out you're like there with uh with your camera out like having already passed the exam ready to like explain exactly how people can you know pass the like you've passed I don't know how many certification exams do you think you've passed in your career as a you know prep you know instructor I don't know like it's Le like at least 30 at least 30 unique unique certifications and you know what's really weird is like I actually have to fail them now because what I learned was that um if I pass them I can't take the updated exam so like I have to go in and then I have to fudge them but sometimes I end up passing and I'm not supposed to but I just like want to so do you know what I mean like I'm just like I'll pass it but uh yeah I don't know it's just um uh after you do so many it becomes uh trivial so which is a good thing right you put the time in you can do anything yeah the mob boss is telling you to throw the fight but you're just like I got to pass it I can't hold back my knowledge of cloud yeah so cool well before you were a exam you know expert uh in in passing all these different Cloud exams of course you worked as a CTO but before that you had kind of a family business around computer repair still exists okay awesome maybe you can tell us a little bit about like your humble Origins as somebody repairing computers and working with your family on this you know our family business came about because you know my mom she was in uh was system administrator for or just the admin for Bell in our in our hometown so bell bell Canada which is a telecom company they had a large presence in our our town and so she managed is it related to like AT&T American Telegraph and telephone so they had like the the southern southwestern bill was the Texas and Oklahoma uh phone company and they got broken up into a whole bunch of different baby bells so it's possible that this was like a Canadian you know I've seen like I've seen like Bell and AT&T I thought Bell was Canadian because I thought Alexander Bell was Canadian but um for what I again I I don't know the logistics of it but all I know is that we had a large presence of Bell in I'm in Ontario in Northwest Ontario and so um they had uh they they had new ownership um and they built a big expensive building it turns out that was too expensive and so then they down downsized the uh want Hometown and my my mom didn't want want to move to Toronto she wanted to stay up North with her family um and so uh she took all the skills that she learned from uh being an administrator and then went into computer repair um and so that was the entrepreneurial business and so that's where I was fixing computers and um I transitioned from there doing uh Tech education so like I've been doing it forever um where I would go on site and I would train train people at their homes on their computers yeah well that is so cool first of all I had no idea that Alexander granbell was Canadian I think you learned something new every day and uh according to wikkipedia uh yes Bell Canada divested from AT&T I'm not sure what exactly that means I maybe they were involved in AT&T at some point anyway this is not the corporate History Podcast this is the learn to code podcast but still is it it's it's cool so um so that's cool your mom was a admin early on and uh so maybe you can talk about like the dayto day like did they start the company where you were still a kid were you able to work there when you were a kid or like how old were you when you got your first job I remember uh I think it was like 95 or 96 was when uh my mom opened uh the business uh and so I mean as early as like 15 16 I was I was there cuz it started it started at in our house in our basement right um and so we had computers there and then she got an office and uh you know I just I just love computers like I I was always on computers and um you know I was always trying to to help my mom whe whether it was writing word word perfect macros MH doing PowerPoint presentations uh anything right and so um you know I just became really good at uh web Technologies and things like that and so you know she was was giving me work because she was getting referred to build websites and other things like that and she didn't know how to do it um and so I took on that work and then because I was good at doing that and that was not causing any issues I was allowed to then fix computers and uh do repairs and things like that so so just from creating simple macros for Microsoft Word you you gradually progress and so it sounds like you had like an early love of computers and Technology I used to be I used to go take uh college courses like when I was 10 so like I like just like if it was computer anything it would be like we're going to do the whole Microsoft Word Suite or and like and I just wanted to go do that and I would I'd be like so excited to do word processing or or anything like it like it was on Photoshop or whatever as a kid that's that was my extra uh extracurricular activities was was doing that kind of stuff um so I have like college certificates when I'm like 10 or 12 for random Technologies yeah that's so cool so sounds like very early on did you would you say you envisioned yourself working with computers for the rest of your life like it was there a specific point where you're like yeah this is what I do this is who I am or was it just kind of a gradual progression I I I just think it was just like that fascination of it I mean yeah there's the aspect it was the family business and so like my brother fixed computers and I fixed computers but um and my my two sisters worked at the company for for a while but uh it just seemed like that was what I was destined to do because it was the trade of of the family yeah well what were some of your earliest memories of using computers like what were some were there any inflection points where you're like did just pulled you in deeper like I remember I I often talk about nintendo.com their chat room and like talking to different people and realizing hey I can use HDML to like change the font size and it'll change the font size for everybody so I'd like troll people making the font really large um because it was just such a poorly built like you know chat room system from like 1994 1995 like do do you remember like any sort of like moments that just pulled you in deeper into technology I mean like I remember playing kmen San Diego and I was really obsessed with that it was like I think like 92 like I was like probably five or six and I just I loved playing K in San Diego and like I learned how to use the the Doss promp to I mean which doesn't sound that crazy uh now because kids are so uh technically um uh Savvy like even even young kids I would say but like I knew how to work MS dos to to get into any program that I wanted to um and I don't know it's just the fascination of of uh I guess video games or that interactivity like the like the opportunity that you could do with it right yeah yeah 100% Cara San Diego they have a new version of the show on Netflix that my kids love they watch it in Chinese for Chinese they have a new version yeah it's pretty good like she's like like with the m like do you have the map and you run around you put the map on like they have the endgame map is it like the so so like a show it's not it's not like a video game so it's not interactive but she's just like traveling around with her like team of like inventors and other people that are like helping her like her computer person like they always have like the giant vond character and like the Q character essentially like the person who creates the interesting gadgets uh or the person who knows all the fills Carmen in all all these background information for her mission to go undercover as like a museum you know a curator or what whatever uh crazy stories uh but but it's a really cool show um and and yeah that game was really cool and of course I love the where in the world is K San Diego from the TV show as a kid the acappellas yeah the acella I always wanted rockapella there you go I always wanted to be on that game show of course it was never going to happen but um uh I don't know I just always wanted to play that end that end level where they're running around on the map and they they're placing the markers in time and I really wanted to win the uh it was like a pocket translator I always thought that would be really cool to have for whatever reason but uh such a cool show and like such like uh like a celebration of like curiosity and intellectualism in an era that like you know he man smash you know type stuff right maybe this was slightly later this was like in the 90s well how old are you if you don't mind me asking like what year were you born in 87 87 Okay cool so you're like seven years younger than me um so yeah you were you you had like internet computers like seven years earlier probably in your life than I did well again because my mom worked for Bell like we had a connection right like I remember before Netscape and having internet yeah you know like before uh which by the way I love Netscape uhet Netscape Navigator it was great um I I mean I wish Firefox was uh still holding holding well as it used to but it's uh a different thing these days yeah well let's let's talk about uh you know what did you do from there so you're working at a family business of course did you dream of branching out and creating your own business did you have like a kind of a Founder bug so to speak that bit you early on and you wanted to be like your mom and start something uh you I I realized I didn't want to create computers forever I I like the idea of building applications programming like like maybe going to like I thought maybe I wanted to go to video games but I realized like at early age that um that industry they're overworked they're not paid well and so I thought okay maybe that's more of a hobby and so um I just got really good I wasn't intentional but I just got really good at websites and web application development and you know for me it was like it it scratched that itch enough and so I just kept running with it yeah and so where did you go from there like getting good is one thing but were you able to do like freelance work oh yeah like um so you know I got all my work through um uh a women organization called perro so you know my mom was a woman a woman entrepreneur and so she knew a bunch of other women entrepreneurs and so I basically built all their websites so anytime there was a website to be built uh I would build it I really wanted to build web applications um but uh there was no demand and no understanding of that in my hometown uh I wanted to move to Toronto I did not have the money and I was trying to get a job there I just see I couldn't even so I like I spent years learning how to build apps and I could do all the work but uh nobody was taking the uh the gamble on me um and so you know one day I had a client um and she wanted to use this open Source technology called Ruby that was built in Ruby on Rails and uh it was an open source project and it just was not in a great state and so at the time Twitter was starting to kick around and it was like 2008 or something um I yeah early Ruby on Rails project not not the best example of Ruby on rail's capabilities in that it had like the fail whale and would frequently crash but but yes but um uh so anyway they uh this open source project um you know I I knew I knew how to fix it up and so I just said hey this is not a great application for what you want to do uh and so I put two weeks of effort not not being asked but I just started uh working on it um and that Co the the founder of that company decided to hire me remotely and and then move me to to Barcelona where I became the of that company so for years I was like stacking my skills but like I just couldn't get work and like I would go and take a Greyhound bus all the way down to from Thunder Bay to Toronto which was like a oh I don't know like 16 hour ride each way or something ridiculous and I would go for one day to go to Toronto to go to like a Meetup um uh just to be around other people that were working with more Advanced Technologies and to try to get an opportunity but you know placers just did not want to hire me because I wasn't local yeah wow and this was obviously like decades before the remote work I guess acceptance before employers accepted that you didn't have to be sitting in a cubicle somewhere where they could come in you know ask you to come in on Sunday or whatever whatever the the you know office space thing is um yeah that so Barcelona this is not like Barcelona Canada this is like Barcelona Spain Barcelona you moved to you moved to Europe yeah yeah but you know what uh uh I did really well there because um in terms of technology they were always like two three year 2 three years behind building what was already built in North America so it's like they're building it for their market right it's like and all we were building was a project manager it was a competitor to to um base camp um so that I mean back then I would have loved to work for base camp but again of course uh no opportunities there so yeah I worked on that and that was uh uh really good um and then from there I just went to a string of startups because I just became really good at uh rapidly building applications and sing them up and so I would find like startups that had seed or preed money and I would come in and I would help them close their round and build their deck and hire their hire their first engineers and scale them to whatever their goal was whether it was like 200,000 to 500,000 users and I was really good at it um but that but I was never like really cut in in the same way of the original cofounders because I wasn't there on Day Zero so they they I just never had the same um opportunities yeah so I I grew I grew tired of that not being able to um uh not having the same negotiation skills to uh to to make the money but putting the work in and so then I decided to just do my own firm and just make more money yeah that's so cool that like you got to be on the ground floor of all these SS even if you weren't getting like the founder level of equity which for anybody who's not familiar with like how startups work I'll just give a very very very quick High futin you know uh but basically you have two or three people that come together sometimes it's one person like a lot of big projects don't have C Founders they just have one person starting them but uh then the founders divide up their equity and then they have like a lot of times they'll have like their like 20% for early hires and then 20% for everybody else basically and the founders will keep you know like 30 or 40% depending on how well they can negotiate with investors um so you're not getting the founder Equity of like 10% of the company or something like that 20% of the company you're getting like 1% as like an early hire maybe 2% right something like that well well well in my situation like I was getting a large percentage but um like it' be 10 or 15% but there was like yeah but there's strings attached where it's like it it vests over this period and yeah and there's like a cliff it was the cliff and you know what would do they uh it happened twice to me where where it was like they because I was the most expensive employee with the large amount of shares and like if they want to raise another round they want to claw back that stuff and so they like I got let go one like one time and the other time it's just like I don't know the point was is that startups are are very tricky and uh you have to be very good at advocating for yourself and making sure you're looking it for yourself because these it's all about money right yeah and uh at the end of the day it's like if you leave yourself open for people to take things away from you they will uh and it's just the nature of that uh of that industry unfortunately so yeah I mean it's a Zer some you know like every percent that we don't have to give to Andrew Brown we can keep for ourselves that kind of uh and people get really weird about money I I mean I think I think it's also hard because it's like you know I don't think people are always trying to be a bad person but just like it can mess with your mind uh or justifications uh uh um tap in but if you ever seen the show silic and Valley yeah it was like that that's what it was like it was like that every every day it just it was a little bit too wild for me but uh yeah you just have to have a lot of luck and um and uh negotiating skills and things like that yeah I have a lot of friends who are startup veterans who started watching silon Valley and stopped because they were like this is giving me like flashbacks of like horrible experiences yeah for years I watch yeah for years I wouldn't watch that show I just like I was I couldn't take it but now it's now it's fun um I think I think the industry is in a different place but that was just a time and place how it was so yeah well Time Heals all wounds right like uh you could probably go back and watch it now and laugh about it you know yesterday's tragedy is today's comedy uh not in all circumstances but in some certain circumstances for sure uh so yeah that that is a show like de definite recommended viewing for anybody who wants to work in Tech uh it just highlights the absurdity of zero interest rate you know crazy you know Venture Capital funded growth and like incompetence at the incumbent players that are being disrupted by the newcomers and all this stuff it so all those different Dynamics you get in Silicon Valley and San Francisco like the kind of the mecca of tech so to speak like uh and and Toronto of course has a pretty pretty good developer scene as well right oh yeah for for Canada yeah it's um yeah fin fintech healtech uh a for some reason ml's always been I mean I'm sure everybody thinks they're an ml Hub but like yeah ml has been heavy Focus for for years for Toronto yeah yeah yeah and mL of course stands for machine learning which is what powers all the AI products that are coming out uh so wow so you did this kind of like rent a CTO type uh basically approach where everybody brought you in you were the fixer like like a bunch of BU business guys who don't know very much about technology they they're able to get funding but they don't have the chops to actually build and ship so they bring and you the fixer the the the server Whisperer yeah I I mean like the thing was it was more like it was like I mean they thought what they were doing was they were uh working to like it was contract to hire so they're like we want to call you C we want you to be CTO we want to give you shares i' be like no I don't want shares just give me money just give me money and and if things go really well then maybe I'll think about it but you know for me I was I was just stacking money at that point and like I had a different cofounder at the time and and that's uh what we were doing because we wanted to bootstrap something we really wanted to do right so we wanted to build like a product like a tech product or I always wanted to do Tech education but it wasn't the interest of my previous cofounder um and it just we weren't never getting there it was just like we were just building thing after thing and we're building up this team of a firm with developers and I'm just like I don't like doing this I don't want to keep building projects for other people that I don't believe in uh even if it makes really good money and so we had to talk and and we said it's time to do something different yeah and I just want to like highlight what you said there like just give me money I don't need stock options like a lot of companies will give stock options as a form of incentive and stuff and you know if it's like a big public company that you're working for like Walmart or Amazon or something like that that's it's almost kind of like free money in the sense that like though you are going to be able to liquidate those stock but certainly in the US if you get a bunch of stock from like a company like uber and Uber just takes forever to go public they they might have like this like there were a lot of people who worked at early engineers at Uber who um by the way super pumped documentary shows you just how evil that company was the Evil Genius of Travis kenic uh of course played by uh Joseph Gordon Levitz I strongly recommend people watch that show uh I think it's on Netflix um yeah super cool show just showing you how Makia like if you don't care about the rules and you just break all the rules like H it was is like it's definitely like watching like Breaking Bad where you're like almost rooting for the bad guy but you know he's so bad and you feel so guilty for like empathizing and like wanting him to win but anyway a lot of people at Uber had like millions of dollars worth of shares that they couldn't exercise because there was no exit and there was like this Sunset the lockin Peri or I can't remember what it's called but basically you have to exercise your options and if you don't exercise them before this date then and and but at the same time you have to pay a whole bunch of tax whenever you exercise those options so there were people who like literally didn't have the cash on hand to get millions of dollars worth of you know theoretical gains that they would get once Uber eventually went public and of course it did go public but we didn't know at the time when that was going to happen so people would have to be like going out and borrowing a whole bunch of money to pay off the tax liabilities for exercising these options buying a bunch of uber that might never actually be worth anything so a lot of people just walked away from their Uber shares because of that um so you know win and doubt just take money because well you're concentrating your risk right you're already working for the company so your monthtomonth livelihood is tied up in that and you know companies may be like show how much you believe in the company buy a bunch of you know like I If your employer is ever trying to sell you equity in in their own company like I would definitely be like concerned uh I it's a nice to have but it's not not to not to uh uh um displace what you should be paid and so you know like it's not like it's bad but it's just like if you don't have the the the finance sense to make sense of it I just I still don't I'm just terrible at it that I just like forget it let's not do that uh let's let's do what we we know it's going to work and um you know I again I just got away from startups and like my company I don't call it a startup because we don't have any uh investors we don't want investors we don't want to get acquired um there's no it's just like we just want to keep it going and build a large catalog for free stuff and that's that's the goal right like yeah once you take investor dollars you're strapping kind of a time bomb to your back and yeah it's like it's like have you ever seen the movie Speed with Keo Reeves like the if the bus drops below 50 miles an hour it'll explode and kill all the tourists on board and all the working moms and everybody that's on the bus they all trapped on this bus it's like barreling down the highway The Unfinished Highway um in La like that's probably the most unrealistic thing about it that you would actually be able to move 50 miles an hour in LA but um but it's like that like once you take on investor money you're expected to keep the bus going 50 miles an hour and if you go up to 60 boom it's like a ratcheting effect like oh you can't go less than 60 that that you have to keep growing you can only move in One Direction so I definitely think it's it's preent and wise for you to ass to uh investors if you start a charity like free C Camp people literally can't invest and you can't own any Equity so it just completely like simplifies a lot of those decisions one of the reasons I I chose to make free C Camp uh a charity and I donated all the equity that I had I had like I don't know like 90 plus% of the equity uh we didn't never have any in investors or anything so um yeah I just donated that to free C Camp for zero dollars when we got our tax exempt status and uh yeah like since then it's just been really simple we don't have anybody telling us mush mush mush move faster move faster and it sounds like you don't have to worry about that either who are the key State like other than the other Andrew the other treky Canadian uh who who else cares about the decisions you all make like who else is involved I mean we have our small team like I we got Sam we got Cindy we got Peter uh we've had other other other folks that are here but we just keep a a very small small team um you know like if there's no need to grow the team there's there's no reason to right because it's just stuff that you have to maintain down the road so like for instance you know like if we start making uh more money because there's a popular certification doesn't mean that you should upscale and hire more people because what happens when that deflates which is kind of like what we saw with covid or or other or or or or other organizations like that um so you know growth is not important as longevity of the company and Mak making sure that the key people that are here are being taken care of whether that is making sure they have good health insurance good good uh job security um and making sure that you know we can make money while also being honest right so like we're we're te we're we're a forprofit but we operate not very well for profit in the sense that like we make enough right but it's not to the point where it's at the detriment of of the the person like I'm not out here going like hey you have to like you should get certifications and you should get certifications um and try to upsell you like I'll be honest with you I'll be like hey I think that uh this is something you can do and it's very popular and you're going to do it because everyone's telling you to do it I think there's better ways to do it I'm going to make the content at least free and have affordable tier so you can support me so at least you don't waste your money you know what I mean like I just want people to I just want people like you know get a fair like a fair deal or or as as cheap as as cheap as possible if that makes sense yeah terrible business model that does make sense like but you're optimizing for longevity you're not optimizing for having a yacht that's right yeah yeah so I mean obviously certifications are the the key that's what people want it's it's kind of like a a an addition to a university degree if you have a University degree or if you don't have a University degree it's a way of proving competence from some Arbiter um objective Arbiter whether that's Amazon or Microsoft or one CompTIA one of these these other organizations that certifies people it it is like independent verification of your skills um and why certifications in 2024 why are certifications so important in your mind I mean um you know you know my my thought process is that certifications they they are a goalpost so there's something to work towards and they're structured learning um I I would say that I like the idea of certifications I like the idea of of it over diploma programs because they can be more agile uh uh more up toate more practical closer to what the industry wants uh whereas I think that schools um they're under like they like there's regul there's regulations and stuff like how schools have to operate and obviously the reason why certifications came about was because like you you go to a compsite program in my hometown and and they're teaching you uh per from 9 years ago and they don't ever update their curriculum right um and then there's this huge process to update it and so I you know I feel that it Ser service in need um so in in theory I like the idea of certifications but um I think the biggest problem with certifications as of as of today is that um these organizations are in a growth mindset like as of like as of today I found out like adabs laid off hundreds of employees from uh their training certification scene because it wasn't wasn't growing right either monetary whatever stuff and so we saw uh like strange behavior for the last six months where uh we had people like pro pro providing false expectations of what the outcomes of the certifications are so like they don't guarantee jobs but they do definitely get you a foundation of skills that are going to be useful um but I I think there's an issue where you have these organizations and it's not just us all of them um where not all of them but most of them most of them most of them where they are um uh they started out good and they were good for a period of time and now they're getting into territory of like okay now we're just here to get the money um and so I'm not saying stop stop taking certifications like I'm still rolling out like I think like six eight of us refreshes and I still believe in in in the content it's just more like align your expectations and think about how it's going to fit in reaching your goals right so if that makes sense maybe we could start like that's so interesting that you see like changes in the way the certifications are being uh you know essentially put out there maintained like you can't lay off I think you said hundreds of people is it really hundreds of people they said hundreds they said between um they said specifically sales and uh TNC were were the largest cut so we don't really know stands for training and certifications training and certification so they're directly involved for making their shts and providing like uh certifications they said they're going to move towards um on Dem and and work with um other vend like third party vendors but they could call me whenever they want but yeah but yeah those hypothetical third party vendors who uh they're they're so proactive about reaching out to you and involving you right not really well well I think we saw the other day about um what was the project it was uh FFM Peg where they were saying hey you can reach out to us whenever they want they say well maybe the channels aren't you know like I'm like no no they know who I am they can reach out whenever they want there's nothing stopping them so so people take it's like you can't speak up or you can't uh you have to like work a particular way but it's just sometimes it's just they don't want to for whatever reason so yeah yeah well um well one thing I want to talk to you about is just like the various certification you know ecosystems if you will like Microsoft has theirs uh Amazon Google uh I think uh hashy corp hashy corp link Foundation Linux Foundation of course yeah we worked with them who maybe you could rattle off like the big players in the space and um maybe some of the big certifications like just for the sake of every like I I'll take notes and I'll add these in the the notes um I always take notes during these so if you hear like a little keyboard clut it's not me like responding to emails or anything it's like I am furiously taking notes I've already got like four pages of notes from talking with Andrew here so um yeah if you could just r a off like who the players are and what they specialize in I mean we have Tech certification Cloud certifications Network Focus certifications security certifications those are our broad four categories I think I said four um and so you know when things started at least like as far as I remember like there were Tech certifications like the A+ certification and whatever other CompTIA certifications and like even back at like at our family family store back in the late 90s early 2000s those things were important getting an A+ certification especially working computer store people cared about those um we saw other organizations that spun up security Sears um and trying to like ccsp and things I forget the the parent organization but like their their process for accredit Edition was extremely uh involved like you had to uh uh show that you worked in the industry for so many years and you had to have another security expert vouch for you and the exam was broken into two separate parts so like the um uh the evaluation process was extremely extremely involved uh but you knew that you were getting uh very good uh uh people so the CT actually mattered right um I think for a while people talked about that they're saying like they didn't like how hard the requirements were it was considered gatekeeping so be some relaxing in there uh Microsoft always made certifications for years and years um before they weren't role based they were like per per um per techn technology and that was good for a long time but they just oversaturated their their Library they used to be very HandsOn like very lab driven um and it was a really great way to evaluate it but then uh they moved away from that maybe for cost purposes or uh they just over satat to the market and everything has now moved over to role Bas certifications right so I think us us was Ro an example of a role would be devops or site reliability engineer or something exactly like a title like that and so it was eight of us that really kicked that off um and for a while they were they were the leader uh I would say like 20 2014 to 2018 they were they were really uh uh they they really had this new model of like uh like the the certificate like the the the attestment part wasn't as hard you know what I mean it was just like a a multiple choice exam uh the content was short like shorter it was more role based it made sense at the time uh and then we saw Microsoft they started uh moving over to that and when Google wrote uh rulers out they did that as as well and so um you know I think for a while either of us like was was really defining this new new way of of making certifications but um I think as time went on um uh you know the novelty of cloud is worn off uh now we want uh people with like like you're not no one's looking for cloud Consultants anymore everyone knows how like how to work with Cloud now so now they want people with heart attac fundamental skills whether you a developer or uh like a network engineer or something else and then applying that to cloud and so um the uh the bar has not raised in terms of that um testing process like we talked about like those security Sears that were yeah Heavy Hitters and I think there needs to be an adjustment either the expectations of the outcomes of these certifications need to be realized and um be properly promoted not to false expectations or the evaluation process has to change so um do that Mak sense just to kind of recapitulate what you're saying the tests either need to be harder or they need to temper their marketing for what a certification is going to help you achieve either one one or the other right because um you know and it's just I would just say eight of us is is is in the the the hot seat right now whereas Microsoft has made some uh improvements like they have some some select tests they've made it open book so like you can go up to look at the documentation while taking the exam they've brought back some of their Labs um um Microsoft has been really good about like the Azure exams about actually using the tech I would just say the only frustration frustrating part about doing Microsoft exams is that their services are sprawling and so in theory their exams are are uh are well executed it's just that their technolog is a a pain to use in my opinion but um uh you know I I would probably say that Microsoft's doing the best uh with with their like how they're engineering their certification and their curriculum and and the issues they're having is not necessarily the exams it's more just the nature of of the state of their products because they're so rapid developing right like they're they're out there and like I just imagine them in a boardroom trying to like get a sale from like a school or or something else and they go around the table everyone says has to have this has to have has to have that and they go okay it has all that stuff and then they roll up those products and so their stuff is a bit more mishap but it does work in the end that's always been Microsoft forever do you know what I mean so there's like a totally different culture from Amon in terms of getting things done even though they're like located just a few miles from one another their headquarters and stuff yeah but but it like Microsoft's fast and loose but it works and like this comes back to like fixing computers like we remember like they would roll out their OS and then you're just like every month you're doing patches because they're fixing things because they just won't stop rolling stuff out but they're meeting the business demands of the organizations and even if it's not immediately they eventually do right and that's why there's such a juggernaut these days yeah yeah yeah I mean is it's been impressive just how uh I mean considering how much of a lead aw's had over Microsoft just Microsoft coming in really strong with Azure um yeah it's definitely an exciting company to watch uh to to see the decisions they make and like analyze them in terms of I'm an individual I want to earn some certifications like most of the people probably listening to this are not in control of like a a giant Cloud company trying to like figure out like what a cloud certification strategy might look like most of them are on the other side of it they're devs who want to earn some certifications and want to be able to uh ramp up their earning power ramp up their opportunity in terms of being able to get progressively more advanced roles in security or network engineering or uh you know Cloud engineering maybe you could talk a little bit about what these certifications can do for you in terms of how they can you know help in those regards I think they I think they lay out like a good road map in terms of or of the landscape of what you need to cover because once you cover something like let's say infrastructure is a code and you've done it in a few different iterations like terraform cloud formation whatever you have that skill right so no matter if Alibaba Cloud says hey we have a new product or there's like a spinoff like like uh Hashi Corp terraform got forked with open tofu or uh you know there's some like thing that's like a control plane that's similar to I the idea is that you have enough transfer uh transferable knowledge to uh to be dangerous and I do feel like there there is a certain amount of knowledge you need to gain over a period of time whether it's three or six years and every year you can tackle something different so like even through my career like uh you know even though I was building apps like it like and I was and I had like a team of developers and uh you know we had like a good amount of uh of users and and traffic or whatever um you know I would still have like a um like like blind spots like I was just like wasn't really good at optimizing SQL and I'm like this is the year I'm going to spend two three months and get really deep SQL knowledge and that never leaves me it's like early in my career it's like I invested that time learning regex right and um now I I get to keep that skill for the rest of my life do I remember all the the details of it no but I I have confidence with it and I I feel that every different type of certification Microsoft all the ones that we've been doing they're there's just like they're they're taking they're covering a part of the pie and so once you've done them you've done them in few different iterations you are now equipped to do anything you want to do like tomorrow if I want to be a data like a data engineer I can go do it if tomorrow I want to beor I can go do it because there's so much overlap of these skills um and so you know I I think that um you know certifications aren't the most efficient way to cover that that landscape of stuff but it's all there right and so if you just keep chipping away at it eventually you'll you'll have all the knowledge and you'll have that Mobility we had we ran a boot camp for was it terraform um uh like the terraform boot camp recently and we used GitHub as the platform and I I did something that I didn't do in the last boot camp was I I made everyone do poll requests um and wow I did not realize how many how many people like in the tech industry that are like in not necessarily developer roles but they're in like it networking or Cloud networking or security like their minds exploded because they didn't realize that they had this huge like missing Gap uh like just like working with GitHub or like just working with code um and so you know there's always these uh like if you can if you can get good coverage of of the fundamentals you're going to be dangerous no matter what you do right 100% I just want to emphasize like I I'll get on my soap box for a moment I think every developer every developer in 2024 should learn the following seven things at least you know dangerous as you said earlier like like you know the saying is you master the fundamentals you never really have to come back to them you've got that Foundation upon which you can build other things you've got all that knowledge that you can use as scaffolding to like Branch out and you know web in other knowledge into your uh inter your kind of like mind map sorry I'm mixing all kinds of metaphors there but I tell everybody you should learn you know HTML CSS JavaScript python Linux git and SQL and I tell people like if you learn those seven Technologies like uh you're going to basically you're you're going to have at least two scripting knowled languages that you know that are very different and their application to different tool ecosystems and stuff Python and JavaScript but you're also going to know databases you're also going to know operating systems you're also going to know Version Control and then HTML CSS are just convenient to know because you never know when you're going to need to build a quick user interface and everything like like even like electron I was talking with Jessica Lord who helped uh who founded the electron team at GitHub like every desktop app that like you launch probably on your desktop these days is probably not everyone but most of them make use of electron and what is that that's just HTML CSS and JavaScript running on a native app like on Windows or on on Mac right yeah um um so there was a uh I actually have deep knowledge on like implementing electron apps because it was like 2017 2018 I built a uh one of my favorite video games is um called um Tetris attack for the Super Nintendo probably love or pen pawn in Japan yep it's it's a high skill game it's deceptively High skill I spent way too much time trying to like get like the the combo system you're saying we could be playing right now any anyway well next time and I get together in person we're going to throw down on some Tetris attack I've got it on my SNES classic I uh uh I I think I it might come stock with it or I modded it but it should yeah yeah it's a great game um but uh so so um uh uh there's a Discord group where uh people play competitively and so I I join that I'm not not as good as they are but um you know they they play with emulators but there's a little bit of delay even with retroarc and so um um I was trying to build a competitor one for the market there was another one that got built in Python that beat me out um and I I got busy I actually before I was doing this that's what I wanted to do I wanted to build a a competitive game of of um Tetris attack but then I ended up building this company um and so I I learned how I learned how to read assembly code for the SNES for the ROM so that I could figure exactly like frame per frame the movements because if the if it didn't have exact frame per frame per mov then they wouldn't competitively play it and so I was basically cloning that and I I built the app in electrona typescript and it it worked pretty well but where I got stuck was um doing the multiplayer so I just I I had an estate where I'm working through U multiplayer and I had to build a simpler Tetris game just to try to figure out the uh the latency issues or like the miscommunication is issues I was having but that's just sitting there and it's postponed definitely it's not done like it's not cancelled but at some point I'll come back yeah and I'll I'll finish that game oh man it's just warm my heart knowing that you're like literally trying to recreate Tetris attack in a you know contemporary environment NE code FR frame for frame yeah yeah and and with Competitive Gaming like probably a lot of people watching this who are in the fighting game Community or something like people literally memorize how much frame every different type of punch in Tekken has or or in Street Fighter because like it all matters like you're you're doing all kinds of calculations in your mind to figure out like whether a combo will work whether it's safe to do a certain move in a certain situation and with Tetris attack like you really have to plan out like like your hands have to move really quick and stuff but also you your mind has to work really quick your eyes have to work really quick and you don't want to be playing on your original SNES and then jumping on like an online client and have the Frame data be even slightly different otherwise it completely throws off your game right uh and people people want that experience there's like what's called classic Tetris on NES I don't know if you have heard about this but people are still playing Tetris on NES like 30 40 years later after the release date um but basically that's the canonical version that everybody plays on the on the original one player uh NES not the Tangen twoplayer unauthorized Tetris I have the tetris uh movie downloaded though I can't wait to watch that by the way just saw my long list of things to do when I have time but yeah like Frank every frame matters every like making your emulator like especially if it's a competitive game making it exactly um how the original game is is vital or people just will not give it any time of day right that's like table Stakes it is it has to play exactly the same but uh and I was just thinking I'm almost at the point where I can come back to that game so like what and I had a whole team around it it was it was really interesting because I always want to make video games but if you find the right video game that people want want to be made the community will just like materialize so I had like a gra like a a pixel artist and a person that uh that made music and there it was really coming together it's just again it's like couldn't get there in time and uh but I'm almost at a point where I can revisit it and I just as of last week I was spinning up mono game or G mono game mono game which is a um it's an open source um engine uh so it's like writing Unity code except that you if you can if you you could Port it to any uh console and uh you don't have to pay any licensing fees and so I had to rush up on my net skills I was very tempted to make a c c course because my C skills are like really sharp right now but um uh it's just it's like it's fun because in Tech it's like whatever I learn is always transferable right so um you know I spent all that time learning different programming languages and you know one day I'm writing typescript the other day I'm writing C another day I'm writing Java and so again comes back to those seven core skills like you said JavaScript the point is just to get started in in those things and if you get started in those seven things you have all those starting points you just grow those all up right then you're going to be in really good shape um so even if they they seem like trivial like HTML and CSS seem trivial that's not the point the point is is that they're your Stepping Stones to get started right yeah I mean arithmetic may seem trivial but without it you can't do any of the higher math right you or like it's like I wanted to um like I'm coding a prototype gape in mono in in mono game because I uh I want to learn the engine and figure out the the architecture of how I'm going to build my game before I come back to my Swap and pop game yeah and uh while I'm building I'm building a shoot them up because that's like the classic that's in the background to you that you have there bullet hell Shooters so so I'm building a shum up where it's it's it's grocery store theme because I'm always uh I'm always fighting with grocery stores and so um I can you elaborate you're always fighting with grocery stores I I I live in I live in um remote towns and uh the grocery store here is just like pitiful because they they can charge more and the produce isn't great it's not all their F fault because in Canada we have I don't know if the word is uh uh monopolies orop there just a few sell just a few so so there's like there's L Blas and soes and there's Maybe like one from que you think they collude to keep prices High I don't know about I don't think so I mean in certain things they do in certain things like bread there was the bread fixing uh scam of of Canada seriously wow seriously bread is such an important staple like that's scandalous like we talk about white collar crime and stuff but like PE families rely on bread for literal sustenance way back to Rome way back to Egypt right like that that is just like if there's ever something that should be price protected it's bread you know what you know you know how much bread I buy per month cuz I have three young kids like uh six five four and two something like that and anyway so like they sandwich bread is like the biggest staple in my house I wish they would eat rice they just won't eat rice and so I literally buy 40 loaves like this big of of whole wheat bread every single month I drive two hours I just did a trip just yesterday that's why we couldn't do the podcast yesterday I did the bread run the bread milk run and like in town it sells for $4 almost $5 and it's like half the size and if I go into to Thunder Bay it at the whole whole Wholesale Club it's like 218 for twice the size yeah and so it adds up right and so I even learned how to like people are watching my like on my Twitter they were probably wondering like why I was so obsessed with making bread the last few months cuz I'm trying to offset my bread cloths and I'm not even kiding W so there's a pract it's not like some hobby that like rich people get really interested in yeast all of a sudden it's like literal like this is costing a fortune well it's just like I don't want to like I want to have selfsufficient skills so I don't go to the the local place and and the it's like partly their fault for overpricing but the other thing is like if you look at if you look at their supplier like their food comes from Family Foods which comes from uh McDonald's Corporation not like McDonald's the the restaurant but like McDonald's the guy named McDonald or something which then comes from soes right and then they set the prices so like there's nothing like if you're a grocery store you have to get your food from somewhere it's going to come from BL Blas it's going to come from soes and there's only so much Flex you have with price yeah I mean like they're passing they have to pass on some cost and they have to have some margin for themselves so the more middlemen you have I guess the price of bread just kind of explodes for the Inc consumer along the way but um but uh that's why I'm kind of like that's why I was making a grocery store like there's two games I I always want to make it's it's uh swap pop which is the uh Tetris attack competitive well in Tetris attack you have two blocks like you have a cursor and you swap the position of two blocks horizontally your only form of interaction right Swap and pop they pop when you get three or four or three in a row vertically or horizontally so so I want to make that my other game is I always wanted to make a grocery store simulator which is like you have like a you have you open a grocery store and you have to you have to manage the inventory and the employees and the visual layout of the store and then you have to deal with competing grocery stores because like in Canada like in my hometown Thunder Bay there was smaller grocery stores that were doing really well and the grocery stores kept trying to buy them out and there was a few where like their familyowned that I know them and and the family regrets not selling out because it's like their whole family lost out on a bunch of money because they ran them in they ran the competition out right so they they were growing they were having multiple stores and then they now they're back to just one store and uh you know it's just the nature of things so I don't know it's just it is what it is but like that's that's my obsessions with these particular things yeah man there was like a I think it was like Bloomberg or something Mall Simulator game browser oh yeah there there's uh yeah uh shopping Tycoon management I I can't remember but there was this newspaper that put together this this really cool like it had pixel art and Chip tune music and everything and it was like a simulation of what it's like to run a mall and of course it's like a nightmare because it's basically um like your tenants are having to move out because malls are not profitable and this was all preo of course uh so there's like even a subreddit like dead malls or abandoned malls or something where people like break into these like you know malls that have basically been like condemned and like explore and Splunk around in like the mold covered you know old movie theaters and stuff is they wear like Hazmat masks and stuff when they go in there but uh yeah like definitely I I can definitely see that being a terrible business to be in in 2024 and making a game about the plight of grocery store owners would be really cool just from like a kind of uh anthropological perspective and also From anolog perspective because I worked in grocery stores like I I didn't have like a cool Mom I mean my mom's very cool but she didn't run like a cool you know business where I could be fixing computers and stuff uh I I would go to the grocery store all the time as a kid and like check out VHS tapes and then later I worked for like two years at grocery store like I show up at 6 a.m. and like mop the entire floor and then I go stock and face the shelves and uh put all the big cardboard boxes into the trash compactor and try not to get my arm caught in there so I didn't have some like childhood industrial accident you know like um I have a lot of nostalgia for just walking around and hearing like you know Kenny G or whatever playing and and like the the FL some bulbs above so I I would definitely play that game if you make it well there's just so many I just there's just so many systems that you can think about in there like what happens when you introduce self checkout what happens when there's like an event like Co what happens when there is a competitor think about like every person that goes through that store like how far do they live to the store uh like all all the attributes of those of those people in simulating that like I like when you go to G where you put Food Matters so like there's a there's an optimization where it's like there's food at the eye level of like there's what at the eye level kids like you put stuff that that catch your attention that's where you put the sugar cereal right cereal like the stuff that you like that's cheap that would save people money but you don't want to buy you put on the bottom shelf the most expensive stuff that is like luxury you put on the top and then like there's like the the the one that's just right below there like there's all these little optimizations you go into the grocery store you smell flowers you feel like oh everything smells good then you see the produce you go everything's Fresh then you go to the bulk you like oh there's good deals they have bulk stuff here there's so pricing in everything too is like a huge deal because you know you can put everything half off or whatever you can get a membership card like then the people that are not members will be all cranky they have to pay like six bucks for a little thing of Greek yogurt instead of paying like four 450 or something right um so you're like pushing people into your to your Rewards program also like one thing I have no idea if this had an impact but if you think about cigarettes right like uh cigarettes were a massive to some they still are in the United States and probably in Canada they're big up here they're like remote towns they're huge right I me think about smokes They Don't Really perish like cigarettes are fresh I guess is fresh as like a cancer stick can be for like probably at least two or three years you can probably have that Carton and it's still consumable right and you have this little carton that costs like 20 bucks or however much cigarettes cost these days and uh it's like 20 or it's like 10 packs and it barely takes up any space it's very lightweight it's probably super easy to transport and that was probably like a huge Cash Cow for grocery stores in like the' 60s 7s 80s because you've got all these people that are addicted that smoke like an entire pack a day and they're just coming into your grocery store and it's a reason to get people to come back into your grocery store regularly too I mean like selling milk the margins on milk and bread are not nearly as high as they are on like cigarettes and stuff like that so I imagine that's also decimated this is total speculation by the way and and and thank goodness that the the tobacco industry is in Decline I'll just say I'll just share this anecdote Camel cigarettes when I was a kid and you know I made bad decisions like I smoke camel because Joe Camel you know the cool like James Bond of uh cigarette mascots right and uh so cool yeah Camel cigarettes just that brand Alone 6 million dead Americans 6 million people who died prematurely before their time because of camel so yeah if there's ever been an evil industry it like no question like the most evil industry ever was the cigarette industry anyway I'll I'll end that little uh that little Soap Box thing but but it just blows my mind like there was it it had to be like a bonanza like the the input cost it had to be like the greatest industry of all time uh in terms of just like how little work needed to be done and how much money was like enjoyed by the people who were I guess putting those products out there uh and how little of the cost was actually borne by the companies and how much of it was born by Society in the form of tax that we had to pay to help people who have like 50 pack years or whatever uh year of smoking cigarettes it's called a pack year that have accumulated like all these chronic diseases or you know even uh you know lung cancer anyway sorry this is not a public health podcast but I just felt like talking about that because cuz for me it's like therapeutic to talk about the fact that like I got taken in by this industry and like there was like a year or so that I year or two that I was smoked as a as a kid like as a like young teenager like 13 14 years old 15 years old right and um yeah anyway I hope I hope you never smoked and I I hope that none of our kids ever smoke I mean I worked in a bingo hall for years but like that was the closest you could say I smoked but no it's uh no asthma I'm not I'm not I'm notok for anything right you dodge a bullet with your asthma I hope your asthma's okay sorry I don't want me to that yeah it's fine but um you know like building these games aren't a waste they've always they've like any pass passion project I've buil I've always been able to turn into work so you know um markety which was one of my earliest applications I built I I flipped into like my earliest uh like uh uh contracts because people wanted something similar of what it was like Swap and pop that game in particular which is interesting I was just building it for fun but uh you know I I had worked at a previous um ettech startup and um you know I left I left and I interviewed at other edtech startups in Toronto that were education education focused and you know some of them I came pretty close to getting hired but uh um uh you know they they passed for whatever reason but like I took that project that Swap and pop and there was like an organization that was that was an edtech company and they would have hack and tells and you go there and you show off your what you do hack inel so it's like show Intel but hack something together in yeah so you say hey look at this cool project this is how I built it and they walk you walk through the technical stuff it was just it was it was a guys for hiring for this tech company um because they they would give you an award right like a gift certificate or whatever um but really what they were trying to do was hire the best talent and so I i' show this project and I like I like I one hands down because who's who's like going through and breaking down assembly code for a Super Nintendo game to make frame by frame stuff built in an electron app with whatever like talking about like why typescripts good and working with teams I didn't I didn't realize like when you're building a game and you have like four or five other people working on it it's like you need to know where everything is it's not the same as building web apps um and so you know they they they wanted to approach me and hire me I said you already had the chance to hire me you weren't interested but it just like but it's was just like how much of a magnet that project was um and so like any project like even if I was like building this Sim for let's say I was building Simulator for a grocery store like you you have to like I'm basically building uh there's software out there for inventory management and stuff like that for grocery stores do you know what I mean like I'm basically building that stuff um so I always find that you can flip that into work and that's a great way of you know whatever you're building like and people are worried about AI I'm not really worried about it that much like large companies should be like people working in large companies like ads Google whatever should like should be worried because they they know how to utilize it and streamline their uh their uh their Workforce to best utilize it these small companies don't yeah do you know what I mean so there's still lots of opportunity for work there's some there's some people out there saying like oh I I cut back on my customer support okay but they're not cutting out their Tech roles do you know what I mean so um and was it Devon is Devon the thing that yeah I keep hearing about it but I think a lot of it's probably Grassroots or what's it called astroturfing like people pretending to be developers like overstating it there's so much hypee out there but but the thing is what percentage they said like there's like they said there's a percentage of like that it was a percentage that they said that they could complete tasks that like GitHub issues they said it was like 13.9% I'm just like okay but we need 100% and then some so even even if they got 100% it still doesn't matter and a lot of those tasks are probably just like updating the copyright date in the footer and stuff like that like simple stuff that like you and I could probably do with our eyes closed that uh yeah it's cool it's definitely helpful that these tools are out there but I feel like everybody's just swept up in so much hype we could we could talk about this for a long time because like I I I you know like I listen to like interviews with like you know AI luminaries and stuff like that and they're like you don't need to learn to code anymore I'm like dude you're talking your own book you're basically trying to convince people that your product is like the next thing since the best thing since sliced bread since we were talking about earlier a Ty um like V it's like talking about VR or yeah I mean like yeah we'll see we will see but I would if I were uh you know somebody getting into code right now the last thing I would be doing is listening to what you know Jensen hang the founder yeah telling people you don't need to learn code anymore yeah right I I don't know any senior developers who are getting work done who many of whom use tools like copilot or have probably tried Devon uh that that that way like it's just interestingly it's just the people selling the the software that is supposed to be able to replace developers or people selling the hardware that it's supposed to be able to build you know train the models that are going to replace the software developers that are talking like this the actual developers don't feel this way I mean like I would I would use it tomorrow if like you be you'd see me making courses tomorrow on it if that was the case and I'm not saying like it's not worth your time to learn there's definitely there there are tools that you can utilize and you use AI tools I just want to emphasize that oh yeah I do a lot so so one of the thing maybe you could talk about some of your tools cuz first of all you've been a a very aggressive and early adopter of AI tools you know Bo who runs the Freo cam Channel whom you and I talk with all the time he uh he uses whisper um also from open AI to he's working on some scripts to like automatically have really high quality captions in English and which then feed into YouTube's Auto translations so they improve the the quality of translations by the way if anybody's watching this I really wish I could watch this with Arabic subtitles you can you can just click the gear and it's like three or four clicks they really bury it switch it to English and then switch to uh then once you've switched it to English like autogenerated or English if there's captions for this then you can switch it again and you can do auto translate you can have pretty good like uh I like we we did Auto translate into Japanese the other day in Yoko on our team she was watching and she's like oh this is pretty good like this is not bad at all considering it's just kind of on the Fly translating but uh obviously we're using whisper for that but like you've used AI like voice cloning talk about some of the AI tools you've used yeah so I mean I mean I think that that's probably the one that sticks out the most which was thei the um the synthetic AI voice and the reason I had to do that was because I was losing my voice uh it's called um muscle tension dysphonia uh so there's one where it's it's like you wear it out the other ones it's like it's degenerative and so like I have like degenerative voice loss if I keep straining my voice and not utilizing it properly it just has to do with uh the predisposition of predis it's just you know genetics right genetics and and uh but anyway the point was is that there was a point where like I could not talk for like six months and I was like well I can't stop making courses and so I I literally went through like I don't know how many uh like voice products uh to Sy and even try to run my own model to make a synthetic voice and eventually I you know I I got a voice that worked but it's not just getting the voice it's getting the workflow with your technology because like a lot of these things don't make it easy to like type it out and then download the part of it and then sync it up so we had to um figure out the right voice that would sync up with our workflow and then we had to figure out how to um there was like another part was like we were trying to do like uh trying to figure out okay we have the voice can we do video as well because I hate it being on on screen right yeah I just hate I I found that I would I would it would take me like you know that like 30 second 15c video I make in the beginning beginning of the the things all day every single time I got a teleprompter I got everything it takes all day to do 30 seconds because I'm I'm terrible at that well people I think most people are terrible at I'm terrible at it too uh which is one of the reasons I don't even like use any sort of teleprompter or anything like that like for the intros I just practice practice practice practice practice uh just to try to get it down to when I can do it on my sleep like the like the baselines I practice those I don't know hundreds of times before I attempt to perform at the beginning of the uh the podcast just because uh being able to perform on the spot there's always something that you're not completely happy with like recording that audio book I I wrote a book last year I recorded the entire thing that took me like two weeks of like just sitting there with a microphone reading it saying no I didn't get it right let me redo it and then going back and editing all that and it's probably twice as bad when you have video just because like maybe like I don't like the way I like delivered that line and I can't just do a nice cut because there's going to be jump in the video too right actually editing video it's obvious where the edits are with with sound you can get away with like less uh I guess you can do more editing with sound than you can with sound and video back to the ey like back in 2018 or whenever 2016 I always forget when we our company started but whenever we started it like I had an like I already had an AI bot that would that would analyze how students would study and make recommendations uh we stopped running that because we needed to rebuild it and the issue was once we started branching outside of AD bus it became you needed like a specialized um model per like per like family of certifications right so so we had that for a while um I'm trying to think uh we were trying to do like generate our PowerPoint slides so like we have a we have like a huge collection of uh like a huge library of slides and there's this huge issue of like when you have to update them it's like I was trying to make it so like it would generate out the code that I needed and just like make the slides for me and so you know I'm I'm not saying we're having 100% success with these tools but I'm just saying that we're constantly trying to experiment and try to automate our pipeline so we can stay as small as we can and we can expand me the brand because the hardest thing in this industry is getting other creators to create content with you at the same like the same standard right so like I know other people that make great content like can you make make it like me no I I make it my own way and I have my own curriculum development and I have my own production standards and stuff like that um and and then it's like even like can they deliver the same timeline and stuff like that it doesn't always line up right so it's so hard um and you can be dumping money at people and they still they still like ah they get 75% of the way they're like ah it's not for me do you know what I mean so it's this is this it's very hard you wouldn't think it is but it's very hard to have some of the skill sets and the stuff to do this and so you know I we made the determination that we're just going to scale me virtually um it's not to say like where we're we're tricking people because it's still me it's just like if I can't use my voice you wrote every word that is being said it's just that you know you you don't necessarily have the voice to be able to say and you don't want to spend like an entire day in front of a teleprompter starting over reading you know but you know what it's like my my AI voice it you can tell it's not me because I'm I'm not stumbling or I'm not going ums or stuff like that and so people people like I I would say they're getting so good I think I have to generate a new voice because there's a newer model that is even more realistic like you would not you would not know that it was me like my older one sound like I have like a mild cold but like nobody complained um and I'm not like and I would intermix I would shoot videos like where it seems like a little more livelier because now I'm in the video right so like if there's some really important stuff you'll you'll hear me but depends on the course but you know most most of the time it's me um but there are there are some courses that are um like we just want to fill in our catalog we want to get the content out and it's content that would never get made if it wasn't for voice because it's just like I don't I can't I can't give my voice to that stuff so I wouldn't I just again I don't feel like I'm cheating people but I noticed like YouTube was saying recently that and I think we talked about this earli when I first started doing I said like hey I should label saying this is a synthetic voice because eventually they're going to ask people to to do that and yeah we we had a discussion with with YouTube's you know team yeah last week about this like we don't believe that we should have to label things that are just you know humans that that are actual creators doing I think like obviously if I'm trying to pretend that I'm some celebrity and like putting words in their mouth that should be labeled just like you know this contains like AI you know generated speech or something but I don't think if if I'm using AI which I've never used it but I will I will say real quick very excited about this there's going to be a voice cloning um course that we're publishing ly Lyn Jung on our team who's created like the stable diffusion course and some other things she has taken my uh the Corpus of audio from me reading my audio book and she's created a really good voice model that and I can speak like German I I can't speak a word of German but you can hear Quincy speak you know Flawless German are are you saying that they could TR they could do translation with my ality and another yeah they can like wrap they the way it works is they build the model and then they kind of like wrap it around like some recorded speech so if there's like a weather report they can basically just have me say with the same intonation and every but it's my voice instead of you know the the weather lady's voice I've been trying to get somebody like I I've been trying to just so many times trying to get people to make like a Spanish version of my or something and and I'll I'll hand them all the material and they're like yes I want to do this whatever we'll even pay them can't get done no matter what ly could help you with that because we have a Spanish free Cod Camp Channel we could definitely publish some of your shirts in Spanish now generally like people like to learn from somebody who speaks their language whose culture but they're never making it so what's you know what I'm saying like it's true I mean long time it's a matter it's not a matter of like I wouldn't give it to somebody else it's like like look at my boot camp it was 100 hours who's going to translate that who nobody nobody you're right there is some work that just has to be done by machines just because humans ain't got time for that right well and you know like originally like I was going to I was going to learn Spanish like I I used to live in Spain so I had some some level of Competency in Spanish and so I was going to go and brush it up and everyone's like oh no no don't do that and I was like but why not no no one will do it for me and they're like no you should get a Spanish person like but no Spanish person will do it for me even though they say they will even with money no matter what so it's just kind of like like um but uh I don't know is hard to find well I mean it's it's just it it's it's just hard um and uh you know I don't know it's it's just hard I mean it's the work is hard like it's not it's not like you being a a mean person whatever it's just like this this role of conton creation is a grind and people do not realize that you get 90% done and then there's 90% more to do and then there's 90% more to do and then there's 90% packaging and then 90% uh marketing and you just feel you just want to be done and over with it and quit every time every course I mean what are we trying to do we're trying to take your expertise your knowledge of cloud computing of the certifications having gone drilled prepared past them or intentionally failed them and uh like like that lived experience that that knowledge that's in your head and break it out into hundreds of PowerPoint slides and walk through all the concepts walk through all the terminology walk through all the ways that like a certain type of technology is slightly different from others find the parallels like I mean your courses the the certification Prep course they could be like a dozen hours of just for one certification right um we just want that expertise and we want everybody will to have that so they can go past this these exams they can earn these certifications they can go out and win in the job market and they can uh get better jobs have more opportunity than they would have had without these certifications right like it's all a means to an end and that end is having families that can afford to put bread on the table Yeah so but um uh back to AI like AI generation for like like I like to use little icons to sprw stuff up so it's like instead of going to Flat icon I can just be like hey give me an SVG icon of something unique and so uh I think that that removes some of some of some of those things before you had to purchase those assets um AI grading so we we built out validators originally with the intent to have it AI graded um because when you are trying to evaluate whether people are doing doing work it's basically just pull apis that bring back Json and say does it look like they set this thing up right and AI could do that but the problem was is that uh the token the token window wasn't large enough to analyze window context window sure it might be now but I'd have to go back to it and so it depends on the the model but like I think like GPT 4 Turbo has like a much larger contact windso CLA has like a really large context window um you can fit like an entire code base into that but you know but even still was like we ended up just having and I just thought about it more I was just like it wasn't hard to write Jason validators that said okay did this show up in the code and so we do have like that was one of the outcomes of the boot camps was like we now have validators for everything almost um which is exciting um but anyway yeah that was another another uh example of uh validation but when we did the boot camp uh we did we're talking about the AWS boot camp the big one tell us just like for people who've never heard about this AWS boot camp it's like 95 hour video or something like that maybe more than 100 hours so like it was a 100 hour video but like there was more to it than that like people went okay I can finish this in 100 hours and said no no no no no no you don't understand this was done over the scope of four to five months so yes you're watching the videos but like whatever you're watching it's three times the labor so like you're putting like 300 400 hours of working in fact today I actually have to do this later but there's somebody that just said hey I wasn't part of the boot camp when it ran but I just finished it all 100% Andrew can you please go grade me and Mark it over even though I'm outside of it and they did all the work so I'm going to go after this call I'm going to go um uh even though it's out of scope I'm going to go I'm going to go that's really chill so you you actually look at their work and it so there are actual deliverables there are projects this is Project oriented learning right so so for that one what I wanted to do was I wanted to uh uh if anybody got to a certain checkpoint I would grade them so we had I think it was like what was it I'm going to go look at the website for the signups since I forget it'll it'll come back to me for Aus Cloud project boot camp adus cloudro bootcamp.com uh we had 10,000 students enrolled but we actually had a list of 50,000 backlogged 50,000 people who wanted the ticket who couldn't take it just because we had to you didn't have the manpower to capacity there was actually there was a reason for it and it had had to do I think with what was the there was a capacity limit at exactly 10,000 oh so like originally what we were going to do is we were going to see if we could have everyone in sandbox accounts and there was like a hard limit of 10,000 is what we determined based on something like at dat bu or something there was some kind of metric I can't remember what it was but there was there was a hard limit of 10,000 we we didn't end up using that system we we did Manual grading so what I found was that every single week we had people that dropped off because um it's hard to do something for that period of time at that level complexity and that's actually just normal for um for uh for Education you always expect to lose 40% per week yeah that's a guarantee me it's like even the best courses of all time on like corsera like uh Stanford's own like course platform have like two 3% completion rate you know free C Camp has a very low completion rate frankly a lot of people uh their eyes are bigger than their stomachs when it comes to doing hundreds of hours of or they or they get to where they need to get to right like it's not necessarily it's it's just like right it's like working out it's like you get you get some kind of level of skill but anyway like when you do it for that long um it will down from like from 10,000 to um I'd say a thousand near completion with a 100 core people that like really finished it yeah and so um that was fine like that was actually good numbers uh for for what it was and you know like when you say how you going to grade 10,000 people I didn't have to grade 10,000 people I had to grade um thousand people and then 100 people really well yeah right um and I really enjoyed it I got really fat even though I had lost a lot of weight I lost a lot of weight again I'm losing weight right now again just because stress of like grading all these people uh no no no no no no no it's just I no it's just um but anyway it's just well I mean you said you got really fat what do you mean I well because I was here like right now I'm in standing but like I was sitting all day every day taking calls every single day I didn't have time to prepare good meal good meals because I was like we were making it we were we made the course like I sorry I made the I we were making a product like a um a social media platform I clone of Twitter right and I didn't plan it ahead it wasn't like I it was all stage it was like we're building something for real and we'll we'll have class this week and then throughout the week I have to make it right so it was like we had a general idea what we wanted to build but it was it was um we say build the as we cross it uh and it led to a very unique experience that I don't know if I could replicate again because uh I didn't make any money off of it not that so how much did the boot camp cost to attend uh nothing it was free it was 100% free for for for students like not free for me not free for you did you have sponsors how did you make it work uh we sorry we had a couple sponsors so we had uh like a we cloud data which is a um a school in Toronto they're like super nice Adrian krill who's my competitor SP sponsored me he was very generous um you wouldn't think that he would sponsor maybe he's trying to push you in an early grave overing you yeah right he's oh no he's go for do a lot of these no he's a good guy's he's like he's just jokeing I'm sure he's a good guy I just but um um I thought we had another sponsor but yeah it was like there was no it was at the time where all these layoffs were happening so people said they said Andrew you're going to have the easiest time getting sponsors and then all of a sudden everyone's like we can't get sponsorship for anything yeah like there like like there's there's events where people have like 500 people and they'll they'll get like $200,000 in sponsorship and I I I had sponsorship like 20 30 and and and and we we like we out of pocket our company xam Pro was like $70,000 right so it wasn't like it was free it cost me money and uh you know we we kind of made it up when we did the terraform boot camp so we had to do a hybrid thing with the terraform boot camp and it kind of It kind of alleviated that but really like this cost of the booth Camp came from me making all the courses the free courses that we published at free Cod camp and people optionally paying for the additional materials which they don't need to pass let's talk about exam Pro's business model I I definitely want to talk about uh you know your terraform uh boot camp and things like and you use the term boot camp a lot of people think coding boot camp like boot camps have actually existed I think back since since the bubble like it's it's considered a newer phenomenon but the idea of basically having like something quick to quickly help somebody acclimate to a new field a new category of skills that they're trying to acquire right uh so a boot camp doesn't necessarily need to be like oh I paid $20,000 and I study for 16 weeks or something like that that's like what it was during the the height of the boot camp craze and like 2014 20 through 2018 maybe that's about right yeah between that but like examp Pro you publish you know huge video courses uh on fre Cod Camp dozens of them on pretty much every cloud certification you can imagine like entire ecosystems like all the AWS you know categories of certifications and it makes people mad too like other conon creators it makes them mad because that they they say um it's not that problem anymore but at one point that uh Conor creators believed that I was um uh uh running running everything to the ground because if if I release the videos for free then who's going to buy a paid course that's just videos you have to do something additional to it and it turns out people will still pay for people love spending money like people still use udemy and and pay $25 for a course that they're never going to actually watch because it feels good to buy to walk into a bookstore and buy a book because it feels like you're buying the time to actually read that book people people people love to like Express their intentions and their aspirations through purchasing well it's like a hot dog too right like like you want ketchup mustard and relish on and and different people bring different perspectives right so there's there's room for more than like people think like I'm worried about other competitors it depends like if if somebody's trying to do exactly the same thing in the exact funnel at the exact time as me that's a problem but if we were friends and we coordinate and they going and this lot people don't know this like a lot of the creators in the space were all F like a lot of us are friends some of us were very antagonistic early on it was very problematic but a lot of us like we like we get out of the way of each other right so that we we both can do well and be we're technical competitors but we can we can both do well and uh it's usually an issue when there's just like there's some people that are just like they're just they just want to yeah make the most and do everything right and I I look like that because I do a bit of everything but I don't really cause that much damage in in these areas if a lot of you doing everything is just because you're intellectually very curious and you love learning about these new technologies and taking these exams like you're like an exam nerd or like certification nerd in the way that like daal Shaw who runs class Central is obsessed with massive open online courses from like Stanford and MIT and stuff like he he sleeps and breathes this he goes to conferences where he just talks he's just giddily excited about this and you give me the same Vibe as far as technical certifications um so one thing one question I have for you the way exam Pro works the way that you're able to publish all this content for free on YouTube on the free Cod Camp Channel and still you know buy expensive bread to give to your kids uh and put gas in your car for a twohour road trip every time you want to get groceries um like like how does exam Pro actually work like what kind of additional things can people buy on exam pro. we like the idea is that we believe that there should be a base level that's free like the videos so that even if you can't afford anything you can pass right you should you should be able to fill the gaps yourself so everything is is like it's it's almost kind of like the the Cosmetics of of DLCs and video games or I shouldn't say that're they're more useful than that but it's like um it would be like we always give a free practice exam so that's our our trick to get you to come to the platform is like we live we always say come to the platform get the free practice exam you go there and then we have downloadable the these are the pain things downloadable slides downloadable cheat sheets um better better digestible content because we put it on freeo Camp as the big video and that's intentional because we want to create a like just a little bit of friction and if you go to our platform you can watch the videos individualize yeah and you can actually there's like a pretty cool like workflow where you like click through and everything's broken out into different like if if if anybody's ever taken a course on like um educative or class classify or something I can't remember the names of these different platforms but they're they're basically like you can just pay a fee to like have this and you can put your site on that but you have all custom and it's much better than those in my experience because you've like gone through and like engineered everything so you you you progress through the different things and you get like stars moving across if I if I recall correctly yep yep yeah so it's it's like a an incredibly wholesome like productive learning environment for people who have a very clear goal I want to pass the AWS uh whatever certified Cloud practitioner or the devops one of the harder ones right which whatever is the yeah whatever of the nine or 12 whichever certifications so maybe you talk about like the the pricing and like how much it costs obviously this is not an ad for exam Pro but I'm actually I'm just curious about these things because I I want for creators to be able to survive and and provide foran this is more just like this is more just information for other creators if you're just wondering how how the the to watch model works and maybe you want to do something similar and go on free C Camp and make think like how do how can I make free content but also make money yeah right because like we're not colluding here or or doing anything crazy here with free C Camp anybody can do it um yeah I mean we're very selective about whom we'll publish on free Cod camp but once you get past that yes if you are somebody who is good at what you do know a lot about what you do and want to create a course on some esoteric technology uh like cold fusion or uh or whatever right like four TR we've got a Fortran course or we we got a cobal course we don't have a four Tran course if anybody wants to create one if you're like some old guard you know uh Mainframe person and you you want to create a course on that as long as you're good at teaching yeah we're we're down you and I think the thing is just like finding a means to for we can make more videos right because it's just it's it's a silic but like right now it like looks like our prices are 29 USD I don't control the pricing that's all that's for like one certification like basic it's it's not a monthly recurring is there no we don't do subscriptions we don't believe in I mean maybe one day we'll have them but like I like people don't like them because they get charged when they don't want something yeah right so like maybe eventually we'll introduce a subscription but like we'd make sure that you can opt out of it and I there's other competitors in the space um that like I I was recommending but then when I sent up their platforms their content there was description then you still have to pay more and then like it was so hard to unsubscribe I really didn't like it like it was in Cloud space in particular and like I I L I literally yelled at them on Twitter because I wanted my money back because I was trying to recommend them because they had Labs like like lab systems I didn't have I don't care if people need education I want to recommend them to other places and so these are obviously ways to grow your organization and so you know we fundamentally thought okay we're just going to charge a single time fee it does expire after 3 years but we assume like the content will be expired by then anyway and also you should do it by then yeah it's like a little little uh carrot like you only have two years 11 month whatever it is a year two years again I don't know what I don't what the parameters are if it's a year or three years but it's the certifications are constantly getting refreshed like yeah and if people come to us we're pretty good about like oh I you know I want I I was just getting back into like fine here you go we'll just we're pretty like even people steal our content we're pretty uh lazy fair about it like cuz we like again everything's soft gated so it's like you know like don't don't if you're listening don't take you know Andrew's hard work and put it on bitor or something like that like you know 30 bucks depending on where you live do you have any sort of needbased scholarships or anything like that for uh people that are like in lower income countries have you ever experimented with like purchasing power priority we were we were trying to like it has to do with the payment Gateway right and so we were trying really hard to switch our payment Gateway and we spent like four or five months doing this and it just like the technology is just still really hard to get implemented so I don't know this is like this again this is why we're so relaxed about it but like you know I've seen people and they're like in West Africa they're you know like they're dealing with like constant power outages and they can't spend $10 outside outside their org right like or or their or their country not their their country is not an organization they're uh maybe one day but anyway anyway hopefully hopefully the countries remain nation states corporations that would be very uh that'd be very yeah but um but you know I would just say like I've seen people they take like screenshots of every single thing and made their own like downloadable slides and stuff like that but like I think that we're like we have a full free practice exam and all the contents there so like you wanted to go take screenshots of all the things so you have the slides so you can review them I don't care but it's it's another thing if you're uploading them to to torrent sites right that's that's another story like because you're optimizing for other people right so again I'm like there's people that go and they like they'll take videos and they're likey Andrew can I go record one of your practice exams on YouTube and review them I go sure I don't care do you know what I mean like I'm like I'm that relaxed about it because you know I I I know there's enough there that people are generally going to pay for it you know what I mean and the people that I I don't feel like like I've seen other people they've taken my content and they made free ebooks out of them yeah that is kind of like sketchy though when they're like literally selling stolen content I think that they weren't they weren't selling it they just were they're just they just were studying and they they uh they enriched it and put it in a format to the point where it's like I almost wanted to pay them so that we could put it on the marketplace which just never did yeah um and so I just went and they they were pretty transparent about they like yeah I did this and that and I went oh okay other companies would sue sue sue you out the nose but like for me I was just kind of like you know what I mean because if we're still making like I'm still if I can still afford things I don't care so much it's like people pirating video games like you know you heard about Nintendo uh and and the the tears of the Kingdom I've never played it but like the that one where they're going after um the uh the emulator for Nintendo like Nintendo switch because they're worried about it and so I'm very I'm very relaxed about it so until it actually impacts me I'm I'm pretty much yeah yeah you definitely don't like Nintendo has kind of like really damaged their reputation with Indie developers by being overly litigious and you don't want to do that you want to create like an ecosystem of people who are excited about exam Pro and recommend it and you don't want to have like a an iron fist as far as people um trying to use your tools right so but yeah camp like that's all built into our you know very permissive open source license you know people can take the free Camp PL it's by Design but when you're actually creating stuff that's not open source that you're trying to sell there's probably a lot more judgment involed I mean it's more like it's the issue is more like when we have schools that take it and they use and they do do this there's been schools the states and the UK not even like it's not like weird it's not like say I shouldn't say the word weird I just mean like countries where uh they're developing countries and they have a a inaccessibility to content I have no issues with them these are organizations that are all about making money they're in the US and the UK and they take my content they use in the curriculum um and they try to find ways around it so for instance they're taking the free Camp content and uh there's internal students there saying hey this is Andrew's content do you pay them or anything cuz they're paying like thousands of like like 7 to 7,000 to $10,000 to veterans veterans of the US at schools using the the the content that was published on free Co camp and so they they told me and I said hey you can't do this you like I said you should I said I would say like if you want to use this content pay a licensing fee and we'll even give you more to update up todate content so what they did instead is they took they took that down and they found one of my older unimi courses cuz I published them on un for free which never worked out by the way I just forgot about them and so they started using cont from like six seven years ago they're like well it's unies thing like and I was like are you kidding me and and these are accredited schools and so I went to their their accrediting board and said hey look this is not they're not they don't know what they're doing they're just taking content off the internet and then teaching and charging 10 thousands to veterans that are subed by the US government man veterans are so exploited I'm sure a lot of people listening to this have served in the US uh the US military uh and other militaries too but like once you have that GI bill money and or like like there are so many grifters out there trying to separate people from their hardearned money that the government gives them for their services uh I mean it's as Tail as old as time like the uh the M Mustang dealership uh right next to the uh the uh Army Recruitment Center and stuff like that right but but with with courses it's really like we want people to be spending that money on community colleges and universities and things like that not on you know kind of shoddy vocational training programs that are privately operated and I'm sure they are good programs too but it is definitely like it comes down to the indivual SCH it's frustrating when they're cutting Corners I mean first of all free Cod Camp use free Cod camps curricula like our actual curricula is totally chill to use right it's open source is accessible anywhere there are lots of organizations that run free code camp on a local network within like uh you know like prisons for example that don't have internet access shout out to persevere um and there are also a lot of uh you know computer labs in places that don't have good internet access which there are a lot of places like that in the US you know the the most developed wealthy country in the world right but have really bad internet coverage and a lot of people will take free Cod Camp they'll put it in like a computer lab at a school so people can actually like learn without having highp speed internet yeah it's a it's a different story when it's like people where like they don't have power half the time or they or they have a lack of access to Internet or it's a different story right but absolutely but but like we would be totally chill if people use free Cod camp in those circumstances but you know exampro Andrew Brown and other creators like please don't just wholesale take their material and and sell like free Cod Camp is designed where you can do that you can even white label free Cod camp and pretend it's your own coursework as long as you don't claim your free Cod Camp that's technically within the bounds of free Cod Camp's life for the interactive textual curricula which is all created by me and a whole bunch of other instructional designers and the open source Community but the stuff we publish on YouTube is like everything you publish on YouTube even though we're publishing it it's still technically copyright Andrew Brown and exam Pro right and and we want to always make sure that those copyrights are respected by everyone so sorry I'm it's hard to enforce copyright but it's just it's just about being respectful a lot of times creators like I'm a very flexible Creator and and my you know my attitude is like I'm just here to help people so when the inis boot camp one the uh the women cyber security had had adapted that and used it to teach a cloud for people that are getting cyber security I didn't ask for any money I just said oh great you're going to help more women get into cyber security you need a cloud basis here you go like I just need to understand the nature of they weren't trying to do this surreptitiously they no no I like sometimes people do things that they don't ask permission but it sometimes it's not an issue with me it's just like it really has to do it's like are you trying to charge some do you not have the expertise are you trying to charge someone $10,000 you know what I mean like for some and it has no outcome for them and do they even know that it's the content's coming for me are you are you misrepresenting the content so like my my goal is like I if I could and like if I wasn't a forprofit company like I I mean I wish I was a nonprofit company there just nonprofits are uh it's hard it's hard it's hard I know it's hard it's hard right and it's un like I'm just not in a place where it's like if I my house was paid off if I if I if I I didn't have debts a house and I was like a little bit a little bit better off I would be a nonprofit and my my whole curriculum would be even more transparently open course I'd make it an open book and I would be trying to push it onto places so that they there was a base level of that stuff so we need people who have these skills and and speaking of that like obviously we've been talking a lot about like the Creator economy and like the realities of creating content getting it out the distribution channel that is like YouTube uh the distribution channel that is like you know free Cod Camp if you want to look at it that way like I have an email newsletter that has 7 million recipients each week that is a way that I can help share the work of Andrew Brown and help more people prepare for and earn these certifications for example but like beyond that kind of like Creator related stuff and I'm sure there are a lot of creators listening in the audience for whom this is really excited about I want to get to the real um the real powerful unlock for everybody listening and that is talking about certifications and for people who want to earn certifications how they should focus their time so my first question for you if I'm a developer in 2024 maybe I've completed a few of the free C Camp certifications which are free that you can just earn by you know completing the projects and everything like that and I want to earn some professional certifications from big companies like Amazon or Microsoft where do I start what would you recommend for a basket of certifications that people should focus on if they just want to have the broadest opportunity possible before they really want to specialize before you get to certific if you should have a base knowledge of technical skills and so some uh what what free Camp delivers with their uh their free certifications the ones that you provide in different technologies will give you a basis of it if you don't have programming skills if you don't have networking skills if you don't have uh any like OS skills Linux skills you you will pass Cloud certifications but you won't be able to do anything when we did our itus boot camp we had people that held Pros Specialties all the highest level clusters notifications they couldn't use Discord they couldn't use a g like a GitHub account they could not write code they could not make diagrams they could not build anything they could not communicate properly and so what I'm saying to you is that CLA certifications require a another level of Base skills that you either have to do prior or during and so when I make my cloud courses I throw in a bunch of stuff in there that is not part of the certification okay and it will take longer to do and it'll be be annoying and it'll it'll take longer to get your goal but you have to have these skills and so you either want to obtain those skills first before you do it now let's talk about certifications certification like Cloud certifications I I think the the approach that is better is to go broad before you go deep okay so uh if you ask everybody else they'll always say go deep into like just pick a cloud and go deep into that yeah and and the reason I I say no is because every single cloud has their biased has their gaps and um they just won't have good coverage of the landscape of of stuff you need to learn and and you basically do need to learn it all not all at once but you need to learn it you need you need to learn it so um Microsoft has a very good approach where they have a bunch of fundamental certifications so they have their fundamentals which is just general Cloud then they have their data fundamentals their AI fundamentals their security fundamentals and there's probably another one and so that is a great approach because you're getting across uh across the board good coverage of your stuff and then when you have that then you can go deeper on another cloud and if you go into ads ads uh um their Cloud certification is it doesn't have enough coverage so you could do ad of us and then do all the other fundamentals that Microsoft has the only disadvantage of doing the Microsoft ones is that they're they're all focused specifically on their products so now you have to go to other clouds to to fill those gaps and I want to talk about like how those gaps are different if you are on the Microsoft platform um active directory which is a huge staple of the of the tech industry is extremely well covered on their platform okay you go to AWS it's like it doesn't exist you go to gcp it's like it doesn't exist and so that's like one big gap that you will have if you use if you're ons and you learn about servess Technologies they're first class over there they work excellent they're they're just so well interconnected you over to Azure Microsoft Azure and they are just not the same thing whatsoever like you don't use Azure functions to build apps with it you use it to execute like background jobs for integrated services on the platform it's it's like a totally different different thing because they're so underdeveloped you go over to gcp and gcp just real quick Google Cloud uh Pro what is it platform Google Cloud platform and AWS Amazon web services inter that's fair that's fair because they're they're different yeah the initialization there but like gcp you go over there they're really good with data like big queries like unbelievably great service uh their their ml services are unbelievably unbelievably excellent um and it's just it's just like it's just they're they're completely different so like people say they're the same and they are to a certain degree but then they're they're different and they'll give you a different aspect of of of the industry right right like uh and when you when you work at places it's it's yes most use a primary cloud provider but they're going to have a different way of working so um you know like Microsoft they're very CLI driven like everything is like when you're learning is like you're using scripts that are preexisting you're using lots of Powershell you're using lots of net you're using lots of dot Windows servers if you don't know that ecosystem you're going to have a hard time right and that's like a big gap as well not knowing that EOS like my cofounder he's really good at that stuff so I always I'm always pulling him in for that kind of stuff so I don't know it's just I would just say trying to get as much broad coverage as possible and that's like the opposite advice a lot of people say but it's weird because there's an older adage of a tshaped developer where you go Broad and then you go deep but people seem to have forgotten that or or they're they're just they're they're just in their bubble of their bias like they're in their like they're in their team and they just want to stick with their team I mean I I guess if I was just like somebody who didn't know a lot about what it was like actually working in Tech and I was just like I'm just going to pick AWS and I'm going to earn every AWS certification got to catch them all and like yeah you're like going through you're learning uh you're using exam Pro to like cover the fundamentals and I'm I'm uh relieved to hear that like you cover a lot of stuff that isn't on the exams just because it is stuff that people should know that goes beyond the scope of the exams but like I could easily see someone just using the official docs and just trying to grind through and earn these certifications and completely not seeing the forest for the trees that these certifications cover very specific you know tools that are all you know it's it's like building a castle in the sky right without that Foundation there to hold everything up you you might as well be like there there's that um the Chinese room Paradox right it's like a machine learning thing like if you're in the room and you have like some book and people are feeding in these Chinese characters and you're looking at the book and you're you're figuring out what Chinese character follows what character and you're ping that out you could technically be like an amazing you know Chinese character token predictor like uh without ever actually knowing Chinese because you're just following like some instructions but you don't actually understand what's going on by learning the fundamentals you ascend from being a mere you know automaton inside of you know a a Chinese character producing room uh to actually being somebody who knows what they're doing and understands the importance of tools and when to use certain tools in which context and all this stuff you're a wellrounded developer you're a tshaped developer right like you've got that breadth and then you've got that depth in the security space or the network space or whatever area you choose to specialize in right so so I know I'm just recapitulating what you said but uh 100% I think that uh it it is absolutely important to get the fundamentals okay well and there's other ones like that aren't Cloud specific like you should know I so like take the ter form CD as one you should know you should know how to work with uh Version Control Systems take the GitHub Foundation certification you should know how to do programming take the C certification right yeah free Camp has a a free C certification that we develops in partnership with Microsoft it uses official Microsoft documentation and we kind of like curated with them there there's ones there are no sort of like I don't think there's a SQL certification but it's like go take the the SQL course on free Camp when we did our boot camp all all of the prerequisites uh were free cam content it was all all all free Camp because we could fill all those gaps there the only the only challenge with like some of the stuff is that again it's not it's not it's not a problem it's just that people like things when they're packaged in a particular way so like a lot of these things it's like they're Great Courses there's like a compai course that came out uh like I think a recent like covered comsi but just like for some reason like if it's not packaged a certain way like there's not a goal post at the end you don't get a a paper at the end and and there's uh uh ways of checking it people kind of can discredit these things which which seems really silly to me um and so you know like it's not like I'm like crazy about certifications it's just the fact that it works as a mechanism to get people motivated um and so you know if there is a way to break out of that it'd be nice but I I don't think there is it's just the way humans are you got to play to to to how humans think yeah absolutely the teacher has to meet the learner halfway and empathize with the learner and and like all their circumstances if they want to help the learner mhm so just to recapitulate like like I mean you said if you want to learn your Version Control do this certification let's talk real quick about the GitHub certifications because GitHub just published some certifications very cool we've already got a few uh we've got at least one course by Andrew Brown on uh free Cod camp that covers one of these uh certifications the the foundational certification for GitHub right maybe we can talk maybe you could just give us some insight into how these certifications were developed how they were released and the interesting kind of sequence of events that transpired from there that you were personally involved in you know it depends on it depends on the certification every family certification uh I take a different approach to uh for GitHub I was really excited about it when I heard that they were releasing these certifications because uh my primary skills as a developer right some people from networking uh the it space technically I cover the it space but developer was it is my bread and butter and so GitHub I already knew inside and out like uh there was no question in my mind that I could produce a course uh very quickly and as soon as I saw the outline um I literally had every single course not just the GitHub foundations every single course broken up in terms of how in terms of how I would record it and the GitHub Foundation like included in like three four days in fact it would have been done sooner but there were uh some uh delays uh because uh we're talking about how how to release that course and the timing of it so so like it was just done instantly and it's because I could just literally open up GitHub and start recording without having to do any research whatsoever um it was it was the fastest course I ever I think I've ever produced like three or four days um but um uh the the challenge with that course in particular like people have to understand like there's it like when courses are engineered there are Legacy reasons as to why they're engineered so like that GitHub certification they existed they existed before this happened apparently they existed for like two three years they were used internally with Partners okay this this is common knowled I'm not giving Secrets out here this is not Secrets but so let's say you're like VMware or some other tech company and you're like we want to get our uh some of our Engineers certified on your your stuff like continuing professional education is that what they were used for yeah I think I think I think again GitHub has to be the one that really speaks to it but I believe that the purpose of it was that they had partners with GitHub and they were incentivized to get these certifications working in official capacity with GitHub and this is kind of like how adus does it and other ones but like adus has the Amazon partner Network or adus partner Network and if you want to advance in their Network you have to obtain particular certifications and they have internal ones and external ones and there's internal ones that people don't know about uh but Partners know know about that you have to get like working with AWS um and so GitHub had something similar not all organizations do that some are doing it for different reasons but that's how some of these things start out and so when these ones were engineered at GitHub they were built um to understand all of the products because they want their uh their Partners to know all their products um and the GitHub one doesn't actually cover a lot of git as it's focused mostly on the GitHub products but you're going to learn git either way whether you want to or not because you have to know to toze I me you have to know get in 2024 I'm sorry but like you're going to have to sit down and learn the weird syntax and the weird like yeah still still um and so and so you know um you know when that transitioned as a public thing I think that there was a legacy team and a new team uh uh has taken over and so I believe that um where they are right now is transitioning but when that stuff came out there was funny pricing around it uh like on Twitter uh we came out and I made the courses really quickly but when I went to go register the course I found it was like really expensive and they were all the same price uh and there was just some key things that were missing like there was no uh domain breakdown there was uh you didn't know what your score was but there was all reasons for it right and so I had taken guesses and I talked to GitHub and it turns out I was right on 99% of all the reasons why um but it was just that it was a legacy product that was transitioning to a new team uh and there and it was that they just did not have like they they a lot like the things that I say out loud or anyone say say out loud a lot times they're thinking about the same same thing so when I had voiced those things they heard them and they just needed they just needed external validation to change them and So within weeks they now have domain breakdowns I think they were talking about getting the score in uh there was considerations of bringing get into the the course and so um you know a lot of the reasons why courses are the way they are is because of Legacy reasons or there's product marketers and they want to get certain things in and often the people that actually want to do the curriculum development have to compromise and they don't get to exactly do what they want to do uh and again this is not just GitHub this is all of them adab us hashy Corp all of them right um and so uh you know certifications that's where I where I say they're not efficient or they're there's going to be like 30 or 40% credit that's more about like what product marketers want you to know or like or it's like PR wanted you to know to to to um now this is the GitHub certifications or would you say this is this typifies all certifications I'd say the ones that that do it the least is Hashi Corp certifications for some weird reason Hashi Corp like they have I would say the cleanest uh certifications I've ever seen where it's like every single item on the on on the exam guide is in the course so if there's a if there's a bullo you're going to get a question on it and there's no what are the values of hashy Corp and you know like you know what I'm saying like they're just like how do you use they're like it's terraform and you got to do a deploy what's the command terraform apply right very very uh practical as opposed to you know it's very and at first I wasn't sure about that but I I really like it cuz because like I I know I can go in there I can make the content uh like just go down the list I got good coverage people aren't stressed out about it you know what I mean it has application but these other ones it's just like it's just that there's more people getting involved in them they want to have different kinds of outcomes in them so some some people take over um you know it's it's just the nature of it so if that makes sense so what happened when like you approached them you you had all this this uh these I guess concerns for lack of a better word like this feedback well I just told them like I like I told them I said you know I I'm I'm really excited about the certification I want it to do well when it does well I make money and it lets me make more free courses for it helps everybody please make these changes and what I what I did was and it wasn't that I just like s it out loud like I like I went at them because it happened was that when I told people the price online on Twitter and Linkedin people went no and the price was $200 per certification every certific no no matter what level even the foundational one and so and so that didn't make sense so I took like 50 screenshots of people saying like I'm going to pass on this one the price doesn't make sense why is it like this and so I I was it was more like it was more like I'm bringing the internalized feelings of the community and rolling it up and bringing it to them that's usually what I do like when I'm today I was like giving a eight of us a hard time and I give them all a hard time which is not a great not a good move but yeah not great for your relationship with them but great for the end Learners who have to use these certifications I shouldn't say that like there's people like like even when I complain about a say there's people in my DMs that best and and and they they understand and they're working internally to do their best but the it's like these organizations are so large that there's there's good and there's people that are I don't want to say bad but they are uh they prioritize different things prioritize different things and so um you know like the whole point of being a Community member is to be the the check and balance of it but you have to you have to be strategic about it because sometimes complain out complaining out loud is not a good strategy and you need to internally work with them and so you have to have a system so if I have an internal process with somebody I'll always do that first and if if whatever reason that's not working then I will go external so like when I was complaining about ad us TNC today I know TNC leaders are reading it and I know to training certification okay right and so it it's me trying to exert pressure to make changes that's better for everybody and AWS like and the other partner included right but there's a point where sometimes the decision is their decision and you're now you're just being a jerk right and so you have to you have to walk that line and go okay I'm not being somebody that's just uh uh trying to get my way versus something like it's more of a like that's what they want to do so like with GitHub and you know spoiler alert you were able to essentially get them to cut the price of these certifications in half I would say I would say that they want they needed to hear it from the community and I just did the leg work for them I didn't I didn't cut the prices but I mean putting yourself on the line and and carrying that and risking them shooting the messenger and being like screw this Andrew Brown guy he's a rabble Rouser right well I mean it was it was low risk at this point because like I didn't have like an established relationship with GitHub internally but I'm just saying that it can be like if you're if I mean jeopardized potential future relationship you right yeah but you know sometimes like some like it just depends on the attitude some people some people are cool with it right or there are there's like it's like if I had a bad relationship with Hashi now one of my friends works there and and they did the they did the like work and said no Andrew Brown is is here to help and he's going to help you you just got to you got to just work this way and then we'll get this great outcome right like whatever organization and so um it's kind of like that it's it's hard because you got to understand like I'm not here to promote these these companies I'm here to promote the community and so I'm trying to work with these organizations but at the same time it's like at the end of the day these companies are money driven right so yeah I they have to not the people but like the organization as a whole they have to grow they have investors right they're on that bus that can't go below 50 miles an hour so um maybe you could talk a little bit about uh the the improvements that they were able to make thanks to the feedback I gave to the they almost took almost all the feedback that and and the things that they couldn't do it's like it was more like we have to work on this over time so again like they got the domains in so in the video you'll see in the video I go they didn't do domains I think they should do domains they have those in now they're in there right um I think they might show the the exam the the uh the exam the exam score there was like key missing content about the exam that you needed to know to take it they filled that out so like that was where that's an example of um a certification team that is extremely receptive uh and and trying to do the best outcome for their certifications right awesome yeah it's hard it's heartening to hear this and I just want to emphasize that like ultimately your interests and their interests are aligned even though they're trying to make money you're trying to you know ultimately make money in a way but the way you make money is by helping people prepare for these certifications and ultimately get these certifications and have Downstream like success as a result of having earn these certifications and actually understanding the skills and having like I guess is like preparing for a certification is not like it's not like sitting around and playing Tetris to attack all day and having fun right it's a lot of hard work yeah and and money so so like kind of smoothing out their learning curve and and just making things as clear as possible so really you're an advocate for the learner is how I look at you well yeah I mean I I think I I would be a developer Advocate like if I wasn't doing this I I'd be I'd probably do an okay developer Advocate or one of these organizations but um uh you know coming back to that point on um uh you know like advocating for stuff it's like if I if like when I I was so excited about GitHub I I made so much hype on that like so many people even even if the cost was $200 they all like actually when that cost dropped and we we promoted it so many people signed up and we're like I'm taking this certification now and so I feel an obligation to make sure that I I deliver the content that is quality content that's reasonable to pass that that that we're setting like good expectations of the outcome because if I tell I'm going to go get a certification and they go get it and now they're out of money and now they can't pay their bills I feel really bad about it yeah um and that's that's that's a big concern and like even like the courses that coming out for the Inus refresh that I'm doing the big ones that everyone's been waiting for forever um like I'm going to be having like a large disclaimer in the beginning explaining like hey there's going to be gaps in knowledge you need to fill these out go look at other free Cod Camp courses that will have them and I will package as much as I can in here but I can't I can't put the whole sun in here you know what I mean I can't well thing that like the theme running through you know your communication with these certification providers and the the work that you do to try to prepare Learners uh and set expectations reasonably you're not like some hype man that's out like this certification is going to change your life you're like this is one of many things that you're going to need to do if you want to have a successful career over the next 20 30 40 years right like you're you're very um just down to earth and like you don't want to hype things up like you don't want to overpromise and underd deliver well I just don't I don't want people to end up in a spot like it's like we had a we had somebody that was like in Canada that was like Hey I want to become a solution architect and I'm paying $7,000 to take a a certification boot camp and I'm going to I'm going to get these five certifications right and they just passed their Cloud partitioner they paid like a thousand like so that means like a, ,500 just to do Cloud partitioner makes no sense to me which we have it for free and it's even more more more robust than any course out there on free C camp and and they're going I'm going to become a solution architect in 9 months and I said you're going to get the most senior senior role possible in the in the cloud industry in nine months that's only given to people that have already worked for years and you think you're going to get that and that's that's the promise that that's the overselling that people have and I'm tell I say and I say to them I'm like you should plan for three years you should have all these adjacent skills and you should assume you should have a backup plan because if if you're burning through all your money you're going to be in a bad spot it's not that it's impossible for it to happen it's just that you need to you need to hedge your bets and and put put yourself in the best position yeah and it's not like if we're in 2016 and 2018 like 2016 is probably better say 2016 you got to start that was a different story because at the time everybody was very curious about cloud and they didn't know much about it and you could just say that you had a certification or were going to go sit one and I was like this I was in Toronto and like there was like big fintech fintech banks that said oh yeah you yeah you have your associate and you're going for your pro can you come in and interview and like and then like you'd be doing whiteboarding and they'd be like okay because they just had no domain knowledge whatsoever and it wasn't that it was hard it was just like they had no confidence in it that time is over and it's with everything like now you know what the new thing is is like how are you going to utilize a ml like like large language models or ML and stuff like that and so that's the new thing that people are going and at one point it was like data it was like oh data everything's data driven now everything's like a the new oil and so and so um you know I think that uh like it's just the the cloud industry is matured like anything else and it's not like it's becoming devalued like people like people still need people to build websites that hasn't changed I mean it's just layers right like there's still web development and there's people are still running CL engineering and then there's ML on you know mood Juma those things are still running okay people need throwback people are still using them there's a whole Community around them like yeah I mean like I said earlier for train I joked like oh get some there are main frames running at like you know state governments you know Employment Office things like that that that so use these old tools because you get the system running you don't want to just scrap it and build a new one right there was a kid that got like a like an old supercomputer it was like wasn't old it was like old by like seven years standard and he set it up in his his house his parents helped him buy it and it's like an old IBM one and he learned Fortran on or something and then and he wanted to see the the ones that they had at IBM so IBM invited him over and he got to see them and they ended up hiring him wow that's cool you you know what I mean like it doesn't matter like there was there's like but you there is a smaller pool right like there's one person that still does um um was it cold fusion right there's a there's a woman out there that does c fusion and there's still work for it but the thing is is that you know you have to want to do that um and and be passionate about it and and I think there's opportunities there and I just wish that people would just keep running with it and that's the problem they just they want to really make money and I I get it I understand why yeah but but like in the race to make money like I mean generally like you need a lot fewer skills to do jumla development or WordPress development than you do to be like a machine learning engineer uh I mean a lot of those people have phds and a lot of those people have you know a decade or more experience working as a python developer you know uh doing like just backend development or something like that right A lot of people have domain expertise uh you can absolutely do that you could become a machine learning engineer by the time you are in your mid20s if you if you do everything right and stuff like that I know machine learning Engineers who are in their mid 20s but it's a lot harder to do that um and I think a lot of lot of people are seeing the machine learning engineers in their 20s and thinking oh I can do that too if I pay this person $10,000 to do their machine learning Boot Camp or whatever right that like there there will be people out there who will happily accept your money to overpromise you know what you're the mileage you're going to get I don't have a problem for people charging $10,000 if it has an outcome if it has the guarant like if you know what you're paying for right but it's like like when you go to a school like accredited school at least in Canada there is like you have your student union you have particular rights have to be enforced curriculums have to be developed a certain way uh they're supposed to have like uh like like on campus stuff and other resources now whether the education is failing in terms of the Quality quality of the materials is a different story but you're paying for that infrastructure around it for a guarantee um though Canada has been having a bit of issues because they've been um getting in trouble for not having uh the proper outcomes as of recent so well I mean the US same thing like there same thing yeah th000 universities or colleges in the United States but I mean come on like how many of those are actually like a college that you would be like really proud to have graduated from well in Canada the the the best school is waterl comp side water you go or University of Toronto is very good but like you go to wlu you'll you'll like you will get a job no matter what you'll get a job because they've they've done such a good job making sure that students have an outcome the cup students get paid right they like you get a 90 if you get 99% you can still fail you get what I mean like they have a they set a really high bar um and uh employers know what they're getting right and so they have that Loop but most schools don't do that they're just like you pay and then you got to go get the job yourself and uh you know what I mean like they they might have some kind of network but it's not as as robust as it is but I'm just saying like if you pay $10,000 or whatever it is to go to Wu it's worth the money right if you get in the right time and you have the money but it's it's these other issues where it's like $10,000 and it was it was all Vapor to begin with um but you know again it's I just want people to make sure that they're getting what they want out out of their money or no if they have no money you know whatever it is right so absolutely yeah and and that's like the name of the game is like under promising overd delivering optimizing for having a reputation which is something you've been investing in for so long uh through everything you've been doing with exam Pro and everything you've personally been doing to advocate for Learners just building up that reputation for or I'm not going to screw you you can trust me that like I'm going to say the reality and not overhype things right um and that's what I want to talk about because there there's I I really need more bread though yeah like literally literally well by optimizing for the long term right like that is the name of the game right optimizing for the next few decades people are still probably going to be taking professional certifications decades from now people are definitely going to still be working as developers regardless of what Jensen Quang CE it's there AI bot that has to go through my certifications that's fine yeah yeah uh it'll just be a few API calls and the certification will be earned no uh I don't believe that that's going to come to pass anytime soon so uh but uh just a quick correction there are 3,931 title for degree granting institutions in the United States so it's not 5,000 it's contracted a little bit which is probably for the better frankly I don't think we 5,000 institutions in the United States but um what I wanted to say is um you and I both grew up watching a TV show that's essentially advocates for that value of like optimizing for the longterm following Prime directives and not you know corrupting civilizations with technology too soon Golden Girls Golden Girls right yeah oh yeah Golden Girls that was the show we watched no we we you may have watched that I have never seen an of Golden Girls I'm sorry to say for all the Golden Girls maybe I'll check it I've heard good things but Star Trek so we we've talked about so much we've talked for more than two hours but I do want to the obligatory let's talk about Star Trek because um you and and Andrew your cofounder he's got this giant poster it's like a blueprint of uh oh yeah he he's yeah like of the Starship Enterprise uh I wanted to talk just a little bit because I I do imagine there are a lot of tiies in the audience people who love Star Trek and I love Star Trek because it's got a humanist message I love it because it has intelligent plots and intelligent interactions people are polite they're civil they get things done they're practical but at the same time they have values and uh you know when I was a kid my role model was Captain mcard because he always seemed to like have this highminded like approach to like solving problems and often he'd be presented with an easy way and he'd be like wait there might be a better way that's not as easy let's see if we can find that he didn't stop merely at the easy way um maybe you can talk a little bit about your relationship with Star Trek over the years I mean Star Trek does set really good uh moral values uh and I I think that's the aspect there is that you have this um uh uh Community or or uh I don't sure the word is I'm trying to look for but the idea is that you have all these people where they're not worried about money they're they're they're trying scarcity post they're have a post scar scarcity mindset and so that they can uh do good do good however they they see fit um and I and I think the thing is like holding up uh your sense of um more like I keep saying morals but the idea like ethics right like so you know like Captain Bard or all these other people have um uh moral ethics about you know what it is that they want to do and and and the betterment of the world and they're not thinking thinking about the uh the materialistic things to to show the EMB betterment of folks and I to me like that is just you know if you can live up to that that that is amazing right and you know I I want to I want to get to that point at some point and so the idea of like producing free content around the world and and having everyone upskill is is that lift up uh you know at least that's what I think so I don't know I think there's a lot of ties there if that makes sense so you see some some of your role as Andrew Brown founder of exam pro. Co like facilitating that kind of path toward a post scarcity Utopia really and it's not a Utopia in the sense that you know everything's solved and people just hang out all day people actually work really hard in Star Trek and they still have regimented work schedules and everybody still follows a strict dress code and all stuff yeah they want to work right they want to work they want to get things done they want to push forward the frontier of human understanding by exploration it's not it's not about going to work so you can make as much money as you can to buy things when you go home uh or go on trips right like it's like you want to actually do things that matter yeah I think a lot of people do want to do things that matter but like when they get into the workforce and it's a different story then and and then also just the nature of businesses um you know that's I think that's the the hard part you know so yeah I mean you and I talked about game development earlier like game development is a terrible field to go into don't go into game development unless you're going to be like an indie like I hear horror stories about people that worked at blizzard and companies like that right um and yet like think of how many creative passionate people who love developing games who are instead you know working as like database administrators or um you know software Engineers that like SAS tech companies because that's where the money is and and they would love they're even hoping to like put away a lot of money so they can eventually go and develop games right just imagine if everybody who wanted to be a game developer could be a game developer and money wasn't like an objective or it wasn't a consideration right well I mean I think a lot of them it wasn't like you look at uh I'm trying remember his name but it's the creator of Fallout the original series he has a YouTube channel he's that would be really good interview I'd love to hear intervie he's on he's on YouTube um I just can't remember his name for some reason but um uh like he talks about like how like it reminds me of when I got into Tech which is like the idea like the reason of course I was a bit strategic that I didn't go to game development because I need I know I had to make some money but the idea of working with like a passionate team and everyone's excited about working on this thing and and moving towards a common goal is like super exciting that was like my huge draw for startups because like you fix computers it's like computer in computer out you know what I mean I don't want to do that forever um but like the idea of building some kind of big product that is bigger than that uh than all of us together and it's going to be an EMB betterment for everybody there's like a funny scene in in um Silicon Valley where they're they're at uh uh the startup like like the tech crunch or something and they're all pitching their products Tech startup disrupt I actually pitched there I went to their big hackathon and I was the first out of 350 people that were presenting I had to be on the stage first but every product is like they're like we're trying to be loo Cal and mobile like they trying to help trying to help people it's going to better world and like that was kind of like the like the reason I really got into startups like uh but it's just the fact that um there's that component but anyway he was talking about the video game industry and like he's like you can get paid to make video games and they like they're obviously being exploited and they didn't mind because they all they wanted to do was all day every day work on video games like a workaholic and that's like how kind of like how I am where it's like you can make you can make money doing this you can make money teaching people how to code and it wasn't like I was trying to make millions I just to like the idea is like youd make something and then you know you can kind of do whatever you want or or like I met like a lot of early startups where they they had their their dot startup that did really well and so now they're kind of reliving their dreams as Angel Investors and they're like we we would go and hang out with them and and they were like really good mentors but unfortunately again it's just the nature of where things where things go um which is like can we have that without the whole uh greed component in there I don't know how that works yeah I mean like I think it's just necessary like everybody wants to make a return I I used to think like oh man there's like something fundamentally flawed like capitalism is just racing us toward this this outcome and and that may be the case but in general if you have money and you want to make a return on it you need to invest money in things that are going to grow and if a company is not growing then why would you put your money there because you have to make just inflation right inflation is normally about 2 to 3% in the United States so you have to make at least 2 to 3% or else you're losing money every year and like what if you're a big pension fund like cpers the big California pension fund you have to find enough places that you can put money to get growth so that you can continue to compound apparently uh inflammation uh inflammation infl infl uh inflation that's my trick for losing weight but I get inflammation for for months I'm not joking I get inflammation for months and I lose a bunch of weight it's the best uh uh best way to lose weight but anyway uh inflation like I was watching a video about like Japan and how they had INF uh deflation well they just had no inflation for for uh for many years and they're talking about like you want to have gradual inflation because uh it stimulates spend or something like it was important they're like it's good you have to have a little bit yeah you do want some inflation the main reason you want inflation is because deflation is incredibly catastrophic if you ever get into a a state of deflation nobody's spending any money cuz like why would you spend money you just hoard your money because your money's going to be worth more tomorrow than it is today so why would you spend it today and as a as a result everybody hoardes their money and the economy just grinds to a halt so you don't want deflation but you want some amount of inflation just to ensure that there's a buffer between you know not not going into deflationary territory because it's so catastrophic but sorry you yeah Japan is a very interesting economy to study if anybody out there likes studying about economics and stuff like the the policy interesting like experiment they do is like they've had so many weird economic experiments it's so interesting yeah but sorry you were talking about um how do we get on that we were talking about um so if we if we go back to Star Trek which is what I really want to talk about sure why not yeah like like how would you be different if you had if Star Trek had never existed do you think it opened some perspectives uh do you think it's spurred your imagination I I think maybe like maybe I'd be more opportunistic and I I would be less focused on like Community involvement like I think the reason I'm so involved in community involvement is because it was mandatory because my uh my grandfather who was uh like he was like my mom just won an award in the province for volunteering and my my grandfather uh did a lot of volunteering in Thunder Bay like like he ran uh the hockey for the kids in the entire town the the soccer he ran like uh the bingo halls did all his volunteer work for kids uh uh and um I guess it was just because like he was a like a veteran from World War II and he had like terrible upbringing right his dad died when he was young because uh um his dad was a uh mortician or whatever that you the person that handles the dead people yeah so his dad died when he was young so he was like really poor and then uh you like he went to war and they thought he died and they spent all his money so came back he had to work harder like at the Mill or whatever and so you know this the greatest Generation having such a hard time I feel like they did a lot more for their their Community because of uh the hard times that they had and so that part like I spent so much time with my grandparents that uh it just became something that you're supposed to do like you don't even think about like why are you doing this there's no money and it's like what do you mean you're you do this because it's good for everybody right like it wasn't it was never a thought of like like why wouldn't you do this and it's like then you have Star Trek which is also enforcing that thing of like why are why are you working for money yeah like why are you doing that that makes no sense that doesn't better anybody so yeah they even have the fangi who are this alien species that is focused on wealth and like accumulation of wealth and it's supposed to model like the 20th century humans in the 21th century that's not to say like I don't think about money at all like I have to because there's a bare minimum which is very frustrating I I hate it but you know at some but I go I need to make money so I can do the things that I want to do which is to do you know better things um you know and again like if if for long term right so yeah unfortunately it's still a thing that you have to do but like it's it's like getting to a point where I don't have to do it which is which is really I sure everybody I know so many teachers uh teachers social workers other people who are frankly like greatly undervalued by Society in terms of their compensation but they love the work they they know the work needs to be done they want to do it even at personal sacrifice um yeah well I want to close with this question about Star Trek cuz I love Star Trek so much and uh have you watched all of Star Trek like have you watched like every single series yep You' even watched like the new ones like theard yep yeah okay who is your favorite Captain who who do you think best exemplifies the values of like you know Starfleet and uh I mean Bard probably but I mean like my favorite Captain is Cisco I really like Captain Cisco from Deep Space 9 yeah what just what do you like about him I I think he's more of a pragmatist so like like he like Deep Space 9 takes place on a um uh the frontier uh a Frontier where it's on like on the out like the outskirts of the Federation and so their values are being tested all the time right um and I think that that's really interesting to say okay you have this utopian but what how do you deal with it when you're you're dealing with people that don't have all the benefit things that you have and how are you going to meet in the middle and uh and how are you going to like where are you going to compromise in terms of your moral values and and I think that that Captain uh handles it in a very a very interesting way and we get uh very interesting uh story lines uh yeah like kind of real politic because Prosperity is not evenly distributed and we talk about the post scarcity but that's really human civilizations Vulcans and a few other uh a few other races have like that level of prosperity but you you do have people that are suffering quite a bit and uh you know starf can't help everybody right the Federation can't help everybody they have to make these kind of tactical decisions and also the d space 9 there is like a diplomatic kind of show like you've got the Waring factions that are kind of constantly encroaching on one another's space and getting into territorial disputes and things like that too so but yeah I mean again like I'd say yeah Cisco is my favorite Captain but if if we're talking about the ideals Ard Picard always is uh is the one there that I think that uh upholds it the best yeah and some people may even see Picard's boring because he's he's to two dimensional because he just has these uh very specific like you can almost always predict what bicard is going to do given a certain situation if you've watched some s trick because he he is a very uh I mean he does grow and progress as as a human uh and he's constantly reading constantly learning he lover of history but at the same time you know that like at the end of the day he's going to take the most highminded approach and he's not going to compromise his ideals and yeah that that can make it less exciting than watching somebody who's much more Dynamic than Cisco yeah and then if somebody just wanted to watch like one Star Trek show to like like they've never watched Star Trek before you want to get somebody like eased into the Star Trek universe what would you recommend they start with I mean I have a very particular favorite episode of Star Trek my favorite episode is duet from Deep Space 9 season 1 season one is not a very good season but that's an excellent episode um and uh this very I was actually like no one ever talked about this episode for years but then a few years ago I think uh it gained some popularity because someone in um I think his St Trek Discovery was like Hey I really like this episode I think this was was fantastic but this specific episode is about um Kieran narice and their uh for those who don't know like beour beour yeah we're going here beour is a is a um a a world that was uh occupied by the Kardashians for years and the Kardashians uh uh basically enslaved them and had them strip mine their own Planet taking all of their resources and then uh the Kardashians uh were in a war with the Federation and wasted a lot of resources and then they decided that the uh the war was over they were having a peace with the Federation and they decided that they're going to uh leave beor and put it back in the beor people because they've taken all that they've wanted um and so uh beour has a lot of animosity towards um the cardasians for their treatment and so in this episode uh Kieran arice sees that there is a ship coming through to the station and it has a very specific Kardashian that was known for running labor camps on beour and so they wanted they want to bring him in for war crimes even though but the card say there was no war because they were just occupied right historical revisionism essentially yeah and so and so this fellow here well I'll end up like I'll end up ruing it I tell you but the point is is that it's it's about it's about this and it changes her mindset and it's the fact that it's about the what like about this episode it challenges uh like your your preconceptions about people um and that's what I like it's like when you have those those kind of moments yeah so that's that's my favorite episode but there's a lot of good episodes out there um but a lot of people like uh what's the one it's like uh the light or um it's it's the one Inner Light yeah people the in light's very good um there's that one uh there's another really good DS9 one which like it's uhing the moonlight moonlight something I I don't know why I can't recall right now or something like that anyway but yeah I if there was one that I'd start with is duet I think it's the best one that's that for me anyway for me in the pale Moonlight in the oh that's really good so so I haven't gotten that far in d space 9 uh I I'm on like season four season five I've just been gradually working through it through adulthood so I haven't gotten there cuz I'm I'm like I've heard it's so hyped up I don't know what'll happen have you have you heard have you heard the greatest Generation podcast huh the great there's these two fellows in in the the US and they it's called the greatest generation and they watch every single episode of Star Trek and they do a podcast on it but they oh wait I have watch I hav heard but I heard it like way back when it first started and I'm like yeah I think they finished everything and now they're doing uh they said they'd never do Babylon 5 and now they're doing Babylon 5 which we know be and I love Babylon 5 that's another good series but yeah very heavy diplomacy Focus five different alien races that have to like essentially coincide and stuff yeah man I could talk all day about this uh so shout out to duet which is in season one of Deep Space 9 you don't have to be very deep into Deep Space 9 what the first eight episodes and Bam one of the greatest episodes of Star Trek ever right there I I finally remember that episode uh so yeah I I guess parting wisdom for the community be sure to check out some of Andrew's awesome courses and note that if you hear AI voice it's not just because he lazy but to protect his actual voice yeah if you can tell but you know like again most if it's like my core courses it's going to be me yeah but uh yeah there's just some they'll never get made unless we use that AI voice so yeah well hey Andrew I know that you and I talk all the time we're constantly corresponding about upcoming courses that you're developing but I just want to thank you right here on the podcast I want to thank you again for everything you're doing not just for the developer community Through developing these amazing courses which you're publishing for free on the fre Cod Camp Community YouTube channel but also for the advocacy work you're doing for people who are earning these certifications like taking your insights and sharing them with AWS sharing them with GitHub trying to get these certifications to be improved right risking your own reputation that some manager is going to shoot the messenger because you really do want these certifications to be good you want them to be representative of what people want to learn and obviously there are so many things you could do to probably improve your own personal situation uh financially you've got all these incredible skills uh you've worked as a CTO you've run consultancies you've done all these things and yet you're choosing to continue to help more people earn these certifications and for that I commend you sir I really appreciate everything you're doing and I think the community appreciates it and all the people who've listened to this who are going to go out and earn professional certifications I hope you all uh keep sharing the enthusiasm for learning education uh working us toward that post scarcity civilization that will hopefully be there for our great great great grandkids maybe sooner um yeah thank you again yeah and you know I I just want to say that if there's any companies that are watching this and they want to sponsor a certification course they can absolutely reach out to free camp and and make that opportunity uh there's a lot of courses that I want to create but I just there's there's no there's no money in it but I want to make them right like yeah and I and if you if you want them made go talk to free camp and you know maybe I'll go make it and I make them pretty quick and pretty good yeah absolutely 100% seconded so uh reach out to me reach out to Andrew I'll put a lot of stuff in the show notes and again I hope you all have a fantastic week until next week happy coding by
