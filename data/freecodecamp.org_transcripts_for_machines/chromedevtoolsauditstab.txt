okay we are at the audit tab of chrome developer tools the page i have pulled up is on codepen it's my zip line for the random quote generator uh this one's get get up dress up show up and never give up that's a quote that i really like um so the audit is really useful it basically takes a picture of your whole page when it runs and it walks you through step by step every way that it thinks you know using these algorithms it thinks that your code could be improved so let's see what happens let's um let's reload the page and audit on load let's see what happens oh okay so i like about this tab it is so detailed which for me i don't necessarily know all the complex things that it's been talking about so far but these i can understand so compressing the following resource with gzip could reduce their transfer size by about twothirds so that is something that's network utilization that's probably on the codepen side so that's an awesome suggestion they give a specific thing that you could do to help and exactly how it would help just because it's on this audit page doesn't mean you have to do it but it's definitely something you should take into consideration let's look at web page performance remove unused css rules see that's probably me i probably have some unused css rules that are there inline block number one sixty percent is not used by the current page button append author so i'm gonna have to go back and look at that because if i delete that it would probably still run just as well and it would have less code to go through so it'd be faster and more efficient use normal css property names instead of vendor prefixed ones that is a css thing that is for codepen that one's not me but i take full responsibility for these other ones up here um what i want you to take away from this audit page is once you have something up and running just run the audit it will catch some things and that maybe you wouldn't have previously thought of and while you don't have to do them it might open your eyes to some things that you weren't aware of that could really improve the performance of your page
