hey everybody welcome to live coding with Jessie and today we're going to continue on with what we're doing yesterday with graph QL and WordPress and react but I got a pull request from Harshit so we're gonna go over that so we have I have on a on a separate branch right now that pull request and I haven't merged it yet partly because I've been working on other things and I didn't really have time to but I did have time to start to go through this pull request a bit and it looks great I'm just trying to get my head around what's going on because I've never worked with this before so just to sum up the pull request what he's done is he's taken out Redux and instead we're just using Apollo to work with our with graph QL and it's interesting I'll show you so we have some new dev tools stuff going on here with our Apollo tools but if we go back to our Redux you can see we actually have the state showing up here like it would normally so in the description for the pool request this is pull request one in the github repo that's linked in the description if you want to check out what was changed but Harshit mentions that there is basically redux is being used by apollo anyway behind the scenes so that makes sense so I want to check this out and I want to get a opinion on you know whether or not is this is this the best route to go just to completely cut out Redux and work with Apollo and because I I don't know because I haven't worked with it before and let me lay out before before we do our first session and basically the first session is going to be going through some of this code before we even start to code anything else just so that we're all on the same page but what I'm thinking is would there be some reason down the road that we would want to use redux as well and if that's the case should we try to incorporate redux right off the bat or should we wait and if we need it then bring it in so that's kind of what I'm thinking about right now so I'll give everyone a chance to you know think about that if you've if you've worked with with redux and Apollo before just let me know or if it's better just to go with Apollo and and if we can accomplish the same things with Apollo that we could with redux then I just need to learn how to do it like that then okay cool all right Harsha says it's not that complex of an app you're right yeah it's not really complex I think I mentioned yesterday it'd be I'd like to add a little bit more complexity to it but for now it is and really we're just getting data about posts from WordPress and we're displaying those posts and then everything else is really just we want to allow users to search for posts and we want them to be able to filter posts based on categories based on date and then beyond that we just want to display those posts in different ways which really doesn't have much to do with with our store or where the data is that's more of just make creating different views and putting that same data into the views different ways okay all right let's let me bring over my my timer or is it that all right let's bring over my timer I'm gonna start this Pomodoro timer so we'll do 25 minutes of coding or at least code review and then I'm going to take a fiveminute break answer any questions that are in the live chat and then we'll come back and do another 25 minute session we'll probably just do two Pomodoro sessions of coding today we'll see how it goes but we'll do at least two and let's see it looks like my analytics may be off occasionally they're off at the very beginning of this dream but it looks like we have a lot fewer people than we normally do so let me know did you all get a notification occasionally if I if I don't schedule the stream until later in the day sometimes the notifications don't go out normally it looks like I got one on my phone but anyway I still have to do work whether or not anybody's watching so we're definitely gonna continue okay cool Kevin's here hey Kevin and Kevin did get a notification so alright okay awesome so I see some more people in here now yeah my analytics are definitely off because there are more people talking in the live chat hadn't been registering on the the YouTube analytics so I'm not gonna stress this for now I do want to remember to start my and Rock server so I'm going to do that right now and I'll copy the link in so in the live chat there's now a link you can click that and then you can see in real time all the changes that we're making you can inspect it in dev tools and it'll be a lot easier to kind of see what's going on all right so let's go through some of some of the code if you want to look at it more on your own like I mentioned earlier check out who requests one in the github repo that's linked in the description and then you'll be able to see the explanation and exactly what was changed but I'm going to go through some things let's see let's get rid of I'm gonna get rid of some of the stuff that is not there anymore it's not needed I think this one also is not needed so big the big thing to notice right off the bat is we have no more actions or reducers okay so if we're not using redux we don't need any of that Redux stuff so that's all gone we also don't need this this API utility okay so that's gone as well you'll notice that the components are all much smaller and let's go back here we go alright so we do have a few things and I guess I'll start with this one because it's up here not sure if it's the best order but so we have a graph QL folder now and within that we have mutations which there's nothing in this file yet but under our queries under posts you can see just like yesterday whenever we we put in a query structure just like this well I don't think we had the featured image in there but basically we structured I like this to get the data back so now we have two queries that are built out here so single post query to get a particular post so we're passing in an ID here and then we get all posts here so we're just asking you know for all the posts I mean this is so far I haven't used graph QL very much at all but I'm liking this you can look at this and immediately know all right I know exactly what data I'm gonna get back that's cool it's not always so apparent with the REST API you know the WordPress REST API I could look at the URL that I'm putting in and know that I'm getting posts but I wouldn't necessarily know you know all the other stuff that I'm getting unless I'm already familiar with what I get back from that API so I really like that it makes it you know easy to know immediately what's going on and let's go here we have our Apollo client so where as yesterday we had a lot of this stuff in our app dot J's file now we just import all of that in so it cleans up the Abkhaz file a bit we imported in we're still we're bringing this in in the same way but we no longer are passing in the store so other than that I mean well with the exception of removing all the stuff that pertain to Redux it's pretty much the pretty much the same here so now let's actually check out our home component where we're displaying some of this stuff so if you notice on the on the site I'm not sure where the site said I had it up I'll have to oh it's a funny I way too many things open on my other screen here all right here we go so the site now it's actually it's pulling data from somewhere else not from from my web site so that's why it's all different but you can see for this home page it's just displaying all the posts right so it's using that first query that gets all the posts and then if we click inside it then it takes us to a single post page a post detail page that uses that second query that passes actually passes the ID which we can see the post ID here and gets the information all right so that's what's going on in terms of how it how it looks and here's the code for that okay that's interesting I didn't notice it like I said I didn't really have a chance to go through everything in here current user okay so it looks like this is in here for when we implement the login system so probably correct me if I'm wrong Harshit but this is probably not doing much of anything right now since we don't have a login system hooked up this is not the good wait harsh it says this isn't the code okay you know what maybe he's still displaying the the code the previous code let me reopen that there we go that's it okay cool yeah that that looked a little odd I guess I had put that in there yesterday and didn't remember that I did it okay I think that was the example I copied and pasted from somewhere okay thanks for letting me know about that okay so here's what's going on now so we're bringing in graph QL and this from what I understand and just the disclaimer here I'm seeing a lot of this for the first time so this is definitely going to be a learning episode for this stream here but from from what it looks like is we're bringing in graph QL here and we're calling that query get all posts and then what I'm assuming happens because otherwise I I don't know how the data would be displayed is that when we do that those posts end up getting into here's props so this props data and then under posts we'll have all our posts so correct me if I'm wrong but I I mean that just doesn't seem like obviously it has to be getting into props somehow so I think that's it so we can determine what query we want so I think I close that window out but if you remember we had our queries so get all posts that's that's what we're using down here and cool I like that so added a little loading thing so if there are no posts we're loading if there are posts then we actually display the posts I like that that's nice you can see really clean definitely clean things up a lot so I I like this so I still need to learn more you know to to work with it myself but I do really like this the other one that will have some code with them let me okay and we're bringing in that query and okay so we're using the constructor bind okay we're doing the loading thing up here like this alright so down here we're doing a single post detail but then options match okay so we're grabbing the ID from our match params we're passing in like that okay I'm gonna check out the the other file here I want to check these out side by side why did that not work all right so something's up with with Adam from so I guess I'm not gonna do this side by side right now all right that's that's interesting to me that that it gets passed in like this I would have thought that we would have passed it in more like a regular function but instead it's like the second argument of this graph QL hmm all right so that's something I'll have to I'll have to look up more but basically I mean that's that's it that's pretty much all that was added to be able to get everything to display like you know like you can see on the site if you go to the the link posted earlier so let's forget to start my timer so I'm just gonna keep an eye on the time for now and then I'll start the timer for the next one let's see all right she's checking the live chat briefly okay all right so I guess what what I'd like to do now then is try to hook this up with as much as cool as all this these comic books are I would like to hook this up with the data that we are working with yesterday and also at some point we need to we need to hook ups either a custom post type or if we can stick with posts we need to have some custom fields for the posts so we're gonna work on that I don't know if we'll get into that today but let's get some data in there some of the other data in there and I don't know I mean I guess if if I can wrap my head around how things are working and there's really no reason why we couldn't start to actually build this out a little bit more with with a UI that's closer to what it's actually gonna be like so so let's start on that I need to grab let's see I believe that or Apollo client is where we can put this in yep that's it so there you go Jessie why google.com slash graph QL and let's see what we get so far I just get a lot of loading loading all right so do nothing so far let's let's see what's going on whoa fail to fetch that's interesting hmm it's my site down I'm just going on I must say still working hmm okay for some reason this is not working that's good that's really good let me make sure this plugin is still active yeah okay yeah so I'm not really sure not sure what the problem is let's go let me do here let's find our queries you know opposed let's try to run this here okay yeah we're still not getting anything let's run this again interesting hmm okay maybe oops it's not what I wanted when it posed alright for those edges hmm interesting okay well we could just go back to using the other one for now and then I can look into what's going on that'll probably be the best thing to do for now so let me let me just go back let's go back to this and sorry yep okay so that is working let's try to get some categories as well some wonder you know pose let's try to make another query and let's say categories let's see what we need for category there we go categories I just know mmm you see maybe there are no categories in here so that's why I'm not getting categories hmm okay that's what hard she said no categories okay well um we are going to need categories at some point so we can grab this and at least make it who hard says otherwise I would have built that too for you thanks I appreciate that it's probably good that there's some stuff that I still need to build that way I'll learn I'll learn how to do it too so let's put that in so we have our posts jeaious so let's make a categories dodge ass and and then we could make I mean we won't really be able to test it out because there are no categories but once I figure out what's going on with the WordPress my wordpress site and why I can't get data from it then we can test it out with categories but if we use this as an example I'm sure it'll work when the time comes so let's inquiries let's make a new file we're going to call this categories and oops I wanted to see those let's just copy everything paste it in there and then we'll also get get this again and we'll paste it in instead of instead of this one get all categories and categories and I guess we can we can also get a single category I I don't know that we would need to I'm not gonna put that in now because I I can't really see a case where we would need to get a single category by ID so I'm going to leave it off for now and let's just export this really I want more than the ID let's at least try to get the slug and what else I guess I'm not sure if the it would be category name or if it would be category title because I haven't seen that data okay let me keep an eye all right so it's it is time for me to do a five minute break for question and answer so let me do that now and I'm going to scroll up to the top of the live chat here and just go down through see if there's any questions I can answer okay so Rolando would like to know of a simple tutorial to begin learning reacts so there are some good YouTube videos that are introductions to react learn code Academy is a YouTube channel that has some good in sure to react videos they are a few years old but the the general concepts of react are still the same even though maybe some of the syntax will be a little bit different you know in the current version also I think there are some react videos on the free code camp channel sorry it seems like this time of day I'm just I'm always yawning no matter what even if I get enough sleep or enough caffeine in this yawning yeah like what else else is good for reacts if you like kind of like the inbrowser tutorial stuff code Academy has has yeah they have an inbrowser tutorial I haven't checked it out for a while I did it when it first came out so they may have more than one out now so those are the ones that just come into my mind okay okay Marco asked how is this loading page being displayed and I think we I think I showed that could but let's we'll take a look at it again in case I didn't really explain it but you can see here is where the loading takes place so it's just simply checks to see if if they're posed so basically if if there aren't any posts yet in this props data posts then it's displays loading otherwise if posts exists then it displays everything so initially when everything loads there won't be post right because we still have to tell graph QL to use this query to get the data but then once the data comes in then it gets put into props then it will it will display so that's where the loading is coming in John lund said you sound a bit English Jessie I like I've never even been to England so I don't know but I actually really like to watch a few English youtubers that have cooking shows maybe it's rubbing off on me I don't know but I'm not now in English I would say if there's any influence on my my accent my pronunciation of words it would probably be a Pittsburgh influence because I live pretty near to Pittsburgh but I know if anybody has ever been to Pittsburgh you know they they have quite a few words that are very unique to Pittsburgh and I'm not I don't usually use the Pittsburgh slang terminology but I grew the people that live right across the street from me growing up were like they definitely had the Pittsburgh accent used all the Pittsburgh words so it could have rubbed off on see our Toro says asked you know you took all the Redux code up yeah so well I didn't harsh it did in his pool request and that's what we're checking out right now but yeah so it looks like we're not we're not gonna use Redux we don't really have to okay all right kevin says by the way that gql stuff is a tagged template string okay let's check that out because I did wonder about that all right Shh all right I'm not familiar with tagged template string so I may have to look that up interesting cool alright so my five minutes is up so I'll come back to the live chat and go through the rest of it after our next coding session but for right now let's go back so we should be save that and cool all right I just scrolled down to the bottom of the live chat now I'm just gonna mention the last two comments before I start the next session here because they're awesome so haha checkpoint says you guys are amazing and I appreciate that thanks for saying that and then Silas has finally caught your livestream so awesome really glad that you could catch the livestream it's awesome so I feel free to ask any questions or contribute in the live chat ok oh I did I do have to ask a question I told a friend of mine that I would ask if anyone knew of any good beginner resources or books on on a VBA so I guess they're gonna try to learn that so anyway let me know I don't know if anybody knows but I have no idea of any resources on it so he had he had asked me about it two days ago and I forgot to ask yesterday so if anybody knows let me know otherwise you don't worry about it I'm sure it'll be all right he's smart guy all right so at this point I don't really want to spend a lot of time troubleshooting my wordpress site I don't I don't really think that would be we're allowed to do at this point especially since I'm not at first I'm just gonna do a little bit of research so that's not really not good like what somebody else Google I don't think that's that's very fun so let's do some some UI stuff which maybe we should bring in material UI so if you're not familiar with material you I'll bring it up so material you i.com for our last project we used this version of material UI the old version and this is simply a framework of react components that follow the material design guidelines but I'm thinking yesterday I did some do some reading of the documentation of the newest version of material you I and I think I think we may use this they have some they have some good stuff in here so we're gonna try to use this I know last time we tried to use this that it just came out and it didn't really go so well but I think at this point there should be enough information out there that I can that I can get at or actually let me see okay harsh you're just putting a live chat you need to downgrade WP graph QL okay is that gonna fix the issues that we're having okay I wish looked up a little bit farther oh okay so it looks like there's some sort of breaking change all right what's worth a shot to check this out WP graph QL github see they have a change okay all right this looks like maybe this is our problem I request an Authenticator for three session hmm okay releases all right so miss that okay it's just thing okay I forgot to start it again better set my timer let me start the timer for 25 minutes all right so I'm actually I'm not going to reset or go back to a previous version right now there's basically I'd like to stick with the most current version and then just do whatever I need to do to my WordPress installation to make this work obviously there's something you can do to make it work because it's working with you know the demo WordPress installation so I think I'd rather do that and be able to stick with the newest version but this may point me in the right direction to see what I need to do but for now let's let's bring this in thank you Kevin just reminded me that my face was covering the timer again thanks for that I'll get used to that eventually I just extremes without my face being there for so long now I just can't can't seem to remember this there I hope I don't make any weird faces because I forget that you all can see me so let me know if I'm doing something strange okay haha oh man okay so this is the problem so Harshit says the demo uses the older version that's why it works haha okay that makes so much sense now all right we know what I'm gonna do actually at some point in the maybe I might not get to it today but hopefully you know before the next stream on Monday I'm gonna reach out to the creator of this plugin so the the person who created this plugin got a hold of me on Twitter yesterday afternoon and actually gave me access to the slack channel for this for this plugin and offered to to talk to me and even potentially talk on the stream and explain more about the plugin and how to use it so I'll reach out to him and it's his name's Jason ball so I'll reach out to Jason and just kind of ask him what's up with the new version and and how do I get it working and then and we'll get that all sorted up and I also think I'm gonna submit a pull request to update the documentation a little bit because I we had a little bit of trouble in trying to get that to work yesterday I don't think the documentation needs a lot of work in terms of my documentation I mean the stuff that they have in the readme on github the actual documentation you click you can click through to get to their site on is it's not bad but some of the stuff in the video I think would be good to have in the in the readme in the github repo okay so let's do that so anyway thanks are for for all the info as well it's like saving me so much time of troubleshooting so let's bring in I gotta go to my terminal first should we merge this now or should we just keep words so I made another branch called Note redux I guess I don't have to merge it right now during the stream but I'm just thinking are we 100% sure you know we want to go with this and we won't want to go back to what we had before I'm pretty sure that we want to go with this but I'll hold off and merge it later for now I guess we can install this as well that's interesting I don't think I've ever brought in a Google font with NPM I'd like to try it though okay so we're going to try to bring this in and then we can just import this into our route component and then I I suppose we'll be able to use it so that's seems convenient give it a shot okay and where's our app touch yes we'll bring it in here okay all right so let's we'll just put in just very basic stuff how to get started so just make sure yeah that's it that's all for installation and interesting so they have a create react app example okay so nothing there to death hmm it's interesting this is definitely different than than the other version that we had used all right so let's just bring in let's bring you some components that we know we'll need so we'll definitely need that top at bar here we go so let's bring that in to get nuts okay yeah so this is what we'll want and Wow quite a bit okay all right let's bring that into we don't want to nap Jess let's put it in home I eventually at some point we'll probably have a layout component so we don't have to bring this in all the time or you know but for now I don't mind doing it like this just to make it make it easy to adjust until we get it to a point where you know we really like how it looks so let me listen for now okay I thought I had pasted that copy something different let me bring this in now let's see there let's see if we won okay yeah let's bring these in first all right so hopefully our app will look a little bit more exciting here in a minute thanks let's do that a bit I'd say that and see if we get errors yeah classes is not defined that when you find oops and pace practice all right let's see if we get it now all right so we're getting some errors and you can see if you if you've clicked on the the n grok length in them you could probably see these as well we'll just go through some of these errors 935 all right so we're getting miss there we go that's what I missed I'm sure somebody in the lab had already caught that how about I just hooves so this is not to find where we what did I just do I took out the wrong thing button app bar is not this I'll put it I put it in the right spot oh you know what I didn't did I yeah see if we Stuart no we do in fact need that let me check the hi chefs oh did I not bring in I think I need to bring in prop types I'm pretty sure we don't right didn't prop types you used to be a part of react and then now now you actually have to bring them in correct okay let's give this another shot hmm wait a second huh oh my goodness all right I feel really silly right now obviously because the components name is button a part and this okay all right oh my goodness so we don't even really need that but just to get it to work let's what you know you're happy yes I'm pretty sure we got pretty much everything from this all right how are we going to do this all right okay question alright so it seems like I've missed this here at the bottom we have to do you know we have to say which style styles and then button at bar but how do we combine that with what we're doing here I seriously doubt see I thought we could just put them sidebyside I mean I guess it's worth a shot we're already getting there there's no way that's gonna work let's see what we get yeah it's not gonna work I'm gonna make this work you didn't wrap it with him Eli provided that let's see yeah I don't think we needed to I mean let me check this example again see what they did here yeah so they've wrapped they didn't wrap the root component in anything there you can check our pages shoot they did here see if he did who I could try to do it sir alright so hard put in the in the live chat try it like this but I've we're still not we still don't have styles in there let's see what happens hmm okay so when we do it like that we're not getting the the post spec I don't know I'm thinking about just going back to the old material you are again let's see see what they're doing for the components Oh so this is where they're wrapping the the theme and everything the all right I definitely don't have enough time in this pumping or a session to deal with this okay hmm okay I still have to look into that let me know what you think though because I'm about to do a question and answers is it worth it to try to do the latest version of material UI or should I just go back to the old version that we've used before potentially just waiting until it's not in beta anymore and then using it let's see then I go back I try to get back to see what version run yeah we're it's still in beta okay anyway let me know about that so I'm gonna switch over to the question and answer session so yes so if you can stick around for your question answer session and even if you don't have a question you can help answer questions that would be awesome would definitely value your opinion otherwise thanks for watching it was kind of a mixed bag today I had some cool stuff with with Apollo and getting things to work not I didn't really do much Harshit did most of the work and then completely failed and trying to get the new version of material material UI it's a work but hopefully hopefully it'll be better on Monday anyway let's get started I'm gonna scroll up and pick up where I left off answering questions alright okay so Brett says it's graph Q I'm making a second API call to get the featured image and that Kevin responded the featured image link is fetched in the single API request but the actual image is loaded in a different request started by the image tag okay that makes sense Brett says says my fetch calls only have the ID of the featured image in there the WordPress REST API and have to make another call to get the image URL yeah so yeah that is interesting so that's true in the with the REST API you don't actually get the image URL by default with the post so you can get a plugin that will give you that data or you can make a second API calls since you will have the the image ID but let's see what we're getting yeah let's see what we're getting with that one call my queries you know it's not working because of error let's go back I'm just gonna take a lot of this out of here just so we can get something that works okay now let's see if we can get this so let's run this so this is the get all post query and we can see the data that we're getting back let's just get rid of this the day that we're getting back does have the source URL so probably what's happening is that the way that this plugin is built to get the data from WordPress is it does actually give you the URL so it's a little a little different than the WordPress API which I mean this actually makes a lot of sense I I read some issues and the reasoning on why they didn't include the URL in the post but it I don't know it seems to me like the URL is so much more useful than the image ID like why wouldn't you want that included with you know the post request but anyway but that is there so you don't need a second API call so Marco says so basically when using graph QL with Redux and Apollo I can just remove Redux from my project it seems it seems like you could there potentially depending on how complex your project is there may be some reasons for using it I would think there's probably some things that you would want hmm sorry there's probably some things that you would want globally available in the store that you're not necessarily getting from graph QL in that case then I think you know maybe you would want to use Redux with with Apollo with graph QL unless there's some way using Apollo to add things to the store now they're necessarily being dated you know that you get from graphic UL I don't know yet I haven't got that far with it okay so we had a question earlier from Rolando about resources for learning react and Marco says traversée media is a great channel to learn react so I haven't seen anything from traversée media myself but I guess check it out Marco says they're good resource fairest Moss says why do you guys keep labeling these as with react shouldn't it be with webcam or something um any Kevin responds react is a JavaScript framework or library I'm with you there Kevin I always go back and forth on calling things frameworks and libraries but anyway reactors JavaScript framework created by Facebook to make web development easier jesse is using it in this project so and Ferris says okay thank you for clarifying that yeah I guess that's if you're not familiar with the names of the technologies that we're using the titles of these videos are probably Oh nonsense I mean you just can't explain everything in a title so sorry about that okay no beers here it says sorry I've been busy busy for last two weeks so that I can't watch your live session oh it's cool no beer don't worry about it I mean we definitely like to have you around for the live session but I totally understand if you can't be here I know I'm super busy all the time if I couldn't do these live sessions at work then there's no way I'd be able to do it for you know one to two hours every every weekday so totally understand about being busy let's see fastest on e says semicolon is missing no actually I don't use semicolons normally it looked weird for for a few minutes there because I was copy and pasting in code that was using semicolons so it it probably looked a mess but kevin says semicolons are never missing unless you miss them I like that Kevin s yeah so you don't really need semicolons I know there's some case and I know we've had it before in the live chat where it would might mess things up if you don't use a semicolon but I can't remember that cases offhand but I remember thinking wow I've never had that particular case come up for me so most of the time you're alright with leaving out semicolons but we are accepting of different coding styles here on the free code camp live stream so if you like semicolons that's cool and you can hang out with us too and if you don't like semicolons then that's cool too I don't think it matters that much as long as you're as long as your code works I think that's more important okay and actually I got through all the the questions so must be it's a slow day here with actually I just checked assuming my analytics are right now we do have a lot less viewers than normal so that would explain why there is not as much activity in the live chat we did get one more question so John Hanson says I read that full understanding of JavaScript isn't needed to work and react as it's a library to me it still feels too much a mystery it does things like magic at times is it better to build my es6 first hmm knowledge of es6 definitely helped me with react but I don't know this is necessary like there's always gonna be some magic I have heard I've heard the argument before that like you got to really understand what's going on I mean I used to hear years ago when I mean jQuery is still a big thing but before react was really big I guess I would I was more into jQuery and I would hear people say you know you really should read the source code for jQuery and understand how it works behind the scenes and I mean that's okay but to me it's like jQuery was awesome starting out because you didn't have to know how it all worked it just worked and you could use it so if if you go behind the scenes and read everything and how would they do it it was jQuery then why not just write it in vanilla JavaScript and not import all of jQuery if you know how to do it so I don't necessarily agree with that argument if if your goal is to learn how everything works in and out then yeah go for it but if your goal is just to make things that work you don't need to know all the magic behind the scenes if you do would you be better at it probably there's definitely in particular what performance so if you don't understand things right behind the scenes you may not realize why doing things one way is you know way more performant than knowing them another way right because you don't know what's going on you just do something and it works right so when it comes down to things like that a better understanding will definitely help but you know we're talking about usually with those questions the difference of milliseconds on small projects that's not a big deal I mean if you're not working on really huge projects you know all that adds up and you know you really you know if saving a few milliseconds makes a big difference saving a little bit of you know computing time makes a big difference but if you're just starting out in building some projects with react and they're not huge and they're not you know not really important in the sense that like a lot of people are dependent on it for let's say like banking or medical things or things that you know potentially could have a huge impact on people's lives then I I say don't worry about it you know you can use it as long as you can use it enough to build something with I don't think there's there's anything wrong with that and then as you use it your knowledge will increase so I just say if you're going to use it and you're not confident in your knowledge of es6 or of other JavaScript just make sure that you build up that knowledge as you go I think it would it would be wrong to just try to do reactant and never try to learn although I think it would be really hard to do react and not learn more about JavaScript as you're doing it I think that just it just happens naturally as you learn to do more things with react so anyway that's my opinion about it I know people would disagree cuz I've read and heard other opinions about that but there's something to be said for the confidence builder of actually making things making things that work and are cool you know at some point you just got to take that step and just start using things trying them out yeah maybe you don't understand completely how it works but like you don't need to I mean we don't really need to you know you don't write you don't need to know everything about electricity and how it works to be able to use you know a computer or I mean think about all the things that go into a computer working we don't need to know all that stuff or does that do you know all the NPM packages that you have going on behind the scenes and how they work no of course not right if somebody did know all that stuff could they make something that's really performant probably but that's just it's just crazy to learn all that so at some point you have to say you know what I'm you know here's where my skill level is at right now I'm gonna do what I can with this and I'll learn as I go along anyway that kind of turned into a rant a little bit at the end so a husk sorry about that but anyway so I would say don't be afraid to try out react and do some things with it and you'll pick up what you need to pick up as you go along let's see John Hanson says true thanks problem is there's too much poor documentation waste people saw problem solved with examples it's hard to sister yeah definitely I agree yeah from that from that perspective it can be really hard to learn things with react if you're not familiar with es6 and you see all these examples with es6 in them then you you really have two issues one like you know I haven't saved since Monday yeah I think I saved on Monday and then didn't save possibly Saturday I can't remember I like sitting down to Shaving like once a week now I've just gotten really lazy about it it's alright I mean luckily where I work there's no real policy on whether or not you have a beer to shave or anything like that so I could grow a giant bushy beard if I wanted to uhhuh but my wife wouldn't like that she's not a fan of the beard okay Oh horseshit says we'll be making another pool with the Mui awesome actually horseshit if you do that I'm going to be so happy if you get this this material you guys stuff working yeah I'll be awesome let's see okay well now I've again gotten to the bottom of the live chat so I guess I'm gonna go for real this time and I had a great time talking to you all so the actual coding portion of it for me was a bit disappointing just because my contributions all didn't work uhhuh but I did like the questionandanswer I enjoyed talking with you all I mean I really talked a lot but I like the questions that we had so it's Friday we got a nice weekend coming up and I'll be back on Monday but a Sebastian's here yeah you're late Sebastian I started early so you missed missed it basically if you want to know what we did this session check out pool request one on project four on the the react bulletin project because the thing that harsh the stuff that Harsha did in full request one is pretty much all that I got to work today everything I tried did not work so she didn't miss much there okay John Hanson says it's Thanksgiving holiday in Canada this weekend so happy Thanksgiving to you Jesse awesome Happy Thanksgiving so yes everyone oh my their neighbors in Canada have a happy Thanksgiving this weekend cool all right yeah so everybody have a great weekend especially those in Canada I have a great holiday weekend and I'll be back Monday and hopefully I'll have a more successful a time one one day but sorry I couldn't find the button to end this dream so I was just kind of stalling all right but anyway have a great weekend I see you all on Monday
