me all right so uh we're gonna talk about building a portfolio today um i've built a lot of portfolios in my life uh it's like what you do in college when you go to art school so i'll give you a little quick background on me i'm a designer i've been working at logistics here in oklahoma city for the past year and we're building some cool stuff and it all deals with lots and lots and lots of data so that's what we're doing i've been designing professionally for about 10 years it's like nine and a half or something i just rounded up makes me seem cooler i've been doing design in general since 2004 i do know html css and jquery not javascript jquery that's still a thing guys it makes it makes carson really really mad so um if you want to get a rise out of carson ask him up how to do wordpress and jquery and he will he will let you know um so i've built portfolios on paper my first ones were on paper and so it was like a book and we would like make these portfolios and we would put them up on the wall like the pages and uh my professor would come around and she would say that's trash and she'd rip it off the wall and she'd be like you can do better so that's a little you know you guys aren't gonna have that level of uh you like pressure here um i've done flash on how many of you guys have used flash macromedia flash nobody am i that old okay we built it with flash and actionscript you know so things were animated and then i've done them obviously with html css and javascript and i've learned one big thing portfolios are hard portfolios are hard because you're bragging on yourself so it's like you're like look what i can do i'm so great and so they're actually kind of hard so i put a picture of my family up there so that's my wife my daughter and my son my son was going to attack the person taking the picture with the shovel so you know that way if you come back to this slide later you know you know you'll remember who i am all right so let's talk about what a portfolio actually is um because a lot of times people think i'll just throw up a website and that's a portfolio so portfolio is technically it's a collection of your work it's going to show what you can do it should ideally have a way for someone to get in touch with you so maybe an email phone number something like that it should also give a little description of who you are right so think kind of along the lines of a resume like it's gonna give who you are um i would say include as much good work as you can so don't don't just put something up there because you have something if it's bad don't put it up there and kind of going along with that focus on the work you actually want to do so if you're listening to this and you absolutely hate writing javascript and you like to design do not fill your portfolio with javascript because the people that come look at your portfolio are going to say they're really good at javascript and then you're going to get into a job you don't like doing or you won't get a job because your javascript's not that good that would be my case so again portfolios always seem kind of hard because you're bragging about yourself you're talking about yourself but you have to be able to do that you have to kind of talk yourself up you can't be like i'm dirt i don't know what i'm doing because people won't they'll believe you they'll be like okay they're not any good so you have to kind of brag on yourself a little bit um so now let's talk about what a portfolio is not a portfolio a portfolio is not a blog nobody cares about your pinterest recipes or anything like that that people put into blogs this is not a blog so maybe when you get a little bit further along it can be a blog but it's not a blog right now it's also not a collection of photos unless you're a photographer you don't need photos on your website it's not instagram or flickr or any of that stuff so you know keep it keep it kind of focused and next your opinion on absolutely anything nobody cares this is like a resume so i know this is kind of harsh but technology you know nothing about but you have opinions about don't do that no you will make yourself look stupid so don't do that don't talk about religion even if you're religious i'm religious but i keep that off of there because people that are like coming to look at my stuff they may not be and i might offend them so i'm going to keep that off of there politics don't put politics on there because if you're way over on the left you're hiring person may be way over on the right and vice versa so just keep it neutral and don't put any kind of isms on there i've seen this before a lot in the past no isms no racism no sexism no isms just keep it clean keep it simple um no dank memes please and no cat photos because nobody's got time for that see so so i put that in there because you know that's like ironic okay whatever all right so there's different kinds of portfolios you're going to see out there um photography portfolios typically have a lot of pictures and almost no text they're almost always a squarespace template with this grid of pictures and you know they'll be like one word and that'll be it um then there's the videography guys and their theirs are always like so busy and so moving you can't keep up with them and they call those show reels um so lots of youtube clips embedded in there there's written portfolios and those are really boring because it's just lots of text but if you're looking for a writer that's what you want there's design portfolios like mine so those are going to be printed or they're going to be online lots of pictures some text we usually use case studies to explain things like explain why we did what we did and then there's development and on a development we're going to want to see some code a lot of the good ones have code on them so uh remember that um so here's some good examples of portfolios and uh they're out of order because of the way i opened it but uh you know whatever see if we can uh look at that that's awesome let's go back to this okay so we'll start with his one jolie thanks kimberly kimberly sent me a couple of examples from the group and then i have a couple of my friends and then i have mine so we're just gonna scroll through these real quick um i'm gonna tell you why i think they're great um this one's great because he gives us a little example of who he is right he gives us some nice just kind of straightforward what he's done what he can do he has a link to his resume right here which is great because it's a pdf and that means that if i'm a hiring person i can click that link download it and send it to all the people that matter um he also has a picture of himself which is awesome if you have a good picture of yourself put it up there so that way we know what you look like next he has his projects and he's got app and code and i'm afraid that if i click one of these they're going to like mess up it's going to like you know nope all right great so it takes me to github and i can actually like look at his code so that's awesome okay great um so he's got those then he has a contact form so we have a way to get in touch with him uh and then at the bottom uh he has like social stuff so find me elsewhere he's got github and well does this like codepen nope free code cam and then linkedin linkedin is a great one if you're trying to get a job because all the professional people like to hang out on linkedin and uh they really like that for some reason all right we'll go to the next one how do i it's always great when it doesn't work the way i wanted all right this is my friend justin justin battenfield um he started off life as a freelance wordpress developer or something like that and he worked his way up and then he was the lead frontend developer at life church for three or four years and then he came and worked at max and now he is like vp of product or something at tbs factoring his portfolio is really anorexic you can get a hold of his resume up here his work his contact his work will just take you i'm pretty sure it takes you to dribble yep and you can just scroll through dribble and see everything he's done and i can't work chrome apparently um so he just gives you like a really quick little blurb about himself download his resume and then he has twitter linkedin dribble and email so next we're gonna talk about clint clint mcmanaman this is one of my heroes he's been in the design game since like 2002. um so right now his website is pretty much just this straightforward deal but if you click here it takes you to his portfolio proper and he uses case studies to kind of show a lot of the things that he's done which he's done a lot of things so i like his because it's just really clean it's really straightforward he gives you a headline that explains pretty much everything he's all about if you follow him on any social media that's what you're going to get so he's pretty straightforward and i like that so if you'll notice like things are really simple they're really kind of just straightforward and i know these guys are mostly designers and then we have a maya right all right is that is that embarrassing to like have yours like thrown up there all right now i really like this again you give a really quick just what you can do you're not like reaching out there and saying you can you know operate microsoft office or something which is i've seen that we have a great little gallery of projects um and then we have them over here on codepen which is awesome because this proves to me that you did this it's on codepen so i can go see what you've done it's awesome and then we have and i like this we have a resume download the resume but we also have the certificate so this gives validity to the claims that you're making that hey i have a certificate that proves that i can do what i say i'm doing then we have contact information so there's there's a few examples i'm going to go back over here now oh i guess we can look at mine i just went through mine and rebuilt it so i love the mountains so i have mountains i have a blurb about my professional self and my personal self i have a little section about what i do and i have three big projects that i've done i'm gonna write case studies for those later and then i have a little chat form so mine's kind of anorexic but there it is all right so if we come back here technology so great when it works all right so my thing that i would say is remember to focus on the job to be done rather than the style it's really easy when you're trying to represent yourself to like get hung up on how things look or whatever like remember that the people that are visiting your site have a job to be done and that is to learn about you and to contact you so remember that and make sure they can easily do that all right so let's talk about the building blocks to include to make your portfolio awesome everybody wants to do that right all right so include your work that's gonna be really important it's not a portfolio if you don't it's just like a little web page so give me work that you've completed right you want to make sure that it's done that you can show it off maybe try some work that challenged you maybe it was something that was really hard and maybe you can explain why that was hard and how you got over it maybe try some work in progress like if it's okay with your employer or if you're just doing things on the side you can put work in progress and you can explain where you're at and where you're going you want to do work that showcases your skill so like the skills that you're focusing on that's what you want to show like i'm not going to cram my portfolio full of code because code is secondary to design for me so i'm going to go design something and then i'll code it and i don't really care how the code looks well i care but that's a different talk so make sure you also do work that you want to do again if you i mean focus on what you're after right don't don't focus on things because i said to do it or because daniel said to do it and especially if carson says to do it no i'm kidding guys carson's great i just had to do i just had to give him a little dig um but yeah put work you want to do on there like if you're like i said if you want to focus on ui ux then go figure that out if you want to focus on development go figure that out if you want to do like machine learning go figure that out um you know focus on what you want to do be you right so try to put your best foot forward with your work you want quality over quantity um you know show them what you know what you're doing i would say quality over quantity because i don't want to scroll through a bunch of stuff that doesn't look very good that isn't complete that you don't really care about i'd rather see three things that you care about than 10 things you don't all right so show your work that's the next one consider using case studies so that is a like laying out and saying this was the problem this was our essentially our hypothesis this was how we approached it and this is the results that's really good because it shows the thought process behind it not just i copied code from here and pasted code to here and it worked i don't know why you want to show why explain the technology stack you used you know why why did you use react overview or why didn't you use wordpress when it was a cms or why did you use whatever you used explain why instead of just saying i use these technologies and putting the cute little icons like great you use those use those on every project why did you choose that explain problems you ran into so like if you're working on something and you had a problem and it was essentially a show stopper how did you get around that did you ask for help did you stay up till midnight trying to figure it out how did you solve that problem the reason i am stressing this one is because it demonstrates that you're a problem solver and not just a you know hanging out on stack overflow which is sort of problem solving in my case but it shows that you know what you're doing and you know how to go beyond just the specs you can actually get out there and kind of solve problems so think about soft skills demonstrating those like who did you have to talk to to get the specs like how did you figure out what the problem was that you had to to accomplish these are these are like soft skills that a hiring person is going to want to like hear about and i wouldn't say like list them out like a bullet point maybe it's how you describe the problem and like maybe the problem was you know we my company acquired this job and i was required to talk to these people and then i had to talk to this person to figure out what the users were after and therefore i chose this technology stack and we ran into this problem and this is how we solved it and that's all just in a short maybe couple paragraphs you know and then you have screenshots and maybe some code pin embeds showing the code and that's just an idea you might also think about explaining how you organize your work how do you organize your tasks you know like what kind of what kind of organizational system do you use that shows that you know how to organize your life and you're not living out of a suitcase there's nothing wrong with living out a suitcase if you do but employers don't want your code that way because it's really hard to come back to all right so think of your portfolio as a resume with some personality um i know a while back it was really cool to do like these little catchy res like portfolios that were full of trendy verbiage but people aren't really after that so do include your resume someplace to download like i said hiring people want to download that and they want to share it with the people in their group um the people that matter do include a link to something like linkedin that's a great place to send people for professional stuff they love it do give us a little about section so we can learn about you that's a great idea so that uh you know i know you're a real person and you know not just something thrown up there i would say keep it professional but add just a little bit of your personality i mean think about what kind of colors do you like what kind of pictures do you like what kind of how do you word things i mean don't you don't want to be a robot you want to have some fun with it like it's not it's not like a science experiment or something you want to have some fun um so give me a way to contact you and you would be surprised how many people forget this piece like if you're putting a portfolio up there and your goal is to get a job or get side gigs i need a way to get a hold of you and a lot of people sometimes forget that i know that sounds silly but make sure you have an email um i would say have a phone number but when i had a phone number on my website i got so many spam calls so you know if you want your phone number that's fine um social media is fine but use it with caution so i have a note about social media and this is coming from me observing other people keep your social media private so that it's your social network and not the world but if you do want to share with the world keep it neutral so maybe if you're going to put your twitter on there and you're a religious person don't put a ton of like opinionated religious stuff on there and if you're a political person don't put your political ideas out there i mean we talked about this a second ago and i'm stressing it for a reason don't put any illegal stuff you know if you're out smoking big doinks in amish we don't need to see that especially if you want a job put no isms again no racism no sexism none of that please don't even give your opinion on it because you can assume if you put it on the internet if somebody's looking to hire you they will find it and you can assume that if it's borderline offensive it will offend them just assume those things and also assume that if you put it on the internet it will never ever ever go away and it will come back to haunt you in 10 years just assume those things they may not be true but assume them because people are going to search for you they're going to google you they're going to do all sorts of stuff they're not just going to look at your website and go that was cool let's hire them they're going to they're going to dig into your past so that's what they do all right here's a few things to consider as we kind of wrap up and these are just my opinions so whatever consider who your end user is going to be and this is where i always start um who are you going to build this for is it for somebody who's going to be employing you either as a contractor or as a job are you building it for your peers kind of like the people in this room is it kind of just to show off what you can do are you just building it for yourself just to have something all three of those things are going to have different outcomes when you're done building it um so as you kind of identify who you're building it for think about where they're at right now like what kind of position are they in um you know if it's a if it's a hiring person they're going to be a kind of a they're probably going to be a business person they're going to be kind of coming across your site you know at work so you can think about that think about their background because that's going to give you a really big idea into what they're expecting so if they're if they're this gentleman on the right that likes haha business he's going to expect certain things whereas if it's me i'm going to expect something else from your site so if you think about who is going to be coming to your site and you're going to think about what their background is you'll know kind of how to you know tailor your website to get the result that you want all right so again kind of diving more into that what is your end user looking for um what kind of position are you going for are you going to be a developer a leader or are you just a haha business person and those people seriously exist they run meetings and they they go to meetings and they talk about meetings and they talk about getting stuff done and they have meetings about getting stuff done and they never actually do anything but they love it so what kind of position are you going for um and you'll kind of want to tailor your site for that um again think about what what's their job to be done when they're coming to your website what are they looking for are they looking for your work or are they looking for you know what are they looking for typically they want to know about you and they want to see your work and then they want to be able to contact you if they want to and you're looking at maybe 30 seconds before they make that decision if you're lucky so why would these people be visiting your site is it because you applied for a job is it because they just saw you in a forum somewhere is it because you you know like taped it to their door i don't know i wouldn't do that these qr codes are they're not cool anymore all right how did they find you did did somebody pass them your website was it like you know like in a chat that they copy and paste it check this out did they find you like through a user group type thing i mean these are all going to kind of dictate you know how they approach your site so i would say have empathy for your end user and make it really easy for them to find what they're looking for because you're helping them like you if you do that remember that they have a job to do and they want to do it quickly nobody wants to hunt for things even if you think it's clever they don't so make it easy for them to find what they're looking for all right and finally just remember your portfolio doesn't have to be perfect um i've struggled with this a lot in my life and a lot of people i've talked to especially when i remember when we were in college it had to be perfect it doesn't have to be perfect build it to your current skill level if you're trying to be a developer and you can only write html and css that's fine you can build a portfolio just build it make sure it gets out there keep it simple you don't need a ton of like fancy animations or fancy effects or whatever just keep it simple remember what you're trying to accomplish with it and make it easy to use but have fun doing it that's the other thing like if you want to put some some fancier things in there to kind of show your skills and have fun doing it that's fine too just don't feel like you have to um number one thing is get it done um because like a resume this is kind of like the you know the electronic resume essentially like you're putting yourself out there and saying here i am this is what i can do um so if you feel struck at all i put this quote up here that's what's been really big for me lately um it's by marcus aurelius the roman emperor he says the impediment to action advances action what stands in the way becomes the way so building a portfolio is hard because you have to brag about yourself you have to handle writing all the body copy for the website you have to think about doing this and that and it has to be professional but it makes you a better developer and a better professional for doing it bye right all right does anybody have any questions and anybody yes right okay she's asking um for me to repeat talking about case studies specifically like what goes into case studies um case studies typically highlight a project you're working on so let's say you were building a project and you had to make a form for the first time right so you were you were responsible for building a form that took in a certain amount of information and sent it somewhere so you wouldn't highlight the whole project you might say within this project that i was working on at work and you might give a little bit of background about the project you would say my task was to build this form and so you would say i started by researching the forms and we we came to figure out this was what information was needed you know maybe it was the person's name an email and a short message i mean this is really simple um and so you talked about how you had a certain technology you were using and you had to go figure out how to pull those things in when the form was submitted and you had to talk about how you captured that that stuff in the database and like alerted whoever needed to be alerted and so along the way you can talk about then you can put in code snippets you can put in screenshots you could put in screen captures like video and then you can kind of elaborate into the results so like maybe the results were because of this people were able to ask for help which increased productivity x percent that's typically kind of what you see on most case studies and i'm coming from a design background a little bit so it is kind of like problem solution result is kind of what you can boil that down to um was did that help to answer your question great anybody else no oh go ahead no you're fine it's daniel go ahead type of job um work you want to do on your landing page your portfolio is passed down the more in depth but i also heard that you should have like additional work to show if you're asked is that something you've heard before and like would you suggest to have like more depth work on the side so she's asking about like and you can correct me if i'm wrong you're asking about keywords and extra work is that okay so she's kind of asking about like keywords and and having more than just what what's on your portfolio so keywords i don't really know about that's kind of like black magic to me that gets into like seo territory which is not something i'm very familiar with um but as far as having extra work yes you will want extra work for an interview i would say on your portfolio online maybe putting your best foot forward but then having somewhere maybe github maybe codepen if you're into design maybe dribble or behance some place where you can stash other work and it's not that that works bad it's just that you haven't chosen to highlight it as a quote case study um because case studies take a lot of work like you really have to kind of dig in and think about why you did what you did and you have to go track down the results and stuff like that so they actually take a lot of work so maybe it's not that that works bad and as much as it's just you didn't want to do that you know what i'm saying so yes when you get into an interview people are going to want to be able to see the different skills that you have and they're going to want to see different types of work that you've done and they're going to see that you're flexible and they're going to want to see that you can problem solve and so by having more work to pull out and show that might not be on your website you show just that so did that answer your questions um that's a really good question and that's a really hard question i would say at least in my case what i've done is i've either asked the client and said is it cool if i show this you know on my portfolio and you you know you can if you can demonstrate to them a lot of times that you're not going to give away any trade secrets or anything like that they will a lot of times say yes if you ask them if not the other thing i've had to do in the past is to essentially recreate the project by changing enough stuff that i can so that it's basically not that project because really what you're what you're trying to say is here's a problem and here's how i solved it and so if it's a fake company and fake data you you're still solving that problem and i mean you can probably in an interview you can explain your situation and they're gonna be they're going to be cool with it you kind of have to be creative in how you solve that problem because that's a problem in and of itself anybody else uh where's the happy medium the happy medium is if you can look at the website and say it communicates what you want it to communicate so if you need a header and a picture and one paragraph tag you're done you did it um you know maybe you can get in with a few extra stuff but the i've heard this over and over and over again and i always kind of struggle with it because nobody wants to follow it but the rule is this nobody reads anything on the internet i mean think about it when was the last time you read you seriously read anything on the internet i mean and i'm not talking about like you you saw an interesting article you chose to read i'm talking about as you browse the internet somebody sends you a link what's the first thing you do you scroll you look at headers you look at pictures and if it's interesting you might read the first sentence of a paragraph so that's how people typically consume websites and you have to remember that like if someone sends my portfolio to a hiring person they're not going to read it until they think i'm interesting they're going to scroll through there they're going to find my work and they're going to go look at my work and they're going to go ah this is not what we want or oh that's so perfect that's what we want and then they'll go back and read it and if they decide they don't like me they probably just couldn't close the tab and that was it so the happy medium is saying i want to communicate this message and this is what it takes to do it and when it comes to writing i've always heard you want to keep it about a sixth grade level and you want to write out your message and then rewrite it and then rewrite it and then rewrite it and then rewrite it and make it as simple as possible um you know and then basically whatever you have cut it in half and rewrite it again because that's how writing goes and that's why i'm not a writer because it's kind of hard but um there's tools for that but does that answer your question or awesome anybody else oh from twitch how would i show a portfolio in a portfolio project i'm working on with someone else is that oh i didn't do the entire thing okay i would highlight the pieces that i did do and i would not be shy to say i worked with another person or you know maybe even name them if they're cool with it and i would basically say i worked on this piece and then so and so worked on this piece and then i took it back and worked on this piece and you know you that's actually really good because it shows that you can work in a team environment and that you can communicate you know back and forth and password back and forth like say uh so so you're asking about what do you do with like skill sets so like if you have a bunch of different skills how do you demonstrate that okay i would say like in a development environment it's probably okay to list out i know these languages um because that's really one of the best ways to show that um but if you can back that up with some projects and be like in this project i use c sharp and in this project i use javascript and this u in this project i use php and if you can like demonstrate that that's even better because then it's not just a list of things that you quote know it's actually demonstrating that you know how to do that i typically don't list out skill sets because in the design world it's kind of become a it doesn't matter it's like oh you can write some code and you can do wireframes and you can do mockups so that's it and my portfolio already demonstrates that so it's like i don't have to do that so that was a great question yeah i would actually probably list those out somewhere it's a it's a static web page i use dribble to host my work and then i link out to that i use jekyll and it works with github pages so it's like free hosting so you make a gh pages branch and you push your code up there and then it point the you buy a domain name and you point it to that dns and it works so so yeah it's static um i don't i don't do much in that way you were gonna ask a question so you're totally asking let me see you're asking if i use behance as a and dribble as a supplement or as my portfolio right yeah okay i actually use that as my portfolio both of them now have a feature where you they like make you a little web page and so i built the web page that i showed you guys let me i'll pull it back up actually if i can figure out how to work google chrome because apparently i don't know how to work google chrome there we go okay so i built this page and then all of these things link to dribble and so i've created dribble projects and then in the descriptions i talk about what i'm doing there and why i'm doing things and then you have all the different things and then when i say see more work that just links to my all my dribble feed so there's a lot of things in here that are not too bad but i didn't put them in there as a case study just because it didn't really matter to me so that's how i'm using that and that going back to your question that means because i'm using an outside source i don't have to use a database and i can just use a static page to just host some information so yes all right sorry you want to see the project right i'm actually i don't know i want to make case studies i haven't done it because they're timeconsuming um so i've put these you know i have basically my last three major employments and i have examples from there from things i'm doing so this is stuff i'm currently working on um and it and inside of this stuff here it kind of explains like each post i'm explaining what the post is about and like what what kind of problems it's solving um so it's sort of a case study but it's not like a traditional case study i think if you were to read through that you would actually kind of get a grasp for what i'm talking about like what's what what the what the the picture actually means so i should probably do a better job of actually making a page for a case study but i was lazy and i have a lot going on so i just linked to that so remember that i'm a designer so everything is about the end picture and showing you how i got to that whereas if you're writing code it's about how you built that thing so there is there is kind of a difference there any other questions no no that's a good question um i tried to get stewarthines.com and a realtor in amarillo texas had it and i was really upset and so i got stuart heinz not me and that's how i chose my domain name sorry i don't have any dnd references daniel back there all right is there any other questions nope i'm sorry you're asking what i used for my contact form it's called formly and it's form ly or something i i don't know i just typed in a contact form for static website and there was like two or three and i picked formally because it was open source and free um so i don't know how well it works it works when i submit one myself so i guess we'll see i guess everybody can go spam it right now and send me emails and we'll see how that works that'd be kind of fun any other questions oh so you're asking about like uh when i said don't give your opinion on technologies all right i'll explain that a little bit further yo go ahead sorry um right the only reason i say don't push your opinion on things is because your opinion is a lot of times what i've learned your opinion and so while your opinion may be right most of the time it might not be right all the time and you may offend someone wanting to hire you or work with you just by your opinion and you may never even know it because they were reading your blog and they were like oh he's so opinionated about this one thing that i just can't get over i mean it's silly but it's trying to take that path of like least resistance because as soon as you try to say that you know about something people are going to come out of the woodwork to tell you you don't you know and it's so it's just like when i i always look at a portfolio like a resume kind of so it's like i'm trying to be as neutral as possible but if you know a lot about something and you can prove you know a lot about something then go ahead i would say by linking to something like having a medium account that's kind of become the new like blog platform and like just linking to that on off your site would be fine if you like to write about tech but i've seen a lot of people and myself included when i was younger just giving my opinion about stuff and then when you look at it five years later you're like man i was dumb or you read somebody and you're like yeah you're a total noob you don't know what you're talking about you know like so it's like you want to just be really careful when you put your opinion out there that's all that's all i mean by that it might have seemed a little strong but yeah i yeah i think both of you right on that she was saying you know that a company may see that you were writing about something and decided you were totally stuck on that one thing and he was saying if you write in a neutral way then it'd be okay and i think you're both right on that like you know just i don't know just be careful when you're posting your opinion is i guess i guess the sum of that all right anybody else got anything oh all right so uh good luck making your portfolios and uh we'll see you next time does somebody have announcements announcements okay yay
