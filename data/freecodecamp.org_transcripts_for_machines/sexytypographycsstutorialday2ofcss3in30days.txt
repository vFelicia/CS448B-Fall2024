hey everyone what's up welcome back to code 30 things in 30 days with css3 today is day number two and we're going to be doing a lesson that i call sexy typography so over here in the browser you can see um basically in the final result you can kind of see what it is we're going to be building so in css3 what's kind of neat is you can you can make some really cool text effects uh just with css3 you don't need photoshop or anything like that so i wanted to highlight a couple of those things in css3 in today's lesson it's pretty simple shouldn't take us too long but i think it's gonna be fun and might kind of uh give you a few ideas of what you can do with css3 on your own websites and applications and so on all right so before we start coding you're gonna need the course files the final course files so uh in this module there's gonna be a lesson uh entitled download the course files or whatever it is that i name it at the time and you could just click on that link it'll take you to a dropbox link it should direct download that today's course files which should be entitled to dash sexy typography there will be an index file a sandbox.css file and a final.css file and that's what you need for today the index you don't need to concern yourself with other than looking at seeing how the markup is laid out sandbox.css is where you're going to be coding your own css and then the final css is what you're going to use for reference it gives you the final result over here in the browser you can see down here you can use it for reference that's what we're going to try to build the final css is what gets you that result okay so go ahead and download that you can pause the video do whatever you need to do and once you're done with that come back open it up in your code editor and let's get started so first things first in your sandbox.css uh open up a new line and let's uh get coding so we need to code the first uh example here cool shadow i call it basically has this cool retro shadow that kind of offsets behind and off to the bottom right of the text and it's this cool effect and that's purely css so let's do that it's pretty straightforward and simple all you got to do is uh select that class so in our index let's find out what it's called shadow typo is the class i called it shadow dash typo and then we're gonna position that relative like so uh we're gonna display inline block uh font size uh we we need to make that quite large so 4m in fact let's make it for rem to be consistent with css3 text transform we want that to be uppercase all uppercase the color let's go double o b3b4 and uh and then here's where the magic happens so let me just save this and head over here to the browser we're basically halfway there we're actually 99 of the way there it looks pretty much the same as down here uh although four rem made this quite a bit smaller so me head back to our code editor maybe make that something like six ram let's see what that does okay go back it's a little bit big but whatever you want to do it's up to you now all we need to do is add a text shadow in css3 but two text shadows so we're going to have a transparent text shadow behind the letters and then another text shadow behind that one that gives that kind of separation so head back here to your css your sandbox.css and we're going to go text shadow three pixels three pixels uh that's vertical and horizontal offset three pixels and three pixels so we're gonna go down and over zero pixels we don't want any blur and the number is going to be e 7 e e f 1. that is this color of the background container so it's gonna you're not going to see anything at all on purpose comma one more value in here eight pixels eight pixels so offsetting this eight pixels down and eight pixels over and then the blur zero we don't want any blur on this whatsoever and then we're gonna do rgba for uh red green blue alpha and zero zero zero so this is like um i'm gonna give us black but then the alpha channel 0.1 which is going to make it like 10 so it's going to be very very transparent so i'm going to be 10 visible semicolons save that head over to your browser and you can see you're done just like that pretty cool text shadow effect you got that you can see here you got that three pixel offset and then the eight pixel offset okay so that was it for the cool shadow version let's go down to the 3d type we're going to make a bit of a threedimensional effect so over here in the browser this one's kind of cool it's angled it's got this like depth and then like kind of a layer at the back that's a bit darker so you can see here you got the text on an angle a bit of a depth going on there like it pops out and then there's like a layer at the back that's darker and then this like very subtle shadow it's very simple we're just playing with some transforms and some text shadow very simple so let's go back here to our code editor sandbox.css all right so we're going to select that class and that's going to be called 3d typo i wrote 3d literally because you can't start a class with a number so just put 3d 3d dash typo like that and then we're going to start with the font size let's do 6 rem again and then we're going to say text transform uppercase and then the color is going to be f2 395 oops a and then we're going to do some transforms so i'm going to start off with the transform here and then we're going to say skew is the first value of the transform property skew and then two values x and y minus 5 degrees comma minus five degrees that's gonna angle it and then we're gonna rotate it five degrees whoops that's gotta be connected just like that so if i save that and check it out over here in the browser it basically looks like it's italic but you can see when i highlight it my cursor highlight is actually on an angle and when you highlight text that's italic it doesn't necessarily do that so so this is actually being angled and rotated a little bit if i were to be a bit more dramatic you'd see you know that this is actually so i'm going to rotate it even more like 25 degrees so check it out you can see that that's what i'm doing so i'm going to put that back to 5 degrees on the rotate and then i'm going to do the degrees five negative five and negative five and we're good to go okay so now because transform is css3 sometimes some browsers don't necessarily know what that is so we got to use browser prefixes you can check out kenyuse.com and see how valid transform property is in css3 and how cross browser compatible it is but i'm just going to for good practice put in webkit transform and essentially just copy this it's exactly the same thing and just paste that in so same thing save it and now let's keep going so we're going to do the transform origin so i want to change the origin of where it rotates and where it's transforming because i'm pretty sure currently it goes from the top left i think that's the default transform origin so where it transforms from and where it rotates from so that's that you can change where you want that origin to be so i'm going to say center center so save that you would notice this more if i change the values of the skew and the rotate to something more dramatic you'd see that it's rotating from the center so why don't i give you an example of that so i'm going to comment this out 20 and 20. so if i were to say bottom right and save and go back here you can see it's actually the origin is in a separate spot versus like top left and then go back here you can see now it's in a different spot so it's actually or the origin of the transform is in different positions of the element so we want center center so it's nice and centered uh perfect now back in the code editor here we're gonna copy this but then have the browser prefix version transform origin but it's gonna be webkit transform origin and now we need to just do some text shadows it's very simple we're just going to do a lot of text shadows in one text shadow property here so text shadow we're going to say 1 pixel 1 pixel we've done this before d 10 e 31 i'm going to copy that value because i'm going to use it a lot now if i stopped there you wouldn't see much over here it's just a slight darker shadow behind it so let me save this oh i'm going to change this back to 5 degrees 5 all around perfect okay so i'm gonna put a comma and return go back and under here and i'm gonna do another couple values two pixels two pixels i'm gonna paste that uh value here copy this i'm gonna put a comma and we're gonna change this from two and two to three and three now you catch the idea i'm gonna do this up until seven so just do that there we go so save that uh semicolon at the end check it out and see what we got so far perfect it's got that kind of angle depth kind of that pops out looks great but there's still more to it we have another layer so let's go back here to our editor comma i'm going to paste and change this to 8 and 8 but change the color value to a darker salmony red color which is going to be 890920 copy that value paste it a couple more times we're going to change this to 9 and 9 and 10 and 10. semicolon at the end check it out in your browser we basically finished it but there's one little element left and that's just kind of this broad blur in the background you can see here as a final example there's a bit of a background shadow an actual shadow back there that just gives it more depth it pops out more than up here so let's uh go back here and add one more value so a comma we're going to go 11 pixels 11 pixels but for the blur property 15 pixels so quite blurry very blurry in fact in rgba we're gonna do zero zero zero which is black but then another comma now we need the alpha channel we're gonna go 0.5 which is 50 transparent semicolon save that head back over and there we are in the browser we're done 3d type we've got that depth we've got that little layer there that's darker and then the shadow in the background so we've got the cool shadow the retro style shadow there and then we've got the 3d type that pops out using text shadows so it's quite simple but it's just a matter of playing around with the values and and giving the illusion that you have threedimensional text so all of this is done in css3 exclusively just you know a dozen or so lines of css very simple whereas if you were to do this in photoshop you'd have to make it in photoshop you'd have to export it for like retina and normal and then put the images and you're adding more bandwidth and it just takes too long just to create something you could just do simply in css3 so that is it for day two sexy typography a little bit simpler of a day today than yesterday day one was quite the beast but today is a simpler just to kind of give you a better breathing room before we get into some pretty awesome and difficult stuff as we go along in this journey hope you enjoyed day two i'll see you tomorrow in day number three peace cheers gotta go bye
