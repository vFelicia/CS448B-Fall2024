hello I'm going to talk about comparison operators and if else statements first of all let's look at some code here we have our is FCC great and I've set this variable here's how we declare a variable here's the name of the variable we've set that to be equal to true so now look this is the if statement down here if and then in parentheses we put something that we're testing we're just going to put this variable which we've set to true so if whatever's in here which we have as is FCC great if this is true we are going to do whatever is in these brackets so what's in this brackets is console.log freec code Camp is amazing so if we run that it is going to say free code Camp is amazing however if we change this to false and we I'm going to clear the console and run that again it's not going to do anything because since this is false it's not going to do what's in the brackets but to be able to see that better I'm going to add an else so else so let me just copy this I'm going to paste it down here and put horrible and we're going to run that so if this is true it's going to do what's in the first brackets but when we have else else means if it's false it's going to do what in the second brackets however we better change this back to True before Quincy sees it and there there that's what it should say free code Camp is amazing okay now we're going to talk about comparison operators comparison operators are more than less than less than or equal to more than or equal to equals equals which just means equals or not equals the less than or more than symbols the way I remember which one is which is if you see the less than symbol kind of looks like the letter L the less than symbol opens the same direction as a capital l which is the first letter in the word less than so let's put in some code here to test these out I put H equals 18 and if age is greater than or equal to 18 so if it's 18 or any number more than 18 we're going to console that log you are an adult let me run that and it says you are an adult now this is where we can use some some else if statements uh that's a new thing I want to show you else if now before it's either two things it's EI either doing one thing or we're doing the other thing but else if we're going to do something if age is more than equal to 18 else if now this may not always happen depending on what's in the the parentheses for the if we're going to say age is less than 18 and I'm just going to copy this up here you are a child if we if we run this it's just going to be pretty similar it's just going to say you are an adult but if I change this to one and we run that it's going to say you are a child let's try put another thing in here else if we're going to say else if age is less than two console.log you are a baby and this is going to give me a good chance to show you something else if I click run it's going to say you are a child it's not going to say you are a baby even though the age is one the age is less than two but it's not saying you are a baby because once the program evaluates one of these it stops evaluating so look at this else if age is less than 18 console.log you were a child now that this has been evaluated it's not going to even check any of the other items so it's not even going to check this that's why it can be very important to order you put things so for this example we probably want to put this up here I'm just copying and pasting here and now we're going to check about the age being less than two first and then check if the age is less than 18 and that should do more of what we're trying to get at here and now it is going to say you are a baby if we change this to 10 um it's going to say let's see you were a child and it's still going to say say anything above 18 it's going to say you are an adult so let's check a few more things we're going to show the equal equals and the not equals and change this to 18 and we're going to try that we're going to run that you are 18 so it says if age equals equals 18 console.log 8 so the important thing about this is that to check if something is equal you always use two equal signs because if you only use one equal sign that's an assignment operator and now we are going to set the variable age to be equal to 18 instead of checking to see if age does equal 18 now something interesting about that is that it's still gonna put true because whenever you set a variable equal to a number it's always going to evaluate as true but now later in the program if if we have it started at 10 and then we're going to set it to 18 now age is going to equal 18 so you want to make sure you always use two equal signs that's how you test if something is equal there's also a comparison operated with three equal signs equals equals equals I'm going to talk about that in a future video for now the last one I want to show show you is the not equal so if you put the exclamation point right before if age does not equal 18 we're going to say you are not 18 let me clear the console and we're going to run that and it's going to say you are not 18 okay well those are if and else statements and comparison
