javascript allows you to select elements from the dom of a website and then make changes to those elements first i'm going to go over ways to select these elements using javascript up here i have the html and you can see down here is where the html is being rendered and the javascript i'm going to put up here so here we have document.getelementbyid so we're going to find an id in the document over here and it's going gonna be div one so that's going to select this entire element right here because the id is div one and you can pass any id if i passed in div two it would select this section right here now i have get elements by class name and i've passed in a class name unicycle something to look at here is this word elements it's a plural that means you're going to get all elements that have that class name as we have it it's going to select this element and this element both of them have the class of unicycle and a lot of these can be called on any element not just the document so instead of putting document here if i put div 1 it's only gonna select the elements that have class unicycle in div one so here's div one and we would only select this item that has the class unicycle we would not select this one because that's not in div one but for now i'm going to change this back to document and now we have get elements by tag name it's kind of like the previous one except instead of passing a class name you're going to pass a tag name so that would just be this pep so this will get all the paragraphs in the document so here here here but again if i put something like div one here we would only get the paragraphs in div one now this is showing query selector for query selector you can pass in a string containing one or more css selectors separated by commas and this is going to return the first element within the document that matches that selection now this can be used to find the same things you found in the above methods for instance when we pass in this as the query selector that's going to be the same thing as just finding the first item with the class name unicycle or we can put in like this and that's gonna be the same thing as finding the first element with an id of let's change this to div two now you can also do query selector all kind of like query selector but now we're returning an array of elements you can pass in different items to match so this is going to match the class unicycle and this is going to match the id div 2 so you can get every item that has the class unicycle or the id div 2. now once you've selected the elements there are different things you can do with them in this video i'll just show you how to set new text or html so first i have a text variable that just has an h1 tag uh with the word the words hello world inside and now i'm going to set div 1 which you can see up here which is document.getelementbyid div 1. i'm going to set the inner html to text that means i'm going to replace all the html inside div one with this new html so look div one is right here so this whole thing is div one it's the whole thing's gonna be replaced with just this new html so let's run that and see what happens as you can see it replaced everything in that this blue line here with with hello world and now let's try on query unicycle and let's change this since it's quite a unicycle this should be unicycle and run that and the first class with unicycle has changed to hello world now a lot of these are actually giving you an array of elements remember so to change things in an array of elements you're going to have to use a loop so let me comment out there and we see this loop we're going to go through the whole query all dot link so for every element that we've queried in query all we're going to set the inner html to the text so let's run that and you can see here we have three hello worlds because this is getting every unicycle and then the div two so we have this became hello world that's class unicycle this became hello world and then this whole thing section right here became hello world now there is a security risk whenever you use inner html especially when you're setting strings over which you have no control this could open you up to a crosssite scripting attack for that reason it is recommended that you not use inner html when inserting plain text instead you can use text content like this and let me just comment this out and text content is not going to interpret the past content as html but just inserts it as raw text so if i run that it's going to have the h1 tags right in there it's just going to put the raw text instead of trying to create the actual heading in the page and you can do that for any of these examples we've seen already well thanks for watching my name is beau carnes don't forget to subscribe and remember use your code for good
