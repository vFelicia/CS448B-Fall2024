in this video I'll be giving examples for subsets and supersets so if you look at this blue line here this represents our Universal Set uh We've defined it to be the integers from 1 to 11 that's 1 2 3 4 all the way up to 11 don't let it concern you that there are elements outside of our universe um that just means that they are I mean that just means they're not in the universe that we have in question right now so it's no different than having stars outside of your Galaxy you're not concerned by that it's just a matter of fact so if you look at this green line uh what what set would that be well it contains elements three beta and gamma so does b b contains three beta and gamma so this would be the set B likewise this set here it contains elements 3 1 and X well a contains 3 1 and X so this is the set a and finally this Set uh contains elements one and three this set contains elements one and three so this is the set C now what can be said about these sets well we have uh we can say that c is a subset of the universe because all elements of c are elements of the universe furthermore we can say that uh the set B is not a subset of the universe because there are elements of B that are not within the universe also we can say that the universe is not a subset a superset of a because there's elements of a that are not within uh or not contained by the universe and finally we can say that the universe is a proper suet of C because the universe contains all elements of C except and there are elements within the universe that are not within the set C so if we wanted to be more specific we could actually say that c is a proper subset of the universe
