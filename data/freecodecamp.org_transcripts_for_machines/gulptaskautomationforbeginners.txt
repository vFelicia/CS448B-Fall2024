what's going on guys my name is jay and in this video i'm going to show you how i use gulp almost every day if you don't know what gulp is i want to show you very quickly um what one of the things that you can do with it so right now i have here a very basic website you can see that i'm requesting a style.css file now i don't have this file yet because i'm using sas as you can see here so this is all some sas code so i need to compile this code to or see so a css file only one css file but then after that i want to minify that css file and then use the css file it sounds very complicated but that's when gulps come and help us so gulp can actually every time i edit something here and i save the file gulp can do all that for me automatically you can pause the file it save the file in a folder you get the file from that folder and save it or another folder and and convert the file whatever you want gulp can do it let's go and install gulp and for that you're going to need node js every link that i'm going to show here every website that i'm going to show you i'm going to paste it on the description of this video go there download it install it in your computer it's just like a normal app so install it there and then after it's installed then we go here to gulpjs.com and we can install gulp we're gonna use our command command line interface which a ton of people is scared of this interface right now to install gulp we just need to follow these simple instructions here we can just copy and paste it all right remember you need to install node.js before if not if this is not going to work all right so let's open the command line for now you can be on any folder but then we need to go to our project folder okay so first you need to install the gulp cli because we're going to use some specific commands for gulp so you just need to copy this and paste it here and hit enter and it will install everything you need to use the gulp command line and everything if you're using mac and you get like permission errors all you need to do is like use um sudo sudo and then paste that and hit enter okay i'm not gonna do it because i already did it and i'm just gonna load and i already have all everything i need all right so next thing i'm gonna do um now i'm gonna go to the folder so let's look at my project folder is this one right here so i'm just gonna i'm just gonna write cd space and i'm just gonna drag and drop the folder i'm gonna hit enter and right now i'm inside my project folder right you can double check by writing ls hit enter it will show you the files inside that folder and that's correct um you can just you can use pwd and it will show you the path to that folder and this is correct so we're good to go i'm gonna put clear so we can clear that out we are in our folder good and now we can just run this command call npm init and this will create like a file um with a bunch of things that is gonna describe our project so for example our package name you can put whatever you want i'm just gonna hit enter the version i'm just going to hit enter again description whatever you want i don't want to put anything for now um entry point so i'm just hitting enter enter enter until the end it will show you like a preview um so right now everything is empty here it doesn't matter for now it's gonna work but i think you wanna add a little bit of description and your name and all that stuff so i'm gonna yes all right so if we go inside our folder now we have this new of file so i'm going to open my editor you will see it here and that's what we did right now that's um you know like the name the version description all right next we're gonna copy this this is what is going to install gulp in our project so let's go there let's clear this out let's paste it let's hit enter this is going to take a minute or two depending on your computer all right and that's done um it's going to give you some warnings because of is going they're going to tell you to update this package or whatever don't worry that's not gonna be uh an issue so you will see that we have gulp and they're gonna let you know the version um all the packages they added and all that stuff so right now we have gulp inside our folder here and now you will notice something different in your file your package.json file that you created earlier and you'll see depth dependencies gulp and the version so for now we're just going to close that so don't worry about that file let's go back to the gold website and now we're going to do this one this is copy let's go back there let's clear this out and now we're going to paste that so touch is just a command that will create a file so it's going to create a gulp file.js and it's going to be empty it's just creating that file we're going to hit enter and that's it let's see and now we have this gobfile.js file and it's totally empty okay let's go back and this gulp help you don't have to it's just this is just more for um instruction and then explaining you different commands that you can use to help um if you're confused or whatever but that's it so we are ready to start our project so we are here um open your gulp file um dot js this is a very important file this is the file that we're gonna use and add some code here okay the first one we're gonna create a variable of gold equals require and gold whoops that's the first one and you need it it's very important um you needed to run gulp of course um we're getting gulp and now we're gonna do is adding different packages so the first one i need is the sas one which is going to get all my sass files and put it on a different folder compile everything and put a css file on it all right so i have here the packet somewhere here i think this one here you go so in here you can search for a ton of packages.coms that you can install using npm ton of packages thousands of packages that you different you can use you can get very very creative so this is the one that actually get my sass file and compile to css so here is very simple they give you this so you can install so let's just copy let's go there let's paste it let's hit enter alright so now we have the gulp assass already installed so we can use it so let's go back there to our um editor all right so now we need to add here so you can see they give you like an example of how you can add your um how you can use that package so let's just copy and paste it first we need to um add the package and require the package so let's just copy this and this let's go back there all right cool now this this is a task this is what's gonna run like a function that is gonna run let's just see what's going on here it's gonna take the sass which is this so this one here we need to change it because we have our sas in this sas folder so let's go here sas and then inside this sas folder we're going to have a bunch of sas files so we're going to do this dot set so this is like a wild card it's going to take every single file that we have with this format so it's gonna take every single one or you can you can be very specific you can be like style.sas it's gonna take that but for now i'm just gonna i want every single file so you do that and that's done so it's gonna happen here this is just if there's an error they're gonna tell you they're gonna tell you there's an error if not it's gonna pipe and then it's gonna run whatever you want and save your css file here so all this i don't want to confuse you all this is just getting the file your sas file compiling the file and saving the css file in this folder so right now it's saving the file on a css folder which we don't have it doesn't exist but gulp is going to create the folder for us so you don't have to okay so let's save that and let's test it so our task name is sas so let's go and say gulp says hit enter all right you can see here no errors no nothing it's just saying lo you know started the sas task it's finished after this time we're good to go if you go back now to your editor you will see a new css folder let's open that folder there is a style.css which is the same name as this one and look at this normal css very cool huh gulp is helping us to do that for us now i need to create another task for the css because i want to then get all the css and minify the css so let's go back there we need the uglified css package so same thing they have here the install command line so let's copy let's clear all this all right so let's paste it and hit enter alright cool same thing now we have the uglify css installed and ready to use so let's go here and now we can actually use it just copy let's paste it here all right so as you can see it's kind of doing the same thing all over again when you have a new package i'm just gonna put this one down here just because i want it you don't have to do it like that but all right so right now is um the task is called css and it's gonna take the file from this so let's change it it's gonna be inside our css folder and i'm gonna do the same thing every file with a css format is gonna um is gonna take it and uglify it which is another word for minified and we have some options here that i'm gonna explain to you what they do so for example max line length is like every um 80 characters i want a new line which i don't want to but i'm going to leave it like that so we can see how it looks and it's going to save it on a folder named dist i'm going to leave it like that this can be whatever you want really i'm going to leave it like that i'm going to save this and let's run this task let's do it let's do gulp css hit enter all right cool everything seems to work and now you'll notice that we have a new dist folder let's open that we have a style.css here and there you can now you now we can see that is and minified css file this is a good file that we can use on our production like this is what you're gonna you're gonna upload to your server it's gonna be very fast but this is what i don't like about the max length option thing is creating new lines for us so i'm just gonna remove that save it again i'm gonna run gulp css let's see if it change this is what i'm looking for so now we have only one line of code with all the css in that line of code and this is perfect this is what i like and now this is what i'm using on my website as you can see is getting from the dist folder style css and that's what i'm using so let's see if this is working right now all right so it's reading the css just fine everything looks looks great so let's close this and this we don't need it now all right but the thing is that now you need to go there and kind of use gold sass or gold css every time you want to do it and that's not what i want right you want everything to be automatically my goal is every time i change something in my sas file and hit save everything will change automatically i don't have to go here and type the task so let's go to gulpfile.js and let's add some stuff so i'm going to get a new task gulp dot task and this is gonna be called whatever i want but i'm gonna call it run and it's gonna run my sas task and my css task right that's cool but now i wanna go a little bit further so i'm gonna write another task and this one is gonna be called watch and we're going to run a function for this one all right and this is the one that i like this is the one that is going to do everything for you automatically without touching the command line okay so we're going to do gulp watch and the files that we want to watch every time every every time i change my sas file so let's go and sass if i change any file with the sas is gonna run my sass sorry like this okay same thing with css so if my css changes i want to go so let's go to the folder oops css same thing every single css that i have there is gonna run my css task all right so that's watch now i'm gonna create a task and it's going to be the default task so let's go there default now i'm gonna do i'm gonna run my run task and my watch task so when i say um default is gulp so if i if i write gulp is gonna give you an error right now because we don't have it yet but we created so let's save this file and now let's see if it works so let's go gulp oops sorry sorry sorry sorry we need a coma after the task name coma save it again let's clear this gulp and there you go so everything runs and now it's kind of a washing or file so gulp is kind of um watching you and if you make a change it will go again and run everything again all right if you want to get out of here of this watching state you just need to um hit ctrl c and you will see that we go like back to normal all right but that's not what what i want so gold alright cool so let's go to the sas all right make sure you're watching this because i want to know if it changed so make sure you're watching this let's go to the sas file let's change i don't know the font size for example let's save it all right let's reload the page and it's changing so every time i save my sash file is compiling my file is doing all this compiling my file to css is getting my css and minifying my css and then it's washing our files every time we do this so it's kind of an automated workflow and this is only the basics okay this is very simple right now this can be very very complicated you can save your file it can do a ton of things you can do everything with javascript for example this is only css we can um we can run prefixes we can do javascript minify too we can do babel so you can um you can do a ton of things with gulp this is only the basics with with a sass file compile and stuff like that so i hope you like this that's it
