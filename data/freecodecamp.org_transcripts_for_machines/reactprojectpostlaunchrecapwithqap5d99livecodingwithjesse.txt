hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today i want to do a recap of the project that we just launched and go over like how we did it the decisions that we made why we made them uh and then talk a little bit about the the next steps uh for for what's gonna happen i also have some nice analytics to share with you just about you know how well the site's doing and um so we're not really gonna do a lot of coding right now um it's gonna be more like just kind of overview also um you know feel free to ask questions uh definitely open to questions and also i want to give you a little update on like my situation uh for work and everything because there's gonna be some changes coming up uh so that's the plan for today uh sorry for the short notice on the stream too i i was just really busy and didn't um i wanted to stream but i didn't get it scheduled early enough so there maybe had been some issues with notifications not being received um but hopefully looks like you know there's a lot of you in the in the stream so i'm hoping that everything works with the notifications okay so first uh let me explain uh some of the the changes right i don't want to leave anybody in suspense right so uh i am most likely uh going to be leaving my position right now uh at the university and finding employment somewhere else so if you follow me on social media you probably already know this uh i've i've received already uh thankfully us a lot of uh not not direct offers but a lot of invitations to apply uh to places and offers from people to um to recommend me so i'm very grateful for that and thank you so much to everyone who who retweeted my tweet or shared it on on instagram or on linkedin uh thank you so much for that uh the the response and the reach that that got is just amazing and um i like i'm very very grateful thank you thank you so much for that so uh i don't know where i'll be at and i'm not sure how quickly i'll be i'll be leaving here so for now um i i guess i'll still be working on this project and i'm still gonna do my stream so i'm gonna i'm gonna keep doing my stream and then depending on what position i get we'll just have to see i'd love to keep doing the stream it may be that i won't be able to stream my everyday work but i'll have to stream the side project and it may be you know maybe the stream has to has to move to like a saturday or maybe it's going to be in the evenings instead of in the morning so um so there are probably going to be some changes to the stream but not just yet out um i'll still be streaming although uh next week i may not be able to stream that much because i will be at uh react training in washington dc so i'm excited about that to learn some new stuff um so just to give you a little heads up too about why why this is happening um so as you all most of you know who have watched the stream this project we've been working on since january has launched it would launch like two to three weeks ago but if you go to the website now if you go to the url you'll see the old website so uh unfortunately is somebody higher up in the organization for some reason unknown to me didn't like the website and instructed the it department to change it back to the old website and this was all without consulting me so at this point i don't know what the problem was i have some guesses but that's just based on stuff i've heard from other people so i don't know why the site was taken down i've gotten no attempt to contact me to explain anything or to ask me to change anything as we'll see in a second the site was definitely meeting the requirements and surpassing them it was based on the analytics it was already hitting our goals for what we wanted the site to do and as far this this person that made the call didn't even look at the analytics um i from from everything i understand about it the call was made without without that so um and this person's actually somewhat new to the organization and hasn't even been involved in the process so this is pretty like kind of disturbing to me um and so i mean that was okay that was definitely a hit to the ego but what really pushed me over the edge is just the way it all happened uh from what i understand um you know the people who did actually get to talk to this person uh say he was he was not very nice about the whole thing um treated treated people in a way that no one should be treated right so given that i just don't feel comfortable being around if you know one of the main people in charge is is treating people like that um so what i'll do is i'm going to try to make sure that people know about it um hopefully somebody will do something about it but you know at the end of the day it's it's not an environment that i want to be in so while i'm still here i'm going to do whatever i can to try to make it better for the people that are staying um but then i you know i gotta get out it's uh so like you know personally you know i struggle with depression anxiety and things so i'm i was just been not feeling very good the last couple of days i'm pretty calm now i actually have a really bad headache so when i get anxiety usually that caffeine makes it worse so i totally cut caffeine out yesterday and i've been getting these headaches i think maybe i was drinking too much caffeine and now i'm going through withdrawal so my head hurts so bad right now but i know based on my past experience situations like this could make me have a panic attack so i don't want to chance that so i'm just trying to be as as calm as i can and just keep doing what i'm doing you know talking to people uh about new job opportunities and you know thinking about okay how do i want to work my resume you know i'm thinking about maybe redoing my personal website since i haven't touched it in years uh you know been talking with my wife about what we want to do and been thinking about ways to just address the situation in the most professional way possible without the way i see there are several options like i could freak out and be very unprofessional about this or i could just try to hide and i don't want to do either right i don't want to hide because i don't want this to happen to other people in the organization and i don't want to freak out because that'll probably make things worse so i'm trying to find a middle ground to get the word out in a very logical way um to the people that need to know um and and make a good case uh for for not only this site but for um you know for making sure that people are treated with respect uh so yeah so i um anyway and i it's it was just one person right so this is not like a huge organizational thing um you know i generally over my three years here you know 99 of people have been very friendly you know just even over the top like beyond what you'd expect people to be so this is a new individual here unfortunately they have a lot of authority so i don't i don't really know this person i haven't even gotten a chance to know them so i'm not i'm not even sure what to think about it you know um other than it shouldn't it shouldn't no one should ever treat another person like that okay so let's get on to the site is some happier stuff i'm actually still like i'm really proud of this site despite what this other person may think like objectively speaking we did a good job with this site uh the the technology is sound it's you know somewhat cutting edge um i think uh we accomplished what our goals were right so if someone wanted to disagree with what the goals were in the first place you know that's understandable they could do that but in terms of does this website meet the goals does it does it me does it fulfill the requirements of the project i think most definitely it does um so let's check out the analytics first and let me give you if you're not sure what website i'm talking about this is the one that we built i still have it up at a um at a test link that i had running anyway so i never took down the tesling and uh i just want to say hi i see a lot of activity in the chat so let me um let me switch up to this screen you can see it for a second and i just want to say hello to everyone um so hey um i see there are some questions i'll get to some of the the more like technical questions in a second but i want to answer any questions that have to do with what we just talked about first um carl asked if i'd still on my live stream no matter what i do want to try as hard as i can to keep doing this live stream as long as you all think that it's valuable to you and to the community i will i want to keep doing it yeah steven says so no feedback no mockup changes what the heck yeah i mean that's it's it's a it's an unprecedented situation i've never had this happen before you know uh for someone to be dissatisfied with with your work but then give absolutely no feedback um mario says thank you for being open and saying uh as it is you you're welcome i yeah i mean i just especially for you all that have been with me here through this project for so long i i want you all to know what's really going on you know um when i say this even though this is live and anybody could watch it like it doesn't feel like i'm just announcing this to the public right like we've all been together many of us for you know well over a year working on projects you know so you're you know we have a community here you know we have a team here so you all deserve to know why the work that you some of you have actually contributed code and many of you contributed ideas so this is all very much our work why it's not there anymore and it says that person acts very mature we are supporting you in your decision thank you thank you so much i appreciate it okay all right so let's let's check out then um some of the analytics and then maybe um we'll see what it looks like in terms of questions in there maybe go over some stuff so i'm gonna make this as big as i can but here's the analytics that i i was impressed i was honestly surprised at how good some of these numbers were i mean i know it's one thing to to have an idea and a plan and and no you know have a good idea that it will work and it's another thing to actually see the results so i'm gonna go over these really quick uh especially for those of you who are just listening and can't read this i took the analytics and i actually removed steubenville the city that the university is in from the results right because that uh the target audience is not people already on campus and most of our students don't actually come from steubenville so we remove stevenville completely so i compared uh the same time period in 2017 to the time period the website was live because we're trying to track like applications and that's very cyclical so the only way to be fair about it is the same time period in in that same year right so we had 67 decrease in page load times right which was expected right we knew it was going to be a lot faster home page even greater decrease uh the next number i think is really important so we're targeting prospective students right we want them to come to our website want them to apply to learn more about this university so google analytics doesn't let you it doesn't show you data specifically about people under 25 but you can tell because if you just take the total number of visits minus all the visits from the age groups they do give you data from which starts at 25 and goes up to however high somebody can live to then we can get a better idea of okay well the group that's left over is younger than 25 they are most likely majority made up of people who um are in that group that age group of our target audience so anyway we have a 48 increase in people visiting our site from that from that age group which is great uh because that's what we were we had in mind the entire time uh we had an increase in visits to the application uh of seven percent increase which is a really nice a nice increase i need to get the data on the inquiry form too i forgot to do that but that's also an important form that we're trying to drive people to um we actually had a big increase in the time spent on the home page which is interesting because the old homepage was huge it took very long a long time to load partly because there's so much content i mean very small text images videos everywhere and you could scroll for three days through it it was long you can see it now at the main website it you know the old website is back online now but the interesting thing is we got rid of all that and had a very minimal simplistic home page and we had an increase of people's of the time spent on the home page by 48 and you know from just looking at that face value kind of trying to figure out why you know i think the busyness of the old homepage was a turn off it was overwhelming and when we actually broke it down and only showed people some very important facts they they stayed and they read those so there may be other ways to interpret that but that seems like a pretty good way um to kind of view that statistic to me and it's almost counterintuitive right we we gave them less content and then they ended up spending more time on the page um also i'm not going to go through every department but you like one of the big things we wanted to do is show that we have good academic programs here where we are a catholic school and we have a wellknown reputation for being catholic so based on our market research we already know that that people don't doubt that but what people doubt is our academics they don't know if we're actually good academically so there are students that would like to come here because they're catholic students and they they want to be here but they're not sure they'll get a good education here so what we were trying to do is appeal to those students by showcasing our academic programs right on the home page and you know we succeeded in bringing in more people so you could see the masters in theology had a bit of an increase some of these like theology program had a 275 percent increase in traffic to that page so you can see just some of the other programs here um some really big numbers here uh huge increases so you know based on these analytics i think we definitely succeeded in in our goals uh for this website right and and this was just really the first phase i mean you all know there are so many ideas for what we wanted to do that are going to come later on or were going to come later on probably not now um so really this is comparing a site that had already gone through a whole year development from an old agency working on it and talking about the old site and then years of development after that comparing it to a site that just came out and you know basically we've done just kind of me and you all have done for less than a year launched it and had very little time to make any improvements and we still had these kind of numbers i mean i to me i think that's that's very impressive i'm proud of it i think you all should be proud of it because you're a big part of it so no matter what happens with this site um this is a successful site and the data shows it um you you can't you can't argue the the numbers um so anyway i wanted to share that with you because i think that's it's just so impressive and um you know all the thought that we put into this site and uh you know everything uh it it paid off okay let me i guess i don't need to show anything right now let's just put this in the background because we're just gonna talk about stuff for a little bit so uh i'm going to take a little bit of time right now to answer some of the questions that you have and then we're going to dive into some of the technology just to refresh your mind in case you haven't been watching these streams this was built with react with next js we're using apollo graphql we use node wordpress for the content management system with a wp graphql plugin we have algolia now for search which i did finish and implemented so you can try out the search now it's way faster we're using google cloud platform to host most of this cloud sql um and what do we have cloud sql the the cloud storage bucket uh and we're using app engine to host the react app we're using digitalocean uh for the wordpress application or the wordpress installation so all those technologies went into this so if you have questions about any of those technologies why we use them or anything feel free to put them in there now i can go into a lot more detail about it hey harshit's here uh and we'll only be around here for a few minutes says now all we need is a good svg loader for the loading screen yeah for sure i am i thought about that the other night um you know sometimes you just think about a project at nighttime you're not even working on it it just occurred to me like we still have the words loading come up when you're looking like we never actually put a real loader in there and we did on the on the search page so i thought well at the very least we can just grab what we did on the search page and then put that in for the loader on all the other pages in place of the words loading so that'll probably be on the list but once again i don't really know how much more work i'll be doing on this unfortunately because you know we still had a lot of good things that could have been done so let me i'm going to scroll up and answer some questions here uh sedek said is it possible to build a kickstarter clone with react.js oh most definitely yeah uh you can definitely do that in react um i i think probably any site on the internet could be redone in in react because it's it's javascript in html and css which is what everything's built out of um it doesn't even matter what the back end is really so you could you could remake really anything you know any ui you know whatever and react components romani says how to make a big web app with react um i mean if you're going to make something a big one it's i you can definitely do it with react i would just if it's going to be really large structure is important um so in that case i would most definitely think about reusability of your components so like your actual code base can remain small and easy to work with uh sometimes in smaller projects and i know we've done it and we've done it in this project sometimes is we'll say ah you know what we could really refactor this and reuse it but let's just get this done quick and do it and then you may or may not ever go back and redo that now if the project starts to grow and grow and grow that could really make things difficult to navigate and your project could just balloon and your code base gets huge so i would be more care if you know right above the bat it's gonna be a very big project then you should be more careful about um things like that like how are you gonna handle that structure and things like that and make sure that that's all planned out so that you don't have those moments where you just say ah you know we could do it like this but it'll be faster to do this you know it you can get away with that when it's not that large but you on a large application it could down the road uh not be good for you so if you have any that's kind of really like a large topic so you have any specific questions you know please let me know uh diy coder says the work is really good appreciate this hard work but using react for making website is this overkill or is this the way to do it uh yeah i mean you could say this is overkill we definitely you know we could have built this website using something else right uh you could i would say this though like i would i have no idea how i would have worked out all the routing for this if we were doing this in let's say just plain javascript and i had to do like i don't know i used like jquery for my to do custom routing it would have been insane it's already insane using you know react uh state management would have been a huge problem so uh this website in particular we had so much content coming over like it let's just say for instance i try to do it in wordpress that also would have been a huge thing uh in terms of making sure all the urls work right it would have been it i think it would have been very challenging and difficult to do this in in other in other ways so in this particular case even though it's just a website being able to use react in the whole react ecosystem helped me a lot but you're right normally for a website react is potentially overkill although to be honest with you if you use create react app to start up a website really quickly um it's it's really easy to build out a site with react um you know potentially even easier than if you were to just do a straight html css than other javascript site okay now it depends like if you're not used to react of course react is going to be really difficult but you know it's it's so the barrier to entry for react is so low now and that's a good thing uh that you know it it doesn't feel like overkill right to build anything in react so um yeah so i would yeah i would say for a regular website it potentially could be overkill but it's not like it's not the end of the world right if you're gonna um uh do something in uh and react at least that's that's the way i feel right it's um it all depends on your project what the resources are how much time you're going to take and what your level of ability is with it right then i'm sorry if i'm not as with it as i normally am it's just my headache is i try to take some painkillers my headache is not getting better at all uh limbaugh says i'm new here thanks in advance for sharing i'm in need of inspiration to study on oh well thank you so much for watching and welcome and um yeah for inspiration i would just say i want to say like keep at it keep getting better every day you'll be amazed at how far you've come in a month you know in in a year you'll look back and it it'll be it'll be like wow i you know like i i couldn't do i couldn't even think about doing what i'm doing now a year ago you know you you'll hit that moment and it feels really good all right and oops says which is better angular or react it definitely def oh um someone wants the old website link i'm gonna type it in right now okay so the old website which is now live in place of this one i just linked here uh so you can check out the old website it may take a while to load all right okay so the question was angular vs react it all depends on your situation on your project uh on what you're good with you can build really awesome things or really terrible things with either one so the the way to go is just look at the strengths and weaknesses of react and angular and look at what you need to do for your project and the strengths and weaknesses you have or your team has and then you pick which which you have to pick so it's it's not a an answer that you can give a blanket answer over everything right uh it definitely depends on specifics hopefully that makes sense i know it doesn't help it's easier if you can just have a this is the best thing go with it but that's not really how this this works um limbaugh says trying to understand why next js is needed okay the reason we went with next.js is for serverside rendering okay so if you're not familiar with nexjs uh it's it works with react right so you you run next js it builds out the basics bare bones of all your react project it handles your webpack config and it gives you a basic like file structure and it handles routing for you in this case we have custom routing but normally it handles the routing for you but what it does that is really awesome is serverside rendering by default why do we need serverside rendering because search engines won't be able to see your content right so they won't stick around long enough to wait to make the api call to get the data back and display it on the page right all click client side but when you render on the server what gets sent to the search engines when they come to your site and anybody else who comes to your site for they get html html css right all there and then after that what next will do is offer clientside routing so you really get the best of both worlds you get that serverside routing for that really fast initial load time and the um the ability for search engines to see your content and then after that you get that speed of it it actually prefetches content so that when a user clicks on a link sometimes they actually have instantaneous load so zero second load time because the data is already there so really awesome uh it definitely helps out right i i would not want to have to handle all the stuff that it does in the background on my own so they do a great job it's it's updated so frequently and it's very very reliable uh zubair says is this project going to be an app react native expo app well it's it's a progressive web app um so that's what we ended up building uh max says is python's still a good idea to learn yeah absolutely there's a lot of good work in um machine learning happening with python as far as i know uh so it depends on what you're into which you want to work with but you know python is definitely worthwhile uh marcio says hey jesse thank you for doing this you're welcome uh great value uh question how do i know that i'm ready to start learning a framework from your perspective of course if you have a good understanding of html css and at least basic javascript then i would say go ahead and learn the framework especially if there's a project that you want to use it with you think it would be beneficial um it can definitely help it could help you make some good stuff you know faster than you you would otherwise be able to um if there's a framework that a you know would look really good on your resume then that's you know that's a great bonus to to be able to have that on there if you've worked with it so just make sure though that you keep up your skills so as you're using this framework try not to get locked in too much depending on the framework it's it's easier harder to do that but make sure your your vanilla javascript skills still improve right your css html is still improved so as long as you're doing that and not really locking yourself in i think you're fine of course if you want to lock yourself in you know go ahead and do it but it does it may make it a bit harder down the road if that particular framework falls out of fashion uh it may make it harder to switch if you don't keep up with some of the other stuff hopefully it answered your question uh it says harsha by the way franciscan.edu going to the old site for me uh is it removed maybe i missed something at the beginning yeah yeah okay let me paste this so this is harsha you did miss something so uh if you want to at some point if you have time go back and watch the first couple of minutes um but basically the short story is uh the old website is back up and the new website that we made has been taken down but you can still see it at that the link that i just pasted in michael cruz says i want to watch live but i really want to know what's happened since yesterday so you go back can you go back and rewind and just watch the first 10 minutes and then come back you watch it on double speed and you'll catch up i guess okay uh rush rushikesh sorry if i'm mispronouncing this uh but they say i'm just a beginner in web development uh before react what should i learn or clear my basics yeah uh html css javascript focus on those if you're a beginner and um and and you'll be fine with that and then whenever you need to use a framework and you start working on more complex things when a framework will really help you then jump into that framework phoenix says hey jesse what's up congratulations i guess i can say that now right also i saw your instagram status uh was this a contract project no um so i explain a lot of it in more detail in the first 10 minutes of the stream but just you know long story short i will be i'm going to leave my position you know i'm most likely going to leave my position here at the university and find another job so if you want to know why that's happening watch the first 10 minutes of this video let's see uh zhang zhao i'm not sure i pronounced that apologies um it says i'm currently only comfortable with html css and javascript for the front end part how do i get the big picture when it comes to web development like how does the front end talk to the back end um yeah i would say you know probably look up some tutorials and courses if you go through the free code camp lessons at some point it transitions into that you know after you learn a lot of the front end stuff so that'll give you a good idea about how that that part works yeah so i mean you don't have to go through everything but if you just kind of skip to that part and kind of look over what's going on that may give you a good idea about what to focus in on more you know to be able to find some videos or um you know tutorials about it uh zooper says what database are you using my sql wordpress api yeah so we have my sequel and we're using the rest api and actually are we even using that anymore i think we're all graphql now uh we did use the rest api for search but now we switch to algolia for search so now i think we're using graphql with wordpress so we use the plugin called wp graphql to be able to use graphql with it michael creo says there's no such thing as just the website yeah it's always more it's really hot in my office so i'm going to turn my fan on low so if it's too noisy let me know but it's like it's insanely hot so i just need to need a little fan there it says swan says hey jesse why have you chose react instead of polymer or vue.js for example okay really good question um so let's see i don't know very much at all about polymer so it wasn't even really on my radar as a possibility i knew a little bit about vue but i had never used it before on uh on a project and when we first started working on this project the timeline was very condensed we ended up getting a very big extension on the timeline but you know a lot of the reasons for that are determined by people you know higher up above me in the organization so uh when we initially started i needed to go with something that i already knew and we had already built several things in react we already had a lot of code that i could knew i could reuse so that's why we ended up going with react had i had all the time in the world to learn and try something else i'm not sure if i would have gone with react i think it definitely worked in this situation so i'm not saying react was the absolute best way to go for this but given the constraints of the project it was the way to go uh for us for this for this project limbaugh says what you just said there helps me a lot oh awesome really glad i could help um nobody says you may not remember me but i do remember you uh you may not remember me but last year i used to pop on these streams and uh you inspired me to take uh programming what a year now i am i'm now a semi software engineer working in a real react project oh awesome i'm so glad you came back and told me that and i i do i remember i remember um i remember the name at least of you coming in here and talking so um that's so cool i love it whenever i hear things like that so that's really awesome if if you get a chance pop back in sometime and you know let me know how your project's going uh nasar says how are you uh i'm okay i'm okay i've been better a lot of stuff going on right now you could watch the first 10 minutes of this video uh if you want to know more about what's happening um but like right now i have a really really bad headache it just keeps getting worse so um but other than that i guess i can't complain i got a great wife and four healthy children and so i shouldn't complain you know it could be a lot worse uh diy coder says yes component reuse is a huge plus and routing also yeah for sure definitely agree with that harshit says algolia search for now it is gonna be expensive um let's see i lost my place it's gonna be expensive monetary costs there yeah uh so right now i'm just on the essentials plan so the lowest paid plan and since the site's not live i it's not going to be a big deal for now but yeah i for the time that it was live i was trying to monitor it sorry oh um i lost my train of thought i'm really sorry oh when i did when the site was live uh i had my dashboard for um algolia up all the time on all my computers so i always knew it was happening lisa he says feel better thank you i appreciate it a mod learns code says hi there have a nice day everyone hey how's it going thanks i hope you have a nice day as well phoenix says also since the time i started working on my blog site i have learned i've had learning i've had a ton of learning uh and the things that can go wrong are endless also it's now that i realize how important good a good documentation is yeah yeah documentation is good i i often slack on the documentation myself um but that's a good point limbaugh says wow awesome i really needed this uh cool i'm glad i'm glad you like this carabbo says the old site looks dated it it does it really does um it was very surprising to me when they switched back because it was pretty much unanimous from everybody i talked to that they did not like the old site so um and you know it was pretty much the consensus that like anything would be an improvement as long as it was faster um so yeah i was i was very surprised by it ours it says i just remember did you enable uh material ui css minification before prod uh command you in the page and check if not that will speed the page up by another five percent oh okay um that is a good tip i don't even remember i don't recall ever doing that let's see let's see our sources styles oh no that's not it no it's not i'm wondering like where are bundled styles coming from i don't think it's this no that's not it this is our just tiny bit of css which actually i didn't minify that either anyway i don't know how to check that out but that's good and see that's the thing too like the site was very fast and we hadn't we've done almost nothing to optimize the speed right like even the images aren't optimized we didn't run them through uh image compression or anything like that it was just so it was fast so all that stuff was gonna come later um but you know shaving so much time off that load time by switching the site was was worth it even if it wasn't completely as 100 optimized as it could be it was still really good uh i'm online learning code said i've heard about koa js can you explain the purpose of this technology briefly thanks potatoes i don't really know very much at all about koa so uh i am sorry about that but i i don't know enough to uh to give a good explanation if anybody else knows anything about koa please uh let me know roland says what is react i don't have any idea of this react is a javascript library for building uh web apps and you can build other things with it too yeah that's pretty it's like the basic concept of react um so yeah so it helps you to build uh to build websites and web apps and it it's very helpful with things like state management harshed says oh okay it says cola js server side framework built by the same people working on express uh jesse might not know about it because he mostly does front end you're absolutely right uh co is used for making performant apis okay cool thanks harshit matt desja says good morning all good morning thank you for uh for watching and stuff and in the live chat limbaugh says game says is access fus part of the same app or completely separate app it is completely separate um so it's actually run by an entirely different company different servers everything i don't have access to it although i was able to send a style sheet to this company and have them upload it so i was able to adjust the styles a bit make it a little bit more like material design style and but that was that was about it is it's pretty limited matt justice says uh best of luck in your transition jesse thank you so much i appreciate it uh roland says i'm curious about react nodes something like that even though i don't know uh any of those yeah it's uh react is a javascript library to build things like maybe like on on the client side like front end stuff node is using javascript on the back end so server side javascript a ish says graphql so uh graphql it's uh query language right so normally if you wanted to get well there's several ways to get data right but one way to get data um to your your front end is to use an api right and and the standard right now is kind of like rest apis um it's like a method of creating an api and getting data from it but the latest thing is graphql and the main difference is with a rest api you prebuild these these api endpoints and when you send a request to the endpoint you will get back a certain amount of data in a certain structure um based on what was already you know premade for that endpoint to give you in graphql when you send the request you tell graphql exactly what data you want and it sends you back just that data right no more no less so you uh you can end up making less api calls because right you don't have to hit multiple endpoints to get all the data you want and then the total amount of data that gets transferred is less because you just get what you want so um it is in that respect graphql was most definitely you know better um than a rest api in terms of how you build it on the back end i don't know enough about that to really know the pros and cons of it all but that's kind of i guess the the most concise way i can put uh you know what is graphql what is the difference between graphql and a rest api roland says where can i learn php um a lot of places i guess uh maybe if you're really new um try out uh like codecademy they have these like interactive courses uh i've done some of their courses before i almost positive they have a php course so i would check that out first michael says okay i'll watch later from the beginning just don't burn any bridges that you might need later it's always darkest before the dawn that is good advice i appreciate that uh thanks michael mattheson says oh feel better jesse i hope so and thanks for saying that uh limbaugh says health and long life to you all thank you thank you and you too um john f says how did free code cam contact you about streaming here um i started doing live streaming on my own channel and i did a few live streams and i i knew that i didn't really know what i was doing so i posted in the free code camp forum a link to my live streams and i asked if anybody would be able to give me advice on how to do a better job and beau karns who does a ton of awesome javascript tutorial videos for free code camp contacted me and asked if i'd be interested in live coding for free code camp uh and then shortly afterwards i also talked to quincy who's the head of free code camp and then i just i started doing live streams and they went well uh people watched them you know quincy and bo like them so here i am i still still doing the streams let's see mark marcio says thank you thanks for answering my questions i hope you keep doing this kind of live question answer take some advil and rest uh thanks thank you for that advice i think i i probably will just go home after the stream and and relax a little bit nobody says yes i'll pop back more often i can now start to understand what was going on unlike last year thank you all right cool very cool um stephen says hey jesse i twitter message you austin texas there's a ton of react jobs available uh indeed you ship rooster teeth etc all here oh really cool thank you so much um jennings al says hope you feel better if you have time exercise yeah that's true i didn't get my my regular workout in today or yesterday uh so i i need to work out like today um or else i'm gonna it's definitely gonna impact my mental health if i if i quit with my workouts um aish says is routing there in both react and node.js yes yes so we have both server side and clientside routing stephen says plus pay says plus pay is way higher in austin yeah that's for sure well one thing is i'm almost guaranteed to be paid more at a new position than i am paid here higher education uh doesn't neces especially at a nonprofit institution doesn't really pay as well as other other industries limbaugh says is there a video where you talk much about price to maintain an app this size uh yeah so an app like this right now and while it was live i believe we were spending maybe like 500 a month on all the hosting and everything that goes with that and that 500 it might have been a little bit overkill because i didn't want the site to go down or slow up so it potentially after the site had been live for a while we could check the analytics and finetune things we might have been able to get that cost down a little bit more but that cost includes a server a droplet on digitalocean um cloud sql database and google cloud platform also on google cloud platform app engine instances and storage buckets and then included with that cost is also the cost of the algolia search service there are a few other things we want i wanted to add in that would have cost more so i wanted to add in sentry for error tracking and i also wanted to add a cdn so those would have brought the price up a bit more maybe another 100 bucks or so maybe 200 depending on the traffic steven says g fuel coffee i know i'm trying to cut out caffeine but man maybe i should just maybe i should just give in caffeine um chang yon song sorry about the name says hello it's 2 a.m in korea first time to watch a live and ask a question uh what would you recommend to study before learning react um says someone already asked sorry for answering this again uh yeah no problem it's uh i learned html css and javascript and that's that's all you need before you learn react irish it says just watch the first 10 minutes feel better thank you i appreciate it emiliano says hi jesse here from argentina greetings hey how's it going thanks for watching um shadrach says greetings from nigeria um let's say uh ch changgyon says uh thanks actually i'm studying javascript i was just wondering if there's more yeah no javascript's good you know and then you should be able to jump into react it'll take a little time to get used to it but if you're solid with javascript then you know go ahead and jump in um let's see five i'm not sure how to pronounce this um but anyways which frame shirt framework should i use for back end um i don't know i mean i like express would you consider expressive framework i'm not really sure what to call it but i i usually use node and express i but i mean it really just depends on like a lot of factors for what you're trying to do um which course is better today's generation i'm not exactly sure what you're asking so maybe clarify that a little bit please and i can i can answer um harsh it's saying click view source of course why wouldn't i remember a view source because i only use view source when i accidentally click it when i'm trying to hit inspect and yeah it looks like it's not even minified well that's awesome i'm actually really happy about that because that means we can make this even faster cool phoenix says i would like this opportunity to thank you for all these streams uh that that you did i stumbled on this on my worst times and i have been better and hooked ever since oh thank you for saying that i'm i'm so glad that that this stream is has helped you out and um and thanks for being here i know you you know you contribute a lot to the chat and things i really appreciate that swan says first thanks for answering my question i watched the part where you explained why you quit be strong man you you're amazing i hope you know it uh that guy's just allergic to intellect good luck yeah i actually didn't i didn't quit yet so like i'm in my office right now so i'm gonna be here for a little while longer so i have no idea how much longer it just it depends i guess on when i find something else and and what hap i don't think that i'm gonna get fired over anything um but yeah so i don't know exactly how long i'll be here but i haven't exactly quit yet but it's not it's not a secret that i'm looking for other employment the head of my department knows um there's actually other people the university that are helping me look for for new work so it's i i'm okay talking about it phoenix says you are also one of the major reasons that i went ahead and loved development the way you just dive into new tech framework and then make things work is amazing thanks i really appreciate that they don't always work but sometimes you try things out it doesn't work but yeah it's it's fun i mean this work is awesome it's so fun you get to try new things all the time and even if it doesn't work like it's still fun and you learn something right and uh and a lot of times it does work and it's really awesome um i want to learn css3 to a dope level from where should i learn it um hey well i mean you could it depends on where you're at right now if you're just starting out check out the free code cam lessons if you're a little bit more advanced then i don't really know there's probably some some good css books um videos uh i don't know if there's online tutorials advanced css hmm i'm not exactly sure if anybody has any that if you know of any really advanced css tutorials please let us know in the chat or in the comments if you're watching this later um donchi says hey jesse what do you think about the python framework django for web development thank you in advance keep up the good work i don't know very much at all about django i've heard of it and that's about it so apologies for that i just uh i i just don't know enough to give you a good answer limbaugh says 500 ouch thanks to the uh detailed answer yeah i mean 500 um is a i would say not that much at all for a larger organization i mean like the university employs like four or five hundred people you know so for our organization that size five hundred dollars a month is not not really that much um you know we probably spend more than that on water electricity internet like pretty much every other thing that we have i'm really sorry i'm having trouble pronouncing this why are you sorry uh says hey jesse i'm experienced with react js node.js and mongodb how do i come up with ideas for side projects that have potential to generate income and future and become my own startup um i don't know that's that's if if i knew a really good answer to that question then i'd probably do it too um but yeah i mean i would say if you're looking for good ideas of things that people actually want to use so you can make money from just uh ask people around you like what what do you wish you could do like what what things in your life do you wish could be automated or enhanced or somehow with you know something on your phone or whatever right um think about what you do every day like is there something you could build that would help you odds are if you build something and it helps you it'll probably help other people so think that's a good place to start right and then if you build it nobody wants it well at least you build something cool that'll help you out right so you haven't lost everything right um bill corn says i came in late and just watched the beginning of the stream i'm so excited to hear that jesse uh that jesse is looking isn't looking for a job because he was fired jesse is awesome thank you thank you so much about yeah yeah i i was not fired i don't think i will end up being fired so it was not it was not fired so this is of of my own free will um matt duchess says vitamin b works better than caffeine yeah you're right actually i think i do have some vitamin b pills at home so maybe i'll just take that when i go home oh okay so then one of the names i couldn't pronounce is siddharth but it's it's written with uh like half in in numbers so okay i kind of thought it might be something like that but i was trying to limit how silly i sounded so i just didn't try it thank you for telling me though and if i've mispronounced anyone's name please let me know how to pronounce it and i'll do my best to remember that and pronounce it the right way every time uh himanshu says what to learn to start making websites html css and javascript that's what you need you learn those you'll be good and you can build you can build anything with that delay b says what back end should i learn with react there is no job with node.js and i don't want to do php um i don't know i mean if you can't find a job with node something what else do people use for backups like python um there's a whole area that uses like net framework with c sharp so i mean that you know maybe that would be my advice uh md says hello um daily at what time the classes begin and i want to learn from starting how can i learn uh you know what i the i'm assuming you're talking about these live streams you know we've been starting at such weird times so i can't really say it'd be nice if i get back on a normal schedule but right now just too many things are going on that i i can't stick to a certain time so unfortunately there is no set time right now shang xiao says many people use coding as an escape as a way to find another route in their life hope whoever is doing it finds passion and luck along the way yeah that's cool learning how to code definitely has helped a lot of people just you know have a totally different lifestyle a lot of times you know for the better lymbola says i strongly suggest jonas at udemy uh i took many before him and jonas advanced css course is the best that i found thank you so much for that recommendation so jonas has an advanced css course on udemy check that out um richaus says what are the prerequisites for learning react uh javascript for sure i mean html and css and javascript if you know those you're good to learn react siddhar says which languages are you comfortable with and how did you start your journey as a web developer um javascript i'm most comfortable with i know a little php and i've done a little bit with python before with c sharp um java c plus plus like i've done a little bit with a lot of stuff but i'm only really confident with javascript and somewhat maybe confident with php md bubba says please tell me i can contact with you i want to learn um you can find me on like twitter and i think i have a link to my twitter in the in the description uh that i don't really do like courses or anything like that so if you have any questions i'll do my best to help out but you know for right now i don't i'm not doing courses although that might be something that you know i might do at some point okay emiliano wants to know um what other css framework do i recommend um i mean i i use mostly material ui i like that if i'm not doing react i use materialize css sorry so i haven't really used a lot of other frameworks so i don't know that i can really give any good recommendations outside of those ones um says codeigniter or laravel um as far as i know code igniter is pretty outdated correct me if i'm wrong so i would probably go with laravel if i were you those are both uh for php uh manu says uh what should i learn before react uh javascript css html uh swan says why didn't you use uh serverless tech for your back end cloud functions firebase um yeah we i thought about that but uh you know it's something that i wasn't familiar enough with that i was confident in doing it in a project of this size you know in this this much importance you know um so the way we're doing it now you know it's for the most part we've tested out before so i felt more confident in that um mit says make some series of kali linux tutorial i don't i've never used kali linux so if i end up using it maybe i'll do a series on it julia says hello jesse uh should you use uh saga or redux thunk i have used thunk before i like it i have not used sagas before uh julia says uh what do you think about laravel is it a good to learn yeah if you're gonna learn a php framework i from what my limited knowledge about it i do recommend laravel i've heard good things about it shrey says i'm currently working with asp.net and microsoft sql server is the dotnet framework losing its significance what future do you imagine isn't storefront.net framework i don't really know i mean i'm not a huge fan of.net framework but i see a lot there's a lot of new stuff happening with it um even like microsoft is really kind of changing the way it it interacts with the developer community so you know i think it'll be around for a while just because of microsoft really um and there's so many companies that are already kind of entrenched in the whole net world it's not going anywhere anytime soon so if if it can be i think if the net world can be more integrated with the rest of like the javascript dev world and take advantage a lot of that stuff i i think it has a good shot at you know being relevant and being around you know for a long time so dar says can i get javascript tutorials at free code cam yeah there's a whole course on javascript on the freecodecam.org website but then also we have a ton of video tutorials as well on our youtube channel andrew says hey jesse site looks great i saw on instagram you're looking around for your opportunities i'm sure you'll be picked up in no time oh thank you i appreciate it um a man who asks what's the best procedure for learning react in a pro way online courses um how to turn off my music my headache's getting so terrible um uh so anything else we're doing a project in that but looking into documentation makes that kind of difficult um free codecamp has some react stuff now on freecodecam.org wow i need to like take a nap um yeah so i would check that out there's definitely a lot of good tutorial videos on react out there so that might be a little bit easier than trying to read the documentation says i'm mostly just fixing bugs at work small issues which arise out of changes such additions the code base is this what developers do in the us yeah but it depends some developers main job is fixing bugs maintenance other developers build new stuff and don't handle you know live you know products so it just kind of depends juggernaut says jesse if you could choose where you want to go what's your dream don't even know um i don't know i have to think about that uh yeah i guess it is like there's different parts to that so it's like right now like i always got to think about like my fame my wife and family you know it's not just like where do i want to go that would be awesome it's you know where could i go that would be the best for my kids that would have good schools and things like that so it's kind of a complicated question uh because i have to think about all those things so um yeah so i'm not exactly exactly sure i mean in terms of work though um i love working on cutting edge stuff and i i love working on things that that would actually help people um siddhartha says i'm learning javascript but i don't know where to implement that i mean i want to work on some projects um from where should i get one yep check out the free code camp curriculum because they'll have a lot of sample projects where you'll be able to use javascript on i would recommend that that's a good place to start uh is it would still be useful to learn jquery in 2018 um yeah you know what there's still a lot of companies that use jquery for their website so knowing jquery is still good um going forward i expect probably the use of jquery will go down because there are other things taking its place so i don't know what the outlook is like for the future but a lot of companies depending on how big they are and what the industry is like are very very slow to change things so there's still going to be jquery jobs around for a long time just because of that um mit says what should i do so that people know me hmm really sorry i just can't quit yawning so people know me in the it field this is what happens when you try to give up caffeine i guess yeah get involved um online like i mean as a developer like twitter is a huge thing so i don't know if it's the same with it stuff but yeah like get involved on twitter you know follow the people that are the like leaders in your field uh you know like retweet their stuff try to interact um that's probably that's a really good you know good way to go if you can like write articles like tutorials or you know do videos like i don't really write that much but i like to do the videos um you know volunteer to help people go to conferences uh when you go to conferences make sure you talk to as many people as you can so all those things will will help marlin says have you ever noticed jankiness when your background loads for the first time with react i get no lag when using the image tag but when i switch to background image it takes about two seconds to load yeah sometimes when you use background image you can have a little bit of jank so um try not to use it hold on let's say this hey all right thank you cool i just got handed a like a print brochure thing and so i can check it out see if i want to use any photos for the website and then they will get me the photos so that's kind of cool so my team here is very helpful like the other people in in this department um are super helpful uh sorry i was right in the middle i think oh the jankiness with the background image yeah so using a css background image uh definitely takes it it stresses out the browser more than using an image tag so you want to be careful with that don't use it like a bunch on one page try to make sure your image is optimized and if you have a ton of stuff going on on a page you maybe don't want to use it trying to do like parallax things like we're doing here right with our um i don't even remember what it's called in css now it's a property when you use a background image that that makes it do that so that can also cause some trouble so if you disable that you'll you'll have a much better time of it so if you notice let's say like that the image isn't showing up first it could be that like maybe you want to take that css and load it sooner right so if you have the css for that in a css file and it's waiting its turn to get loaded then it's going to take a while so what you can do you can make that background css be inline in the html and it'll load a lot more quickly or if you don't want to put it like right in the html tag you could just take it and put a style tag at the head of your document and put that above all the other things that you you want to load like all your files you're bringing in and that's kind of like a little trick to use for the stuff that's like users will see immediately i mean and then of course like the image size itself will definitely have an impact on how fast it loads too emiliano's coffee coffee coffee um trey says how is work like for trainee software developers in the us who are straight out of college in the first six months i honestly have no idea because that's not the route i went so i i've never i i've never seen it oh okay so uh i got a pronunciation here so wa wah weiru let me know if that's the right pronunciation thank you so much for for letting me know how to pronounce that um jesse says or andrew says jesse do companies use create react app in production i'm not sh i'm not sure i mean it's it's pretty commonly used but i couldn't tell you right now like of a specific company that does use it so i mean i i don't know i imagine yes but i definitely have to look that up i wouldn't want to say for sure without without checking uh siddhar says how's o'reilly's javascript book for learning javascript i want to have a handbook kind of thing for html css so that i can memorize them i don't know i haven't checked out that book so uh there are some good there's a javascript book called eloquent javascript that's really good and then there's a book series called you don't know js that also is very good so they're available online but you you can get them in print as well so check those out uh siddharth says what can i do to memorize html and css3 tags and attributes just use them right i've never attempted to memorize them like just use them and if you code every day with them you will remember them uh so that's i think is the the best way to go about memorization right because just look them up and you will remember them right the annoyance of having to look them up will force you to memorize them right it's so much better to do it that way than to try to like sit down and read a list of them right you may as well be actually getting coding done while you're memorizing hopefully that that makes sense it's just like the best way to learn a language is to actually speak it be immersed in it you know like a spoken language i think that's the same way with a computer language right just just use it and look up what you need to until you don't need to look it up anymore java oracle python which one do i have to learn uh for a job you can get a job with any of them it just depends on what you want to do so just figure out what you want to do and then do a little bit of research on what companies are using what language right and and then you know do a search see what how many jobs there are for that and that should kind of tell you phoenix says are you wearing red pants yeah i'm wearing red pants so i don't know if you can see i'm wearing yeah i'm wearing red pants so yeah they are if anybody is interested in wearing the same red pants as me you can find them they're bonobos is the brand and they're bonobos uh chinos i don't know what exactly the color isn't called or anything like that but they're nice pants they fit well uh andrew said oh andrew was talking to somebody else um juggernaut says jesse uh you want to continue web development or you're looking for other endeavors like systems games etc i'm thinking i'll probably just continue with like react development because that's most likely what i'll be able to get a job in but i'd definitely be open to other things like game development sounds fun uh anything that has to do with some like newer stuff uh like machine learning uh sounds really cool um you know like uh vr or ar sounds awesome to work with so i'm open to new opportunities i just am not sure that i have the skill set to get hired in those positions right now uh md baba says i want to learn machine learning how can i learn um try out udacity has some machine learning courses i think they have some free ones so see try those out because i i think they're pretty good and see if you like it if you really like it and you want to do their paid courses then those are available too julia says well i have to to know object oriented php in order to start learning laravel i don't know i don't know enough about laravel so sorry uh par says what is your view on google versus oracle um if you mean like the whole lawsuit that was going on between them i i think it's i side with google in that lawsuit so basically like google was using so oracle owns the language java google was using java in android's operating system and oracle sued them um claiming that i think like google owed them a bunch of money for using java when because they own java so it's kind of ridiculous like if we start saying that companies can own programming languages that's just crazy right it to me like if that's how oracle oracle is going to do this then you know people aren't going to use it anymore right it's so that's like probably an oversimplification of what's happening and i could be wrong so if i'm wrong correct me please but um i just think it sets a bad standard if you're going to allow oracle to kind of win that that case um manuswar says hi what are the languages i should go for if i want to become an ethical hacker as well as get into android development um java or or kotlin for android development and as a hacker like i mean you you just need whatever you're trying to hack you need to know how that works so um you would i would assume i'm i'm not a hacker so this is assumption so you know don't take it as the way to go but i would assume you would need to have more of a general knowledge of a lot of systems uh and then you would need to like seriously do your homework on the particular system you're about to hack uh siddharth says is there any direct use of c language and web development in web development not that i know of i've never come across it but it you know could be out there um what about c sharp yeah c sharp is used in like dot net framework stuff so i have come across that in for the back end in web development limbala says have you used react native and what do you think about it as uh as a newbie learning react i'm not sure if i should focus on progressive web apps with react or react native you learn react first unless for some reason you really need to make a mobile app um i like react native i i really like like building things with react native and i i hope that i can do more with it in the future so but i think if you're coming from knowing html and css and javascript trying to get into the react world it's an easier jump to learn regular react first than to go into react native because there's a few extra kind of things you have to think about when you're building for um for a mobile phone right to building an uh mobile app right so it it's a little bit easier uh if you're still doing things to the web and a lot of what you learn in react will help you to learn react native yeah uh lymbala says i'm focusing on mobile apps or small businesses yeah if you're focusing on mobile apps then then learn react native first because that's what you'll need i know progressive web apps can be downloaded on the home screen but a lot of people just don't get that yet and don't realize that that's a thing so probably you're going to have a better time of it and a better time selling your services to small businesses if you use a mobile app um so ron says can i go for the react without the node.js yeah for sure you don't have to use node.js for react great can be used with any type of backend we have another react versus angular question uh so i'm just gonna say it it just depends on your project there's there's no there's no quick answer for react versus angular marlon says thanks for the help jesse gonna try sorting this background jank out by the way how do you personally go about styling and react style components um i have used style components before but normally um just use like css and js sometimes i use normal style sheets sometimes i just do inline styles i do a variety of things i haven't decided on what i really like want to stick with yet siddhar says uh what are the steps to become a full stack web developer um you could either start with the front or the back end i started with front end so i'll go over that html javascript css um after that then then you start to learn more about backend stuff so if you already know javascript i recommend going with node learn about a little bit about node how to set up uh you know your your server your your basic routing maybe do like some handling of form data emails things like that in node um learn about apis how to build apis how to use apis like you know and and branch out from there right and i mean that's just the javascript ecosystem so there's a whole lot of other stuff if you want to get into other languages and i'm sure i mean i'm probably i'm leaving out a lot of stuff right so but that's just the basic route you take uh limbala says thanks so much for these uh so useful answers i will be checking out your 200 other videos here yeah if anybody ever manages to watch all of my videos please let me know because that would be i mean i've been around for all of them but that's a lot of content right in apologies because i'm sure i probably have some like weird annoying things that i do and and having to suffer through all those uh probably not the best um but balaji says is there any way to improve the speed access of websites much faster than regular scripts languages uh yeah there's there's definitely a lot you can do um you know one of the biggest things that i always do going in if people want me to improve speed is check the image sizes so many times it's that images are way too large you know they're only showing a tiny image but in reality the file is actually huge image compression could be even like you know what's being loaded and when is it being loaded um sometimes websites will have all this tracking stuff so you got your analytics and then you got your social media things that come in and they said way too much going on and don't realize how much it's it's impacting uh their site right if you use like some thirdparty things sometimes they're bringing in whole libraries like and you don't even realize like other versions of jquery and stuff just to do one tiny little thing so like all of those things can can definitely help out with speed you can set up like a cdn and that'll help the speed so there's a lot of uh quick things you can do that don't really take that much time but can have a huge impact on your site speed i think i did a video once where we try to take an old site and make it faster or like a couple of videos it may it'll be one of my early videos on free code camp or it may be one of my videos i did on my own channel uh before i started doing free code camp so i think there's a link to my channel in the description if you want to try to find it um i do have some some videos on there as well uh s sumits says what do you think about reason ml and reason reacts uh reason seems really cool when i went to react rally ken wheeler gave a talk about reason and that was the first time i really like learned anything about reason other than just hearing it and it seems really awesome i don't know enough about it to really give a good explanation of it um but it's something that i would be open to using in the future and i think it could help me write like better better code so i'm definitely i'm i'm a fan of it but a very new fan uh saran says do web development does web development involve algorithms and data structure in javascript not really a lot i mean algorithms and stuff like that you need to know for job interviews right but in reality like you don't use them very much at all in daytoday web development so if you're not great with them don't worry you can still be a good web developer without being great at algorithms siddhar says thanks a lot for your for the answers going to watch your javascript tutorials awesome yeah and check out like on this on this channel uh beau carnes does a ton of javascript tutorials that are awesome uh constantine says hey jesse how long did it take you to become a front end atlanta first shot so i was a freelancer for a while so maybe like three years before i got this fulltime job so like during that time it's not like i was always looking for jobs i was freelancing right so um but like i learned more and more as time progressed and i picked up more clients and try to do more challenging jobs so it was like a three year period of me slowly picking up new things but working while i was doing it getting basically getting paid to learn so i don't think it would always take it certainly wouldn't take three years for most people but because i was freelancing while i was doing it i wasn't really like actively looking for for fulltime um like a fulltime developer position siddhar says keep teaching us and uh balaji says thanks for your knowledge it is so useful oh i i appreciate you saying this um every says hi jesse just watch the first 10 minutes of the streaming i'm really sorry for what happened to you uh hashtag we are with you thank you so much i appreciate that um make tutorials on operating system programming it's hard to learn yeah i don't know anything about that so i can only make a tutorial on things i know about um soran says thanks for guiding us through live videos and always up to uh live with jesse uh nami says hello jesse you're a great teacher and i've learned a lot but still lost i need help with javascript and learning the codes and let me know i'm um i'm about to end the stream now but mammy you know get a hold of me on twitter or something you can always ask me a question on there as well man as far as how to get started in android development uh you could if you want to just do android and you don't want to do like react native um then you know try to find some android tutorials you're probably gonna end up using java or kotlin for that siddharth says what is franciscan uh franciscan if university of steubenville is the college that i currently work for uh saron says do you have experience with machine learning with javascript very very little experience like i've done some tutorials and watched videos on using brain js and tensorflow um js so i i have some ideas for stuff i want to build but i just haven't built anything yet uh ahmad says afternoon javascript which framework do you prefer reactor angular i prefer react but i don't have a problem with angular i just i just work with react so all right i'm going to end things now i've been streaming for a while and i think i've gotten so many messages i keep seeing my phone going off so i'm going to check these and hopefully if there's nothing like major that i need to do at work i'm going to i'm going to head home for the day and uh and relax a little bit tadar says you made the franciscan website yes i did so the website you see back here this is what we made um in live stream the whole process all right so i see a few more things coming up but i'm gonna i'm gonna have to cut the stream off it there's so many great questions i i really enjoy this but this this could probably keep going forever um but i i love all the questions i love all like the the interest and everything and i'm gonna try to do another stream you know when i can and uh hopefully after i do my react training next week i'll have a ton of new stuff to share with you about react so i'm super excited about that and i'll definitely let you know all the cool stuff that i learned if anybody happens to be in the dc area specifically in like um tyson's corner virginia around there uh let me know you know maybe we can hang out next week or something um and uh yeah so until next time have a wonderful day and thanks again
