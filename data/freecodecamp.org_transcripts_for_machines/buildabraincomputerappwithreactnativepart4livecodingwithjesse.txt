hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to keep working on our brain computer app we have all of our phase one functionality working but it doesn't look very good so we need to style it a little bit just make it look a little bit nicer it doesn't have to be like amazing right but uh we want to look a little bit better and if we get through that today then we're gonna do whatever else we need to do to get it ready to actually go to the google play store we're gonna launch this first as an android app later on on ios i happen to have an android phone so that's why i'm doing android first and i'm on a pc so i i do have a mac that i can use to launch this as an ios app as well but it's not as good for streaming so we're going to try this first as an android app since the last time we streamed i did install uh android studio so we can simulate the android app right now i'm just going to stay in the the web mode because it's easier to work with when we're styling but at some point when we need to we can also check out the the simulator in android studio okay so see there's a lot of you here and a lot of you been waiting for a long time i noticed a few you uh are in time zones to where it's like i don't know 2 am 3 a.m something like that i apologize for that i um i used to be able to stream earlier in the day to accommodate time zones especially time zones like if you're in india or or you know time zones in that area uh but unfortunately i have to work during that time period now so uh it's kind of hard for me to accommodate i guess if i waited till even later like towards night time here in my time zone uh i it would be maybe morning there's just not really a time that i can stream that would accommodate all time zones so uh let me know if this is a very awkward time for you and i'll keep that in mind uh but um i guess probably the best thing for me to do maybe is just try to do different times when i can so that you can always watch the recording but you know maybe sometimes you can catch it live if i switch up the times one other thing i wanted to to tell you all before we get started with the code you may have noticed that part two is no longer available so this is part four of a streaming series part two is not available uh so after trying to figure out what happened to part two my best guess as to what happened is that i accidentally deleted it so i'm very sorry about that i'm not i don't really remember deleting it for sure but what i do remember is that before the last stream like right before the last stream i was trying to set the stream up and i accidentally created the stream with basically like no scheduled start time which means the stream would be scheduled to start immediately and then i quickly realized my mistake and started a new stream uh tried to start a new stream with the same name that would have the correct start time and i wanted to quit that old stream basically delete the old stream so i wouldn't confuse people who were thinking that it would start immediately and um what i think happened is that i thought i was deleting that that stream that should have never been created but in reality i maybe deleted the wrong stream and i deleted the second one that's what i think happened and the reason i think that is because after i finished that stream which is stream three i went back and saw that the duplicative stream three was still there and it had never been deleted and um so i'm thinking maybe that's what happened i tried to contact youtube through the feedback like their feedback modal on um like creator studio is like the youtube um kind of like admin panel for um for creators i tried sending a message there i don't really know if they'll get around i don't know if they even would um put like recreate that video i know it's possible i've read online that it happened sometimes that they will recreate the video uh but i'm not 100 sure like free codecamp doesn't monetize so i don't know i don't know how google would view that if it would you know i've heard that they do it for large channels this is kind of a large channel but i don't know so we'll see i'm kind of expecting that that video will never come back so i really apologize for that um i mean i like i i tried to read everything i could and do whatever i could to try to get it back but it's i think it's out of my hands at this time so anyway uh that's what happened to number two i did have a few people ask about it so i figured i'd just you know let everybody know so let's go ahead and uh and get started and like i said we're gonna do some styling we may also add in maybe clean up the code a little bit if i notice somewhere where we could clean it up it's still very simple though we've managed to do everything all in one file but we do have some places where you know for instance we still have some commented out code you know this if statement is kind of pointless right since we're not doing anything else so a few places where we could clean things up you know i'd rather not ship unnecessary code if i don't have to so we'll be on the lookout for that but for now we want to do some styling which we basically did you know very very little styling you know up it to this point i don't even know if we have an object for styles no we don't okay let's do that first let's make that so in react native let me set my timer as well so i'm gonna set a timer for 25 minutes and i'll do code for 25 minutes and then when the timer goes off i'll go back to the live chat i'll answer some questions as many as i can get to and in a five minute time period and then we'll do a little bit more code all right so okay we we did import style sheets so maybe we have it somewhere i just don't know where are we using style sheets there we go i'm just gonna mix in there with everything else so when you're doing react native it's uh it's a good idea to use this stylesheet.create and to put your styles in here it helps as far as i know with what react native does behind the scenes it helps with performance so let's let's move our styles into our stylesheet.create object and then we'll we'll go from there so that'll clean things up a little bit get our styles all in the same spot so if i take this so this would be our our inputs it looks like all our inputs have the same the same styling so i should be able to select all of them yep and let's get rid of them and let's say style equals styles dot input and then up here in our style object let's create a key called input whoa didn't not mean for that to happen all right input and then let's paste oops i wondered if that was gonna happen since i i cut all of them but let's paste our styles into here okay now what we should get is our and let's log out so we can actually see this let's see if it'll there we go so see these now have the same styles and we cleaned up a decent amount of code here because we just move this into styles this works just like a normal style sheet with a few differences so a normal style sheet uses css syntax right this is javascript object syntax so you notice we don't have hyphenated uh properties here they're camel case so if you take your normal css properties and camel case them then they'll work and also we have no uh values in react native so there's no pixels at the end it's just straight numbers okay anything else is a string and we can also throw javascript in here which is is a pretty cool feature and then by default everything is in flexbox in react native and the flex direction by default is column whereas uh normally in on the web the default flex direction is row those are the main differences now react native uses a subset of css which means that you can't use all of what's available in css in react native but most of it's still available so if you if you try to do something that's not available you'll get a message in you know in your browser depending on what you're using uh whether a browser or uh an emulator or testing on a device at some point you'll get some warning to say that you know this one doesn't work at the very least you'll see on the screen that it doesn't work right so for now uh i think everything we're trying to do will definitely work okay so let's look through the rest of our app just to make sure we didn't miss anything no we didn't miss anything so right now let's add some styling to our our links here or i'm sorry our inputs here um the inputs are really close together which looks kind of weird so let's add a little little space between these so i'm gonna add uh let's add some margin and i'm gonna do margin vertical this is a little different you don't see this too often in css but in in react native with our style sheet we can say margin vertical and let's just give it an 8 and see how that looks now what this will do is margin vertical will add a margin on the top and the bottom at the same time so we end up with in between inputs here we end up with actually 16 pixels or 16 units right of uh margin and then at the bottom here we have eight so i don't sorry if it uh there's a little bit of a delay on the stream my computer's been doing this weird thing lately where every once in a while like i can hear my music like slows down and if i'm recording a video or streaming it just like stops for a second or two uh i haven't been able to figure out what's doing it yet um hopefully i can just maybe try restart and that'll fix the problem all right so i don't really like that much that much padding and to be honest with you let's uh let's give this a little mobile mobile view here so let's try to imitate a mobile view and see if we can get a right now it's showing this i wonder at device type all right cool so we can kind of see you know how this would look on a mobile device it's actually looks super small i think we can definitely make this stuff bigger wonder why why did it look so small uh did we have it on oh because i had it zoomed in a lot that's why so uh i definitely gonna take the zoom off of that at least on the on the desktop or the uh web version i don't know and my uh my timer stopped that's interesting i wonder if my stream freezing and my timer stopping or have anything to do with each other i guess i'll have to keep an eye on the clock now at about 5 30 eastern time or about a half hour into the stream i'm gonna take a break and go to the uh go to the chat all right so let's uh let's make these a little bit bigger well i want to make let's make the text bigger as well uh which i don't think we have any styles on the on the text so let's make style equals and let's say styles dot whoops heading i've been typing on a different keyboard all day for work so now i'm uh keep mistyping everything so we're gonna do for our our text we're gonna have the styles.heading oops nope and let's give this a font size of i don't know let's say 24 let's just see what that how that looks right all right a little bit bigger not too bad and um i kind of you know i want this to be kind of stand out a little bit more so let's do margin bottom uh we'll we'll give this a 16 for margin bottom oops forgot my comma see what that looks like okay a little bit better all right not bad and actually with more space there the spacing on these inputs doesn't look quite as bad uh also our inputs are you know i think they could definitely be wider like right now you can't even see uh all the content i wonder what would happen if we just comment out the width would it go full width okay it's it looks like maybe it's it's defaulting to some sort of you know preset width i guess i'm okay with that to be honest with you though i mean i think we could go like there's quite a bit of white space here we may want to you know go a little bit wider uh especially because the device id is is so large uh there may not really be a way to fit it in there but yeah actually if we went just a little bit wider i think it would it would work uh so let's figure out why it's getting this width and i'm gonna we don't need much space for the preview all right and i'm going to look over here let me make this just a bit smaller sorry if it makes it harder to see but i want to see what kind of styles we're getting here and if we go over to computed so if we look here and inspect the input right we're so we're on the input and if we go to computed we could scroll down it's in alphabetical order and we can go to with and see like all right actually when it's grayed out like this this doesn't mean that there so i want to make sure you can see it yeah you can see it i was afraid my my face was covering it up when it's grayed out like this it means that there's no width directly applied to that so i'm i'm guessing that this is just taking up the full space of its container so let's check the container maybe not so where it's interesting maybe maybe we'll get lucky and just find it in here i'm not sure it's just it's an odd number to default to right what was it defaulting to 152. yeah so that is odd and we can see there's not really it's not like the container is forcing it to be there this is the container right so the container is much bigger let's see let's see what we can do uh let's see if we can do some flexbox stuff here so if we do flex 1 flex 1 should stretch this out i was afraid it would do that um so it stretched it out the wrong way uh probably because we have it set um flex direction row that's why all right let's get rid of the flex all right um let's see all right youtube's telling me that the stream is not getting enough data let me check my connection that's weird connection seems all right let me know if uh if anybody's having trouble seeing this i'm gonna um oh yeah connection looks good maybe in about five minutes i'm gonna answer some questions so uh if you're in the chat right now asking questions and stuff hang in there for about five more minutes and then uh we'll uh we'll answer some questions here let's see i don't remember if you can do this in react native 100 i'm pretty sure it's not going to give us what we want but it's worth a shot hey it worked now it works now on the web i'm not 100 sure it would work on mobile but that definitely made things larger and i don't want it i don't want it to be that big so what we can do though is we can say with 100 but then we can also set a max width and we could see like you know what would we really want it to be like how wide is it right now 318 uh what if we said you know we really never want it to be more than i don't know 280. let's just see 280 see how it looks okay um we could probably go a little bit smaller since we have our device id there let's see if we can get away with like 260. okay 260. that gives us enough space for our number now the reason that these little icons are showing up is because i have lastpass and so it's showing up there these won't normally show up unless somebody had lastpass but in case they do we'll have a little space for them so we got enough space for the device id and certainly enough space for the email and password doesn't matter because it doesn't really show up anyway and let's see oops i really don't like that these are right up next to the edge of this uh so i wonder if we could do something about that let's see if there is let's let's go to our documentation for our text input and see if there's some way to get a little bit of padding in between um this uh maybe we could let's just see if padding will work that's worth a shot and then we won't have to go to the documentation let's just say padding uh horizontal and let's give it a four for padding horizontal let's see what it does cool all right that gave us a little bit of padding okay awesome all right so that works um it's looking a little bit better uh this button says press me that's not what we wanted to say um so let's change what the button says so we wanted to say uh maybe submit see how that looks submit looks good uh also you know maybe we could do something with the way the button looks and i think there's probably some builtin styling options for this button so we definitely could look that that up so let's check out react native button and let's see this reference here oh cool we have accessibility label we should probably add that accessibility label and this takes a string and we can just say submit i think that's pretty straightforward but what you know submit with me okay we could color the colors for the color of the text in ios or the background color in android i'm not gonna worry about that now i'll just leave it as the default i mean just for uh otherwise i'm gonna take a long time to figure out what color i want it to be so i don't wanna um i don't wanna do that we're not working on end end tests yet so i'm gonna leave the test id out and let's see what else we have okay it looks like there's nothing else built in in terms of uh styling just let's see uh it's not gonna show us i was hoping we'd get a preview of what it would look on different devices but it doesn't show all right so what we can do is add style on here so and this will be the last thing we do before i go to the questions our styles.button and we have another button actually so let's make sure we uh we add this button and why is it saying style can we not give a style to this button hmm maybe we can maybe that's it maybe we're stuck with this this style which is fine i want to keep this very simple and for the for the first release you can always uh add um add in better better styles you know later on all right so here we go so we have our inputs and our submit button slightly better look to it a little bit more space here and now let me go to the chat let's set a timer here and you know this this timer that i've been using it's the tomatotimer.com it's been just stopping out of nowhere the last couple of days i might switch it up and go back i used to have a different timer that i used but i forgot the url for it but may have to switch it up all right so i'm going to try to answer as many questions as i can if i accidentally skip your question you know just like ask it again or put it down in the comments and i'll try to get to it right so um i have some questions people a few people asking uh what is a brain computer app so brain computer app is just an app that reads your brain waves uh well i should say this it's a device it's a combination of a device and an app so this is the device i'm using it is called the notion brain computer it's built by a company called neurocity it's a startup company and inside of this is the same tech you'd find in a cell phone uh and or like an internet of things device you put it on your head it reads your brain waves and then you can send those brainwaves to wherever you want in this case we're sending it to our app and for this app we're keeping it very simple and we're just tracking the level of focus i believe it's the gamma waves in your brain give you a good indication of how focused you are so we're tracking the level of focus and if the focus drops below a certain level we're changing the color of the screen and we're making the device vibrate and so that's what a brain computer app is for this project i hope to do some projects in the future where we do other things with the data coming out of the brain but this is kind of a proof of concept just to show that we can reliably get data to a mobile device through a react native app i'm using react native and expo so this is kind of phase one project one of you know working with brainwaves and uh react native uh alex asks if this is gonna be posted on the channel after the live stream ends yes it will and i will not delete it this time see uh rudra asks what is a variable in programming um a variable is a little piece of data right that you can assign well it's it's something that you can assign data to okay uh so let me give you a i gotta have a variable in here somewhere right where's here we go so we have const notion is a type of variable called a constant that means that we can't change it after we assign it a value and we've named your variable notion and that notion notion holds the value of a new notion that we've instantiated with a particular device id all right so a variable could be a lot of different kinds of data could be just a string which would be like a word uh or a number right it could be an object it could be an array so there's a variable could be a lot of different things but at its most basic thing it's just something that you use to hold a value hey everybody everybody saying hello from different parts of the world how's it going uh arnav asked what my time zone is i am in uh eastern standard time so it's the east coast of the united states is uh my time zone so same time zone as new york city um that's probably the biggest city i think in this time zone let's see uh my tommy says did you really delete it i unfortunately i really did delete the second part of this this stream uh the second part of this series so uh very upset about that like i was honestly like i felt sick when i realized uh what had happened so i mean there's still some small hope that somebody on youtube will get my feedback message and uh and have mercy on on my mistake and and bring the video back up but i just um from what i read online i don't think they do that i think at some point in the past they used to do that kind of thing but i don't i don't think they do it anymore so um we'll see all right okay all right so i'm just looking through trying to find uh questions just still a lot of people saying hello so um all right someone says hello from brazil hey how's it going um someone uh pranav says how much money can we earn in react native depends on where you get a job from here in the united states a react native developer could most certainly get a job making um over 100 thousand dollars a year it's it's definitely not uncommon for that to happen um different parts of the world are obviously very different um and it you know different companies pay differently but it's it's certainly certainly possible to make to make that much which unless you're in like a very big city that's that's an excellent salary like from where i'm from there's not very many people that that make that much money so um react native can can make you a lot of money i was born in one of the poorest states in the united states which the united states is a pretty wealthy country so i guess it's you know it's not super poor but it's just you know i don't really know that many people that made that much money uh when i was growing up all right awesome i actually got through most of the questions uh so we'll go back and do some more code um the last another question just came in right when i said that and it was a react native versus flutter who wins in your opinion uh i um i really can't comment on that because i haven't actually built anything with flutter so i feel like i'm not in a good place to comment i really like react native it can do a lot of things i've heard good things about flutter but like i said i can't i think you could build awesome things with react native or flutter obviously if i had to choose something to build a project with right now i'd choose react native because that's what i use every day and i i know it um but if i didn't know either one you know i would definitely take a look at flutter and see you know maybe i would maybe i would use it all right so let's go back i'm going to try setting my timer again see if it works this time and uh let's go back in here and i want to submit and see what our styling looks like on the once we're like logged in in the logged in view and also i don't want to forget so i'm going to tell you all right now so you can remind me um the uh um red flash so we we put in a style where like the screen would flash red if your focus got below a certain level that when you first start up the app that red is like the default color so we don't want that to happen so i think i'd like to try to get rid of that as the default color so we'll take a look at our styles and see how we can do that but otherwise let's let's login and let's see let me grab my password cool all right so one thing i'm i'm seeing here is the focus text is quite small and it's very close to this log out button so i think what i'd like to do here is make this text a bit bigger and add a little space here between focus and log out and that's probably about it in terms of styling right so i said we're not it's not going to look very like really pretty uh but i want it to look like it's not broken or anything like that and uh let's see where's our style i keep losing my uh styles object well i guess we don't really we want to put a separate style on our focus text so because i don't want it to be quite as big as the heading so style equals and let's just i'm just going to call it focus focus text probably not the best name especially if we reuse this style if we end up reusing it we'll rename it to something a little bit more generic but for now i think that'll that'll work so let's say focus text and let's make the font size let's give it 18. okay that'll be nice nice and big for readability uh but then also not definitely uh like noticeably smaller than the than the heading and then let's give it uh let's say eight eight pixels on the bottom between the button and the focus text so we're gonna do a margin bottom of eight i keep saying pixels but when i i say pixels out of habit but i really just mean like units right whatever that translates to on a particular device okay all right that's that's better a little bit of separation there we can see what the focus is and um yeah let's see that looks good the only other thing i want to do is uh what do you think about this focus um right now the focus is a number between 0 and 1. do you think it would be easier for the user if they saw that as a percentage so instead of 0.23 if they saw 23 percent do you think that would be easier let me know what you all think uh in the chat uh it wouldn't be too hard to you know make that display as a percentage um and then it might be a little bit more obvious to say like oh i'm 100 focused i'm only 20 focus uh yeah let me know what you think looks like i got one yes for that nice okay um okay we got a couple of yeses cool let's let's do it all right so right now we are showing the focus here is just the raw data of focus um but what we could do is we could say like focus and we could multiply that by 100 and then we can add in a percentage sign and let's see see how that looks cool 23 see not not too hard um i don't know why 23 keeps coming up as the default like i have no idea maybe that's just the baseline that comes through maybe that's the last value that came through before i turned my device off last time i don't know um cool now you notice we still are seeing that flash of red every time we we restart so let's look at our styles and see how we have that set up uh so it looks like we're saying uh the background color we're saying if the focus is less than 0.2 or 20 and we have a user then display red otherwise display white now i don't know if this will work but it's it's possible that if we just switch these around maybe it would read the white first and we should be able to do that if we just say if the focus is greater we'll just flip around these values greater than 0.2 and we don't have a user then let's display white otherwise red i don't know if this is going to solve our problem but if there's some sort of solution that might work and it's very easy to try i'm always up for trying it and no that did not work at all that that is in fact the opposite of what we wanted how did i get the opposite um let's see and uh let's see sorry i gotta somebody's trying to say not nice stuff so um just gonna hide the messages okay all right so that definitely didn't work and uh let's see let's look so you guys somebody else is spamming a lot of messages so um there we go all right that'll clean up the chat a little bit sorry about that okay all right what the heck did i do here well let's go let's just go back because that's not what we wanted there we go there we go all right so that's better hmm oh let me see i'm gonna check the chat as well to see if any of you realize what my mistake was see aj says hey aj how's it going uh aj's one of the um uh cofounders of neurocity and uh who made this uh this device so the uh notion headset um aj says last value is that what i i don't know if he was referring to what i was doing here or commenting on somebody else okay um all right let's let me think for a second on how we could make that work i'd rather try to avoid the flash of red if we could but it's not like uh absolutely have to have let's see so actually if i reverse these colors and we get a flash flash of white maybe it would be oh now i know why i did that right because i said if we don't have a user now i confuse myself all right let's go back to what i did before so i know for sure i want focus if focus is greater than point two i want it to be white for sure there we go focus is greater than point two i want it to be white let's get rid of this for a second right and could we switch it yeah let's which is so folks greater than point you want to do white and then if user red all right this is a slightly more complicated thing but let's see if it works ah we still got the flash let's see if it'll happen if i save again will this happen oops if we save all right actually didn't happen let me actually change something and then we'll see all right we're still getting that flasher red i guess it doesn't matter uh now what this does is i just kind of split it up and added two kind of like two turn areas so um it's saying like if the focus is greater than 0.2 then we just make it white but if it's not then we go to the the right side of our ternary and then we check and see is there a user if there is no user us if there's no user then we do nothing which would make the default color um i guess nothing it would be whatever the default normally is which i'm assuming is just white or would it be red hmm i wonder if we even need to add white like what's our default without it let's um save that all right cool yeah so we don't really even need white so i'm thinking we could we could get rid of the white altogether because we don't need it and instead we could do these ends we'll switch the focus back to if focus is less than two all right we're still getting our um our flash of red that i don't want but we're able to get rid of our our white we don't need it uh two we do have what we could try to do instead is let's try this out well first i'm going to look at the chat and see if anybody has an idea all right it looks like no but uh here's what i'm thinking y'all can let me know what you think about this idea what if we take out all of this logic from here and instead in this use effect which we're already using to turn on and off the vibration we use this to change the color and we can set the color as part of state i don't know i think it's worth a try uh in which case let's go up here if we get any more state we might have to clean this up a little bit but for now i think this will be this would be fine and we can yeah let's clean this up here and let's say um let's say b g color set background color and we're going to go use state and the default background color is going to be white ffff and let's see let's use some typestrip stuff here i think we can say i'm using typescript but as somebody pointed out to me in the comments it's a typescript project but i'm not actually using types so let's see if we can uh use types here so what this is doing let's see if it actually is doing this yep so right now we're basically using typescript to say x can only be white or red we could add more if we wanted but for right now this can only be white or red and it's going to give us some cool autocomplete stuff which let's check it out down here so we can set the background set set bg color and oops now we're going to say we can either do white or red those are options so let's throw in the option of red and then we gotta set it back the other way right so if we're not if we are focused if we regain a certain level of focus let's reset this to white cool now down here we can just set our background color to bg color so if this works let's see if it works first if it does i think i kind of like that better because all the actions that happen when terms of a shift in focus are all located in one place and then we keep logic out of our styles so it looks a little bit cleaner and i totally forgot to look to see if this even changed did anything let's see sweet we got rid of that flash now we just have to see like did it actually work so i'm gonna turn on the headset and i gotta give it a second to turn on and connect right it's starting up it takes just a couple seconds to start up once it starts up i'm going to put it on and um see if we can get that focus down lower actually if it's stuck at 23 we can probably change it let's just let's cheat and just change it right here hey cool so we get red and if this was a mobile device it would be vibrating now let's switch it back and we get white cool so now the color is set all right and then the notion is uh it's starting up so i can see on my other screen i've got a dashboard up it's uh starting the operating system on the uh on the headset so it should be starting pretty soon and there's a lot going on in the chat so uh i'm gonna get back to that in a few minutes here yeah about five minutes i'm gonna get back to the chat all right that's cool um let's clean this up a little bit so if the user sell set user else um let's get rid of this else since we're not doing anything there and see if i think that was the only spot where we had unused code all right cool so we are connected now i'll put this on for a little bit so we can get some real data okay cool so we should be getting real data here uh i've got a an okay signal coming in oh goodness all right i just noticed something i don't know if you caught that on the screen but we we got a ton of decimal places out here so i don't want all those decimal places so let's let's make sure that we don't uh we don't have that and um actually that was kind of weird that that even came on the screen because we do have this two fixed two that's odd so set focus the number we're putting into focus is actually already with with two fixed so yeah we came up again very weird which i kind of don't want to show a bunch of decimal places anyway so let's just go ahead and uh add where are we at this focus um let's go dot two fixed uh you know maybe when we're multiplying it's it's messing it up and let's just see can we do two fig zero is that going to mess it up number not too fake returns a string representing a number interesting let's see if we can oops not on the end put that in the wrong spot there we go two fixed see if that works all right now we may or may not see that that number pop up but i'm thinking that since we're doing this after any calculation takes place then we'll actually get two fixed zero which means we will have no decimal places so that was cool i'm glad i put the headset on to see that that particular bug the auto formatting on that is a little weird but cool all right so am i i only got like another minute before i wanted to stop and go back to the channel what i wanted to do next if i had time was start to get this ready to to go to the app store so what i'm going to do is just kind of go through what we need so let's go to expo and let's see get started preproject documentation that's what i want so i'm using expo to help us build this uh react native app so we they have documentation for so some of the stuff that we haven't done yet is like the splash screen so it's just something that'll show up in the app and so we could add this into our app an app icon so we got to think about what we want to do for the app icon i'm i'm not really any good with any type of like photo or image editing stuff so i'll probably just find something online that like automatically creates all the icon sizes that we need um that'll be uh let's see walk through i know there's there was some documentation that talked about actually releasing stuff to the app store i don't know where it went there we go publish your app this will publish all right so there's a couple options we could do with publish um we could publish through uh through expo or could publish um like on my own server so i haven't decided what i want to do so that would be the first step and then we would actually deploy so i'm gonna skip the apple store for now and we're gonna go to android in the google play store and uh this is the next step of what we need to do so we basically are gonna run an expo command and it's going to bundle everything for us so we just need to make sure that we have our our app.json file sorted out and it has the right info in there and then i already have an account for the google play store so we should submit it like if we get the bundle right then we can submit it and um it says we can do it manually um and then we can actually just upload it straight from the command line which is pretty sweet once we do it manually the first time and i'll try to do as much as possible with this on a live stream i don't know if i'll do it today because i've been streaming already for you know over an hour but the next stream this is what we're going to be working on uh i don't know how long it will take to get approved but you know i'll let everybody know once it gets gets approved but basically that's these are the next steps that we're going to do and um really i think the hardest part at this point is just making sure that our app.json is looking good and figuring out what i want my app icon to be because i really have no idea um but i'll show you right now what our app.json looks like so right now it's just whatever was the default which it takes the name from with the name i put in when i started the project right so um i believe the icon is like the default expo icon in the same way with the splash so we can see like this icon is just the default that comes with the project it's blank same thing with the splash you know rather not have nothing there uh but at least like there's something there right it wouldn't it wouldn't throw an error saying it's nothing there um so yeah that's that's about it not really not much else left to do uh to actually deploy this so now having said that the only people that are really going to be able to use this or you know anybody that has one of these headsets i mean anybody could download it but they're not going to be able to get the brain data right so um it'll be a very very limited audience and after that there's other features i'd like to add to this uh and i'd like to have it a web version and an ios version so those are the next steps for now i'm gonna go back to the chat and answer the rest of the questions and uh let's see i guess so i'm gonna keep keep tracking my focus here while we while i answer questions right let's see let me figure out where i i left off at uh let's see um finding you says can you tell me the prerequisite of this course um i don't really know like what the uh um prerequisites would be like it would definitely help if you know a little bit about um react native uh i guess other than that you know you don't really need to know much uh in terms of like the brain computer interface like it's uh it just it has a javascript api so you don't need to know a lot about the internal workings of what's happening see let's see uh a question that says do you have a cat i do not have a cat no i don't i have i have four children and uh no cat i have the only pets that i have right now are two goldfish they're behind me oh let's see so there's a lot going on in the chat but not a lot of questions so i'm uh trying to find the questions all right so there's some some questions and comments based on the uh that red screen that kept uh coming up when we didn't want it to so thank you for all the the advice on there i mean uh so what's the app's purpose the purpose is to uh let let the user know when their focus is dropped below a certain level it's crazy you can see uh how much like trying to go through the questions and like move back and forth lowers my focus normally if i'm just coding my focus is a lot higher than this like more consistently but but trying to talk and read the chat uh really like i guess like diverts my my attention there's a ton of uh comments about hacking in here uh i don't know how he had on the topic of hacking in here but there's a i just keep scrolling and it's all this talk of hacking i'm trying to sift through all this uh chat to find uh any all questions here's a question are you using csharp i'm not using csharp in this uh and this application no this is all uh javascript well typescript technically and uh so it's typescript which uh actually i just recorded a typescript tutorial video last night i think i'm going to um put it on my youtube channel tomorrow so maybe tomorrow morning at some point tomorrow and uh so if you're interested in learning more about typescript check that out yesterday i released a video about documentation for javascript and it's not that long i think it's like less than less than 15 minutes or 20 minutes or so but if you're interested in that check out my youtube channel the uh the links in the description of this video and the typescript one i think the typestrip one will be pretty helpful i was thinking about rerecording it because i i made it when i was tired and i look really tired and i keep saying uh and um a lot so if i don't rerecord it and i just release it which i might just release it because i don't have a lot of time and i really don't want to spend a ton of time going over the videos because then i have less time for my family and i just overall put out less content but i recommend watching it at double speed because then it's not quite so annoying did i say uh and um i'm gonna try to work on that more maybe i just need to not record videos when i'm really tired because i tend to do it more when i'm tired but that video will come out it be recorded or in its current state it'll come out tomorrow on my youtube channel and i actually think it'll be pretty helpful based on what would have been helpful to me when i started with typescript that i tried to make the video in a way that i would have found helpful so if anybody's interested check it out uh i mean says what's the machine you're using uh i'm i'm using a pc so it's i i don't even know what brand pc it is but it's like windows 10 pc and where did i get it from i don't remember i don't think i got it from amazon i think i got it from like new egg or tiger direct or something like that oh okay i mean clarified i think i mean uh meant to say like what what device is in like this this headset device so this this is the neurocity notion headset and in the description i i spell it out too as well so you can check it out but this is a spring computer it is a brain computer or brain computer interface and inside of it are the same parts you'd find inside your cell phone and it can connect to wifi and it takes all your your data from your brain and then provides a javascript api so that you can link it up to your to your app or your website or whatever whatever you want to link it up to oh i mean also asked how much does it cost i i'm not sure what the cost is right now because i think they're working on another model this is it's kind of like a um like a testing device this is um i i don't know what you want to call it but this is like the first version just for developers to work on and it was a thousand dollars i don't know what the price is currently or what it will be when they start making more of these kevin says configuring a splashing screen in react native is as dangerous as eating the hottest pepper in the world why i hope i can do it sergey says in 2004 i created a calculator in basic i thought i'd become a superstar in the programming world but i only got older and i still make calculators actually in 2004 i made a calculator in c plus and then i didn't code for a long time after that but i did i do remember i don't really remember anything else that i coded in that class but i remember a calculator kevin says is python or java better i don't i don't really know in terms of better it depends on the application it seems like python has way more momentum right now whoa somebody's spamming the channel let's uh should we let me keep saying should we make app using pythons um let me get rid of let me hide these messages yeah please don't spam the channel the question is that was being spammed by at least two people that i see is maybe three people was should we make an app using python and um yeah if you want to that's uh it's it's entirely up to you python's a good language so if if you feel like that would be good then you'll go go ahead with it someone asked if they could be moderator uh i would mute people or spamming i was actually just thinking that it might be good to be to have a moderator it seems like the last few streams we've had more people spamming than than normal so um i'm going to think about it thank you for offering i'm going to see if if the next stream is is this bad with spam again then i think we'll definitely need to uh to have a moderator because it makes it really hard to for everybody and for me to read the chat and there's no need to spam you know i get to the questions eventually all right let's see i can't pronounce this name but it says can you learn a language in two weeks i don't know i mean if you already knew a few programming languages then maybe you could learn enough about another one to code but if you were starting from scratch and you had no idea how to code then i don't i don't know that you could really learn a coding language in two weeks uh amin says why did you start youtube um i i started doing youtube uh because i i wanted to share my work i was working at a university and i wanted to share my work with some of the computer science students there and see if they'd be interested in and helping out with with some of the work and i ended up getting a larger audience outside of the university and started you know catering my streaming towards them and then beau carnes from free code camp saw my live stream and invited me to stream on the free code camp channel and so that's that's why i got started and basically i keep doing it because i just hope that you know my streams would be helpful to someone else and um yeah so i don't i don't get any money from this this is all volunteer even on my own youtube channel i don't monetize you know if i at some point in future like maybe i think about monetizing like if i really wanted to produce a ton of content and do it as kind of like a parttime job i would think about it but for now it's all just volunteer and i just i like sharing information and helping people learn uh inside out says can you measure pre and post stimulant using this app for scientific proof actually that's kind of interesting i've never thought about knowing that before but that would be kind of cool to measure your level of focus at doing a certain task depending on what stimulants you would take like to see maybe if you had a lot of caffeine does that help your focus or does it hurt your focus that would be kind of cool to do um so i i would imagine you know you could probably get some good data on that you'd have to really make sure that you controlled all the other variables like noise and like time of day level of sleep like there'd be a lot of other variables that could kind of mess it up but if you did it consistently then i think it could be um yeah that would be kind of a cool experiment uh i mean as my inspiration my favorite goto resources yeah my inspiration uh for coding is like i just like coding and um i i love uh like when i hear that some a video that i've done has helped somebody like that's that's inspiration right i'm not gonna lie at first my inspiration to get into coding was i had a couple kids and a wife and i needed to pay the bills and this was a way to make money all right i mean i did like to do it but it was definitely like it was how i could get a good job to be able to provide for my family uh but now like in terms of keeping going with the youtube stuff is you know whenever it helps somebody that's that's provides me with more inspiration to actually do uh more content i know there's probably a lot of noise there's my kids playing upstairs so i'm probably i'm gonna try to end the live stream here in a couple minutes so i can go hang out with my kids before it's time time for them to go to bed um and there was i think there's a part two to that question oh your favorite goto resources uh when i was starting out i used free code camp a lot and did a lot of youtube videos and stuff like watched a lot of youtube videos now though i'd say like my favorite resources are just the documentation for what i'm using and stack overflow and mozilla developer network mdn i have a question how many programming language do you know slash understand um i mainly code in javascript and typescript i can understand coding in c sharp and i've i've worked with in the past java csharp python c plus plus i think what else see like i it's been so long since i've used those languages i don't really know if i could jump in and code anything in them right now but i could probably look at uh like a simple application and tell what was going on uh but i i wouldn't i don't know that i would say that like i know them you know but if i had to use them and had a little bit of time to get um kind of like get acquainted with him again i could probably code something i mean says do you already have a job yes i do i have a job i'm a senior software engineer uh at a company called dick sporting goods mh08 says this is only my second live chat with free code camp i learn stuff thank you for doing it oh you're welcome thank you so much for watching uh sergey has to go see you later sergey thanks for watching all right um all right i'm gonna i got through all the questions i think if i miss your question please put it in the uh comments below on this video i'm gonna wrap things up now and go go hang out with the kids for a little bit um if you uh if you liked the video you know please join us again for another live stream i'm gonna try to do this maybe uh saturday maybe i'll try to do another stream and uh check out my youtube channel the links in the description i just put out a new video yesterday and i got another one coming out tomorrow a tutorial on documentation for javascript and another tutorial on typescript and um feel free to follow me on social media links are in the description you can ask me whatever you want and i'll do my best to get back to you i mean coding related stuff is probably the best you could certainly ask me whatever you want but i don't know how helpful i'll be in other areas of life but anyway thanks so much for for all everyone's help all the the nice questions in the chat in the in the live chat i'm getting really excited about this project i can't wait to release it to the app store and that's going to be the goal for this weekend is actually get it submitted to the uh the google play store and uh that'll this will actually be my first app that i'm submitting to the store so that'll be that'll be exciting and i'm excited to actually do it live for everybody to see and uh hopefully then that will help you out if if you want to do your own apps but uh until then uh have a great day uh thank you so much and stay safe
