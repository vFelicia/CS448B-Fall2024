let's talk about list comprehensions in Python this is a very easy and concise way for you to create lists in Python so right here we have two different ways of creating the same list and as you can see this is the traditional way the first thing we do is to create an empty list then we create a for Loop to Loop through from 0 to 10 so we calculate the exponential of two to every single value of x then we append that to this list now I can print this print squares if I run this we can see that we have all the values I'm going to quit this get rid of this bring this back and the other way we can do this is by using list comprehensions so we use this syntax so are saying X exponential of 2 for X in range 10 now if I print squares again and I comment all of this once I run this you can see it gives me the same value but it allows us to do it in a concise way
