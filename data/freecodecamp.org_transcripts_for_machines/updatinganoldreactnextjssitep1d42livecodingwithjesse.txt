hey everybody its Jessie welcome to live coding with Jessie I'm sorry about the delay I thought that was a long delay yeah so like a halfhour ago maybe I decided to download some updates I wanted to restart my computer anyway because if you remember yesterday the camera wasn't working and usually if I restart it works well you know for weeks so unfortunately the updates took longer than I thought so that's why I started late I was trying to get a stream going on my laptop but I couldn't get it working fast enough before the updates finished so now it's everything's working now so again sorry about that lets it's saying that the resolution is not good on this stream so let me know how it's going all right so today we're gonna start sorry I just my computer just literally came back on you know two minutes ago oh trying to get everything everything ready okay so today we're gonna start for really from from the basics so I had some feedback saying that you know a lot of you like the beginner type of stuff so I'm not always gonna be doing beginner level work but what I'll try to do more of is even when I'm doing some of the advanced work I'll try to explain the steps you know a little bit better so that you know someone who is a beginner might be able to understand so today we're gonna go back to project one so I don't know how many of you were we're watching for project one but we're gonna go all the way back there and we will update some of our packages and because we need to make some changes to that so I've already gone back into the repo and I've opened some issues with some of those changes and we'll talk more about some of the changes I think I did a few weeks ago on a stream we may do some of the changes live on a stream we'll see how it goes but I thought this might be cool to do because I'm sure a lot of us have projects that we've done before and now you know six months later a lot of the packages that we use might be out of date well you know how do you go about updating things so that you don't break them so that's what I'm gonna try to do today and I have not done anything with this I haven't practiced at all so we'll see it may not work at all we may break it so we're just gonna kind of try to update things and test and see if things work we're going to be using you'll get so we can certainly revert back if we need to we could even do things on another branch and then merge when we're certain that everything works so let's let's give it a shot so as I said before since I'm trying to do this you know for beginners I'm gonna start you know right off the bat I haven't liked any commands yet let me try to find the right it's this alert okay so let me get switch you over to the screen there we go and oh I also did put that yesterday her should asked about that electron app that we had started up but I had forgotten to make the repo for that repo is now available so that's in that that marcom that fu s Markham organization that all the other projects are in now there's a project for that of electron one Oh Blake asks if I'm in another office no I just left the light on which I don't want the light on so hold on a second there we go when I was trying to do the stream from my MacBook the camera on there was just super dark so I had to turn the light on but I can't stand the glare off the screen when the lights are on all right so let me make this bigger so you all can see so I'm just starting here right from my terminal okay I happen to be using a program called I term you can find the link for that in the description below this video but you know you don't have to use this you could use a different program you could use you know the built in terminal and like Visual Studio code or you know just the normal terminal that comes with whatever computer you're using so the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna go into for me I keep all my stuff in a projects folder so I just CD the command a CD and then you type the name of the folder and now I'm gonna check this out and find our here we go see I react is the name of our projects we need to go into that folder so I'm gonna CD again and go see I react once you type in the first few letters you can hit the tab key and it will assuming that there's only one file but it could be based on what you've typed in already it'll just autocomplete the rest not a big deal for short names like that but when you get into some of these longer names like like this one it's very helpful because you know one little you know mistake and the computer has no idea what you're talking about so it it won't try to guess what you meant if you accidentally misspelled a word you know in the middle here alright so first thing that we always want to do when we go into a project that's being tracked you know it has a github repository or any type of git repositories we want to do a git pool this will pull any changes oops since I restarted my computer I have to put passphrase so I'm going to grab that quickly from LastPass and I will do that on my other screen so that you all don't see my my password yeah all right I'm gonna put that in there Oh No so not it this should work let me try to copy it again there we go and then I'm gonna do SSH ad and that way I won't have to put this passcode in again at least until I restart my computer okay so now we we should be able to do let's do it get pull make sure just make sure all right yeah I did run so we're already up to date so we don't have anything in our repository so we were safe to begin working so now I want to open this up I'm gonna open it up in Visual Studio code I've been using that a lot lately we did most of this project using atom but it's fine to switch between our code editors so the shortcut for Visual Studio code if you have it installed and you've installed the commandline interface you just do code and then dot you put the dot there it opens up the whole folder there we are and now I'm gonna make this take up the full screen and let's let's open up our terminal here so our integrated terminal so now we won't have to switch back and forth we can type in our commands right here and first things first let's check out our package JSON this is what we're going to be concerned with for for most of the time so I'm going to get rid of this sidebar and I'll make that a bit bigger I hope that's big enough for everyone to see and I'm gonna move this down just a bit and I could always make it bigger when we need it so let's just let's check some things out here so we're running next to point 4.3 and we can see the latest version is four point two point one so we're way behind same way with react latest version of react is sixteen point two so we have some work to do here let's see what else so I'm just going through this just to refresh my memory on what we're doing for this project so we have Auto formatting going of our code linting set up so it's good it looks like most of what we're using can be updated alright so I just checked the live chat here harsh it says that there are no braking changes so if we run yarn upgrade latest it should work so let's do that first of all let's confirm that it is running locally right I would hate to have it that something right now that's going on be breaking it and somehow think that what we're about to do will break it so let's do let me see what we had to come in for dev ok so I'm gonna run it in this other terminal so we'll go yarn dev and hit enter and we'll see it's going to start we'll be able to check this site out in just a minute there we go we're on localhost 3000 I'm also gonna start up this end rot server we got here believe I need to do this and grog there we go I'm going to paste a link and you should be able here in the live chat you should be able to see the site as we work on it with that link and I forgot to start my timer so I'm gonna do 25 minutes of like coding updating testing and then after that I'm gonna take a fiveminute break I'm gonna go back to the live chat answer any questions that you have so if you've asked a question already just hold on till we're done with this twenty five minute period I'll answer your questions if you can't stick around for the answer you could always watch the recording of this video you know sometime later on you know whenever whenever you have time to watch it so it looks like yeah we have people connect that's working and I will pull over a browser window as well onto this screen and I will check it out the localhost 3000 great it looks like it's working use the home page is working let's click on some things okay awesome so since that's working now let's update so let me check out again what Harshit has suggested to run yarn upgrade latest and was that yes it's so down here I'll bring it up a bit so down here in our terminal we're gonna run yarn update upgrade and then we'll do latest I apologize for the yawn I haven't had very much caffeine today I had like a cup of tea and it was a really old tea bag it's been sitting in my desk drawer for like two years so wasn't the greatest cup of tea alright so just to show you how much that does this is this is what it's all you know kind of installed and went through all these packages so we have our base packages that we can see in our package JSON but they all have dependencies of other packages so I mean look at that quite a bit still scrolling yeah so we started way up here and we have all this scroll so saved 829 new dependencies it's just amazing yeah long scroll okay we did get some warnings usually these aren't really a big deal but you know if you what if you're worried about them you could always read them and then you know correct that so in this case these ones all are just saying that we have something in dependencies we have something in dev dependencies already and we were also trying to add it in our regular dependencies so not shouldn't really big be a problem for us and if it is we can switch it up later on all right so we'll do a git status just to make sure what's changed and this is perfect this is what we expected to be changed this package.json and our yard and lock so let's test it out now before we commit anything so I'm gonna go here I think it'd probably be a good idea to restart this server since we made so many changes so we're just gonna exit out so I hit ctrl C to stop that server and then I just went with another yarn dev and let's see we got a look we did gets we have a warning here okay so we have some weird stuff going on well it looks like it's still loaded so let's see what what we've got here for these warnings so each out in an array or iterator suge unique key problem okay so evidently somewhere we've forgotten to put a key fob and Reformation okay so it has given us some file names and line numbers where you can check some of these things out so maybe we can go through some of these and fix them you know what I have this air is it's saying there's no entry and another window I had I had a different project open and I was also running that on local I was 3,000 and it's still open so I'm going to close that right now so we get rid of all that mess all right okay so let's check this out see what we have going on let me let me do a hard refresh so this video shows up hmm it should have shown up I'm also gonna bring up dev tools to see if we're getting any errors in the console okay we have that key proc warning again the same the prop type warning okay all right so we do have a few things that we need to work through so that's good if we had nothing to that went wrong then it would have been a really short stream okay I am gonna doublecheck the live chat quickly just to see if I've done anything wrong so far or if you won't notice something in any of the output that I didn't catch oh here's a nice comment this is interesting so John Hanson says I run the NPM outdated it almost every time I do an editing session fingers crossed every time so I you know what I'm gonna have to keep that in mind because it's much easier to do very small incremental updates than to do like I've done here and wait months before we update something so I think that that's a good a good practice I'm gonna have to really try to train myself to make a habit of frequently updating especially when we're in the process of building something because at that time it's I mean that's really the time to change things and work out any bugs so I actually really liked that idea and we did have a question about whether or not this was an actual website it is an actual website you can find a link to it in the description it's kadek etics comm is the live version so we're working on this locally and then you all have the link to be able to see this as well using Angra right okay so it looks like the only thing I'm seeing in relation to what we've just done is Hardison saying that he's not getting an error in dev tools when he's running this through through end rot so that's that's interesting let me let me try to empty the cache as well it should already be anything since I have dev tools open but we'll see I am a little bit worried about why this video is not loading anymore let's let's go through some of these errors and fix these first and if that video is still not loading then we'll dig into it I don't know why this would be messing up the video but you never know it might fix it so we'll just try it Sanjay asks what is and rock and rock is this little commandline tool that I have here it's let me make it bigger as you can see it so I get the name of the person who made this is just slipping my mind but his Twitter handle is izzat inconceivable he very generously has kind of donated unlimited use of this to free code camp for these streams but there's a free version that has more limited use and basically what you can do is run something locally on your machine and then turn on this little commandline tool and it will give you a URL that you can share with other people and they can check out what you're doing locally in real time from anywhere as long as they have an internet connection so for these streams it's very very helpful hey harsh it's getting the errors now so normally not happy to see errors but in this case I'm glad that someone else is seeing the errors as well alright and har should also is seeing the video that's interesting all right I'm not gonna worry about the video now we'll get to it at some point okay so let's let's take these errors one by one so oops I got a better description over here oh no I didn't I didn't see this we're actually getting the good description here so that index dot Chasse and she's 73 let's see if that's if that's legit number so let's go in here to that static yep just you know what it's just where our index chance is oh it's in our pages folder that's where it is it's trying to switch back and forth between different like reacts routing systems you kind of like forget where things are that's what happened in this case I forgot that we have everything in pages when we're using next okay let's doublecheck that number where do we get 73 so let's check out 73 hmm all right so if we add in a keeper up here that should fix it so let's go with key and let's give it the key prop let's go I wonder what I'm bringing in one if we're going to the post ID let's try post ID if I am pulling that data this will work and it'll give it a unique key so let's try it out yeah it worked okay so I am bringing in well I see some some of you in the live chat we're saying I could just use the index you you can you can definitely use the index I to use the post ID as the key because it's assuming that you're getting the data from one WordPress installation you're never going to have the same key so that we'll make sure we get a unique identifier there and in cases where I don't have an ID I've used like a random number before so I think it's like UUID is the package and that will also give you a kind of a nice random number and this is just to make sure that we don't accidentally have the same values for key so basically everything you want to have a different key value all right let's check this one out seventy nav so we're gonna look in the nav component on line 73 so let's check that out where's our nav components components there we go and nav alright 73 one nice thing about next and I'm sure other frameworks have things like this but one nice thing about next is the error messages are pretty descriptive and helpful so it's usually not too bad trying to debug things all right so we have this link here and we have a hmm okay so evidently on link title is not valid to use maybe this is something that's changed in the newer version of next so this this link is something that comes with next and it has to do with the prefetching so maybe title is not available anymore I could just get rid of the title and that would be okay but instead I'd actually like to see if there's an alternative here so let's check out the documentation for next it's been quite a while since I've looked up this link tag stuff so there we go let's see so here it is in prefix you drop out the link hmm so here's our link but if we need we need more info so let's see if there's more in depth ducks that's that are linked to let's check out learn next yes calm I haven't been here for a while either I don't want that I really don't want to do the tutorial I just want to see the content okay hard saying move the title to a tag be a tag all right let's check that out okay cool that makes sense and let's see while we're on this screen this is actually very helpful so learn next J s comm will give you kind of a nice you know guide to get you started if you've never used next before John Hanson asked if next was like react router next has routing built into it so it has some elements that do behave like react router all right so I'm going to close that out and I'll close this out there's also a ton of great information just right here in the git repo for next ok so let me refresh ok it looks like we're using that same that title in another place so let's fix that now since we've just done that we're sticking I have line 15 so let's check out sticky nav line 15 oh okay and it looks like we are using this quite a bit so I'm guessing that this used to be valid at one time with next and then now it's not because obviously we would have seen all these errors before or at least you know the warnings so I'm just going to move all these down here into these a tags so if you're not familiar at all with what next does one of the cool things that it can do is prefetch pages so it can grab the HTML four pages before the user is even navigated to those pages and so that's why we've wrapped our a tags in our link tags so you don't have to prefetch with the link tag if you just put the link tag without this prefetch attribute then it'll still do clientside routing for you right so that means it's just going to work out what's going to be on the next page right there in the client there's no page refresh that happens right it doesn't have to hit the server again but the prefetch is nice and it results in much faster load times so once the user gets that initial load over with you know every click that they go to where they're you know we had that link prefetch tag is going to be nearly instantaneous and we were first testing this site after we launched it the analytics the Google Analytics were showing a load time of 0 seconds for all the interior pages so that was I was pretty excited about that I've never seen zero cents for load son okay okay harsh it did say that that change came in next three because they're not passing the tags to the a tag so they're not passing the props to the a tag so evidently before anything else that you would put on this link tag that wasn't immediately used by the link tag like this prefetch or the href we just automatically get passed down to the a tag inside so I guess that's not happening anymore so that's why it's registering as an invalid tag so good to know thanks hard oh let's see what do we have here okay so wow we're using this title I I think we're gonna be chasing around these these title attributes quite a while so let's kind of this text reveal image card and where was this at 73 wait a second 21 okay all right so let's grab that and put it down here and save okay great okay hey I think we got rid of all those linked attribute errors whoops click the wrong thing there console all right great now we can move on to another air so we have a warning I shouldn't say errors most of these are just warnings if not all of them so I mean obviously the site still working did not expect server HTML to contain a div in div okay let's see if it's telling us what it's telling us here actually I'm gonna stop this and restart it I just want to see the message again that it gives me in the console to see if there's any difference in what we're seeing in our dev tools console versus our terminal okay there's slight slight difference okay so check out team Jas and where was it saying hmm I'm not really sure what the air is here so I'm looking at this one now check the top level render call usually do we're looking at team jazz all right so my timer just went off here so we'll think about this one for a few minutes while we do to some questions so let me take a short 5minute break and I'm gonna scroll all the way up to the top of the live chat and I go through and try to get through as many questions as I can okay a hardship mentioned early in the stream that this was the react jQuery mix project yeah yeah I I should probably mention that in case some of you are checking out the repo now or the code this was an odd setup where we blended jQuery with react so I'd actually love to switch it over so we're not using any jQuery at some point I think I made an issue for that but that's going to be a really big project it's not entirely necessary right now cuz everything's working but if we ever get some time that might be a nice project to do let's see blake is asking if anyone has written batch scripts i don't really have that much experience with with writing bash script so i can't help you out too much with that okay Josh Modi'in was asking about a project that he's creating but then he had to go so sorry about that if you can if you watch this later on and you know maybe you still have some questions join us for another live stream or comment on this video you know send me a message on Twitter or something I'd be I'd be happy to talk to you about your project Phillips's could anyone recommend some package or way to play notification sounds in react app hmm I I don't know that I've ever heard of a package I've never really needed that so I've never looked at it looked for it so I don't know of any package is anybody else know of anything like that could help out Phillip a package that I would play notification sounds and a react app okay Philip asked does anyone know how to do search engine optimization with react without serverside rendering for example Facebook sharing is still showing react app as a title not sure what to do mm sorry for the on again I need some coffee or something uhhuh okay so to do it without serverside rendering yet I honestly I think the best way is with the serverside rendering if you can't do that kind of the older way to do things would to be used something like phantom Jes I think it's called which basically like will serve two crawlers like search engine crawlers or things like that a version of your site that is already been prerendered and just kind of like stored so at least that's my understanding of what those things do it I've never really used them but I have looked into using them before and I decided that the serverside rendering would be the better way to go all right my time is almost up let's see if I can get one more call it questioning looks asking about is it valid to put eight reps on the a tags inside the link tags saying JSX the its a11y but I really want to pronounce that as a lie can I do that is that a thing anyway it has to do with accessibility for like screen readers and things so anyway what I'm gonna start calling Ally wants href on the a tags I I don't really know I'd say just try it out and see if it works because it may be that it would work all right like that but I'm guessing that there are other people that have thought about that and run into that issue as well so if you try and it doesn't work I'm guessing this probably an issue for that you know or somebody's brought it up at some point okay Hart should also mentioned using puppeteer to serve up versions of your site to to crawlers so that they see you know what they should be saying yeah so I've never used puppets here so I can't personally say anything about it but you might want to check that out as well oh okay so evil has some advice for us on that that last air that we got so let's go back to the code now and let's check that out so one more Pomodoro session probably just do one more and then probably wrap things up around there we'll see we'll see in any case at the end of the stream we'll definitely you know get to all the questions that you have in the live chat all right so let's go back to okay so Evo saying you know don't you need parentheses in that map okay yeah let's let's add some parentheses here and see see what that does you know the one here right yeah should need to because we got one too right yeah okay it was giving me a red squiggly line at first I didn't understand why all right let's try this out now so we've saved it let's do a refresh here see what we get actually this this wasn't giving us what we want to eat we got that air here so let me restart the server and see what air we get see if we get the same thing I'm gonna check the live chat see if there's any other discussion about this all right that's okay we're still getting that still at the same line all right interesting Harshit I see also said try navigating right to the team page because there's still more errors there so let's check that out so we need a key prop there as well Wow was I thinking with these key props this is like something that I rarely forget now but you know was less experienced when we are doing this site like six months ago it's just kind of amazing to look back and think how did I forget key props on everything all right so let's check it out let's put a key in here and this can be just like we did before let's do a post ID okay Evo said it probably it does not need parenthesis all right well let's take him up then not a big deal alright but we didn't need to put a key in there so that's good let's check back whoa okay so did not match server the client didn't match the server that's interesting let me let me show this refresh again well that's odd I wonder mmm that's odd hearted saying check out get initial props okay I notice how I should comment Harsha's comment about puppeteer is saying that I actually have used puppets here because we were using it for NN testing you know that now that you say that I do I remember puppeteer was in there so I'm using it kind of indirectly I don't handle it it just runs when we do our test so alright so let's see I mean we should be getting I'm wondering if this may be just something weird is going on locally whoa interesting yeah when I go to it like this obviously we don't get it but when we refresh and see if we get it again yep we do okay so on refresh we get that I said you're saying and also remember for this project we have a test server on digital ocean so we can run this in production mode and see if we're still getting this kind of thing happening so we're gonna have another whole nother level of tests going on all right okay well that seems to be the only thing that we have happening now on the team page okay coach that's ko Jae I'm just gonna say coach for now correct me if that's the wrong pronunciation it says the div and a bear seems to be because you're somehow initially rendering a different tree on the client versus a server yeah I just I don't I'm not seeing right now how or why it's rendering differently let's take a look again at this page and see what we're doing in the team closer interesting this okay okay all right so they're at this page works perfectly fine when you navigate to it through the clientside routing but when you navigate through you know when it's the first load through the serverside routing it doesn't work there's just a bunch of data that's missing so harsh is saying restart the server maybe it's the cache ok yeah let's try that all right so let's restart the server see what we get mmm okay still getting this error okay still that let's try to refresh yeah still still getting that error okay John sang how I should sing show up in the terminal John sang maybe there's some inline styles that are causing that error all right so it looks like this is all we're getting on that latest restart okay so we are getting we do checkout hedge as you know what let me check this out really quickly because this seems like something that's a really easy fix so let's just do it while we see it there and then we'll go back to this team page there's five there we go all right so let's check out initially I thought we were having some issue with our jQuery but if that was the case we wouldn't be able to open these modal's so I don't think that's the problem the problem this is odd let's see we're getting here yes no we're like we're getting some data but not other data right so we get all this but not this and we should be able to get that let's see what we're doing where are we getting that data because concert rendered and this is our all right you know that's the top section so we're not worried about that but that is coming in properly right yes it is okay so let's go down here to our cards I just can't remember exactly how I did this before it's too long ago I'm trying to see where where exactly that data is getting put in for the modal there you go contents for a team card here and then the bottom modal's I'm gonna see where we have our modal's all right let's check out the team card component then this rose content all right let's check out our static JavaScript file I think I remember what was happening oh man I was using fair this is a little bit painful to watch look at this code hmm all right while we're in here I'm gonna remove these console logs because we don't need those get out of here console logs all right let me check the live chat harsh is saying isomorphic fetch seems like an error with the fetch okay let's see what I'm using here yeah I am bringing in isomorphic fetch all right let me check got a question here about this code again so we're I'm saying there this card equals this saying does that make sense it might not make sense it's been a while since I wrote this Levite when are you using this card this I don't know it's possible that it was necessary to make this variable at some point and then I changed the code and it wasn't and I never switched it back it's possible I just didn't know what I was doing and I did that unnecessarily so I'm not gonna try to refactor this right now because we're gonna completely get rid of all this jQuery at some point so I'm not gonna worry about anything in here right now only if it's like I absolutely have to fix something because it doesn't work anymore all right let's see coach is saying what is good st. component did mount is not available and rendering on the server you're setting up some data there which appears to be in conflict the conflict between the client the server okay page the team colored sections you know there shouldn't there's nothing going on with data in here this just and it's these and you can see here this is just initializing like the modal's in material materialized CSS so there shouldn't be any change of the data all it should all it should be doing is just allowing us the modal to open and then allowing us to open and close these sections okay let me check my time whoo seven minutes all right let's look at this again yeah it does seem it does seem like we're not getting that call made on the server side like like you all were saying because here when we see the server does nothing no data but then for the client we have all this I mean this is all the stuff this is only this stuff that's supposed to go see yeah yeah this is only the data that's supposed to go inside the modal let's look back at where we're putting that component in the in the modal or where we're putting that data into the modal I don't think we have a separate modal component right all right so let's see where this is it should be grabbing this data team member yeah we're grabbing all the data from the team members this is this is where we have our API calls to the WordPress API all right so that's the top section we don't need to worry about that that would do this I definitely do this differently if I were making it now but it works okay so we are putting the content we're passing that to team card all right let me check team card again I don't think we need that anymore we don't need that fixed all that let me fix that okay all right so let's see what we're doing with content okay so we have a div with a class of content we've setting it to displaynone I think we can take this out let's try taking this out let me try to restate same thing actually let me check now remember this was working if we went to it with the clientside so let me make sure I didn't mess it that up as well now it's still there see so that section that we had before was completely unnecessary so that was probably left over from initially before we turned this into react the way we're doing the modal's was unclick it grabbed the data from that particular div and then because you're clicking on this container dev so we're gonna grab the data within it and use that to populate the modal and then once we went to react we switched it up and we actually have a modal for each instance of the team card component and then we put the data directly in that so we didn't really have a need of that anymore so we'll just get rid of it that was completely unnecessary so now let's move on and see what's going on with this content Stephen says is it getting hung up on the first full yeah yeah it only doesn't work if if it's the first load is right to the team's page John Henson says should prop Tice be added to all components is it used in the production build or is it just for development troubleshooting now we probably don't need prop types for all our components you could use prop types prop types are nice it lets people know you know who are going to be using this like exactly the content that you should have I haven't used them a lot but it might not be a bad practice to do nice this is interesting okay so what let's look at what we are getting in the modal so I believe we're getting this this h4 which is the name and we're getting this title let's double check that whoops let me let me refresh and we'll double check yeah so we're getting the name we're getting the title let's see I I guess this is included as part of the title wait a second team cart or okay here we go team cart org here and then usually said oh no that was content hard in this case we're we're not going with content renders so we've already passed this down as content rendered here so as a prop on team card we don't need to put rendered we go back here I guess we don't really need that this is to being a P tag since we're getting P tags so I'm just gonna I don't think this is the problem but I am going to change this to div hopefully I don't have something going on with the styles for that hey hey it works what all right I'm gonna just verify again that it works interesting all right cool that works and it worked before I change this to a day of so I don't think that really matters but what did we do I don't even remember what I changed I don't think I changed anything except I remove that data from here right we remove that data from up here we restarted the server it didn't work and now we have this Google Analytics getting messed up here alright so this works now I guess that's okay when you accidentally fix a bug this for this page so I'll page you when we're running this okay this is all right so now there's something going on here with the page you I I'm not that worried about this as long as as long as it shows up clientside at some point and logs the page you I guess I'm fine with that I'm assuming that this got updated react GA so maybe something changed with that package so we may have to take a look at this package and see if anything changed if we're still using it properly all right so my timer did run out so I'm gonna go down to the live chat I'm gonna catch up with any questions that you all have and then we're going to wrap things up and I'm gonna try to find some caffeine Sebastian says does this repo have prettified you mean prettier it says if it does try running it without it you think maybe something that in there is causing the errors I'll try it if I get really stuck and can't get through the error so I'll take a look at the syntax and see if that's the case whoa all right so everybody were talking about Ally a11y so like a 11y and someone said they pronounce it Ally as well who was that I can't find it now oh look said that and then rook said the amount of characters between the a and the Y and the word accessibility is 11 that's really cool so I mean I assuming that's where they got the name from that's that is pretty awesome John Ensign says I finally figured it out submit form data with fetch to PHP mailer gave up on Google reCAPTCHA as it's so hard to implement happy with my client side validation site is live but not finished so I that's awesome John great job on that yeah I definitely send it send us a link whenever you're ready for from people to see it I'd love to check it out okay I see the link you put in there now John so I'll I'll check that out after the stream I'm putting it in my browser right now so I don't forget all right Wow I got through the live chat so not not a whole lot of questions I did kind of go back and forth you clean code and chat a little bit more I normally do so that may explain it all right so not a bad stream we got a lot of time we worked through a lot of errors for the most part things are still working we didn't check out every page so you know we may run into some issues that are a lot more difficult but I feel like this is going to be doable and I'm glad that that we're upgrading everything first then we're gonna go in and add the new features you know change the layout a bit which I can share all that with you or if you want to preview some of it check out the repo and read the issues that I've put in recently but it'll be nice to take advantage of you know the newer versions of next and react and some of that you know performance improvement that we should get alright so I guess that's it for today thanks everyone for watching thanks for all your help and your comments and the live chat that that helped me a lot to kind of get through and figure out what was going on tomorrow I should be back tomorrow around the same time that will be my last stream for a while so the entire next week I will not be working the Christmas break so I won't be back until after the new year so I think I'm back January 2nd so that'll we'll see what's going on when I get back hopefully if I have time then January 2nd will then be when I come back for streaming so probably a stream tomorrow and then not again till January 2nd maybe I'll try to get some like prerecorded videos out on my own YouTube channel you can find the link in the description to this video I I do have some content ready that I just haven't recorded yet so we'll see kind of defense I guess on how loud my kids are and if they get to sleep early so I can record but anyway I can't promise anything I mean if my kids get really good toys or video games and I want to play them I I might not have time to record a video so you know how that guess all right so yeah so if I don't see a John says I may not see tomorrow Merry Christmas Happy New Year see any of you tomorrow for the stream yeah definitely Merry Christmas Happy New Year and if you get in some time off you know definitely and enjoy your time off try not to code too much hang out with your family and friends you know just relax and and I'll see
