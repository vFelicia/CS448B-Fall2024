hey everybody and welcome to live streaming with Jesse a live coding with Jesse and today we're gonna do something different I thought we'd do some react native so I have a react native project that I'm nearly finished with and I don't know that it's gonna work out how I wanted it to so I anticipated doing some work with Redux and react native but here's my problem I don't know if you can see this we make it a bit bigger I was trying to update my packages and it's it's just hanging I can't I tried restarting my computer and doing it again so I'm not sure if this is gonna work like that but what we can do is we can do some other work so right now I'm running two different branches I'm running a the master branch which has all the same functionality but it doesn't use Redux and then I have a Redux branch so what we should be able to do if if this won't work is just switch back to the master branch and then work off of that branch and and everything should still work fine so just to introduce you to what we're working on this is a flashcard app this is the final project for the react nano degree from Udacity so this is how I'm implementing that project I'm sure there's a lot of different ways that it could be done basically what it does is it lets you create decks of flashcards and then you can quiz yourself on them so run it through quickly so these are the decks I can click on one of these decks and we can start the quiz and I could answer obviously you see the u.s. they'll need some work so I click the first one to be correct the second one will do in correct us to show how the grading works basically you make the the question and the answer and you can toggle back and forth between the question and the answer and then once you're done it gives you the score in this case we got a 50% and then you can also add cards so this I don't think will work right now but let's just try to add one yeah see it's not going to work because this branch is trying to use redux to do this but all the redux packages are not installed so let's dismiss that go back and you're also able to add a new deck this is not gonna work most likely as well let's submit that oh you know what I don't think I hope that went up to redux yet so that didn't throw an error yet but that's how it's supposed to work all right yeah this still is not working so let's just cancel that for now and switch over to our other branch okay I do want to probably have to restart this there we go okay let's run yarn quickly in this branch I'd like to at least test to see if it was something I was trying to do on the branch or if it's something wrong with this computer we'll let that go for a minute just to see see what's going on but let's check out a little bit of the code they make this a bit bigger and let me say hey to everyone in the live chat before we start to put it it's uh Nance and says you broke it yes I somehow I broke the Arne I don't I don't know what I did alright see that's not that's still not working so let's just quit that and let's refresh hmm maybe I'll restart the server this actually the first time I've tried to run this on this computer I've been developing this on my my laptop so it's probably why I'm having problems I didn't it didn't allow enough time before the stream to test everything out but here's some of the code that we're working with and I guess since we haven't ever worked with react native on this stream I'll do a little intro it's going to be really familiar if you're if you've been watching what we're doing with react but there are a few differences so I'm just going to run through the differences quickly just to make it a little bit easier to to understand what's going on and why we had to do things a little differently let's see dragon hunter said am I too late no no I haven't said yeah and nobody's too late yet we haven't haven't really started anything let's see yes I am using using Adam okay heart should also asked about your PR Arshad I'm testing that pool request so I've downloaded it to a different branch and I'm testing it I think I ended up using the service that you recommended the M lab setting up a MongoDB database and that was all working I think my problem still is the email thing so the was a email mail trap for some reason it still doesn't work I think you had mentioned something about possibly the port's being blocked by my network I'm thinking that that's the problem because I've had issues before with ports in the past so I know the the ports are kind of on lockdown here so what I'm gonna do and this is why I decided not to livestream that because I'm not going to try to do any work on that project until I'm gonna go home on my home network where I have more control over what ports or blocks I'm gonna test everything out there hopefully it all works out then and then if it works out I'll merge it all just gonna have to come up with some other way to do testing I guess from you know from work from my office so anyway that's why I haven't merged yet and that's why we're not working on it right now so hopefully at least don't know if it still doesn't work at home then maybe it's something else but from everything that I've tried doing with it it's it's probably a port thing so I'll have more info about that tomorrow alright so let me go no no beer it so I forget to shave yeah I have not Harsha is asking change support 25 I changed I tried port 25 I tried port for something whatever the other one you recommended was I tried all this porch nothing worked so yes I'll just I'll try it out at home Trieste if I'm drunk I am NOT drunk now I haven't been any alcohol today actually for a while I don't remember the last time I drank okay let's let me start my timer and okay so we're just going to go over some code first and then maybe we'll try to do some updates maybe with with the UI so sorry about the misleading title really did want to work with with redux but and so I figure out what's going on with yarn we could do work with redux and reasonably expect that it would do what we want it to do but I have no way to test it so let's check this out first of all well we'll start at the beginning here with our app dot J's file obviously you know we make this a bit bigger for you all so the setup for package.json is is actually should look pretty similar to any other react project and then I've added in our standard linting that we've been using on all our projects with with prettier and standard Jass you notice a little bit something's a little different instead of react strips we have react native scripts right so everything is is going to say you know react native instead we're using expo which it brings in expo does a lot of stuff you'll see us bringing in some components and things from expo we're importing it in various parts of our app it also comes with an app that you can download and then allows you to test out the app on your phone and debug and everything you know right there so let's see all right so not a lot going on with the package.json let's check out our app j/s okay so we're bringing in you know react just like normal we have let's go over some of the navigation because now the navigation is probably one of the biggest differences between react and back native that I've dealt with so far so if you notice we're bringing in we're not using react router we're using react navigation we're bringing in a tab navigator and a stack navigator so the the navigation is definitely see where I'm pulling this in okay so here's the the first part I have a tab navigator and now this obviously these are the tabs at the top or if if you're on Android the tabs are at the top if you're on iOS the tabs at the bottom one of the cool things about react native is the there are some standard components that get rendered differently based on whether you're on iOS or Android so it'll use like the native styling options for those which is really cool you don't have to worry about doing that yourself so in this case we added some some tabs we have a list view tab and a deck view tab this is really straightforward right we have our screen right this is the label tab our label this is what the user will see and then we say what component is going to render so you can see all our views over here our react components so we just tell the Navigator what component to display as the view when you click on that particular tab so super easy notice we do import this so it's very similar to react router in those terms but we have we also have some options so you can style your tab bar okay just your basic basic options colors and things like that but then we also have the stack navigator and think of the stack navigator like if you were to click on buttons within the app you wouldn't want the views to change right but you don't want every single view to be on your tabs that you would have to weigh too many tabs so this is where all the rest of them the rest will come into play so we're bringing in the tabs here so we're actually so we've we've named this tab navigator tabs right we saved it to that constant so we're pulling all of this in and then in addition to that we're adding a screen for what we call it work for a deck view our new question view our quiz view and you saw all those views when we did the demo a few minutes ago right so that's how navigation works so some elements are familiar but that was definitely something I had to grab my head around you know to understand I was coming from you know browser mode using you know react router so a little bit different for that let's see as far as this page is concerned I think that's all you don't want to go over maybe this since it's this here we'll talk about this we have this style sheet dot create and you'll notice I guess it's hard to see on this base we'll go to another page here so maybe it's a little bit more obvious where's your stuff there we go so we're using style sheet create we don't have to do it this way but there's a performance improvement if you add your Styles in like this and then you know this is just a JavaScript object and then we can put it in here so on our view we have style we just have style style container so then everything under container is applied to this component right you'll notice there are no there's no indication of pixels or anything like that everything in react native is just just straight numbers okay so they don't you know we don't have like VH or pixels or eeehm whatever you want to will you normally use in the browser obviously we're still doing since this is a JavaScript object we're camel casing everything we're actually importing colors so we have a color CAS file and we're just bringing in the colors from there so we have purple and white coming in let's see I have just some some test data up here so this will actually be gone in the the production version of this app but I needed some test data to work on before I had everything set up and working okay we're using async storage instead of local storage so there isn't local storage on your your device the equivalent would be async storage depending on your device whether it's iOS or Android the database that's holding that in the background will be different but you don't have to worry about that a sink storage takes care of all that and you have a simple API to use that so for now it's just get item right so we're safe everything is just saved as key value pairs so all of our our decks are saved with under the key decks right and then so in this particular case we're just getting everything all of them and then we're just looping through them all let's see there's oh okay the only other difference you'll see we don't have divs or P tags right we have views so instead of a div you're probably going to want to use view wherever you would normally use a div and instead of a P tag you want to use text that's just in general so you would never just have text right normally you could have just text inside of a view that isn't wrapped in a component but you can't do that in react native you have to have any text wrapped inside of a text tag so that's that's probably the other really big difference so probably the way you do routing and then the views and text instead of divs and P tags probably the biggest biggest differences I guess I could show on let me show one that has input so you can see with the inputs it's actually not that it's not that different from what you would normally see the cool thing though is we don't have to worry as much about styling inputs so by default depending on what you're using you get that default device style so so that's kind of nice you can of course style it however you want but if you if you didn't want to worry about that you get default styling which is cool all right so let's let's actually do some some coding with this and let me see how much time I have I do want to answer questions I know I see the live chat is a lot going on in there right now so I will as soon as this pommeroy time is up I'll go and answer some questions and then we'll see how much time we have I have a meeting in about an hour so I can't go any longer than that and I need to get I need to get some data ready for the meeting so probably need to end no later than like 45 minutes from now okay looks like my app froze on my my device so I'm gonna restart it so we can actually see what's going on well that's well that's working let's go back over here and we let's see okay here we go all right so it's back we're back here let's um let's take a look at the UI and see where we could have some improvements here one thing that I've noticed probably could be improvement is uh we need these titles need to be bigger and uniform throughout right now they're not uniform throughout so we can we also need that let's add a card because a couple of cards so that we can see the UI so that should be good but your notice right now here's my biggest problem the UI doesn't automatically update when you add a card so right now the data is there so the data for those two new cards that we just put in is there in a sink storage so but it's not reflected yet so what I'd have to do then is reload and when we reload you'll see it's it'll be reflected see so now we have our two cards okay so now we can see our quiz all right so we have our question and answer and we have this is the second question right so so that works now but what I need to have happen and this is why I was starting to implement Redux I mean also it's the data is a little bit cleaner with Redux anyway but I wanted to try to get that automatic refresh but since we can't really get Redux working right now we're gonna put that on hold and instead we're going to work a little bit on the UI so here's what I'd like to do these buttons are way too big in proportion to the other text on the page so the text inside the buttons as well as the title and everything so let's just do some style and lesson react native the stylings not it's not that different but it is a little bit odd to get used to a unitless styling okay so we're we knew we're deck view okay so we're in our deck view and let's go down to our styles and let's check out our font size I think we can definitely for our title we can double that font size and I think that'll still look look pretty good our number I think the numbers fine for right now that's that this area right here and you can see we've already seen since we have my device is connected to my computer right now and so it's Auto refreshing every time we change something which is nice so this is a lot nicer size I think I'll stick with that for now and let's maybe adjust these a bit I want to keep the buttons large enough so that they can comfortably be clicked by users even if the user happens to have a large thumb so I'm hesitant to make the buttons any smaller but I would like to make the proportions a bit nicer so let's check out our button let's see how we have this here so our text let's make another another we're gonna it only this works like a class but you know what I'm saying it's not really a class since this is just a JavaScript object that we're gonna call this button text and I call this button text I guess I don't have I don't have space between these and let's make the button text let's see what 20 looks like I think it might be a bit too big but we're gonna try it out so we'll go font size 20 and we'll leave the color alone right now let's see what this looks like oops we didn't put it I didn't apply it so here's what we need to do and that's not a comma so let's take this this text we're actually going to use we're going to apply it to both of these and we need to add style and let's go with styles dot button text okay now we'll save that and see how it looks okay not bad not bad so you can see this I think that that font size is more appropriate given the size of our buttons okay not bad I still don't really love the proportions though oh it would probably better if we had a title of this deck that it was more reasonable so let's add a deck let's see okay that's a little bit bigger I'm gonna submit that and once again we actually have to manually reload this to get it to show up here we go here's our test deck okay this is not bad not bad okay let's let's check out our whoops Oh interesting I have to do something like that maybe if there are no cards then let's disable that start quiz how about that let's add that in right now because you know we don't really want that behavior so I don't know if you saw that but when I click start quiz since there's no cards that automatically takes me to the score screen and obviously we can't get a score if there are no cards so let's change that so right now on that button to start the quiz we have on press and then we navigate to the quiz but what we want to do instead is check first to see if there are any cards and if there aren't cards we don't want to navigate so let's remove this yeah let's remove this and we're going to bring it up here that's and the navigation so I don't know about you but before I started react native I was afraid that it would just be way you know just so much more different that I wouldn't I wouldn't be able to to catch on very quickly but you could see I mean this is very much like what we what we're used to so let's see we're gonna need to put let's let's make this so that it can handle our clicks on both buttons so what we need to bring in then is the view and the deck and so here what we can bring in there is oops I don't know why get rid of that what did I call that handle navigation navigation and what did we call it we quiz so that you was quiz and then we did bring in where did we get that from oh okay we're already bringing in deck here so okay and let's copy this and for this one we're going to bring in new question so if you notice here normally we would put an on click here for a button but it's it's on press for react native which makes sense we're not not clicking you know this is all touchscreen alright let's see question you need to put in view and then yeah this should be fine the way it is let's save that and we'll click it let's see if it works whoops no she's not the fine whoops I didn't say all right let's chat again my addition is not a function what did I do wrong okay now it's working all right great so it's working and it looks like it's taking us to the right place and it's passing the data we can doublecheck that it's faster data by going to something actually does have data yeah and those are the right question oops sorry I didn't realize I didn't know this on the screen I'll do this again this we can see this one it is passing the right card data and it's obviously going to the right spot so now that we've implemented that we can say at least for this on press so we're gonna say if my shirts yes we're gonna say if deck questions dot length is greater than zero okay I've had questions length greater than zero I didn't want to deck all right let's see if I work no we're ready okay I'm getting an error be so against something my whoops let's try to make this irregular otherwise no questions all right let's make this oops all right so basically what I want to do with this there's no questions is indicate to the user that they need to add a question so for right now right now that's gonna be a console.log which obviously isn't gonna help the user that much on a device but at least this will remind me what I intend to do with this in case we don't get get to it during the stream all right so my timer is up so let me set my fiveminute timer and oh there we go getting more useful feedback here that's my old code very uh there we go okay so that I keep forgetting you can't see my screen okay so I'm on this test deck now and I'm hitting the start quiz button you can see that feedback there and it's not doing anything but if we go to our other deck where we do have cards we hit start quiz and it does work so that's what we've that's what we've done here is just made sure that you can't start the quiz unless there are actually cards so the next step which we may or may not do on this dream would be to add some sort of visual feedback to the user to remind them that you need to add a card first okay so let me go let me restart that fiveminute timer since I went back and did some work let's see I'm gonna go through mmm questions alright let me go through the question just see what's here we may or may not do another Pomodoro session since I do have a meeting coming up soon all right so I'm gonna scroll up and try to work my way down through as many questions as I can oops you guys can see that but or not also forgot to mention this but there's a live stream going on now from the chrome Developers Conference so if check that out I was watching it a little bit of it earlier and some interesting stuff so I don't know what the times are for everything that I think is going on pretty much all day today paka says i'm trying to master react before going on redux what do you guys think I don't know that you need to master react before getting to before getting to Redux yeah I mean if you end up working on a project project where it makes sense to use Redux I'd say go for it because there are definitely some times where Redux is going to help you significantly and keeping your app keeping the dataflow on your app more sensible so if you're building absolute that they don't really need it then don't worry about it but it's a good thing to know so I mean it's not the only option either right there there are other options for handling your data other than Redux so you may not need to use Redux you could go with what it mob X which I have not used yet but in general when a question is like do I need to master this before doing this my answer is almost always no like you don't need to just learn learn what you need to do for that whatever makes the most sense for your projects and it's not it's not really an either/or thing with these different technologies you can learn them both as you go alright hey Sebastian says update yarn ok cool why I did not try to update yarn yet so I would do that to try to fix my my issues with this dragon on just said a broken yarn still faster than NTM not in this case although I've heard the newer versions of NPM are pretty fast too I haven't seen data as to which one's faster but I think it's better ok Harshit says clean clean the cache and yarn ok I want to try that three thinks I sound drunk on the stream so do I actually sound drunk on the stream I don't know you know how it is when you hear your own voice recorded it always sounds weird to you so my voice always sounds weird I'm not a good judge I guess okay actually let me try this now since we'll try to clean that out and see if that will work Harshit says which version of yarn are you using one per point one cause problems for me yeah you know what I think I'm using a later version of yarn on my laptop because I just I recently upgraded iron on my laptop like sometime within the last two weeks or so so I'm definitely using an older version here so I mean let's give it a shot see maybe maybe something will happen here but okay see Z ohm boy says why do you use Pomodoro app what are the benefits Harshit mentions it helps to manage time and track work yeah definitely so in this case on the stream I also use it to help me to break up the stream and remember to stop coding and check out the live chat answer some questions and then also to remember to stop answering questions go back to the live chat but I do use it even when I'm not streaming and it does help it helps break up the work into manageable chunks keep me on track and keep me taking regular breaks because often it's it's easy for me at least to keep working on a problem and I'm stuck and I keep trying things and trying things and it doesn't work but if I step back and take a break even if it's just for a few minutes for some reason my brain just it needs that little break and then when I come back to it I can i often either solve the problem or I realize you know what there are better things for me to do right now this isn't really a main issue you know I may have been working really hard on some side thing that wasn't essential for the product to launch so I like that little break it really helps I find I'm a lot more productive when I'm using the Pomodoro timer let's see well based on the amount of questions I'm seeing in the live chat I think I should try to get through the questions now and not hey all right you got through it all awesome okay so if you didn't see what just happened there if any of you ever run into a similar problem where yarn just is hanging and not working try yarn cache clean as your command Harshit just mentioned that and thank you for that advice and that worked for me so everything installed now I would want to double check and test this on the other branch as well but we saw I was having the problem on both branches so since it worked on this branch I'm assuming that'll work on the other branch I'm not going to test it right now because we still have changes here that I want to commit first anyway so cool that'll work so maybe I would actually like to have everything finished and turn this project in today so I don't know if we'll work on this more on the stream it depends on whether or not my project passes the review so we'll see if it doesn't pass and I have more work to do maybe we'll do another stream on this otherwise I'll have to implement all the Redux stuff on my own but in any case whenever the project passes then I can I can show you on the ship might not do a whole stream about it but I can show you the finished product and of course it's on my github profile so you can check out the code whenever you want all right so let me just run through the rest of these questions here let's see okay dragon hunter says set in 8vd with android studio why Expo I'm not sure about the first part of that statement but it why use Expo instead of Android studio I'm using Expo because that's how so within the Udacity course that's how we were taught to do app development so I could use Android studio but but this was just the the quickest way to get everything set up alright see the whisper in your ears says that's that's actually the name says hey let me ask you I've been trying to choose full stack frame work and everything came down to meteor or sales apparently there is nothing more dominant these days but people say meteor is dead now Harshit says meteor is not that dead dragon hunter says if pearl is not dead yet then nothing is that I guess the whisper in the ears is kind of weird because meteor has so many stars in github so let's see yet to be honest with you I've seen really cool things done with meteor I don't know about numbers as far as how how many people still use meteor if it's if it is dying I don't really know but from what I've seen built with meteor it's it it was certainly very capable so generally I don't really do full stack stuff here I'm more frontend although we do include some backend stuff when we need to so I don't know that I'm the best person to give you advice on and it's our framework to choose let's see but maybe if somebody here watching is stack or has an opinion that way you know please share that in the live chat okay all right sory says guys you're wasting your time this is not realistic go elsewhere good luck okay so not sure what would I did that upset three but I guess the streams not for everybody see I'm not sure what he means by realistic I mean this this actually really is a project that I'm doing so I it's realistic for me this is how I work so let's see a harsh it says in response I have already cloned and tested the app yesterday so I'm not wasting my time let's see okay so the whisper New Year's is saying it's still talking about the question of a fullstack framework is saying JavaScript doesn't have a dominant stack like like laravel for PHP Harshit says use pug with express it's really powerful okay Harshit says it gives flexibility okay so I'm not gonna read everything but there's a debate here about whether or not Express is capable in the same way as a fullstack framework is a dominant framework so the debate seems to be from well you can add things to Express to basically do everything that you want it allows a lot of flexibility like that but on the other hand it's not like ready to go you know right off the bat to do everything you need so let's see somebody's mentions happy use H API it's a framework I've never used that so I can't comment on it shree mentions do you know what async async' EO is that a sink that supposed to be a sink I don't really know no I'm I'm not I'm not aware of what a sink EO is Jamal says is this the Udacity project yes it is the Udacity project so it's it's project three of that react nano degree for Udacity so the it's the final project so as soon as I'm done with this and it gets accepted then I'm officially done with the nano degree and and I passed so really excited if you all been watching you know like it's been taking up a lot of my time doing the the nano degree so I learned a lot through this but I'm definitely excited to not spend all my my Saturdays and doing this I'd much rather to have some time to spend with the kids and I'm sure they would rather let me spend time with them as well let's see all right sir II said you really can't do this any more than five minutes I'm not sure what I was doing at the time when when you said that tree so I guess if you could elaborate maybe I'll answer but I can't when was that 153 yeah I'm not sure what I was working on at that time sure he also says you can't do it yeah I don't remember what I was working on at the time hard should ask if I need a PR in this project two already cloned and tested it actually hard should I appreciate the offer but I don't feel comfortable taking any PRS for this project since it is for a course so I need to I need to do it all myself since it's for course otherwise as you all know I'm perfectly you know happy to collaborate on projects I'm not I'm not one that needs all the control over things I realized that you all bring a lot of expertise to the table so I'm quick to admit whenever I need to take the help of someone else but in this case since it is for a class and I'm being graded in a sense on this I'm gonna have to figure it out on my own but again thanks for the offer I appreciate that and then certainly after I turn it in if we want to keep working on this I'm definitely open for that if we want to try to make it better and actually launch it as an app that's cool too I think I'll probably still work on it I'd like to maybe have my kids be able to use it to help them study so that's something I'm definitely definitely open to rook says those unitless CSS values are pixels can you use REM as well I'm not sure if they're exactly pixels I don't recall in that part of the course when they explained that I don't recall exactly what they are so I don't know maybe somebody knows but I don't know if they translate exactly to what what pixels would be let's say like if you are in a browser on a mobile device I don't think you can't so ATS also about using a.m. or REM I don't think you can use any units I actually haven't tried but I'm pretty sure that you you're not supposed to use units with that so if you didn't if you don't remember that part it when we're doing the CSS or the styles for in react native there are no units so normally you would see pixels or EMS or something here but we don't use units all right harsh it says I guess the unit is relative to device yeah I think that's how it works it all depends on the I guess the device pixel ratio well and that I don't know there it's hard to talk about it without a unit right but I think it does depend on the the resolution of the screen and size of the screen let's see harsh that says hey Jessie did you hear about Adam IDE check out Adam that I oh yeah actually I I saw something about the Adam IDE I may end up checking out at some point so we'll see maybe I'll test it out we could use on a stream or something when I first heard about it I thought I didn't really need any of that functionality but it would still be cool maybe to take a look at and just just to show everyone John Hanson says the start quiz button looks wider odd yeah let me reload see if it'll work there we go yeah let's check that out actually you're right to start quiz button does look wider interesting I'll have to check that out later on to see if it if it really is wider I mean there's there's yeah it is odd yeah I definitely want them to be the same I don't want one to be wider than the other I may change how these buttons look as well right now at this point I'm not as worried about the Styles because I just need to get this turned in before the deadline so unfortunately it's not gonna look awesome but I just need to fit all the project requirements so I can always style it later on save some debate about between view and reacts which I'm kind of skipping over a bit to look for more questions okay Blake says if I learned react what I also know almost all of react native well it depends on how much you mean by almost all you would know a lot you would know a lot of it so the concepts are the same right so the idea that you have these components that get rendered into something else right that's that's entirely the same but in terms of like specifically how you do things right there are some differences but I mean I pointed out to me at least the big differences for me and learning it and you see they weren't really that big of a deal so I didn't think it was that big of a stretch to move from react to react native okay now I don't know if I went even deeper and try to do something more complex than just a flash card app maybe I would run into some more issues but I think going for me at least going from not using react to do web development to using react was a much harder transition than transitioning from react to react native so that was just my experience but it just didn't seem that hard to translate the concepts into building something you know for phone than doing web development so Blake s so what do you think I should learn yes so Blake I think to be honest with you it depends on what your goals are for for learning right I mean learn whatever you enjoy you know or learn what you need to do for the projects that you're doing but react right now is growing it's continuing to grow there are a lot of react jobs the payfor react developers is nice so if you enjoy working with react I said go for it I mean are there alternatives that are popular yeah there are alternatives that are popular but I I just I see react more and more in job listings so if your goal is to get a job doing this type of thing then you know it would be I don't think it would be wrong to go with react but it's just a pow mean if you check out to you and you really like you there are jobs for view developers if you check out angular and you love that then they're still you know there are a lot of jobs for that so definitely test out different things but I think you'd be fine if you did want to go with react I think you'd be fine from a from the standpoint of having marketable skills all right I got to keep an eye on the time here okay so I'm good probably about like 10 more minutes I'm going to try to get through the rest of these questions I think I can do it Blake asks well he's asking Harshit would you agree that there's bigger support base and react our [ __ ] says yes yeah I would agree as well John Hanson says does one need to use native if a create react app has a responsive layout or does this all go further than how react deliver is different from desktop to Android iOS etc Mobile portable apps yes yeah so you could potentially do like in one of our previous projects we use create react app just for a regular react app and then we were able to save it to our desktop and run it and it looked a lot like a native app but it really wasn't a native app right so to get more of the benefits of a native app you go with react native right so in a if you're doing just a regular react app you could make it seem like it was a native app but really it wouldn't be the underlying code is still JavaScript HTML CSS when you're using react native the underlying code becomes native code for that device so depending on where your iOS or Android you know it's different but we're no longer talking about just HTML CSS JavaScript that's what you see when you develop but what actually ends up getting delivered to the device is the native code so there's definitely under the hood there's a big difference but then you also have access to more more on the device so I know there's the support is pretty good for let's say a browser like Chrome to access a lot of things on the device but it's never going to be as and I shouldn't say never but it's it's not as good released now in terms of having direct access to all the functions on a device and I imagine there's definitely some performance improvements as well when you could do it like that so if you if your goal is to build an app that people can download from an app store then definitely use react native if you're not that worried about that and it's something that would make more sense to be a website that could potentially also act like like an app you know progressive web app then you know you could just use normal react let's see alright so blake link something i'm not gonna have time to read through this but the question the the link for the question is react je s vs. JS versus static what should I do so I'm gonna unfortunately I think if I want to be done in time let's let me save that and if I get through the rest of the live chat maybe I'll try to come back to it if I have time Brooke says in that logical and error try wrapping the arrow function in parentheses okay that must have been we were getting errors there so as we worked it out sorry I didn't see that when I was working on it there okay thanks thanks for helping that Roger says maybe you should make a video about how to keep up with your videos maybe I will do you all think that I need to do that have some instructions there are quite a few videos now and some are better than others I mean I'm I'm not gonna lie you all are very nice about it but I know there's some times when I have a goal for a stream and it just doesn't happen and it's just a failure for the most part other times we get a lot of stuff done and it's really cool but I mean that's what it's supposed to be right the goal of the stream isn't like let's get as much done as possible let's let's see what it's like for somebody to get through their work and sometimes fail all right rich Rishabh says hey man pretty excited for the stream working on it from last 8 months really excited to see if I missed something as per standards cool awesome five Huff says good morning hey how's it going rishabh says I've been writing services on meteor and consuming services with react native it's great for middle level apps alright that's cool that's cool let's I'm glad to hear you have some experience with react native so maybe for future projects when we use it you'll be a great resource for us then let's see and and we'll glue wopo sorry if I'm mispronouncing your name but I know Lupo says for the pages using the stack navigator do you have to import stack navigator from react native navigation another quick walkthrough on how the screen Navigator works would be cool okay yeah no problem let's check out that navigator again so I'm going to go back into app touch ass and let's check out so right now we're importing tab navigator and stack navigator from react navigation and then what we will we have or so here's our main navigator alright well we have a home screen we have a deck new question and quiz yes we base we just have four views then for home we're actually importing a whole nother navigator because we want the home view to have tabs so in that case we've created another navigator the tab navigator and within tab navigator we have two views list view deck whew alright so we have four main views and then we have this home screen actually is split up into two two different parts so I guess that's what five in total so that's how we you know we bring that in and now that we've done this alright and we've we've linked all this up here in app j/s which is our route component now when we go into something like let's go to list view because that's home when we go into this view we can do navigation so we can actually do this so we have this on press this props navigation navigate deck right so we can navigate right to that view called deck which we added in here so the view is called deck and it goes to the screen the component of deck view and and for all of our sub components we can do that we can just run that navigate this props navigation navigate and go right there and this isn't all we can do there are a lot of other options for for what you can do with a navigator but this is the one that I'm using most often potentially this might be the only way that I'm doing things because the apps pretty simple and then I happen to be passing some data along as well which is nice to be able to do that but that's optional so hopefully that that helps I can show you I guess the touch as well so am i bringing this in this times no that's my status bar then I guess it's enlist you I guess it just gets added in I was looking to see if there was someplace where we had to add in the tabs but I don't think we did so when we when we choose tab navigator and we say what we want each one to be so we want it to display as decks and new deck and then we give it some options just for styling then automatically on the home the home screen it just adds those tabs and it knows what views what components from here we've given it the list view new deck for you so you don't actually have to plug that in anywhere it's just it's it's there let's go back to one of those views as you can see so there we go there's our tabs so hopefully that that helped to help understand that like I mean that's like just a really simple thing it took me a while to read through documentation and watch the videos and figure out how that all works together so if anyone is having trouble getting that after my very quick explanation don't worry about it I definitely needed a little while for that all to sink in in the process Thiago says our ask do you think the react nanodegree is a good idea are you enjoying it I am enjoying it so like I said I'm just I'm busy so I'm not enjoying having to spend all that time away from my family but I've learned a lot from it so it's pushed me to do things that I probably would not have pushed myself to do so I I like it I think it was worth it I wish I paid the full price for the course and then a few weeks later they had a sale for Half Price so my only regret is that I didn't wait for the sale and get it for Half Price but otherwise it's been great I especially really like the code reviews so when you turn in a project it gets reviewed by someone and they go through and let you know what you could have done better or if you didn't meet some of the requirements and they give you suggestions so that was really helpful because I don't usually have people reviewing my code and so that was helpful and that really pushed me you know to go back and say no do it again that's not the best way you could have done it and so yeah so I definitely learned a lot I've come a long way between these streams and the help that you are giving me and the react nanodegree I learned quite a bit in these last you know a few months of doing this it's I'm pretty amazed at how far I've come you know in terms of my abilities with react in just that short amount of time so I think I'll end up doing a video like a review of my thoughts on the course when I'm done with it so maybe sometime in November I'll be able to make that and I'll put that on my my youtube channel and just kind of go through what I what I thought but as of right now I say it was worth it oh cool Alexander says the in terms of the pixels they are di P density independent pixels awesome whoo I figured that there was there was some explanation for it but thanks for that so the the unitless let's see were not so the unitless values here that we're using for react native are actually device independent pixels was that it density independent pixel sorry I'm setup density independent pixels let's see which table uh alright mujtaba sorry if I'm mispronouncing Apple each table says Jesus was sent by God to teach people teaching is like being a prophet but people do never appreciate many things in life though if the knowledge is free of charge great yeah actually unfortunately you're right if if something's free people do usually take it for granted and don't appreciate it quite as much so it's great that free code camp is free but sometimes just in talking to people no one's come out and said it but occasionally I get the feeling that sometimes people don't take free code camp as seriously as some of the other people that teach code for profit you know that that cost money when I think what we have is free code camp is really highquality and it's it's amazing and I'm allowed to talk about my stream I mean sometimes my stream is a mess but the other people that that do videos and that work on the free code camp website and the forum you know and all the different things that free code camp has going on it's great quality it's amazing what we've been able to do just with volunteers and keep it all completely free of charge so it is really good and I hope people realize that in this case free does not mean that it's somehow below the quality of other things I mean I I think free code camp in in many cases is a better quality than some of the paid paid courses that I've taken and that I've seen so anyway thanks for that much table I appreciate you saying that let's see Saucon says redux ugh it doesn't make sense to me the generator thing looks so highlevel stuff would you use thunks saga observer or anything else I've used thunk so thunks pretty simple I've used it I have not had experience with saga yet so I I'll probably end up working with it at some point I just kind of like to know what it's like and what the differences between thunk and saga but if you're having trouble with saga I would check out funk it seemed it's really simple to use at least in my experience it's I should ask what mirroring software I'm using it's called visor let me see if I can bring it up so yeah I don't know if you can see that now you can't see that on the bottom uhhuh because my my thing some way let me move this oops let me move this you can see a little bit so visor that's the icon there I guess that's really small but it's it's called it's what is it V Y SOR visor let's see let me see the time oh man I got a rep let me go really quickly through the rest of the live chat and then I got a go to my meeting I can't be late to this meeting the head of my department is going to be in this one and my boss will be in it so definitely got to finish up quickly here so I'm gonna skip the comments so sorry I won't be able to read all the comments but I do want to get to the questions Schlow bird says how do I get an overview of all the JavaScript frameworks I just use basic js4 now and I don't know which with with which frameworks I should start I don't program for a living I don't know that there's a resource off the top of my head I don't know a resource that good there's an overview I imagine it probably exists somewhere so I'll tell you what send me a message on Twitter or something and then I'll send if I can find something I'll send it to you if I had more time in the stream I try to look something up right now so sorry about that but coming back for another stream or send me a message or something on Twitter and I'll try to help you out as best I can oh cool harsh it says there's a material design framework for react native so it's react native material design github I Oh awesome that sounds really cool like I said I'm not gonna do it now because I need to turn this in the deadlines almost here but after I turn it in if I do some extra work I I may end up using that okay all right hard should I see what you're saying about the SendGrid keys I'll test that out later on maybe after my meeting okay harsh it's asking about how to find freelance work yeah so like I don't have time to answer right now cuz I gotta go to my meeting but hard [ __ ] ask me that send me a message on Twitter or ask me in tomorrow stream and we can go over that in more depth I do have some advice I used to freelance for a few for like three years so I definitely have some advice on that so I'm happy to help you out with that world's s what's the disadvantage of PHP I don't work that much with PHP but one thing that I've noticed with PHP that I don't really like and I don't I haven't that looked at a lot but I have a coworker that's dealt with it a lot and it's been a problem is the different versions of PHP don't always work well together so he's worked on some legacy projects where he can't upgrade to newer versions of things because of issues with different PHP versions supporting different things so it's kind of he's kind of stuck and I'm afraid at times it can be a security issue because he has to run things in different versions of PHP we've inherited this you know this old code and so we have to keep different versions running and try to keep track of what will work on these different versions I don't really like that it seems like with JavaScript there's not that much of an issue like everything's always backwards compatible at least I haven't really run into anything like that so that's the at least for me the only did like bad thing I've run into with PHP and maybe there's a way around that and I just don't know it because I'm not I don't use PHP that much but otherwise you know and I know people that they make good money you know doing things with PHP and they do really cool stuff with it so so I don't think there's a problem using it Harshit says we you stream react native tomorrow maybe it depends on how much I get done on this project today I'm gonna work on it later on today so we'll see if I get it finished and I turn it in I may not stream about it if I if I don't then I probably will stream so maybe the answers may be all right so I got through everything sorry I had to skip over a lot of the comments and I couldn't give as good of answers as I normally do I guess that I'm just running out of time so I will be back tomorrow most likely in case I'm crazy unless something crazy happens I'll be around the same time around 2 p.m. Eastern time tomorrow and thank you so much for all your your help during this and a lot of great discussion in a live chat I love when that happens you're helping each other out and helping me out so it's just awesome but anyway I have to go and go to a meeting now so I'll be back tomorrow and until then have a great day
