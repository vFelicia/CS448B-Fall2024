hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse and today we're going to work with git and github and we will merge some pull requests in particular we have two pull requests that i'd like to merge in our bulletin project that we're doing with react and if we get through that and we have a little bit more time then i have a pull request for a bug that i had found in the in the resource center project so let's get started all right let's see so let me get my my screens in order okay and i want to apologize um i had mentioned on monday that i would be streaming wednesday obviously i did not stream on wednesday so i had completely forgotten that i had the day off wednesday so everybody at the university that i worked at had the day off uh so it was um all saints day which is a catholic uh holiday and this is a catholic university so we have the day off um so uh for anyone who celebrates all saints day or today which is all souls day then i hope you were able to make it to mass yesterday and uh today i am listening to some traditional music for all souls day so if anybody happens to like classical music based on early medieval uh poetry then let me know i can send you some nice spotify playlists um okay so hey everybody i see some of you are saying hi there in the live chat okay great i uh i just got the the analytics was showing zero viewers for a while there and now it finally kicked in so um i think we're good to start so we're going to go through both these pull requests and first thing we'll do is we'll we'll pull them in on a separate branch test them make sure everything's okay we'll and then we'll merge them in if we happen to have any merge conflicts we'll work out those merge conflicts um you know live and hopefully if you're not that familiar with git then this will this will help you out for me at least when i started working with git just the basic commits were not that hard but it made me a little bit nervous when i i first started getting into merging pull requests dealing with merge conflicts that was that was kind of like another level for me so hopefully this will let you you know get an idea of what it's what it's like for a real project you know to bring in code from other people and and how to handle that uh without you actually having to go through this on your own projects you know and uh try to learn it and and make mistakes on your own uh hopefully i make the mistakes and you can you can see it and then you don't have to uh i don't think we'll make any mistakes though uh these seem pretty straightforward in terms of a pool uh pull requests go so let me start my pomodoro timer if you haven't watched the stream before first of all welcome thanks for watching and then secondly uh i like to break things up between 25 minute periods of coding or in this case reviewing code and then five minutes of question answer and then we just go back and forth between the 25 minute five minute periods and then at the end if there are any other questions left in the live chat i will answer them all so if you have a question go ahead and put it in the live chat now and then please be patient and i will get to it uh at one during one of those break times or at the end of the stream uh probably gonna only do two sessions of coding today i got the stream started a little bit later than normal just had my my whole day almost was filled up with meetings so it just took me a while to get everything get everything ready and get the stream scheduled uh let's see we're gonna check out if you'd like to check out the repository so that you can see the code too in github it's the bulletin react repository the link is in the description for the video if it's not in the description let me know it should be and i think we'll start with the pull request let's go should we do 57.58 let's start with pull request 57 and this is from sebastian so we're going to do a get fetch origin pool and we're going to pull request 57 since we'll put our 57 get the head and we'll call this since sebastian submitting the pull request i'm just gonna put an s there and then let's see uh uh there's there's several different things here i like to name my um my branches for testing based on what's happening in the pull request but this there's several things here all right let's just say styling just in general because a few of the commits are about styling there we go so now we can do a get checkout and onto that branch that we just made okay when i switch it when i pull in a branch to test and i switch to it i always do a yarn or we could do an npm install for not doing yarn in this case we had nothing to update but just in case the pull request added another npm package we want to make sure we get that right away or else we may end up getting some errors and uh we might waste time trying to troubleshoot that when all we needed to do was just update all right so i'm gonna go to our bulletin and we'll check it out specifically let's check out our print view because this pull request happens to uh deal a bit with print view okay not that so one of the things that i had wanted um was a close button so i like that probably um what i'll do or if any of you would like to do it is uh maybe move that close button over to this side upper right side it's entirely possible that when i open an issue about this i said left side accidentally instead of right side so if i did i apologize but i think i would like it better on this side and then that way we could move uh our content up a little bit higher otherwise uh this is good and let's fix the attachment code print view button bug let's see great white space and print document okay uh wonderful i think i think that's all we'll really need to test out if you notice i do have the console open so that i see any errors the only error we're getting is uh from an an image that we're trying to pull in so i'm not worried about that that may just be uh something having to do with either us being a local host or maybe some problem uh in our wordpress installation where that image perhaps it doesn't exist so in any case this is okay i'm not worried about this error it doesn't look like we're getting any more errors i could click around just to be sure um great all right so now the next step is let's merge this so the first merge i'm going to make i'm going to merge the master branch into this test branch i know i've mentioned this before but for any of you who maybe haven't heard it before i like to merge the master into the test branch first that way if it really messes things up we haven't messed up our master branch we've just messed up the test branch but if everything's all right there we can do a checkout to our master branch that means we're just moving uh to the master branch and if you're not familiar at all with git when i say we move to the master branch that means the version of the code that we have saved as our master branch now all our code will switch to be that version so if we if we had our code let's say open in the background here we could potentially actually see the change happen uh whoops i meant to say get check out master now we can do a git merge and we'll merge that test branch in into master and now we get a little summary of what's happened we've changed the these following files and it gives us the the pluses are additions to those files the red minuses are deletions from those files so there we go so now we've officially updated it the final step is to push that code back up to github which is where we're storing our repository you don't have to use github if you're using get it's it's helpful but it's not um it's not necessary so we're gonna do a get push origin master there we go so now the code that we've just merged in is available in our master branch on github and if you're following along with the repo pull request 57 should now say merged it may auto update for you or you may have to refresh but when you do it like this on the command line you push it up you don't have to hit the merge button on github in your browser it will automatically say that it's merged all right so the next pull request that i'd like to work on is pull request 58 okay so harshit has uh submitted this pull request and it's it's titled uh miscellaneous changes but it also closes issue 59. so issue 59 was opened up by let me double check this but um since i've read it i think i read it yesterday um it was upgrade material ui um and this was submitted by i believe christian yes so christian submitted this and uh letting us know that material ui has come out with a new version uh and so we should upgrade to that so harsha's has upgraded to that and also removed the read more buttons because now on our posts if there is more to read we have a continue reading this will be nice because on posts like this which are really small there's not really anything else to see so it would be there there wouldn't necessarily be any advantage to clicking read more uh if you really wanted to see the single page with just this post you could always click on the title instead okay but this will save some space overall let's see wonderful i just wanted to test that out and make sure that we uh because i hadn't tested this out for the print view so we can in fact do print view with um a single post great uh all right so we're going to go through the same process as we did before it doesn't look like we'll have merge conflicts but let me check yeah so get let me pull this over just so you can see what git does so i'm on i'm viewing that pull request and here it'll let us know it'll scan the branches and let us know if there will be merge conflicts so we should be okay i'm still going to go through the same process as i did it's just a good practice to test things out first uh so just because there's not going to be any conflicts merge conflicts doesn't mean that we should automatically pull it in right because it may have no conflicts but um we we may not like what what has happened uh so there could be no conflicts in the code but there might be errors when you try to run it um let's see okay i happen to look over to live chat and arvin says get push origin is always the same as get push origin master that's good to know i can save save some time now and and typing that so let's if i remember hopefully i'll remember in about a few minutes when we go to push this up we'll try to type it in uh the shortened way okay and looks like sebastian found maybe a little bug when switching back to normal view it will always be on grid view um let's see so if we go to print and then click here oh yeah it always goes to grid okay um sebastian if you'd like to open an issue about that then please feel free otherwise maybe i'll open an issue a little bit later on if you didn't catch that here's what happens we can choose list view and then we choose print view and when we go back out what we what should happen is that we should still be in list view but what really happens is that we've gone back to grid view so we'll want to we'll want to change that and so that was that was a good catch on that sebastian i had not noticed that let's see here we go all right so let's go with uh get fetch origin pool this is pull request 58 head and this is from harshit and let's say material ui uh since this this pull request among other things did upgrade to the new version of material ui great now we're going to check out oops git checkout this and we're going to run yarn and this time we do actually have an update for our package so we should have updated um material ui and material ui icons to the latest versions okay um let's see now let's merge merge the master oh and do we have a conflict now no it's just prompting us for a merge message okay um all right so let's just merge it there we go and that's just brought in basically it's just brought in all those changes that we had just merged into master it's brought those in to uh to update this branch so there were no conflicts but we needed to update this so if this looks familiar it's because we just saw the same thing up here right here okay now let's give it a little test so we we really shouldn't see anything let me refresh this and let's see if we're getting the same error we are so let's check out this it's not it's saying it's a warning so obviously things are still working here um line items prop on a dom element if you intentionally want it to appear in the dom with a custom attribute spelled lowercase line items instead okay so it looks like uh we have some some props so since we weren't getting this before and we are getting it now potentially maybe something changed in material ui since we updated it and and this is no longer a valid prop so since this is only a warning i'm okay with merging this in now at some point we'll want to fix that but it looks like uh they've created by grid component so it looks like this is having to deal with a grid and the grid seems to be working so we can double check that and potentially if we even are we we may have stopped using the grid for this i think we did switch to using masonry so we should be okay everything looks fine and then we should also there we go so you can see we no longer have that read more okay uh so now that we don't have the read more i may end up cutting out some of the padding here it just seems like more padding that we need but otherwise not bad and then eventually what we will do is uh once we're actually pulling in data about with attachments uh these posts that don't have attachments this entire bottom portion will be gone so it'll save even more space and then only some of the posts will actually have attachments okay looks good though looks good let me just click around just a bit more make sure we're not getting any other errors and let's try this search great okay awesome okay everything seems to be working although that's that's odd to have a space there interesting oh there we go that's really odd huh that was interesting um we'll have to keep an eye out for that uh some empty spaces not a huge issue but just a little kind of visual glitch i guess okay that looks good whoops so let's check how much time okay great seven minutes uh let's go ahead and switch back to the master branch and then merge this in um i just checked in the live chat proxy says how much longer will this go on i just tuned in um i'm thinking another half hour at least um we seem to be going through things pretty quickly so uh more quickly than i anticipated um but i think we have at least another half an hour depending on how many questions uh are in the live chat okay so let's do get checkout master and now let's merge that branch into master which should work with no problems git merge h great all right and now we can do a get push origin okay which i've just learned is a shortened form of saying get push origin master if we wanted to push a different branch we could specify that but if we just want to push master i guess that's the default um great and actually let me ask so arvind is the one that that let us know about get push origin is it relative to the branch you're on so for instance if i was on let's say the dev branch and i did get push origin would it automatically just push um whatever that branch is so would it push to dev or is it automatically master um i'm not sure i guess i can try it out at some point uh if you don't know um okay but at this point all the code now is on github it's all up to date on the master branch and now github says that branch 58 is in fact merged and great so we have all the outstanding pull requests should be merged in for this bulletin react repository not only that but we have our our issues here that have been closed so um let's check this out uh let's check out add a close icon to print view and i do want to see if i in the upper right corner of the preview okay i okay so i didn't mess that up i did i thought i may have messed it up and said left corner okay um let's see this maybe maybe i'll leave this open uh and then i'll close it whenever i put that in the right corner or if any of you want to put that icon in the right corner but it looks like 51.52 let's check out pull requests or i'm sorry issue 52. there we go so this vertically align that attachment icon so before this icon and the text were kind of off in the alignment so let's close that close that issue awesome and let's also see this upgrade uh this was closed so christian uh actually it was already closed this was closed i suppose automatically then um so we've gotten rid of those issues and let's double check okay we can go into our projects now so we're using this uh kind of kanban style uh to track some things and now we can move this over to completed okay and it looks like i'll need to add some more in here we're getting kind of low on to do so i'll have to go through and check that out see what else needs done okay great so about two minutes let me i want to take a look at the live chat now before we start on um on the next pull request we do have a pull request for a previous project and we're gonna we're gonna bring that in um and that one's a little bit more uh technical i guess and because it deals with um with forms and bugs with older browsers and things so uh i don't want to try to explain that with two minutes left so let me go ahead and take the break now and i'll go to the live chat and after this five minutes is up uh we'll do some more um some more merging of pull requests uh let's see jessem says how long have you been with git um i guess so i guess that was how long have i been using it for three or four years yeah somewhere around there uh music says how to get started with github um well check out there there are a couple of courses that are free online that can help you learn about using git and github i recommend if you want more of a structured course i definitely recommend udacity's intro to git and github really i i think the course is very well done so check that out it's a mix of text video handson assignments i i really benefited a lot when i took that course early on when i was just learning also if you like videos uh this channel free code cams youtube channel has a series of videos on on git and i believe that code academy has something on git now i'm not positive and then there are also youtube channels that have some get tutorials i think learn code academy does have some get videos uh so you can check that out as well so that would be this would be my suggestions github itself has um tutorials documentation and things like that you could read through if you prefer you know just read through and try things out on your own see uh see s what time is it over there in my time zone um it is 3 30 p.m proxy asks have you ever done merging resolving merge conflicts using github desktop instead of a command line i've actually never used github desktop so i really can't i i can't say anything about it so the answer is no i've never done it um for me the uh the command line seems to be pretty quick uh i can get things done quickly i never have to leave the command line although when dealing with complex merge conflicts i could see how maybe it might be helpful to use something like github desktop i i've never tried it though has anybody used github desktop um at all or and particularly when it comes to merge conflicts uh if you have let me know i'd love to um i'd love to hear about it sebastian says uh missed the right corner part yeah no worries sebastian it's cool um yeah that's not really a big deal that's easy easy fix oh man arvin said i left my job by the way oh arvin what's um uh so how did that go are you are you um i don't know if i should be sorry to hear that you left your job or excited i guess it depends on whether or not you like that job and and what you're uh what you're doing now so um was are you happy about uh about leaving was it a bad situation uh and do you have anything lined up now um in terms of uh in terms of a job anyway let me know and actually for anybody who's looking for work uh occasionally i do have or i hear about some projects that are open for freelancers so let me know if you're interested and then if i find something that fits your skill set i could always you know let you know about it i can't guarantee anything i just i'm not actively looking for work but occasionally people get in touch with me about you know some job so let me know uh also if you tweet and um you tagged me in the tweet saying that hey here's here's what i do you know let's say i i'm a rack developer or i do php or whatever and i'm looking for work i can retweet that for you i don't have a ton of followers i think i have maybe like 600 or something 700 i don't know somewhere around there um but potentially i could retweet you and you know some other people retweet you could reach a large audience so pretty much everybody that follows me is a developer of some sort so i'd be happy to help you out in that way because i know some of you are are looking for work so just let me know all right my five minute timer is up but i'm nearly to the bottom of the live chat so i think i'll do one more question oh arvin says the net ninja has a great tutorial for git and github so i haven't i haven't used that tutorial yet but arvin says it's good so check that out as well that's the net ninja um oh igor did ask about my github black theme yeah it's actually uh it's a script so i use this tamper monkey plugin um and that's that's a chrome plugin uh so you load tamper monkey and then search for github dark which uh rook has has pasted in a link to that it is github dark so that that is the correct link rook thank you for that um and then just follow the instructions on that repository and you'll be able to get the um the github dark theme and it also comes with some cool options so um see we have settings here you can change it up uh i actually recently changed up my github theme to this monica space gray 80 so uh you know you could do oh you can change tab size nice i'm definitely setting it to two because that's that's what i like um anyway uh great that's cool all right so um cfas if i stream after work i usually don't stream after work because then i'm i'm home and my uh my network is not good enough at home uh my internet is not good enough to stream in 1080p i don't like to stream at a lower quality because it makes it hard to read the code so usually i i can't even get 720 uh most of the time too so until better internet becomes available where i live i probably won't be streaming from home i'd love to be able to but just doesn't it's not working out right now let's see okay now i'm gonna go back uh and we're gonna merge in another pull request after that i'll go back to the live chat and uh and answer some more questions let's see oops and i just realized that i have my phone plugged in and when i have my phone plugged in uh there's some feedback often on the mic so so sorry if anybody heard some weird feedback going on there but it should be fine now all right so let's go first of all let's bring up this other project which i think i'm running on localhost 3001 let's see it's one of these there we go so i already have it up here and here's the problem so the problem that we had which i think i mentioned last week is when you went to submit a form so let's just bring up one of these forms this is we have two forms one is a little bit more complicated this one is the the simpler of the two so you go to fill out the form and you hit submit and nothing happens this bug was found on safari 9.1 on a mac so unfortunately the bug was found by the head of my department which is no good right i don't want she was very um very nice about it she wasn't mad at all in fact she had thought that she was doing something wrong so but it's entirely not her fault uh it just it doesn't work so i had mentioned that i thought that it had something to do with our use of async await and it seems like that's the case that that was the problem so um let's uh let's pull in the fix so let's go to let's see let's get our notifications and yeah this was the issue and let's find the pull request all right so what's this holder let me let me give credit here so let me open up um so uh helder has submitted this pull request so thank you very much for this and you'll see in the files that have changed i know it's really small so let me zoom in a bit some of these basically most of these changes are because of formatting which is weird uh because we should have auto formatting happening but anyway so let me scroll to the actual um file that that did change so if you see here we went from using async right so we're using async to using just a normal um promise with our with our fetch okay so that's what i suspected needed to happen and let's download this test it out and uh hopefully it'll work we're going to use browser stack to do some testing because we need that safari 9.1 i see igor just asked uh what's the lowest safari version you're supporting with this project to be honest with you i wasn't worried about supporting older browsers because this is an internal project and everyone working at the university should be getting updates on their browsers so i generally don't worry about supporting older browsers because i think it's bad practice in general uh for internal websites because it just enables users to not update their browsers uh which potentially could have you know security issues but in this case since it's the head of my department that was having issues i need to fix this and i haven't had any uh complaints from anyone else so i don't know if other users happen to be using that same version of safari but it's entirely possible that they are so i'm just going to fix this okay and by me i mean helder is going to fix this so i did do some uh some testing and research on the issue uh before i made before i made the issue on the repository but as you can see helder actually did the the work coding so let's see what what is this 65 okay so let me let me bring over the terminal window for this so we do have you know what i have some changes that i had already made where am i at um here right resource in it let's go to our bulletin and no no no resource center that's where we're at so the project is resource center let me undo all my tests because i messed this up pretty thoroughly uh all right and let's do let's do status view story.js no i have not updated this um if you're not sure what i'm doing i'm trying to get rid of my my tests my changes because i don't want those to be to be committed are included at all let's see what it says i've changed project description name email that's interesting so what does it think it was i'm gonna do a git diff to see what changed okay that's interesting it says that i've actually added this line in interesting hmm and i don't really want that added in right i do not so let's see what i want is that to say story and not project description so let me go let me change that actually could it be it's already up to date that's odd that's really odd i thought i had fixed that at some point anyway uh let's just go ahead and change that back then there we go now what we should have when we do a git status is that nothing is here so uh we don't see that little asterisk anymore so that means nothing's there okay great let's do it get fetch origin pool and this was 65 i believe we can always double check 65 yep and and we'll do uh let's see this is from helder um so there and let's go safari bug so now we're moving to that branch and we're going to type in yarn just to be sure although uh it shouldn't do anything okay great now let's merge master which is up to date so awesome so everything's up to date now here's what we're going to do i'm going to run ngrok which where's my ngrok server at maybe i have it on here instead uh so i have n grog running somewhere or i had it running i stopped it from the last time there we go okay so what ngrok is going to do is this is going to allow me to test this from anywhere so um i'll paste i'll go ahead and paste this in the description in case you want to test it or i'm sorry in the live chat so ngrok is now giving me a link to this even though it's running locally now you all uh can can test it out i'm going to run browser stack so if you're not familiar with browser stack it lets you run your your sites test out sites on different operating systems different browsers so oops oops i forgot i was on chrome canary let's try browser stack this would be a lot easier to log in like this okay so i'm already logged in so here's browser stack let me zoom in a bit so you can see so i have a choice to run this on you could see a lot of different mobile devices but i'm going to go down here to mac and let's try el capitan so we're going to go 9.1 on el capitan and it's actually going to start up that browser device combo once that starts up we're going to visit that ngrok link that i just pasted in and we're gonna try to submit that form so for me it i had a previous ngrok link in that obviously is not working now because i shut down that that link great so now we're in as you can see we're in here i can from in here i can inspect so you can see i can bring up the dev tools the safari dev tools and inspect things and the console will be most helpful to us i suppose so i'm going to go into that suggest a story form since it's a lot easier to fill out than the other form and there we go there's a slight lag but i'm when i'm doing this but it's not unreasonable and do the test and submit oh interesting type there object entries is not function okay so we are getting an error here i can uh i have my email open on another screen so i can tell whether or not an email was sent or whether the error completely stopped it it looks like it's completely stopped all right so i know this is really small i can't the the zoom is not working for me so um let me bring this whoops again let me just read off this error then so we have a type error object dot entries is not a function so it says in object dot entries uh this state form object dot entries is undefined so let's check that out in the code so we have our dot story.js and down here where we're doing our handle form data this is where we have object dot entries this state form so interesting i'm just going to choose this undefined i wonder uh hmm nothing huh that's interesting is all right so here's what i'm thinking maybe object dot entries is not supported well let's just all right let's check it out in uh mdn and it should tell us here at the bottom where we could use it oh okay so the compatibility uh here says it's available in safari 10.1 we are testing it at 9.1 so that would make sense um okay so it seems like seems like we need a polyfill right let me deploy polyfill listed below let's see if we can just copy this polyfill and uh and get it to work um just i mean this will just kind of really tell us where the problem is i suppose let's get rid of that let's see okay so we should be able to go back to our uh browser stack this should have auto refreshed okay blake has a question here i just noticed asking what does a polyfill do okay so let's let's go over this nice this is a really great question so a polyfill is a way for you to use some newer syntax with older browsers so let's just check out what this particular polyfill is doing so it's checking to see um if object entries doesn't exist so you know we see that um exclamation point there which is basically just the opposite so if object dot entries doesn't exist meaning it's not supported by that browser then we're going to create object dot entries so essentially it's just making it anyway and then it's making a function that takes in an object okay so it's going to do object keys on that object all right and it's basically going to do pretty much the same thing as object dot entries would do but it's using syntax that is acceptable for older browsers or it's using you know other other methods so the objects.keys that's acceptable for older browsers so when we add this in what should happen and we're going to test in a second is that on newer browsers this will completely get skipped over and everything will work as normal but on browsers that don't support object.entries instead this function will run and it should return something that will allow our our forms to work properly uh even if it's in an older browser so i believe from what this was saying that this will not work in older versions of internet explorer i have no intention of supporting older versions of internet explorer so i'm not worried about that but it looks like there are some alternatives if you do need to support older versions of ie so hopefully that made sense uh if anybody else has some more insight on what polyfills are what they do please put it in the live chat now always appreciate expertise from from you all so let's let's try this out again it's a test all right submit error no the page integral is not allowed to display insecure content from n rock all right let me try this so let me try another link and then test it again so it looks like there was some issue because i was using https uh so let's go with the non https or just the regular http link and give it another shot see if that makes a difference but we weren't getting the uh object.entries error so i'm assuming that that was corrected but we'll try to verify and get an actual submission to go through okay now let's submit so nothing happened and we get no errors in the console all right i don't like this this is no good uh let's check our network see what's happening share a story and we should be sending where's our fetch upload where's our upload url and we defined it up here story form so are we actually submitting sorry for this being so small um error occurred okay now we finally got an error let's see what it was okay so it looks like it's a um access control origin thing where are we sending these i saw all right let's double check our server you know what this is the one where we're sending with sendgrid correct uh probably what's happening is i have um a white list of domains when my sendgrid api and i don't have this domain included so here's what i'm going to do i'm going to copy this let me copy this add it to the api and then we should um we should be okay so uh i'm going to do this on my other screen for sendgrid uh just so that i don't accidentally show something on youtube that i should not in terms of user data but basically what i'm doing here is just adding a url to the whitelist for for this particular api key that i'm using so if you if you want to know how i'm doing this in sendgrid you just log into your sendgrid account and then on your side menu you go to settings and then api keys and then you just select the api key that you would like to edit edit your key interesting maybe i don't domains that's interesting it looks like i don't have the api key set up with any type of white list interesting okay then that's crazy alright so what is the problem hmm uh it might be it might be the way we're running this server actually you know what let's it i it probably is that let's shut this down and let's go thousand okay so uh it's been a while since i worked on this project so i had forgotten that the way we're running this is um there's a server running on there's a version of the site running on localhost 3000 and in this case 2001 and that one works except the forms don't work but then we had another one running on port 9000 and that one worked with the form so that is probably our error so my 25 minute timer is just ended but i want to do one more test since we're so close let's see let's submit this and see what happens okay so so far nothing um there's a network let's get xhr all right well we're not getting anything hmm we're not getting any errors in the console that's odd oops let's try one more thing one more thing before we stop so let me see this let's let me check out our package json file and see okay so we should be starting those servers right foreign hmm let's build okay so i'm gonna run this i'm gonna try one more time no matter what happens this next time i'm gonna go to finish up with some question and answer stuff uh i'm not i'm not gonna go through the process it let's say this works i'm not gonna go through the process of actually merging this in we've already done it twice i don't really think there's there's much value in doing it again um the only difference would be after i did all this i would then actually go onto the server and update the the live server okay so let's let's go with start start that server and for sure okay let's double check okay great that is working and where's our where's our browser stack there it is okay i'm going to go ahead and do a refresh just to make sure it should auto refresh on us but i just want to make sure everything is is working properly let's submit all right okay it says your story suggestion was sent successfully okay and i will verify by checking my email that i am i should be getting an email update uh somewhere let's see so i've gotten nothing so far but oh you know what uh since we're in testing mode it's probably turned off uh so that's why i'm not actually getting the email but uh we did get we did get a success message so i'm happy with that awesome so uh with just you know we had to add that polyfill in there uh which is okay uh what i'll have to do then uh it's not exactly ready to merge in yet because i'll have to add the same polyfill into for the other form uh there's probably a better way to do that so i don't have to repeat the same code so maybe i'll i don't know i don't mind repeating something twice if i had to repeat it more than twice it might be worth it to maybe make it a separate component put it in the utils folder uh we'll see um but i'd have to do that then merge it uh put it on github i'll pull it into the server so if anybody's interested in that whole process um maybe i could i could show that on a stream in the future um just let me know but otherwise i think the the problem seems to be solved so thank you again uh helder for that pull request and um so if anybody feels like browsing this site on internet or on safari 9.1 it'll work now so all right so let me scroll up a bit to where i left off in the live chat and uh answer uh as many questions as i can let's see okay cool so um i if you remember earlier in the stream i was asking arvind about his work situation since he uh said he just left uh left his job uh arvin says i've decided to learn from you and do some freelancing it'll give me more time to learn all right that's awesome that's awesome i mean hopefully hopefully i can help out with that and and you'll learn some things uh feel free to you know ask me what you know whatever you want to uh you can message me on twitter or you know or whatever we're just asking the live chat happy to help and uh freelancing is it's nice um if you get some steady clients it can be it can be really nice let's see right c says i'm doing the same as you and my life hasn't been better pure happiness for now awesome that's awesome i'm glad to hear that okay oh uh musa says i must leave now thanks for the stream man good afternoon so i'm sure moose already left but uh in case uh that you watch this recording uh i'll see you later and uh thanks for watching the stream and and joining in the live chat i appreciate it world says browser support like internet explorer or safari makes me want to leave web dev i feel like i'm fixing fixing vhs for a living yeah i'm not really uh i don't really like supporting older browsers either but um luckily i don't really have to that much so i think i have it better than than other people in that regard so it could be a lot worse but yeah i really i don't really honestly internet explorer does upset me sometimes with just the weird errors but to be honest with you safari is pretty bad too especially on mobile mobile safari is like i think right there in the running for worst browser uh to have to deal with as a developer so if anybody on the safari team is watching i apologize i don't mean that in any way um to belittle your work or anything um but i just happen to have had a lot of bugs on mobile safari with some of the stuff that i built this is interesting arvin says i learned vue.js as i found it easier than angularjs and guess what i don't find i can't find any jobs for view developers in india that's actually i mean that's interesting i've always wondered about vue i know a lot of people like view but i don't frequently see view mentioned in job descriptions now i'm i'm not really looking at that many job descriptions but i i don't recall it being mentioned often so i kind of wondered what you know what the job outlook was like for view developers excuse me try to have the yawn uh i'm i'm highly caffeinated at this point so i was i'm surprised by the yawn okay i guess that's good to keep in mind i mean of course this is anecdotal it's it's in no way uh a study of you jobs but i i have kind of wondered about that all right rook says uh the can i use site is pretty nice for browser support information uh let's end this session um yeah if you didn't if you've never used can i use before it's it's simply can i use dot com you type in what you want to do and uh normally i almost always find what i'm looking for for some reason i couldn't find object dot entries but it works for javascript stuff like this or even css like let's go like flexbox right so you don't have to specify you just type something in you'll get the javascript and css and you know it it'll show you what it's supported with so if you want to use flex and css it'll say you know okay internet explorer 11 has partial support even explains what that means um and looks like all the other browsers have full support so really useful super fast to search through i use this often okay igor says it should be a lot of freelance tasks or outsource projects on vue.js okay um yeah that's that's a good suggestion you know maybe there's not fulltime view developers uh it's possible there's not a lot of those jobs but you know freelancing uh you know temporary projects i guess are a way to go oh okay sebastian noticed on that bulletin project that when you click on continue reading that is also only in grid view let's see actually now i'm clicking this sebastian and it looks like oh i'm sorry um i clicked the wrong thing let me let's go continue reading where are we at need to find something that says continue reading oh you know what continue reading is only a great video oh i see what you're saying now actually that's how i want it so i'm currently on the site i have it so that in this list view there is no continue reading the entire text appears so that's actually how i want it because i had complaints initially i had complaints from users because they wanted to be able to just scroll through and see everything and not have to click to read more so what i did as kind of a compromise was in the grid view because these cards were more narrow and you could potentially have a very long scroll if there were a lot of there's a lot of content i left that with the continue reading but in the list view we show everything the full content so it that actually is how it how it's supposed to work but sebastian you have uh great like attention for detail um yeah that was that was pretty good about noticing that arvin says what freelancing website would you suggest apart from freelancer um igor says have you tried upwork uh let's see i i i have not tried upwork i know you're asking um uh you're having a conversation with igor on there but uh in case you know anybody else wants to to join in here um i'm just kind of reading it out a bit i've not tried upwork so i can't vouch for that i have tried freelancer i didn't have a great experience with it it seemed to me like the uh the pay was just way too low for a lot of the projects um there's a lot of competition a lot of people trying to you know undercut and bid lower than other people i i didn't find it to be really worth my time unless i really didn't have anything else going on uh so i didn't like it i i um i think it's more promising some of the sites like uh top towel basically any site where um they you you have to test to be accepted as a developer so they only take quality developers who can pass the tests and then they match you up with companies who are actually willing to pay you know a fair amount of money to get a good developer so if you can find something like that either top towel or something that that operates like that i think that's that's the best bet if i ever go back to freelancing i will probably do that um yeah that's so that's kind of my advice about freelancing if you the thing about freelancing i i talked a lot about freelancing last week so i'm not going to talk a lot about it now but i'll just say freelancing is about selling yourself to a certain extent so you're not going to be able to spend all your time coding and learning if you want to actually make money you have to sell yourself if you're not comfortable with that you almost have to be a marketer uh in a sense but if you're not comfortable with that freelancing may not be for you unless you can find someone a company like top towel or maybe a small business or something that will be the middle man you know kind of the go between between clients and and you they can handle contracts they can handle payment uh things like that that will allow you to spend your time doing what you want which i assume is coding and not worrying about the you know these other things so for me that's more of the ideal freelancer situation uh because you know while i do have experience with marketing and things i i'd rather not i enjoy the coding more so anyway just something to keep in mind world said i like how you say interesting instead of cursing like i do yeah so i i assume that you'd said that whenever i got the error in the console there yeah so um i um i purposely never curse on this stream i know i have some younger viewers so i i wouldn't want to expose them to any words that their parents may not want them to hear and potentially i may have older viewers that just would prefer not to hear that language so i like to keep it pg rated or g or whatever so anyway yeah so you will not hear me curse on this stream and um i have four little kids so i get a lot of practice at controlling my language even when i get upset about something um let's see so when i'm not streaming though uh i i i have i have said some uh some curse words at the computer uh luckily i have an office with my door shut and everything so there's no danger of being overheard uh my uh my spotify playlist has ended so uh gotta put another playlist on it's really weird to try to do the stream with nothing in the background let's see michael crow says take your break now if you don't you'll be banging your head against the wall for the next hour trying one more thing you're right if that if that last thing hadn't worked i i was definitely in danger of doing just that uh you're a smart man igor says that thing always happens one more thing one another thing and oops you have been working for a couple hours without a break yeah that's true i don't know how many times my wife has called and said when are you gonna come home from work it's getting late and i'll say okay i'm working on this i'm just gonna try one more thing and yeah and then i end up being here for much longer okay world says you demand safari nine users should be grateful cool i hope so i'm gonna have to uh next time i see the the my department head i'll tell her that it now works she'll be should be happy okay blake says by the way i messed around with figma the wireframing tool it's not bad okay cool so at some point maybe last week sometime we were talking about uh free wireframing tools i believe we were uh specifically wanted ones that worked for windows and figma came up so for for any of you that were in on that conversation or interested in wireframing tools uh for windows that are free check out figma figma rook says what's your opinion on stricter linting rules like the airbnb preset for eslint um i i don't know i to me the linting rules i like the idea of linting rules right so you know like on our on a lot of our projects we've set up um some linting uh rules we even have the auto formatting uh that enforces things like that and i like that it brings a lot of consistency in particular the airbnb rules i don't really have a comment on that because it's been a very long time since i've even looked at them i don't really remember too much of what it is so but in general uh you know stricter linting rules i don't have a problem with as long as they don't slow down development significantly so um i don't mind like when we're doing the auto uh you know the auto formatting with standard js and prettier uh i'm okay with that people you know can do whatever they want in terms of how they code and then it just gets when they go to commit it just gets converted to how i want it that's okay um yeah i i would say it would almost depend like on a case by case it depends on like what are those rules in particular and really it's it'd be more of a personal thing if the rules were a lot of things that bother me then i wouldn't like it uh but if the rules are really specific and happen to be like just how i like things i'd probably be okay with it so um i haven't actually given that much thought to it so this is kind of just off the top of my head but i'm not i'm not opposed to strict linting rules but it just really would depend on you know what what are those rules uh in general i uh i like spaces and not tabs so two spaces uh i don't like to use semicolons um i like having properties like if we're talking about react uh you know properties on diff separate lines i think that makes it a lot easier uh to read it does make the code longer but is you should be keeping your components as short as possible so assuming you're doing that it helps with readability and the length isn't too bad so that's my preference uh what do you all think um i mean i like and what do you all think about what we have set up now i mean i i've really been liking the uh kind of the auto formatting rules that we have set up um but you know what do you uh what is your opinion on it i definitely like to know oh igor says we just switched to that those rules they are awful all right so we got one vote for awful in terms of the airbnb rules oh okay so sebastian says i'm looking on when you click on a category or other button in the drawer it shows a red or blue color oh okay yeah it does uh so we'll definitely want to change that you know what i i have noticed that before okay yeah so we definitely want to change that um i'm actually okay with this gray color that you can see right now it's showing uh as opposed to the red uh the gray is fine with me or one of the colors that we're already using in the color palette would also be be okay with me uh let's see so thanks sebastian um okay so sebastian notice it's just for the ones that are a link component okay um yeah i'll have to check that out person says hi i'm new hey how's it going thanks for joining us uh in the in the live chat and uh welcome uh robert says i created a getter if anyone wants to join if we have questions or can help each other outside of the live chat uh jesse let me know if i can share the link yeah go ahead and share the link that's awesome yeah we we actually have a um we have a slack channel too and i um i have not gone through the process to be able to efficiently accept people into that slack channel i know there's a way you can set it up so that'll just automatically let you get an invite and i just haven't really taken the time to do that uh yet uh so if you'd like to be a part of that your best bet maybe is to just send me a um a message let me know what email you want to use to sign up until i can get that and uh but getter sounds cool though to use because then we wouldn't have the issues um in terms of invites that we have with slack blake says my mom would appreciate that i'm not sure what that was in response to uh was that is it something in the chat or something i said so i don't let me know uh sebastian says submitted pull request to fix what you said about the close icon and fixed up the bug of the grid all right awesome sebastian thank you so much that was so quick i really appreciate that oh okay blake says the language all right okay cool so that was i mentioned earlier that i i don't uh use any bad language or cursing on the stream uh one reason being for our younger younger viewers i don't know that their parents would appreciate that uh so yeah um yeah i personally don't have an issue with uh with cursing but i would have an issue with someone cursing around my children so i'm definitely sensitive to that so i'm always um i don't know about you all but i'm always amazed at uh what i hear um some people saying around their children like in public um i don't know i mean i guess it's just what you were used to growing up but um i don't know my mom never said a curse word i only heard my mom say curse word one time her entire life is we we almost got into a wreck and um so she said it uh my dad was he he cares a little bit more but never um almost never anything like really vulgar you know um but anyway yeah i just i think it's a good um it's a good skill to be able to have to control your language based on who your audience is or what situation you're in um i it just kind of shows like um an element of selfcontrol and and being able to control uh your thoughts so i like that i like to see that in a person like that that ability let's see all right uh seems like i've i've gone through everything in the live chat so yep uh if i happen to miss your comment or question i'm sorry about that i do try to get to everything um but uh occasionally i missed something so if i did feel free to reach out to me on on twitter or any other social media that uh you can find me on um or just you know come back for another stream and ask me uh okay blake did ask can you do a live stream on deploying a react website yeah i definitely can oh actually i'm so glad that you um that you said that uh so i have more information for you all uh in regard to this bulletin website we've been working on so for the last um for the last maybe two weeks or more i've been talking about the the login system so currently we have set up a heart should set it up a passwordless login system that uses a link that you get via email what i'd like to do is to tie it in with the university single signon system that they're using for other things um i i talked with one of the meetings that i had today was kind of an unexpected meeting but i ran into some of the people in the i.t department who are in charge of the single signon and i asked them what they thought and uh what's gonna happen is over the christmas break for the university uh so the end of december they're going to switch everyone over to using office 365 for the email and calendars and everything like that at that point everybody at the university is going to have their own microsoft account their on office 365 account and they're going to have to change some of the way they do single signon so what makes the most sense for this project is to wait until that happens uh and then what we probably would end up doing is having something come up that says like sign in with your office 365 account and then we'll have a check server side to say are they using a franciscan.edu address if so then go ahead go ahead with the office 365 sign in if not then you'll give them a message saying hey you need a franciscan address uh i think that that that may end up being the best way to go about it and possibly the simplest way because i'm sure there is already some code out there for using sign in with with office 365 or with your microsoft account and react it seems to me like that would be something that people are doing somewhere so so that's what's gonna happen it doesn't need to happen until you know december probably january probably sometime in january it'll happen so we got a lot of time to think about it and to look for a solution and get that ready but what that does mean is we potentially could wait and not release this newer version that we've been working on until then or we can release it now with our our email link so we're gonna have to make a decision with that either way we have a lot of time now to really work on this and get it to a point where where it's how we like so we may slow down on this switch up to some other projects uh there's definitely time if we want to think about extra features that might be cool um we we have a lot of time so we essentially have like two two months potentially two and a half months now uh to work on this so um i mean in potential this is really it's functional now i mean i i i don't i wouldn't release it right now there's still some things like the filter by date doesn't work um and uh there's there's some things that i would change like design wise just really minor adjustments but potentially like you know this is you know 95 operational at this point anyway basically what i'm trying to say is we got a lot of time to work on this now so if anyone has any ideas for features that could make it better i'm i'm open to considering them i can't guarantee they'll make it in although if you have a feature you think would be really cool and then you also submit a pull request for it then i'm much more likely to bring it in because it's it's already done anyway so i think it'll be cool i'm not excited about this because i think we can really uh make this you know better than the the current version that's live um and uh it'll be exciting so not only will we be able to give users a easier way to sign in that's tied in with all their other university accounts but also we may be able to give them some new features updated design it'll be nice and yeah i think it'll be really nice okay um okay robert also has uh has pasted in this getter channel um live coding with jesse free code camp lobby i'm gonna take this and paste it let's go over here okay cool this is some stuff i had from a previous stream so let me let me go down a bit and uh here this uh this link is for the getter let me uh copy this link over just to make sure that it works before i give it out to everyone it's not working for me what did i do wrong all right is that link working for anyone else uh getter dot i am slash live coding with jesse free code camp slash lobby because i'm getting a 404 whenever i try to use that let me see okay okay i'm gonna wait a minute just to see if that getter link is working for anyone else because i want um not only people in the live chat but the people that are watching this later on i want to be able to give them the right link so also so robert says can you limit the single signon to ip address or can they also use a link on home computer i need to create the exact same thing but limit it to a word computer hmm you know what i'm not i've never really thought about that um yeah i don't know so i don't know does anyone have any thoughts on that how could we limit it to an ip i mean i suppose it's possible uh yeah yeah i would i would suppose it's possible right i mean we're limiting it to email address so if you could grab the ip and just limit it to the ip i suppose that would work but what's the potential for um faking an ip address how hard is that to do i don't know like how uh secure you need it to be here let me um put in the link that's actually working for me right now so this link is working so getter dot im slash live coding with jesse free code camp okay and then once you get there you'll see let me show you uh on the screen here so everybody knows how to how to get in here you'll see this lobby and when you click lobby then you'll be able to get in and and chat um so off to sign in i know i do have a getter login sign in yeah i think i've signed it with github so um you can sign in with twitter or github is it not working there we go okay so here we go yeah um please uh join join up with the getter uh we do still have our slack channel too so um that's available so you know if you want to join that just let me know i'll need your email to invite you but otherwise the getter channel is open and um that'll be cool so feel free you know if i'm not streaming to ask questions in here and um the more people we get in here the better we can help each other out so um okay uh i think that's it let me check the chat one more time and all right so now i have officially gotten through everything and it's it's just in time because i'll have a little bit of time to wrap things up before it's time for me to go home and yeah so this is a pretty good stream we got some things worked out worked out some bugs merged some pool requests hopefully you all have learned a little bit more about git and it's really helpful if you're not using git i highly recommend it it's uh i highly recommend some form of version control and among the forms of version control that i've had exposure to i definitely prefer git so uh try it out if you haven't already tried it out uh you'll well if you force yourself to use it and get used to it you know you'll never want to work without okay all right so i should be back tomorrow sometime around 2 p.m eastern time so until tomorrow have a great day
