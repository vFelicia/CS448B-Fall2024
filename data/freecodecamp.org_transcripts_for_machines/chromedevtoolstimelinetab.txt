all right in this video we are going to be talking about the timeline tab of chrome developer tools when there are performance issues in your web page this is a great place to start because it records everything and you can look in detail from a whole bunch of different ways so we're going to do i'm just going to hit this record button i'm going to refresh the page it is capturing stacks profiles of the javascript memory and paint which is like css so once i do that i'm going to press the stop button okay it downloaded all this information and download it retrieved all this information it says the largest part was scripting of all the aggregated time what's really cool about this is how many ways it'll organize the information it just took it's just in a split second got all this data and it's going to organize it for you the best way that makes sense to you which i think is awesome so in this view you can zoom in on specific things it tells you exactly what scripting in this summary if we go down here this main thread and all these details again it's color coded each one of these green line the blue line the red line has to do with when the document object model is loaded let's go ahead and switch views to this way so here this is so awesome i'm geeking out right now so i'm still so excited about it if i click this first bar which is the biggest one as somebody who's not i'm not an expert in google development tools i'm still learning and i encourage all of you to do the same and just get in there play around click on things see what they mean if you have a question ask it's the best way to learn so this main thread went all the way throughout but here if we click on this save timeline data load timeline data it's going to bring it up in this lower bar here as well so i'm going to make this bigger i won't be able to see much of the main page anymore back to the timeline i click this and it brings up all this information about this one thing it says the type which is evaluate script the total time the self time the link to the script it'll take me exactly i'm going to click this where in the document this is this exact piece of code so if your page has a performance issues maybe his memory is not quite working the way you'd expect it to the whole thing's taking a long time this is a great place to look just to see exactly where the problem is what part of it's taking so long and it you can view that information and use it so efficiently to fix the problem quickly and get your page running smoothly what i want you to take away from this is not everything you're not going to be able to get it all at once get in there and play around with it and see which way works best for you when you're looking at all that information that it has to offer and remember when you're editing a page and editing the information for a page it's not going to save so if you fix a problem in the browser make sure you keep track of what you're doing so you can fix it in your original documents as well
