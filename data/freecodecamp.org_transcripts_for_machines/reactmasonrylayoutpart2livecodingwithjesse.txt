hey everybody it's Jesse and uh happy Monday hope everybody had a good weekend uh at the end of last week I was working from home my streams were not not the same quality in terms of uh video quality so I could barely keep 720p I am back now in my office and uh so the quality in this stream should be a lot better today uh we're going to work on the masonry layout so at some point I think last week we uh we started working on this and we got to the point where it was working and it seemed like that was it uh I'll just have to do a few more things and and it would work but that's not that's not how it went so um I had some problems so I decided to do a part two to show those problems and hopefully fix them Today's show is going to be a little bit shorter than I have been doing so lately I've been doing really long uh shows because the the things we've been trying to get done have been a little bit more complicated and that's it's taking a while but I have a meeting at 3 uh 300 p.m. eastern time so in less than an hour so this definitely has to be less than an hour so I'll try to cut it off and start uh answering questions at at 230 and unless I can get this working sooner than that I don't I don't know maybe uh and then definitely be done you know before 3 so hey everybody we have some people in the live chat uh so how's it going hopefully the uh the lag time will be better too between when I say and do something and when when you all actually see it also have some upgrades um I got that new microphone hooked up on my work machine now so let me know if it doesn't sound good um I'm hoping that this is better sound quality than just the mic that comes with an iMac so if it's not I definitely want to know and and I can return the mic and maybe get a better one or just stick with what I had and oh the other big piece of exciting news that I have is I just upgraded my ram in this iMac so I have double the ram so that's always fun um I I've noticed it is slightly faster so we'll see the real test will be when I have a million tabs open and uh we'll see if it if it still holds up but let me um let me show you the problem that I'm having and where' it go sorry I just had it oh okay so let me show you the issue first I got to go in so we're on a branch so let me do a get checkout so if you're not familiar with Git You can make these branches which are basically like alternate versions of your um of your app or of your site and you can just switch between them so they're like they're like parallel universes in programming uh so if you you can try out some crazy thing on one branch and it doesn't matter if you totally mess it up because you switch back to your master branch and everything is is like it like it should be and you can use that to push um depending on how your deployment is you know that could be the the branch that's stable uh and you actually push out to your server so I'm going to switch to the masonry branch and now we should be able to see I'm going to bring up the site on I'm on my other screen right now bringing it up um what page resources okay so here we go here's the page right and look it looks like masonry is is working this is what we were left with you know last week after we got this going but when I click this tab you can see definitely not working and this is actually even worse than what it normally gives me usually I can at least get like this layout but the Footers back here but uh this time I couldn't even get that let me see yeah okay so here's what I normally get something like this so that's obviously not what we want and also I haven't tested the images yet I'm assuming that'll work it talks about it in documentation for um the react uh component that we use and this is the component in case you you weren't watching uh when we first started this I'm using react masonry component and um this is a react component that that uses the masonry uh Library if you're familiar with masonry or isotope it's used on a lot of sites uh to get you know this kind of kind of effect you know all these are just positioned uh with JavaScript you know and so each one as As you move the page around the position changes so you always have you know kind of nice even spacing between everything so the problem is really I need to refresh the layout somehow uh when the tab is clicked and I think I I ran into this issue on on a site I did before but I wasn't using the react plug uh the react component I was using just masonry um you know just the the JavaScript plugin by itself so I had access to you know to everything that you can do with that so there was a way to just kind of refresh things when you when you press the tab so that's kind of what I need to do at least what I think will fix this problem but I haven't been able to figure out how how to do it uh there's not really at least on on the documentation here I have not seen how to do that I did find something in the issues yeah they have these triggers so like on images loaded on layout complete on remove complete so I don't really need the trigger I will need images loaded at some point but I don't need the uh the trigger what I need is you know that that refresh so does that make sense all right I'm just I'm checking the live chat just for a second so I have uh more people in here now uh talking so oh okay uh Sebastian says there's some weird Statics on oh you know what I have forgot to turn my fan off let me turn the fan off and see if that helps uh it's a little bit warm in here today so hopefully that that helps it was a oscillating fan so I imagine when the fan was blowing right on the mic uh that probably made the noise oh okay saying so it's probably not the fan it was some other s okay let me definitely not the fan so all right so if it's still happening oh someone's saying it was the fan let me I'm going to do a little bit more at least with that mic and just see if it keeps happening uh if not if it's gets really bad let me know and then I'll just uh switch to the uh to the internal mic and um yeah I'm I'm not sure it wasn't a really expensive mic uh so I read some of the reviews uh on Amazon said that it was better than the internal mic so I thought I'd give it a shot and um we'll see maybe uh maybe I need to go with something a little bit more expensive a little better quality okay so what I'm going to do is um I'm going to go to these issues and trying to I should have um I think I still have the issue open on my laptop and I should have checked that out layout complete H that's not it's not exactly what I want to do um can't remember what the issues are I may be able to just look at what tabs are open on my laptop right now and just open it from there there we go so I'm just going to open the um the issues from my tabs all right nice that's a nice feature if you're using Chrome and you're logged in on multiple devices uh you can see what's open on all of them so uh I on my other screen I just opened some some of the issues that that had to do with at least some somewhat had to do with the issue that we're dealing with okay so this is what let me bring this over this is what I found that I think might help so and I couldn't get this to work uh maybe late last week I was working on it and basically you can bind this instance of masonry and then you can you should be able to do something like this you know this masonry on layout complete and you know do something so I couldn't get I couldn't get it to the point where I could bind it and actually access this it kept telling me you know like this you know doesn't exist so let me check let's go to our code and we're on the resources page let me make this a bit bigger for you all and I don't really need this right now and I don't need I don't need that side pen all right so P that'll give us more space okay so you see we have M these uh components now on just the first two tabs so the the tab that has everything and then the the tab that just has the audio cards uh you know we have masonry here we're going to try to add these we're going to try to add this on one of them just to see if we can get something get something going okay um then we should be able to call something like this so let's just let's just copy this I know this this isn't exactly what we want to do right now but this will be a good first step uh so I'm just going to go up here and put actually I already have component did Mount so I don't need to copy the whole thing okay so there's masonry on layout complete let's all right so I guess we'll do we we will put a layout complete Handler and let's just do something simple like um all right let's save that and hopefully hopefully we'll see that uh I was just wondering about with server side rendering maybe um no it shouldn't worry because well we'll see we'll test it uh there we go back here and I'm going to inspect this so we can see the console and first I want to click just to see if there's any difference now so you see whatever tab that's pretty odd now I'm have I have these things appearing H what did we do here that's really weird I'm going to refresh this because i' I've never had that I don't know why that's happening okay I'm going to check the live chat see if someone did I put okay uh so good uh so Patrick in the live chat mentioned I must have that in the in the jsx where do I have that should be oh you're right I I must have accidentally put that oh I know what I did um I pressed uh the the wrong key when I was trying to close this pain the um command slash like um I guess it be like the back slash I can't ever remember which one's forward slash and which one's back slash but one of them makes a comment and the other one toggles this pain on the side so I pressed the wrong one and didn't realize that I commented that okay so that fixes that uh not really our problem that we're trying to deal with but good catch on that Patrick thank you okay I did have a question about masonry is but it looks like it got answered um in the live chat so uh in case you are just joining um M and you have the same question masonry layout is I mean this this is what it is what it ends up looking like where you you can have uh content of different heights uh you can even have different widths if you wanted to um and then it all Lays out nicely with you see there's always uh the same space between them you know on all sides uh and it you know it keeps that space no matter what uh so you see as we do this our our width and height changes but it still it still works so that's basically a masonry layout so and then there's a JavaScript plugin called masonry that we're also using all right so what I'm not getting is any any logging from what we wanted here so we wanted this console log layout complete Handler this layout complete Handler okay so this should have it should have done something although now I don't remember when we do I just want to test this because I'm not sure with our server side rendering if I should even see this on the on the client side maybe if I um maybe if we do our client side routing and uh then we'll see that I'll give it a try either way so first I'll I'll do a hard refresh and this should give us the um the completely rendered h HML it's assuming my I'm going to just restart this so I still I know I've said this several times but I still haven't figured out what the issue is with why uh my Dev server just keeps like hanging um it's starting to get pretty annoying so I think I'll I'll figure it out okay so I did get let me bring this over here and show you that I did actually get that console log so so we can see that that actually did work so what should have happened is we should have got those three exclamation points that are in that are here layout complete Handler I'm just doublechecking that I spelled everything right yeah so this should have worked because our layout our layout should have been complete um I wonder if there's some issue with me using uh two instances of of masonry let's see let me um I'm going to switch it to this one just to check you know maybe see if we have any luck with the with the first one instead of the second one the um the hot module reloading does some weird things sometimes like that okay so I did get it this time so that we so we got these exclamation points this time uh so that's what we wanted I'm going to click click around here see if I can get him again scroll up oops wrong page we're on resources right there we go that's why I didn't get it okay so I did get it again so both when we do um I'm going to do a hard refresh double check that great so the client side routing we still get this so it it Bas so it works for some reason though it did not work when we had it on the second masonry element that's not good news so you need to be able to use this multiple times or else I have to rethink how this is laid out plan B could be if I need to if I can't get this to work with with multiple um instan of this masonry component on the same page then if I need to all of them could be within one masonry component and then we could do some sort of sorting some kind of sorting where I can pick um pick the categories and they all just all the cards are just shown in in head I don't know if masonry can do that right off the bat I'll have to check I know isotope which is a JavaScript plugin built by the same guy that built masonry isotope does do some cool things with sorting so I have to check that out isotope though is not free to use so may have to buy buy a um a license for that uh and then see if it works with this with this component uh I'm going to see thoughts actually uh bro bromo Matic uh says were you calling both of them this masonry actually no I was just using one at a time my next step was going to be okay do we need to call these different things um yeah I I guess that could be the next step let's see if we can yeah let's see if we can do something like that where we just give this a um I'm just going to put a two on the end I probably will not keep that keep that naming but uh for now we'll see if it works all right so let's see what we're going to get wow I don't know I really need to um figure out what is going on with my wow okay all right well I can at least see something I'm still getting this but I'm not getting um that second one and what force Reflow ask JavaScript all right so I haven't really seen this happen before so I'm guessing that whatever I just did here with this is not going to work out yeah I mean it's not like I did anything different all I did was just add this in a second time and then up here yeah I just added this there's nothing in here that I see that really should have caused this so um let me check one do another page just to verify that it's it's something on that page that's doing it actually maybe it's maybe I do need to restart the server um all right we'll try it one more time I don't really have at this point much hope that I can get both of them working so it may have to just think of some something else while I'm okay that should be up now Vlad asked Sublime Tex or adom which program better to use thanks uh I've never use Sublime so I can't really say I do I like Adam it is I've noticed Adam is slower than like Visual Studio code uh so I can't compare it to Sublime you know myself I've heard that sublime's a lot faster I mean I I like Adam I'm open to switching to something else though it's just hard to switch when you have all your packages set up the way you want them Okay it definitely is that page so let's take this out then we at all right since since the way that is given in the documentation to Target a specific component seems like at least at this point it only works if I put it on the first instance of this component then I think I'm this is a dead end that I'm trying to go down here um so we need to switch it and try something else okay so I'm just going to I'm G to kind of mess everything up here yeah so since this first instance is really all I need it'll it'll contain everything there are reasons that I wanted to split it out like this one of them being that um there's a limit by default on how many um how many posts you can get back when you make an API call to Wordpress which is what the uh all this content is where it's coming from so uh I thought it would just be a lot easier if at some point I could make separate calls for each one of these but there are other ways to get around that and I think that's an easier problem than trying to dig into this component and see see what I need to do so let's oops I forgot to take out the stuff at the top and something up here was messing this up so hopefully this will work now great okay so that works um now we have everything here of course these are not going to work anymore so what we need to do then is have some other way of switching these out uh which I think we can we can figure that out in where' I put that okay so let me search I know I saw somebody else pretty sure so somebody else how to filter select item just like example there we go I think that's the one we need it's SL slow all right H okay so it looks like there's not a builtin filter like with with isotope um all right so here's what I think we'll have to do then let me check this one as well was that one isotope Maybe so it looks like they do have a branch that works with isotope all right let me go back I'm going to check the live chat see if anyone has any ideas okay uh bromo mtic says maybe have one masonry component and clicking on the the all audio you know video buttons will change as the filter inside that one that one instance yeah I think that's that's probably what what needs to happen okay so let me look at I I want to see what the uh Json looks like here to see what I can what I can filter by I don't remember what I called everything so we're going to take a look at that okay I'll bring this over so you can see what I'm looking at um here's our here's the data that we're getting uh we're actually not getting this much I am narrowing it down a bit um you can see we're getting that up here uh so we're making this call here and we're actually just getting the title and then these custom fields that we set up um so in these custom Fields okay so I do have a field called type so this is what we need to check for okay so let's so I think I do want them all to show up at first so that this is going to stay the same this is going to be the first the first load uh what's going to happen then is when we click so let's add a click where's our tabs oh here there sorry I was looking at the wrong one this is what we want this is has all of them here's our tabs uh so let's see we'll put a click on click that's how it is in react right it's just it's on click I'm I'm checking the uh live chat just quickly Thor says no idea about frontend development especially not with react can't help sorry it's all right um uh Mark ask what is isotope okay so isotope is um just a a JavaScript uh plugin that sorts out you can sort out uh HTML elements um in like a grid so think like um like Pinterest like how it's all laid out in a grid like this uh so like this but isotope lets you like let's say I'd click on these and it would just sort them on the Fly uh so they would all you know come in and come out and Resort and everything uh really easily it can do other stuff too but that's mainly what I've used isotope for yeah actually Sebastian has a good point plan C I can just use masonry client side that's actually not that's not a terrible idea uh that's that might be a good idea I'm going to take a second to just think what would be the fastest way so I the the most to me the best way would be to me to figure out how to do this like the react way right uh with with within that context but a way to do it that would definitely work and it might it might make sense to just get this working right now uh and then work on the other stuff later on would be just to use masonry as on its own without being you know imported you know via this react masonry component um and then then I would have access to everything let's just do that because otherwise I don't think there's any way I'm going to get this to work right now since I well since I've never done it before and I've done the other way before so if I have any chance of getting this working today I doesn't have to be working today but I'd like for it to be working today then I'm going to go with Sebastian's suggestion so here's what we're going to do we're going to go to Masonry there we go we go to the Mason website and I'm going to just pull in everything from the CDN for now and because that'll be the fastest that way I don't have to download anything and we can just try it out and see if it works so I'm going to throw this it I guess it doesn't even really matter where I put this um just put it in here uh let me take out this react masonry component and let's take out where we've used masonry here and let's just make this a div and I don't even need this div actually let's just take it out okay so we don't need that div and column okay so we're going to S on the column um let's grab I think that's it I think that's all we need let's let's remove this I'm just trying to get rid of everything so we don't get any errors don't need that okay um so this is wow what did I do and I need to add these these other things in as well at some point um so we need to add back our categories because we're going to be able to use uh the the tabs like we were hopefully um we can get that to work so let me I'm just going to copy and paste on my other uh monitor I'm just going to copy and paste from the get repo what we have on the master Branch because that'll that's basically what we need I either could do that or I could just hold down you know command Z for like a minute and it would probably get us back to where we wanted but I'd still have to change out the uh masonry components okay Patrick said there was some audio static so it it for sure was not the fan which which is what we thought uh that it wasn't the fan anyway so I may be returning this microphone because I definitely don't need the static all right the microphone I really wanted was not the one that I got anyway so I don't know if I can justify buying the one that I really wanted but I think it's like a 100 bucks it's not like an insane amount of money but you know it's not really necessary I think everybody could hear me with the builtin mic all right so we have here's everything and oh man that was ugly uh they just copied in really really ugly looking so that's better okay so let's save that and just verify that this is working oh that's what was happening I left that on click and there U sorry I'm scrolling around really fast I hope I'm not making anybody like motion sick that would probably make me motion sick if I were watching I do I need to keep an eye on the time and not forget about that I should have set an alarm but I did not uh okay 242 I can go for maybe about 10 more minutes it doesn't look like there's really any um any questions as I'm kind of scrolling around or at least I did answer a few questions as we were going so uh so we may not even really have a a kind of question answer uh session at the end of this video like we normally do uh because it doesn't look like there's any questions if you do have questions uh throw them in there now uh into the live chat and then that way I know and I'll um I'll try to end early enough so that I could get to them and uh as always if you uh don't get your question in in the live chat if you're watching later or something then you can okay this is it this this looks bad but this is what it should look like uh then you can always put it in the comments on the video or you can uh message me on Twitter and I'll answer you uh whenever I get a chance so I do answer everybody all the comments and everything and any messages anybody sends me I do answer it sometimes it's a few days before I can get to it but uh I definitely try to answer uh every question all right so that's what we want it to look like right now so now since we've imported uh masonry here now let's initialize it I don't really want to initialize it with jQuery even though I could I'd rather just use uh van uh JavaScript cuz I'm not I guess I'm let me grab this element argument if you yeah this is what I need okay so we'll do it in component did Mount um let's call this and then make this actually do I need to say I probably need to do that right let me know if that's uh the case but I think I do need to do that um now we can paste this in here and and I can change these cons just to keep it consistent and the query selector is it's going to be row no yeah it will be it will be row because each one is going to be its own sorry I'm thinking out loud here um normally you would have you know one you know one encompassing element for everything but in this case we're going to have multiple so yeah it would be row actually I should just look to save time I did this on a project where I was using react I'm pretty sure I was doing nearly the same thing I didn't have four tabs I think I just did it with two uh but I should check that before I try to redo what I what I've already done um that would be a waste of time so let me see and I think that one is um a private repo so if you won't be able to see that one if you wanted to follow along yeah it is private but this one that I'm working on now is public so um you can check that out if you want to uh links in the description all right all right so let me bring this over just so you can see you see what I'm seeing let me go over here um this might be a little small sorry about about that but there's a lot of stuff so I think we need it need to be able to see most of this okay so I'm bringing in h here we go so I actually have named I have quite quite a lot of things going on here so we have this container wow this kind of looks like a mess I don't know what I was thinking um probably I think I had a lot of this from an earlier project that I just copied and and uh so this is not all necessary but it was easy okay so I I do have the basic structure is pretty much the same although it looks like I've kind of messed with the the normal layout here and the the container for everything is a column instead of a row so I don't want to do that again what I really want to see though is how I've set up I to uh to work here so you see I do have two of these and it looks like I just kind of have the container inside what would this would be my row um normally yeah I don't know why I have this this stuff nested so deeply but I'm going to go to uh I'm going to have to go into the the J JavaScript because I did not put that in the component let's see all right let me let me see where am I at upload search okay I think this is it I'm going to take this off the screen I just want to double check and make sure there's nothing in this file that should not be public no I don't think there is all right so I might actually be using isotope and not Masonry which is not a huge deal uh cuz they're similar enough but it looks like I am using as the item selector the column and as the container I'm using isope container so I think if I just put you know basically the row here I'll I'll give the row a class and then as the item Ed column that should work yeah so let's do that and then that'll be that'll probably be the last last thing we could do so we can at least just see if this works and I don't know we'll see if okay Andrew ask can we get your uh GitHub user script theme so yeah my theme for GitHub is it's the GitHub dark script uh and I'm using um tamper monkey to run that so I it's not a Custom Custom script that I did so if you look up GitHub dark script I think there's instructions for how to use it in different browsers uh with different plugins so uh check that out uh it's really cool there's also lots of options you can customize it if you want I'm just using the base um you know the default options right now all right so let's do let's give these rows let's go let's make a masonry containers and then I think we should be good within that to say that the just the columns so want this to be masonry container and then this one is going to be the column okay let's see what happens when we do that let's let me try to refresh no I really need to fix just fix this this Dev server and figure out why it's not I've never had this happen on any other sites that I've used next to build this is the first time this has happened so I'm not not really sure what's going on okay oh okay so something's happened this isn't exactly what I want um so I'm going to have to work on it a bit you know I don't want this I obviously want this in four columns but we can see is it not working on there maybe it's just working on the first one all right so it's definitely it looks like it's it's doing something on the first one and we'll verify this by inspecting it and checking out yeah the positioning so we can see like it's being positioned here uh so that's it let's see if it's doing it on any other tabs it might not be I might have to H H yeah so oh yeah definitely need some work but at least we got it to initialize we just need to work on the um just some of the settings that we can use uh so basically I don't know if I'll do a part three to this I might just do it it looks like there's not like a ton of interest in this at least let me know if if I'm wrong here but uh just based on like the number of viewers we're getting it's a little bit lower than normal so I'm wondering I mean maybe it's just Monday and everybody's busy but um maybe there's just not a lot of interest in this topic so maybe there might not be a part three maybe I might just um I'll just get it working and then if you're interested you can check out the the uh repo and uh ask me questions if you want to uh but basically if you were going to do this if you want of the next steps The Next Step would simply be um to so first of all I'll probably need to add another um like a container element or something because these columns are getting messed up I need to keep these column classes or I need to somehow I need to set the columns correctly like like I can't have this column with here um I should never left that in uh so I need to set it so that it respects oh cool there we go so just fix that I guess I needed to respect the columns that we had that looks nice that's actually working so so that's that's fixed great so basically all you need to do now is just put some click uh handlers on each one of those tabs these these tabs here and then each time a click happens yeah see that's not that's not work see each time a click happens it would then um kind of re init refresh uh what's going on with um with masonry all right so we'll have to redo kind of like this thing for each one of these on click so worst case scenario it actually destroys the first instance of it and then reinit on this one and then gets destroyed so I don't know hopefully I can just do like a refresh but that's probably what needs to be done um off to check the docs again it's been a while since I looked at the docs for masonry but that's the process so that's what I'm going to try and uh that's what I'll work on probably tomorrow morning so let me check quickly and see if there's any questions here at the bottom and then I got to go um go to my meeting at 300 which is in 4 minutes luckily the meeting is just like like 10 ft from my door uh Mark Twain asks have you ever used Google uh metadata in your project is that an improvement for SEO um I'm not sure Google met uh I probably won't be able to explain this I don't have enough time because I need to ask what you mean do you mean just like the normal metadata like title tag and um descript SEO description or like the actual meta tags I don't use like The Meta um like the keywords I don't use those at all I don't think they have any benefit to SEO anymore but title tags definitely uh have a big benefit descriptions don't really uh benefit your ranking but it's good for like actual humans when they read that um let's see yeah uh bromo MX says we should totally do it the react way yeah I definitely do want to do it the react way I'd really love to get it working like that um so probably I can do it like I think I can do it the react way with um with masonry uh I can like import it probably what I should do is like install it with npm and then import it into uh my component uh and then set things up like that so I think I could do it in a more react friendly way than I'm doing it right now but it's not like it's not terrible right now I think it's going to work uh we just don't okay Sebastian says it's kind of pointless to make another live stream just to add that onclick thing so um the git link for this project is in the description for this video romatic says can bring back the masonry component add filter prop to the internal State update filter value after clicking on the tabs and you could use something like string match inside the filter all right I'm definitely going to check that out and take a look at it I got to go to my meeting right now though uh thanks for watching and uh I'll be back tomorrow 2 P.M
