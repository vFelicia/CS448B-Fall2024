in this video i'll be going over an example of the distributive law so if you look at a intersection b union c that is supposed to equal a intersection b union a intersection c so if we can if we decompose this equation and look at let's start with a intersection b then that equals singleton 3 based off from these predetermined sets and then if we look at a intersection c that equals the set 1 3. so the union of these two is going to be the set containing elements one and three now if we look at b union c that equals the set containing elements one three beta and gamma and if we take the intersection of that set with a we're left with a set containing elements one and three which is good because now we've shown that this is equal to that now if we look at a union b intersection c that's supposed to equal a union b intersection a union c so if we analyze b intersection c that equals singleton 3 and then a union b right here equals 1 3 x beta gamma and a union c equals the set containing elements 1 3 and x so when we take the intersection of these two sets we're left with the set containing elements 1 3 and x and when we take the union of b intersection c with a we're left with the second containing elements one three and x which is exactly what we wanted so yeah we've shown that these are in fact true
