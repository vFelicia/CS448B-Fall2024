hey everybody uh welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're not gonna do what i said we were going to do yesterday which was try out a new javascript cms and i'll explain why in a minute but what we are going to do is pull out some more data from our sql server database and we're going to use our our node.js code that we that harshit wrote and we're going to put it into my sql database using the wordpress api uh we'll pro we'll need to make some custom post types so we'll be working with a wordpress plugin uh we'll bring over that one that we have used on some some other projects that we made and we'll modify that to fit our our first custom post type we'll make will be um faculty so that's what we'll work on the only other thing that i think we'll need to do is we'll have to do something about the way the html is getting pulled in to wordpress so i'm looking up some things on stack overflow that you all had had mentioned last week at some point so we'll try to get that working but we should be able to get a decent amount of work done today i don't have any meetings so we can have a kind of a normal length stream here so for sure i want to try to get into pomodoro sessions of work with questions in between and after and uh depending on how it's going uh maybe we'll go longer uh we'll see and oh i don't have my headphones my music on let's get that going first uh hey everyone seen the live chat blake's mentioning so i did just get a haircut so anyway um yeah so i feel nice and fresh with my hair cut uh if does anyone use spotify that's watching uh so i guess spotify just came out with um well within the last week sometime the your top songs of 2017 playlist uh so i don't know it's pretty fun i definitely wouldn't want to share it with everybody because i'd be embarrassed i'm somewhat embarrassed by some of the songs that it says that i listen to the most but but it is fun going back through and uh projects i was working on when i was listening to certain songs all the time so that's really fun uh just to remember like oh yeah i listened to that all the time when i was working on you know this website so it did bring back memories uh anyway so if you haven't uh looked that up yet uh check out see if you can find your top songs playlist on your spotify account it's it's a lot of fun all right let's uh jordan asks what cms are you porting from the cms is called ektron and i'm not a big fan of it i haven't had a lot of good experiences using ektron uh and it's old and the company that made it got bought out by another company so i don't really think it has much of a future so we need to to be done with it so let i me really need this right now i don't need that let's see where we're going all right i was working on this earlier but i don't think i need it no we don't need that i shouldn't have anything unsafe so i'm gonna not save that um we don't need any of this none of that none of that we need that sorry i just i was not prepared at all i i ran into one of my former students from when i used to teach high school uh when i was getting a haircut and i talked to her for a while afterwards so it set me back a little bit i didn't get as much time to prepare as i normally do um let's see oh you got um question from all right i know how i was supposed to pronounce this on amhel is that how i pronounce it angel let me know i'm trying to pronounce it i'm trying to remember anyway uh asks what's up with the branch on gatsby uh the brainstorm gatsby i haven't worked on but it's i'm leaving it open and i want to try to work on it um i really wanted to try to work on them both a little bit the next branch and the gatsby branch and then test them out and see which one was faster i still would like to do that but realistically i i've got to be conscious of the amount of time we have to complete this project there's still a lot of work to be done and it needs to be done by february so if if we have to i don't know wait and finish that branch like afterwards then that can be pushed so basically it's something that's not necessary for us to do this project can certainly work and we know it can work with next so i think our best bet is to if we need to for time just work on the branch that is using next and work on the gatsby branch later some other time for testing purposes okay blake's asking about question on the fcc slack channel i don't have the slack channel open right now um maybe i can i can take a look at it later on though uh all right so we will need to log into this uh tell me this password got saved why is it not there we go all right okay great so we brought these posts in last time and uh as you can see they came in like actually did it come in right this time that's interesting whoa all right i don't know if any of y'all just caught that so we were having a problem before where um we brought all this data in and these tags weren't there uh so you could see like root list view image detail view image like you know all these custom tags weren't there and we were getting a different view uh so what i just did was if i go to visual and then i go back then you can see all those tags are gone and they're all switched around but if i just go back out to posts and i come back in here you can see the tags are there again so i think we're okay with that the the i'm assuming what would happen is if i switched to visual edited something and then updated it that we would lose these tags so at least this is good news because at first we can still import data without having to fix that problem of the the tags getting uh getting changed but whenever i open this up and let other people come in and start editing i would have to um i'd have to fix that issue so that's actually good because now we don't have to deal with that on today's stream which i kind of i wanted to to fix that before i even started streaming today but i just ran out of time okay cool so at this point then let's let's build a plugin to make some custom post types and then we'll install that plugin here on our test wordpress install and then we'll pull over some data yeah okay let's do that so the first thing we'll need to do is grab the plugin from a previous project i'm trying to think if i have that plugin available on github i don't think i do um i could probably just grab it from wordpress install we've already worked with um catechetical institute yeah so i'm gonna grab it from catechetics.com okay uh let's find yep this is it this is our project if you see my head bobbing a little bit don't laugh at me i'm listening to some some music that has a really good beat so i just can't help it all right so let me throw this plug in here and let's change this to php so we can get that syntax highlighting wonderful and i definitely need to make this bigger so everyone can see i don't need this right now and oops let me start my timer i'm gonna start this pomodoro timer um harsh is saying try custom posts ui is that a plugin is that a different plugin i was kind of thinking i just use our current plugin that we've already built okay all right so we can just grab basically we can just change change these for now just the faculty and actually we don't the plural of faculty is faculty i mean we could say faculty member okay so that's all we need for now and then we can get rid of all the rest of this oops i need to keep that it's at the bottom so and why did you do that resource that's weird okay um so it's gonna support obviously a title editor should we have an excerpt yeah i'm gonna have the expert excerpt in there just in case definitely want a thumbnail okay that looks good post slug faculty we definitely want to show in the api showing menu okay that looks good down here with our taxonomies this is do we need this google map api no i don't think we'll need this so let's get rid of this google map api we use this on on that catechetical institute project okay change title of value title for team members all right are we gonna need to do this all right i'm going to comment this out for now because we might need it uh but just not right now so let me explain what this code's doing now that i've kind of cut out the stuff that we don't need and i'm going to comment this for now as well oops did that not yeah i don't think i'm going to do custom taxonomy right now we'll see all right let me explain a little bit and then i'll decide about that so here's what we're doing here we've created a plugin um a wordpress plugin so we've just given it a name and description you know just some basic stuff here at the top and within this function create new type right we're creating new post types so uh we've created a post type with the name of faculty right and then we've just given it some some options here so um a singular name uh this is the name of for the the add new button so it'll say add new faculty um the edit so basically we're just given the names that all these labels on the post will have right and down here we're registering this type and we're giving it you know some options so we want it to have a title that can be edited and an editor excerpt thumbnail we want it to be shown in the rest api we wanted to show in the menu in the admin panel we've given it a slug of faculty right so it's pretty straightforward you know how this works you definitely need to know what the right you know words are to use uh and then down here you know we're just creating that type so so that's it i mean that's the main point down here though uh you can create custom taxonomies and we may want to do this but first i i just want to make sure that this works and we've done it right and then we'll get to we'll get to these so i'm going to just comment these out for now and then we may come back it might not be a bad idea to make a custom type for the faculty members that says their department oops all right so i'm just going to copy all of this and let's add a new plugin actually maybe i need to see if i can add a new plugin like this yeah i need to upload it first before i can i don't think i can i don't know you appear you're making direct addiction yeah i understand yeah let me make let's save this first um yeah we may as well save it as part of this project so the custom post types.php and then let's go in here all right so we made a zip file for this which is what wordpress wants let's go back to our plugins directory upload this plugin no 158 oh man this this little ending piece right there all right let's go uh can we edit this editor all right let's see if this works now i'm 57. i think i commented something out that i should not have all right let's try this one more time so i think that was it no all right um let's see hmm oh no this is a problem okay now i do need that to be closed somewhere i don't think i ever closed it that's close yeah that should be closed hmm i'm gonna check my other version of this plugin yeah i did miss one um here okay oops all right let's edit this one more time this should work yay okay it worked all right so now we have this post type called faculty we can go in and add new faculty right and the info should come in here so this is where where we had imported these posts before that were faculty members now we're going to put it in here so this is all we need for now we're not going to do any custom post types yet just to try to get all this data in here and quickly enough to get the site finished on time if we have time or potentially even after the site launches we can go back in and and make some custom post types it'll clean things up a bit and make it a lot easier to edit later on but for now we're just going to dump everything into this you know kind of wysiwyg editor all right now let me now let me go through we do need hmm we may be able to just put a category in here if i make it so that this supports categories i won't make a custom taxonomy all right let's let's see category how do you spell category what is wrong with me um yeah that's it category there we go all right that should do it the uh process for updating the plugins is not spectacular uh i'm sure there's a better way to set it up but for right now i'm not i shouldn't need to edit this that much okay plugins oops editor all right let's see if we can now put categories in we cannot hmm all right maybe i need to oops all right so it is in there uh so maybe there's that's like i need to look up how how to do that then or make a custom uh taxonomy all right so we also have our um our code that we use to migrate things over so we're gonna use this again we're gonna do it just like we did before let's see yeah just like we did before post data but we are going to need to change some of this so that we're not we don't want this to go to posts we now want it to go to faculty let's see oh you know what i think the um the url was in our config which let me switch off here for a minute so i can't show everyone the config because then you'll see all the passwords and stuff uh so let's let's change this up a bit yeah we'll change this up okay so in our config we were bringing uh like the full url now i do not want to do that anymore we're going to bring let's see all right okay so let me switch back all right so here's what i've changed before uh everything was contained in this wp uri meaning it had the word posts in there so that everything that we were putting through here to be sent to wordpress was was called was being added in as a post we don't want it to be though what we want to see is we don't have the option to make things you know basically whatever whatever we want it to be in this case faculty uh so let's give it i guess we can give it a shot at this point let's see how much time we have six minutes okay and i know i haven't uh checked the live chat in a bit i will as soon as this timer runs out um where are we at i'm just running through to make sure we have everything we need all right we were trying to make the category faculty did we accomplish that last time or not i want to double check see if these posts actually had a category i think we did not i think they ended up not having a category yeah so they came through as uncategorized now before we bring it in we really should get this put in here as as faculty because no not as faculty we want the type of faculty because if we pull too much data in then we'll have to go in and manually add that and i don't i don't really want to do that that's going to take too much time if we figure out how to do this right now then it'll save a lot of time in the long run so let's let's check out what we would have hmm actually i can't check that out now we have no content in the faculty um let's see let's let's put in a create taxonomy you should do it like this now you think yeah i think this is a good way to do it all right so we're gonna make a new taxonomy for the faculty and so you don't want it to be named resource categories um all right okay so we've given these are all the labels that are going to appear in the admin section of wordpress and then here we've we've just added some options uh giving it a slug we want it to show up in the admin menu we want it to show up in uh in our rest api so let's save that copy it over uh into wordpress plugins plugins okay let's see if it worked maybe it's not working because the plugin is still running oh it's wrong thing let's deactivate that for a second okay less than a minute now i'll go back to the live chat check out what's going on there all right let's go back in here activated see if it's done anything and it has not worked um okay i'm pretty sure i know what i did wrong uh but my time is up uh let's see all right there we go okay so see now we have faculty department uh so philosophy so we have the faculty department philosophy now so this will work just like categories work on a regular wordpress post but we've now made it custom so all right so that's how you do it uh and this we have enabled the hierarchy which is kind of nice we may or may not use this but uh in case we need to at some point we have it okay great now let's take a five minute break and i'm gonna go back to the live chat looks like there's a lot going on in here so let me scroll up and get through as much as i can okay harsh i see your um you're posting stuff about the custom post type ui thing uh i will check it out um yeah i'll check that out i found i've looked at this one before and to be honest so here's here's the reason why i didn't want to go with a plugin before one when i can just like copy and paste and do this like quickly it ends up being faster i know it didn't seem that fast before because i had a missing bracket and and i missed that but now that i've gotten through that those are mistakes that i'm not likely to repeat in the near future so it's actually faster for me to just copy and paste these uh whereas if i went with a visual editor i would have to fill out all the fields every time uh so i don't like that also my philosophy when it comes to wordpress plugins are if i can do something efficiently myself then it guarantees that i know for sure what's in that plugin and it's as lean as possible so you know plug in this post type plugin which i'm sure is is very nice and effective it does come with a lot of extra stuff like you know all the stuff that determines what the ui is right and where we were we have no ui uh involved here no admin ui so anyway if doing it this way ends up taking way too long i'll check out that that other plugin and we are actually going to use a plugin when we try to make custom fields because the plugin does save a lot of time but custom post types and taxonomies aren't really that hard to do you know we have the boilerplate right here and we just change the names and that's pretty much it okay you seek thanks explanation okay looks like there is some confusion about what i was writing so this is php and um that's so wordpress is written mostly php so i was making a wordpress plugin that has a category that we can pull our data into so we're not really going to do anything with php for the rest of the rest of the stream this is node so we're going to be mainly working with node and with um sql queries uh for the rest of the stream now i probably won't really show making any more custom post types on a stream uh since i've already demonstrated it once and i know we've done it in previous streams then i think it'll be fine just to for me to do that stuff you know else um different times during the day uh dr dan says the code looks really difficult um yeah honestly if i had to write stuff like that from scratch you know i'm assuming you're talking about the php um then it would be difficult but i mean really when i first made this plugin all i did was copy what how this was already being done elsewhere i don't remember where i first got this from maybe from the docs i don't know um and then just filled in what i needed right so uh it's not it's not that difficult as long as you you that's why i kind of left this stuff commented out so we have an example that i i don't touch that's not messed up of something that works um if you were talking about this node stuff uh this is somewhat difficult a little bit more advanced heart should actually made this uh so it wasn't me i just modify it you know slightly okay harsh should i see you were saying that i might need to use uh plural in our here instead of category i i could use categories yeah that might have worked i guess it doesn't matter now since we already added that custom the custom i think is the nicer way to go because then it's it's more obvious what is wanted when it's called departments instead of categories uh so it was probably better that i went that way anyway i was just trying to do categories so that it would be a little bit faster uh dr dan asked do we have to use sql prepared statements with node.js is it even possible yeah so let's see oops wrong file um yeah so we're using sqlize which lets us put in just basic sql queries and it basically so that we can use sql queries in node right and these are if the syntax looks weird to you uh we had some issues with the syntax so there are some differences with the syntax between sql server for microsoft and my sql so if if some of these look different it's probably due to that just a difference in syntax all right uh didn't my timer rang but i'm almost to the bottom here the live chat so let me see if i can just get through this last few things here um before we move on let's see street fighter motorcycles says 37 watching but only nine likes unacceptable audience members uh yeah i don't i don't think i can even i can't see the likes from the admin panel for the um uh the control room for the live streaming so anyway i'm not really sure what the likes do do their likes play a role in i don't know how you appear like in searches or something i don't i'm not exactly sure i mean it's nice when people like the videos i feel good when it happens but um i'm not sure what role they play in in the overall ranking of videos 13 likes now nice thanks for all the likes dr dan asks if anyone was from america here i know we have a lot of people from america that watch in the stream uh i am from america so people from california colorado georgia texas awesome all right i gotta read this out so this will be probably the last thing that i i read out before we start again with the code um rook said i thought taxonomy was something with dead animals john b says that's taxidermy so that was pretty funny rook i suspect that rook may have known all along it was still pretty funny all right someone from peru welcome well up to 21 likes now awesome someone from poland welcome and portugal all right we have people from all over it i love that uh okay so let's set our timer again do another pomodoro session and this time we're gonna try to bring put our data into the correct post type which is faculty and we're going to try to add this category not a faculty but in this case these are philosophy faculty so we're gonna try to add the word philosophy in here so here's what hmm we're gonna need to see i'm going to need to see how this how this comes in so here actually here's the problem i think all right let's let me um let's do this wp uh what's the camera what the url is vp json me too is that it no restaurant post is it post no um what is it called wpg lwp all right i forgot trying to figure out what the rest route is there we go nothing seriously whoops added extra slash okay um okay here's the the issue with categories so when you get data from the rest api in the terms of the categories it it's an array but it's an array of the category ids so i'm wondering if we need to create our custom types first get the id and then send the id there uh harshit saying in the live chat check out the api docs for custom post um yeah so let's check that out those types type hmm okay um i really want to see all right so this is that test post that i just made and i want to see okay so faculty department is here and the category philosophy is three all right so let's just grab this this whole thing and put that in here okay so content okay let's try that all right so let's save that and i think that's it and that's all we'll need all right so now this let's run this i still don't know what the shortcut is for the console or the integrated terminal um all right so let's try melissa's migrate yeah uh hmm up someone which i don't like but that's not the end of the world if that's the only thing that's that's being changed there may be other things changing it's hard to read it like this there's a lot of breaks in in the middle let's see if we have those no we don't okay so it is actually adding in a lot of other stuff so we're gonna have to fix that i suppose or at least see how bad it looks if it still looks okay even with these additions then i guess it's fine for now wonderful all right that's great all right let me let me just go back to the live chat briefly to see if i messed anything up that i didn't notice before we try to do more of this well oh no is this is the stream okay now it just occurred to me that maybe it wasn't a good idea to change my network in the middle of a stream so hopefully it's all right uh is oh goodness my the amount of viewers did drop off let me know if you can see the stream the status is saying good in my um control panel but i'm not seeing any activity in the chat so please let me know all right it's okay now great thank you i've been streaming for like seven months and i can't believe like it never occurred to me like hey don't disconnect yourself from the internet while you're streaming uh anyway i had to to change networks because i couldn't access the database otherwise but anyway all right it's fine now sorry about that okay harsh it's saying uh we should use graphql uh our that's that's fine with me i'm i mean since this works i'm not going to um try to switch it up to graphql now but like some point soon if if you think it'll be faster and easier to use graphql to upload this data instead of just a regular rest api then i'm i'm all up for doing that um but let me know like i said we've we've been streaming for about an hour now so i'm not gonna attempt to implement that right now but i'm definitely open to it uh code cvs what's delay on the stream can you read out the time when you read this um 2 59 2 59 pm eastern time when i'm reading this there's def there's a slight delay i don't know how long the delay is exactly all right uh let's try to bring in let's try to find and then bring in another um department of faculty members so the first thing we need to do is bring over our ours what was this called i always forget what this is called uh sql operations studio for microsoft so this is an electron app from microsoft that is sql operations studio and i think it's pretty cool i like it it looks a lot like visual studio code first things first we need to connect what nice it automatically connected me that's pretty awesome all right and we need to take let's i need a query how do i get the query new connection new server group tables content um i know i had saved queries where did i save that to um there we go let's try to open that saved query there we go awesome all right let's run that just to make sure it's working no um connect all right cool so that is working uh so let's open up another query then uh and we can just come back in and change the folder id and then this should give us what we need um so what was our select star from content come on all right this is going to take a little bit because i'm accessing everything all right cool so i need to look for something that's obviously let's see a faculty member i'm have to figure out a way to narrow this down a little bit more this is a lot of data all right let me just scroll down area anderson monica for id 146. all right let's check 146. let's run that all right cool so i think this is fine arts department why does nick will have two i don't know let's see which one is the right one um all right this one looks like there's nothing in it i'm i'm not going to try to pull this out right now we'll just delete it since it's only one we'll just delete it from wordpress um but these are fine arts department oh interesting that this shows up in here as well we'll delete that too we definitely don't need that interesting okay all right 146 is what we're bringing in where there we go so now all we have to do is we'll switch it to 146 and then let's make this well in wordpress let's make a new add a new faculty department let's go in here we could add them directly so let's name this fine arts and should automatically give us a slug yep fine arts and where is our it's not saying the id i need the id whoa and it's there we go uh let's see if i can make it show the id no uh okay let's uh faculty department let's see if i can get it here there we go so i guess i'll have to just check in the rest api when i add one which is okay uh so it's going to be id4 so let's go in here now and change it to id for so when i run when i run this again after making these changes it should pull in all of our fine arts faculty members into our faculty custom post type with the faculty department of fine arts so let's try it out and there we go so now we have fine arts faculty as well and let's get rid of this duplicate which should have nothing let's double check yep it has nothing in there so let's get rid of that duplicate and then let's get rid of that carousel that we're not going to use and we can apply our bulk actions move to trash apply great all right not bad so once we got everything set up all we had to do was run run the commands make a few edits and we've already got all these uh in the system here so you could see how you know after really probably just a a few days work at most we could have you know all of the content really after another hour or two we could probably have all the professors and i'm saying hour or two because you know assuming something messes up but this is going to be much much faster than the alternative which was having um student workers go through and copy and paste content from the website to wordpress that would have taken a really really long time all right cool so about five minutes uh let me go i'll tell you what uh let me go to the live chat i um basically because we went through this process twice already everything beyond this at least for this post type is just going to be the same thing over and over again so there's no need for me to keep doing the same thing right you can always you know rewind a youtube video and watch it again so i don't think there's that much value in doing the same thing again on the live stream so i'm gonna go to the live chat now i'm gonna take any um any questions that you have and read out some of the comments and and then that'll be it for today's stream uh tomorrow i'll try to work on something else uh so we'll see uh let me know right now on the live chat and in the comments if you're watching later if you want to see more of this type of thing of making custom post types and taxonomies bringing over data or if you'd like to move on and get back to some of the react stuff where we're going to build out some of these pages you know now that we have some of this data on the professors we can make uh pages for each department with content and we can also make pages for faculty members so at least we can make that that template page set up the routing for it um so we have some data now we can play with so we can move back to the react stuff if we want but i'd like to know what you all want to see because i have to do it anyway it's just a matter of whether i do it on a stream or not so let me know if i don't hear from anybody i probably am just going to go back to the react stuff i could probably find someone who can run this you know i just say hey watch the video and keep running this script and fill that in so i may not even have to do this by hand but i do need to do the react stuff there's there's not really anyone else that i would be able to just say hey do this because it's not really a repetitive task it's more of um there's going to be some creativity involved alright so let me check in the chat let me scroll up a bit okay so um let's see we have someone from uh as azerbaijan uh welcome also and and they liked as well thank you for the like uh so street fighter says i'm not sure how likes work but it's better to have them than not to have them it's free content that is extremely useful liking is the least we can do i appreciate that thank you for saying that so i mean i did say earlier i'm not sure what the likes are for in terms of you know youtube and what they use it for but um it is nice when i get a lot of likes that does make me feel uh like i'm doing something worthwhile so i do appreciate it uh let's see code cv asks what are you building here um we were building well there's a lot to this project but in this particular stream we were building a wordpress plugin to set up some a custom post type and a custom taxonomy and then we were pulling data from a another database a sql server database and we were pulling it into our wordpress database which is my sequel and so that's what we work on today the bigger picture is that this data is then going to be fed into uh react app and uh eventually there'll be a lot more pieces to it so i do explain some of it in an earlier stream if you want kind of a more indepth uh explanation so i think maybe like the the beginning like the first video i did for project five uh has a bit a better explanation yeah and again sorry about me messing up the the stream when i switched networks uh just didn't wasn't thinking and i am sorry because the viewer count dropped dramatically so i i think i've lost about at least half of the people that were watching uh so sorry about that uh some of you maybe rejoined after that so really really sorry if anybody that got cut off earlier is watching the recording later on i apologize for that here oh okay uh john boyce said the url said the tag id let me check that out oh cool it does say in the url so the tag id is four all right so i don't have to call the rest api to figure out the tag id that's useful i still wish they would put it somewhere in here but uh i since i can see it in the url then that's uh that's fine too uh thanks john for um for pointing that out that's very useful yeah um harshit yeah your migration scripts are awesome that was that was really good i think i mentioned before like i made like just really really minor adjustments like um obviously like just changing a few things like adding in uh you know custom post type capabilities here i think i i did something like right around here i don't even remember what it was for sure right now but other than that like this is perfect um yeah really good i i really appreciate that hey john hanson's here says hey y'all late uh sorry uh you weren't here earlier just just finishing things up oh cool uh harshit says he's gonna make a pr uh which is a pull request with the graphql setup awesome uh that that'll be really cool yeah i'm interested to see that so i assume i'll have to use the wp graphql plugin with that which is not a problem i i figured we'd we'd install it at some point anyway okay so rook um votes for react for the next stream cool john hanson just react all right code cvs is that database open to the public unfortunately it's not so i only have limited access to this database so i only have read access to a copy of the real database uh and i only have access to it when i'm on campus at this computer on one specific network that i can access from this computer so it's very limited uh i wonder all right my for my database people here is there a way that i could easily make a copy of this database and then have it more widely available assuming that i'm not going to open up info that shouldn't be opened up which i'd have to check to see um maybe like potentially remove some tables or something like that but um maybe that would be better i mean it'd be nice if like let's say i had to work from home one day i could still access this and work on it um yeah anyway so i mean we we're not gonna do it right now we don't need to do right now but if anybody's watching now or later on you watch the recording and you can think of a quick way to duplicate this database i mean it might make things easier yeah i mean i guess i could put it on i don't know where i'd put it i'd have to check into like where where i could host a um a sql server database especially a large sql server database might be a little bit more complicated than i i thought but i think it's worth looking into just you know so it's accessible to more people oh nice okay harsha says maybe hosted and then azure so that's what i was thinking of i do have an account with uh with azure already so um yeah maybe i'll look into that and it looks like car should also found something on stack overflow that i'm checking out right now all right yeah let's check this out interesting all right so there wasn't back up so could i make a backup and then just use that back up somewhere else okay cool um all right maybe i'll look into that i said there's not absolutely a need for that right now it would just be nice to have the option of being able to access this somewhere else all right cool back up too all right that's cool i'm going to leave this up on my screen so i i have it i can remember where i got to this i mean it's not that hard but rather not have to think about it again how i did it all right cool um okay so i've got to the bottom of the live chat here i if i missed your question i'm sorry you can throw it in the live chat right now really quickly if if i see it before i end the stream then i'll i'll answer it otherwise i'm going to wrap things up here so thank you so much for watching thanks for all your help uh definitely accomplish what we uh wanted to accomplish today and it works uh things work like like we thought they would so i should be back tomorrow i think what stays tomorrow yeah tomorrow's good i should be back uh thursday i don't think i'm gonna be able to stream on thursday uh so there's um i have a meeting in the morning and in the afternoon we have a christmas party uh for my my department so not sure if i'll if i'll have time to stream if i can get a short stream in maybe i'll try uh but i guess plan on me not streaming that day i think friday is good though to to uh to stream um okay we did get another question i got two more comments so let me let me read these out so uh bo bogendra uh let me know if i mispronounce that name i'd i'd like to say it correctly uh if i can um but but gender says hi i just knew about it from one of my friends what topics are included in here and what time uh can we on on this live stream thanks so the live stream is usually around 2 pm eastern time monday through friday sometimes i'll go a little earlier a little later but that's you know generally around the time if you subscribe to this channel the free code cam channel you'll get a notification assuming you have your notifications on but you'll get a notification of when i go live i also um tell everyone on twitter before i'm gonna stream uh so my twitter a link to my twitter's in the description of this video so if you'd like to follow me on twitter you'll get an update there as well and the topics are mostly javascript stuff like frontend development we do a lot with react we do some backend stuff and obviously some database stuff as well a little bit of php uh because we use wordpress for some things we use material design uh a lot i think that covers most of what we do uh so i'm always open to trying new things if there's something you'd really like to see me do i can't guarantee that i'll do it because these are i work on projects that i have to work on for my job so i don't have complete freedom as to what we do but um if i can work in something new you know i definitely try to um anyway thanks for watching uh codetv says you should put more detail about what you're working on in the description yeah and there's a lot more i'd like to do with um the descriptions and the titles that basically the the problem i have with the descriptions are that i write them before i put the stream on and i don't always know what's going to happen during the stream so sometimes the titles and descriptions are are completely different from what we end up doing because whatever i plan to do just doesn't work and we have to switch things up and often i don't go back usually and edit a description unless i see you know like a typo or something uh so i i definitely agree with you it's just it's like it's a time issue for me really uh to go back in and do i know it doesn't seem like a lot but you know at this point i have over 100 videos so going back through and trying to make better descriptions uh is going to be pretty difficult and i can't really make great descriptions beforehand as i said because it frequently changes uh so i'd always always be me trying to go back in afterwards i'll think about it and i'll i'll try to do better with the descriptions though so um i think that's good uh it's a good idea and uh i'll see what i can do i can't promise anything but i'll see what i can do oh okay uh harsh it's asking if i checked out the project i have i've been looking at the project um so i um i will give you some feedback i guess har let me know you don't have to let me know in the live chat now you can send me something later uh let me know if there's anything specifically that you would like feedback on um or just like feedback in general as to you know what i see i want to be as helpful as i can to you so if there's if there's some area you really would like feedback on let me know then i can direct you know my attention to that particular area otherwise if you want general feedback that's that's okay too uh i just want to help you out as much as i can okay so i'm that i'm done um with the chat now i am through everything uh for real this time uh so uh again thanks everyone for watching and uh for helping me out here in the live chat i will be back most likely tomorrow and uh in until then have a great day
