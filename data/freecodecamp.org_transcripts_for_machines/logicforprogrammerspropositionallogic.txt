welcome to free code camp I'm commander candy of coding commanders and today I'm gonna teach you all about logic logic is the foundation for all computer programming so the better you're able to understand logic the better and faster you're gonna be able to pick up and learn any programming language or encounter any programming endeavour introduction to logic for programmers propositional logic you'll find reference materials and homework at coding commander's comm slash logic dot PHP mathematics science and computer programming all are based on logical reasoning what logic does is it defines a set of rules if we want to be able to sign typically or exactly determine something we need rules define to make sure we're all measuring by the same standards to make sure that if I say this is a cup cup means the same thing to you that it means to me and at the end of the day we use logic to determine whether things are valid or invalid true or false if you're gonna be doing computer programming especially if you plan on doing business logic building enterprise applications you know working for a company it's a lot of validation a lot of true or false especially on the back end I've worked with like PHP nodejs sequel and a lot of what I do when I'm hired by somebody is validation is this valid or isn't this is it true or is it false if you really think about it at the end of the day just about anything can be boiled down to true or false for example say you're taking a multiplechoice test and the question is four plus four it's multiple choice your options are two four six eight now we're smart mathematicians we know four plus four equals eight right but even though that's openended that's not a true/false question we could break the problem down to four two or false questions right four plus four equal to false does four plus four equal four false does four plus four equals six false does four plus four equal eight true and because that's true that's what we're gonna select as our answer today we're gonna cover propositional logic that's the basic building block of logic it's a way for us to determine whether things are valid or invalid you may also hear it referred to as statement logic because you can basically think of a proposition as a statement for example I have blonde and red hair today that statement is true propositional logic allows us to evaluate whether things are true or false based on certain conditions this is sound familiar in computer programming if statements aren't your rectly derived from propositional logic and in this video we're going to learn how remember logic is all about defined rules so first things first let's properly define a proposition a proposition is a statement it has a truth value that means it's either true or false it's not equal to jellybeans it's not equal to 564 it's gonna be true or false and a proposition can only have one single truth value so it can't be true or false it has to be either true or false so let's look at some statements and determine if their propositions are not the first one commander candy is 4 foot 11 is that a statement yes does it evaluate true or false yes and it can only have one single value I'm either 4 foot 11 or I'm not 4 foot 11 so yay commander candy is 4 foot 11 is a proposition by the way this statement is true commander candy is a halfling on 4 foot 11 what is your favorite flavor is that a statement yes does it evaluate true or false no this is not a proposition whatever your flavor might be chocolate vanilla strawberry mocha banana mango it's not true or false next X plus y equals 36 is that a statement yes does it evaluate true or false yes either X plus y is 36 or X plus y isn't 36 but it doesn't have a single value depending on the values of x and y it could be true or false so uh this is not a proposition the better you are at logic the better you're going to be at breaking down those complicated problems that we encounter as programmers if you can get it broken down to its basic building blocks is this true or false is this true or false you can solve just about any problem there is we can combine propositions in order to solve more complicated problems in order to do say we're going to use variables such as PQRS X Y Z we're going to use logical operators things like an and/or we're gonna learn some others and we're also going to use comparison operators like less than greater than equal to not equal to less than or equal to we'll go over some of those as well now let's talk notation okay let's look at an example we're gonna start with two statements P and Q let's let P equal Sally is 42 and we're like Q equal Lynda is 36 now let's look at some ways to compare these two statements P and Q we could do P and Q we can do P or Q there's also comparisons like exclusive implication by conditional in order to evaluate if these statements are true or false we're going to use something called a truth table truth tables consist of multiple columns there's going to be a column for each statement or variable and then there's going to be a column for what we're trying to evaluate in a scenario like this where we have two statements or two variables there's gonna be four possibilities if Sally is 42 Linda can either be 36 or not be 36 so if P is true Q can be true or false and if P's false Q can be true or false as well if Sally isn't 42 Linda can still be or not be 36 so let's first look at and Sally is 42 and Linda is 36 that means both those statements are true both P is true and Q is true so there's only one possibility that will make the statement true and that's if piece true and Q's true if there's any false going on there the whole thing's gonna evaluate is false next we have or Sally is 42 or Linda is 36 with or P and cubed they don't both have to be true just one of them has to be true if just one of them is true then the statement P or Q is going to be true with or they don't both have to be true just one has to be true so Sally can be 42 Orland that can be 36 P or Q so if there's any truth going on here the statements can evaluate is true if Sally is 42 it's gonna be true if Glen is 36 it's gonna be true but they don't both have to be telling the truth mmhmm so there's gonna be three possibilities of truth here the only way that P or Q is gonna evaluate false is if both P and Q are false next let's talk about exclusive that means P can be true q can be true but they can't both be true so if Sally is 42 its going to evaluate true if Linda is 36 its gonna evaluate true but its Sally's 42 and Linda's 36 it's not gonna evaluate true if Sally isn't 42 and Linda isn't 36 it's not gonna value a true you need exactly one true in one false there's going to be two scenarios to evaluate as true now let's look at implication implication is going to read if P then Q P is what we call the hypothesis and Q is the conclusion this is a conditional statement you know like our if statements and computer programming those are implication so let's look at implication if Sally is 42 then Lynda is 36 if Sally is telling the truth and lenders telling the truth then the statements true if Sally is telling the truth and Linda's aligned then the statement is false if Sally is lying then it doesn't really matter if slin de telling the truth or lying it could still be true because it has nothing to do with Linda at that point there's only a condition applied here if Sally is 42 if Sally lied and you know it doesn't really matter anymore anyway now let's look at by conditional that reads P if and only if cubed another way to write that is the F with 2's and this statement is gonna have the same truth value as P implies Q and 2 implies P saying it goes in both directions so basically if Sally is telling the truth and Linda's telling the truth this is going to evaluate true if they're both lying it's still going to value a true but if one's telling the truth and one's lying no matter which direction it's going in it's filled and evaluate false and now let's just touch on negation negation you might see ever in any of these ways like negative 6 that's negating sex it's the opposite not it means like not pee that's how you would read that or the opposite of pee so basically if P is true not pees gonna be false if P is false not P is gonna be true now we're gonna look at some of our comparison operators less than greater than less than or equal to greater than or equal to not equal to these are some comparisons there's also like identical if you're familiar in computer programming like you have like three equal signs these are comparison operators these are ways that we can compare numbers and we use these often in our conditional statements okay let's go ahead and take it back we're gonna bring it back to computer programming I'm gonna show you some examples of conditional statements in a couple programming language and how this relates and trust me as the computer code your writing gets more complicated a good firm solid understanding of these logic fundamentals are really gonna play a big part on your ability to be calm on your competency my next video I'm gonna do set theory that's another very important concept it's like the next step in logic if you understand propositional logic and step theory like really really well you are going to excel at learning whatever programming language or techniques you're trying to learn let's look at an example you're friend invites you to dinner you are only interested in going if dinner is at a Greek restaurant right your response using implication now remember implication it P then Q if not P then na q okay let's break down this example okay your friend invites you to dinner that's not really important you are only interesting going you're gonna go if dinner is at a Greek restaurant right you're not gonna go if it's not at a Greek restaurant if dinner is Greek you are gonna go if dinner is not Greek you're not gonna go the hypothesis is dinner is Greek that's the P and the conclusion is I will come to dinner you're writing your response so if dinner is Greek your response is gonna be I will come to dinner let P equal Greek like Q equal I will come let R equal I will not come if P then Q and if not P then R and here I use this example from my website because it already has the rules for a conditional statement clearly written out so I'm going to explain now how we're gonna transfer that into computer code okay so this examples in PHP I'm also going to show you with JavaScript afterwards the way the syntax works in PHP per if statements you write if inside the frame to see in your condition and then inside the brackets the clever code you want to execute if the condition is true if it's a save constructed on JavaScript it's pretty common here this is where things get a little bit different than JavaScript but I'm gonna show you how it's easy once you know the base logic to write it in whatever language if dollar sign dinner equals equals or you could put three equals their Greek echo in PHP echo print something yes I will go to dinner okay so now we are going to write this in PHP we're gonna let people Greek q equal I will come to dinner and are equal I will not come to dinner so P then Q and if not P then R so how would we write this in PHP dollar sign P equals Greek and PHP this is how you declare a variable you put a dollar sign in front of it and then you know it's a variable so dollar side P equals Greek I put Greek in quotes because the PHP a string that's like word sends as characters we put them in quotes double or single then I have dollar sign Q equals I will come or ending each line with a semicolon because that's how you do it dollar sign R equals I will not come so basically the condition is your P and then inside is your Q if dinner equal Greek echo I will come else what else means is it's the opposite of whatever condition is in here so if in here I wrote x equals three if x equals three this would execute and if X didn't equal three this would execute so else echo I will not come see how this could be simply translated into whatever programming languages you're at you know you would have to Google how do I declare a variable what the syntax looks like but once you get to construct the condition is the P and the code is the Q now let's take a look at it in JavaScript and JavaScript instead of putting a dollar sign we just name them whatever we want and then we put bar in front of it so and other than that it's pretty much the same is with the PHP and JavaScript we can print to the terminal using console.log so instead of echo I use console.log here but those are the basic differences as you can see in the syntax bar it's in a dollar sign console.log instead of echo other than that we're transferring it the same way we put our P in here and we put our Q in there don't forget I do have homework in the form of a quiz game and some reference materials available at coding commander's comm slash logic dot PHP on a page you'll see links to everything I have related to here to help you out now let's do some practice problems together now I'm just going to do some simple little math problems with you using logic so you get a better grasp on how to apply the logic to reallife problems I definitely suggest afterwards checking out the quiz I have to reinforce the logic that you've learned and also get better at it quicker at it sharper at it good idea would be to these examples that I'm doing go ahead and write it out in whatever programming language you might be working on if you've started learning one or if you know you want to learn one I did also like materials odd writing logic in PHP so if you're not already working on a programming language go ahead and write out my examples in PHP if you can't think of how you can always console.log print equals I have this like blown up a little bit it looks a little pixelize that's cool right pixels are cool right so let's do x equals two and we're gonna go ahead and do y equals zero so let's say that x equals two is our P and y equals zero is arc P and Q would read that x equals two and y equals zero so let's say if X plus y equals four what are the truth possibilities here okay so let's see what are the different possibilities of truth here first of all okay if x equals two and y equals zero 2 Plus 0 is 2 not 4 so something's fishy here right would it be possible for X and Y to both be true would that be possible no this one would be false would it be possible for X or Y to be true yes this is possible we don't have enough information really to know anything you know we know that one of them's lying at least right haha one of them could be like or both of them could be lie so here this could be true or false we're gonna need some more information here to make a definite decision but if I were to give this to you as a given this can still be true now let's do X or could be true or false as well right okay now let's do this I'm gonna give you some information and let's come up with some stuff that's true and some stuff that's false given X is less than Y a parenthesis and x equals 3 so we're gonna take this as bat now let's see I'm gonna give you some values and you tell me if it's true or false y equals 3 y equals 0 why equals 3 times X okay now you tell me what's true and what's false okay first of all with the given it's an an so that means both have to be satisfied X has to be less than Y and X also has to equal 3 so which of these statements could Polly be true given the information okay if X is less than Y and X is equal to 3 can Y also be equal to 3 no if it was less than or equal to that could be true but it's not so this is false sure that we know that's definitely not the case y equals 0 if X equals 3 and Y is less than X could Y be 0 no because well 0 is less than 3 and Y is got to be bigger than 3 false y equals 3 X could Y be equal to the value of x times 3 which is 9 yes because 9 is bigger than 3 okay given I'm gonna give you some information in this information I'm giving you we're gonna just assume is true x equals negative 3 y equals 3 and Z equals 0 now I'm gonna give you some statements and then you tell me if they are true or not let's do negative y is less than 0 X is equal to Y and X plus y equals Z all right negative Y is less than 0 okay Y is 3 y is 3 so negative Y would be negative the ring and negative three is definitely this is so true yeah you always felt you're wrong okay I'm gonna give it a star now let's do X equals y if X is negative three and Y is three those are not equal so this is ball X plus y equals Z does negative three plus three equals zero yes it does this is so true yay thank you for watching my video if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to comment below so I can help you out I will be going through the comments on this video also feel free to reach out to me on any of my social media at coning commander on twitter everywhere
