hi in this video we're going to talk about the basics of software we've already covered hardware which are parts of the computer that you can actually see and feel with your hands software are the programs that run on the hardware you can't pick up a piece of software you can pick up a piece of hardware with the software downloaded onto it but software is the code that is written and imprinted onto hardware the two main types of software that we're going to talk about are the operating system like windows mac or linux those are the main three you're not really going to get any more than that or applications now everything that you think of as software probably falls into these two spaces especially the applications applications cover everything from your web browser to games to things like photoshop or your mail how you edit documents every type of system application that is not an operating system is just a regular software application the big takeaway from this video is that hardware is what you can actually hold on to from a computer but software consists of all the programs that you can run on that hardware
