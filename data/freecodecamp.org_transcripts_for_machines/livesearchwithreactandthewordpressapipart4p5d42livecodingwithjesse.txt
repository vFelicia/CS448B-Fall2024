hey everyone welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're gonna keep coding our search page and we already have the search working with the wordpress api so we type in the search box and whatever we type get saved into state because we're using react and then state updates the input and every time the input changes it fires off a function that searches sends off a search query to the wordpress api that data comes back and then populates our page now what we want to do is take some of those check boxes that we added in yesterday and we're going to connect those to the state and we're going to use the value in state to change our parameters in our our query that we're sending to the wordpress api so that a user wouldn't just search for one word throughout all our data they would search for a word and be able to say i want to search for just this word in just this type of content so they'll be able to narrow down their search a lot more and it'll have the added benefit as well uh to be a little bit easier on the wordpress api and not having to search through so many different types of of data because everything's split out into custom post types so on our end of things we send one query but really on the wordpress n it needs to make separate searches as far as i understand from the way it works in the php is that separate searches happen for each of those post types so all around i think it'll be a better user experience and it'll cut down on what needs to happen uh in wordpress to get that data out to us so that's the plan for today all right cool looks like from the uh stream analytics we have a decent number of viewers so i'm going to put the link to what we're working on in the live chat now and i may put it in again later if we get some more users i don't want anyone to miss out so the link that i just put into the live chat will connect you up with what i'm running locally so we're using a service called ngrok and the creator of ngrok has generously allowed free code camp in this stream to use an unlimited version of ngrok for free which is awesome i'm not even sure that you can buy an unlimited version i think the plans all have limits so really awesome of him to uh to donate that for us and it allows this stream to be a lot more interactive so you can check the site open it up in dev tools every time i make a change locally you will be able to see the change immediately in your browser you're not limited to seeing just the page that i have on the screen you can you look around in the site and you do whatever you like so let me oh before we start i want to tell you just a little story so please be patient with me and humor me for a second while i tell you the story i forgot to say yesterday but yesterday i was in a coffee shop so i spent the morning working in a new coffee shop that just opened yesterday morning and it's very close to where i work so it's it's a little bit far to walk uh it's down a hill and then across the street and stuff but driving distance it's you know less than a minute so anyway i go in there and i'm working on my laptop so i'm a laptop with all the dev stickers and everything on it and uh i'm working and then i notice somebody's looking at me and so i look over there and they come come over and say are you jesse and i say yeah and they said i watch your stream i watch your coding stuff and uh it was just like the weirdest like coolest thing um i i've never had anybody recognize me from the stream before and i don't know it was really awesome so uh so i talked to him for a while and it turns out he's a computer science major here at the university that i work for and i i've never met him before uh so he actually knows some of the same students in the computer science program uh and you know he's been watching my show and i had no idea so i i got a picture with him and we exchanged emails and i i invited him to come over and be on the show if he wants to or you know come to my office and show me what he's working on or ask me questions or anything so anyway i that was just a really amazing experience for me so i just wanted to share that with you all if any of you ever do happen to see me don't hesitate to come up and talk to me i'm really friendly and um so i won't you won't bother me like i won't be freaked out just you know say hi i'll be super happy if you say hi so uh i know if any of you are in the pittsburgh area like it's possible you might see me because i i am also in the pittsburgh area uh and i just said somebody asked me about my dev stickers so i'm going to show my laptop quickly because i have it here so here are my stickers so i have some this is a windows 95 sticker and i found this one on a window when they were doing construction on my building and somebody had just left it there so it was essentially probably going to be taken out with the window and thrown away so i made sure i grabbed that and it's held on with scotch tape i have some from november conference syntax con hacktoberfest so all of them are tech related except for this one or this one is just darth vader one my brotherinlaw's got me that for christmas um and then this is a window sticker and i took off the microsoft because it was huge and just kept these so anyway those are my laptop stickers for right now i have a little bit of space left to put some some more on there and um oh cool so peter says the darth vader one's cool yeah i actually have i have some other ones i just didn't really have a spot to put them so they might end up going on uh another laptop or i don't know what i'm gonna do with them for sure but i have uh boba fett and this uh skull i have a stormtrooper and kylo ren so that's some cool ones and i have some other ones like uh netlify and like get i get kraken uh so i just have some other ones uh usually i um i only like to put stickers on my laptop for things that i actually use so some of the ones that aren't on there yet are products that i don't really use some of them i do want to try to use at some point so they might get on there um so oh michael says sign them and send them to people oh that's a cool idea i never thought anybody would want anything signed by me but that's actually not a bad idea i'm still not sure people would want them signed they might just want the stickers but yeah off to think about that i'll yeah maybe i'll think about me what the best way to do that would be and um and i'll get this i also have some free code camp stickers at my house all right so i better get started i want one more comment i'm going to read off before we get started um from tracy uh says hi jesse thanks for the live coding stream uh you're welcome thanks for watching i'm just looking for my post php heavy development environment just wondering and learning thanks to free code camp and generous coders like you what all this is about oh uh thank you for saying that that's that's awesome and uh tracy any questions you have let me know um either in the chat live or comments or on twitter or you know wherever okay cool also i swear to stick whoa steven got a job all right steven congratulations so steven got a job starting next monday really really cool i'm super happy for you um yeah so let uh as much as you're comfortable with let us know about the job and how everything goes i definitely love to hear from you i totally understand if you can't be around for the live chat as much you know your new job might keep you busy but um if you can check in and and just say hello and let us know how it's going nope that would be great all right awesome i love when i hear stuff like that really really happy for you okay all right let's get started so i actually um i have a a meeting at 3 p.m my time it is now 1 42 p.m so we can't be super long on this stream i still want to try to get two pomodoro sessions in if i can alright steven's a senior web developer slash designer for api and javascript awesome awesome that's really cool you got the senior web dev in there too that's really really cool um yeah so cool really happy for you all right so let me all right we have a bunch of people now in the chat so i'm not going to keep you all waiting uh any longer let me switch the screens you have something better to look at than my face and uh start the pomodoro timer and get back to here i was working on the server uh i don't have that committed yet to github but it's just very minor work and just some comments so we're going to be working on the search the search page and i did do a few changes to the search page and pretty much all i did was change the text on the page so it's not completely up to date on github yet but there's nothing major that's changed just just the text um okay see uh you want me to share the link to the pomodoro timer i will share that i think this is the one that harshit built so one of our our viewers uh built this pomodoro timer and so we're so we're using that so i know several of you have built pomodoro timers if anybody builds pomodoro timer and wants me to use it on the show let me know uh send me a link to it or something and i can rotate and just kind of use a different one every time okay so let me go down here let's make some space let's get rid of that and let's move this over here we don't really need this terminal right now there we are okay so we have a separate page that's a component a react component for our our search page if you want to see it just type in uh slash search at the end of that ngrok link and i ought to put that in the live chat one more time since we do have a lot of new people that weren't here when i put it in before so this ngrok link after the dot io put slash search and you can see what page will be working on so you can see i just changed the labels so i didn't even change the the values or you know anything like that yet so i need to go in and change that first and then we can actually start testing this out the search i don't think works right now so i think when i added these check boxes in i broke something so it may not work klaus asked about are we using wordpress with node.js i thought it was only php uh we're getting data from wordpress and we're pulling it in to react that we're running with node so we're using both but the wordpress is now it's hosted i think i have a test wordpress site on godaddy i think yeah i don't think i made a droplet for it eventually it'll be on its own digitalocean droplet we might go with aws i haven't decided for sure yet uh so let's make this majors and i did have some i sat down with my boss today and decided some things about uh design on some of the pages so we may have some new stuff going on with design departments and what's this faculty so some of the interior pages are going to have a little bit more involved a fancier design you know bit more elements on the page so we'll probably be working on that sometime soon and i had another presentation of this website today which which went well uh so had some good questions too to kind of like think about up you know opportunities and possibilities for the site okay news oh i i had put news in here but we're going to change this up to match what we just had so we had faculty majors what was the other one departments departments major and i need to make that singular i believe so let's keep them the same here oops department i like i like to keep it all singular i don't know why i made that plural it doesn't really even make sense as a plural label okay so let me save that and then i'm going to show you uh what it looks like now on the search page i can find it there we are so i was on the theology page which actually the uh the logo didn't load oh there we are i don't know what happened there but let's move this to the search search page i also have an idea for how to change the router i think it'll make the router a little bit faster and it'll give us more freedom to do things with the routes so i'm not going to change that much on it but i think the change will be good so i might do that on a different stream or maybe after i do the change i'll just show what happened on the next stream after that and let's see all right if you are asking questions in the live chat i'm not ignoring you i'm just going to get to the questions once this pomodoro timer gets down to zero and then i'll take a few minutes and and catch up with the live chat okay so here's what we have now we have our search input what i'd like the user to be able to do once they search is also to click one or more of these check boxes and then it'll say you know they let's say they only want to search for faculty members then they just check faculty and they type in their search and they'll only get results that are faculty members you know so or any combination of these so we'll definitely have more check boxes than just this and we'll also at some point have a sorting feature as well that might be the next thing that we add in so that you know maybe they can sort the pages by newest or alphabetically or you know however else we can think of to sort them we want to give we want to give the users the most freedom and control of their search as as we can reasonably give them so let's actually let me see if this is working whoa yeah not working all right so i'm sure as we go through oops as we go through and connect these check boxes up to our our search function we'll find the mistake hopefully okay so we already have our our on change functions connected and it's going to pass this value okay which is great and this value will match up with the key that we have in state so with state oops we have these uh check boxes and they're split up let's see how we split up right now we have an array of objects i'm gonna leave it like that just for now but i don't think we need to have an array of objects i think we can clean that up a little bit but um i'd really like to just get this working uh so when i you know maybe try to go as fast as i can through this uh let's see tomorrow major faculty so in our search term for our fetch search term function we have this state search type okay that needs to go on to this this url so the search term is going to tell wordpress what to search for but then these search types are going to tell it which post types to actually do the search in so we need to create this as a string so what we can do is make this uh let's see let's how are we gonna do this search oh okay sorry so we're making uh in state we have search type so sorry about that i was in the wrong function i i had forgotten that we made this in a state so let's we want to go to the function where we're actually clicking uh on the check box and that is handle change i believe yep okay so when we handle the change we're saying this set states and then whatever the name is and then we're we're making it the value checked so this is how we pulled this in from the component demo in the material ui documentation we may need to change this let me think so we certainly don't want the values to be let's see how we're doing this is state name check yeah we're going to have to switch it up so just to show you what's what's happening now let's check this out and let's go into the react dev tools uh so let me it was our search don't we ever search component i guess not all right so here's our state so we have our check boxes array but when you actually click a check box you see it adds faculty right so it's still doing what it was doing in the material ui uh documentation so it's not even at all you're taking into account what we've created in state uh so let's switch this up a bit i think so we need to keep this sort of thing here but i would rather have yeah i would rather have this in the check boxes array and as long as we keep the the names of the check boxes the same as what we actually have to search for uh or the name we actually have to put in the query i think this will work because we can just grab we can grab the keys and use those so let's try that out so if we were to do this it needs to be this set states and hmm what did we call that oh check boxes all right how are we gonna do this check boxes i'm not sure if this will work i'm gonna try like this first not sure if it'll work but let's let's give it a shot i'm also going to remove i'm going to remove all of this and just do that instead all right so let's see if it works all right cool uh no not cool so it's not yes we don't want that we want let's see um oops the state all right let's try that uh so what we'll do here is um we're combining these so these three dots i believe that's the spread operator correct me with them wrong sometimes i uh i forget the terminology uh but this is going to allow us just to combine these two things so that before it was overwriting this now it's going to combine it let's let's test it out make sure that's right okay um not working let me refresh completely here and see what's happening there we are search okay so let's check out check boxes there's nothing right now if we click faculty there we are in department no no no okay it's not working now what did i do all right let me see what i've done let me check the live chat chat first to see if you all have caught my mistake since you all usually catch my mistakes before i do um let's see uh nikki says initialize every checkbox value in state okay so i should initialize all the values first then in state let's see steven says it's not resetting that state when unselected all right well let's let's put in the values and see if that does anything so we're going to initialize these values here in state oops not what i wanted to do so what did we have department let's do um major faculty okay so now we have them initialized in state okay uh let's see nikki saying use the prestate version of getting state i probably should just check the get up repo for the catechetical institute site that we did the same thing in and see how we did it there that would probably save us a lot of time so let's let's check that out and see i react let's see pages resources okay so where are we handling results check that's weird hmm all right i have a better repo let's look at that resource center repo because we we were using material ui here so i don't think i don't think we were doing it the best way for the catechetical institute site since we were mixing in uh materialized css components where is our form rose no oh views all right all right so in our service request form this kind of check boxes handle input change name okay um i'm checking live chat again to see some more things uh he says you're already using it a bunch uh set state uh okay sure objects okay uh nikki yeah let me try it i'll try that out before we implement some of this uh before i try to implement some of that okay um here we are okay oh what am i getting here nikki saying another closing parenthesis you ever an existing one didn't add a new one oh okay you're thanks cool totally didn't see that uh my my timer is going off for this pomodoro session so i'm gonna take a break answer some questions in the live chat and then come back to this and see if we can sort out what we need to do here so we have done this two different ways in previous projects this project is slightly different uh but i'm sure we can figure this out by uh adapting what we've done previously if we have to all right so let's set five minute timer i'm going to scroll up to the top so i i don't miss any questions and i'm just going to go down through whatever was asked first that's what i'll get to first hopefully i can get to everything before i have to end the stream hey everyone see a lot of a lot of people saying hello so i'm just gonna say hi to everyone uh let's say hi there at the beginning of the chat so i'm scrolling down there are no questions so far or i've already addressed them oh michael says jesse your kids grow up so fast they do grow up so fast but i'm not sure why where did that come from in the middle of the the coding but that is definitely true uh srikanth says you're doing great you deserve some appreciation jesse thank you thank you trying to do a good job and uh to be honest with you most people are are appreciative of of the work i do so occasionally there are some people that aren't so appreciative but they're in the minority of of people i um i usually hear positive comments so uh it's it's been really nice uh cesar asks is this really advanced um i'm i'm not sure it doesn't seem that advanced for me but i like we've gradually been building up to this so it probably seems like a lot right now like just coming into the project uh but i guess kind of keep in mind that like we've built up to this little by little uh so i mean you definitely you know it's not it's not a project i would give to a beginner for sure uh but the building blocks to get here you know are sometimes you know just very simple things it's just we combine them and uh and you know build on them and then we end up with uh i don't know what i think is is turned out to be a pretty nice site i'm gonna have to google translate this next question and let's detect language so we have a question that says your movements are correct the applications you're doing are not right so um that was i think that that statement came around the time when i was trying to do the uh checkbox stuff so um yeah so i guess that's uh that was true yeah i am messing something up here in is here and it says hey hey how's it going thanks for watching uh chris says using a virtual dom with react in es6 looks pretty awesome it is pretty awesome it's really fun i i think react is is super fun uh ew ilia i think that's how you pronounce it let me know if it's not but ilia says could you describe your computer setup okay so my setup right now is i have an imac and it has i'm running like 32 gigs of ram it has the 27 inch um 4k screen on the main screen or i'm sorry 5k screen on the main screen i'm running a the secondary uh 2k 27 inch monitor i think i think it's 27 and um then as another screen i have a a vertical display that's just an old lenovo widescreen monitor uh but it's it's just vertical uh and that's kind of good for longer um articles and things like that sometimes i put dev tools over there and so that's my setup right now i have an external microphone set up so it's better audio for the streams um which i think i use the keyboard that comes with with a mac and like the trackpad thing that comes with the mac so that's that's my setup i don't remember i guess i could tell you real quick if i go to about uh this computer i could tell you what the specs are i mean i'm using visual studio code for my editor and my terminal is item 2 about this mac let's see yeah okay so they are 27 inch displays the retina 5k it's the late 2014 model imac uh four gigahertz intel core i7 and uh amd radeon r9 uh two gigabyte graphics card yep and not that it matters that much but i'm i'm running the uh one terabyte hard drive uh i i believe it's the ssd but i can't be sure i don't remember for sure wow that lenovo display is it's 21.5 inch and it is in 1080p crazy i did not realize that it just doesn't look that good compared to the right next to the 5k screen so alright so let me go back do another pomodoro session and then anything that i've missed in the live chat i'm going to answer after this next pomodoro session i need to write down where i left off in the chat let's see okay i need to keep an eye on the time so i'm not late for my next meeting all right it looks like uh there were a few other things in the in the chat about our uh the issue that i'm having right now so let me check those out uh christoph i see that uh your suggestion okay nikki says we don't need an updater function if we're using the material ui box all right great kristoff um i think uh you what you put in there is gonna work yeah yeah that looks good uh let me change this up to do that as well so we want check we're going to take name and put it here and then we'll do checked yeah so we're not going to need whoops yeah i'm gonna be able to take a lot of this out take that out oops and i need a this set stage check boxes all right let me see event check interchange okay what are we doing okay there we are right no all right and i don't need that okay now let's check boxes to still give me trouble uh let's try that x equal checklist checks should i mean i'm looking at this it looks like it should work actually let me let me go back to what we originally had that i know worked no i don't want to let's see i don't want to go that far back so i'm gonna miss out on that let's just let me just grab from material ui what we did have if i can find it i have a lot of stuff up on my screens right now there we go all right so let me grab that handle change okay so this is what we did have for handle change so let's just put check boxes name handle change all right so we are still getting the same stuff going on here i want to verify that yeah so we are still getting there okay let me check back in the live chat okay nikki saying what we did have before almost worked we just needed to spread uh inside the check boxes section on the state then add the update okay actually oh let me let me look back one more time too at how we did it here were we really putting so we okay so we were doing this uh in this state within form we were putting all our checkbox stuff inside form so when we went to handle the input change let's just ignore all the stuff that's not about check boxes so if it was a check box we're just saying checked so the value is checked we're doing form name value checked so this state form oh okay all right this makes a lot more sense so what we're doing here is getting that whole object that is formed which in our case will be check boxes we're getting that object we are changing the object and then we're setting the state of that object that makes sense let's do that so let's go um checkboxes whoops let checkboxes equal this states check boxes oops check boxes and then we're going to do um this boxes name equals checked and then we're going to do this set state equals let's say check boxes close check boxes all right let me see if this works and then if it does i'll explain what i've done but no sense in telling you the wrong thing if this doesn't work okay so do we have no we're not i want to be able to see the state make sure we're doing the right thing no is that not it okay here we are so we're in check boxes no it's still creating one outside of here why do we have double okay so it is doing what we want but it's also doing something else all right where is this where's this part happening all right so what i'm trying to do in here and let me know in the live chat if if i'm uh messing this up somehow but basically is we're getting what the current value of check boxes is right checks boxes is now an object that contains key value pairs representing each checkbox the name is the key the value is true or false depending on whether it's checked or not so we're taking that we're modifying it and then we're combining it with this but do we need to combine it with that because we're not yeah we're not getting rid of this so i don't maybe we don't need to maybe we can just do this maybe that's that's rose i don't know if that's where i was messing up but i it was unnecessary let's double check and make sure it was unnecessary yeah let me give it a refresh here oops i need to remember what this is called or can i go like here there we go okay all right let's check it out now faculty there we go okay and i see i'm sure some of you in the live chat uh recognize my error first so thank you for that um okay so this works now so let me explain what's going on right now especially for those of you who might not be familiar with react i want to try to explain as much as i can so basically the same thing as i explained was happening before but now instead of trying to combine what was there which was an unnecessary step we're just setting state to this new value for the check boxes array i'm sorry the check box is object so this check boxes object here starts out with all the values being false we go down to here let's assume we just check a check box let's just say we check the box for faculty so it would pass the name faculty it would pass the events and then it would pass the value of checked which in this case the value of check then becomes true so in the check boxes object we're passing the name so we're going to get the checkbox item with the key value of faculty and we're going to set its value to true right because that's what the value of checked is now then we're going to do that set state and we're going to set our in our state the check boxes object that we've now updated we're sending that whole object there again and that's what's gonna update state uh so let's see so nikki says that way works but can cause asynchronous issues um i so in in what way can it cause issues i'm not denying that it causes issues i just i'm not aware of them so i guess what what issues does it cause and are these issues that we need to be careful of in this use case because if the issues aren't going to affect us in this use case i'm okay with leaving it like this even if it may not be the best way just for the sake of getting it done and moving on um nikki says set state is asynchronous okay so uh so nikki are you trying to say then that okay so set state here so potentially our search could run before set state and then it wouldn't have the right criteria i'm not i'm not sure if that's what you're saying so let me know if that's the case let's see i'm going to continue on just to see if we can make this work i do need to check my time we have nine okay almost 10 minutes so at this point let's get let's see nikki says the value in state can run one behind checkbox so you check it and it actually sets the state to false you uncheck it and it goes to true oh okay all right let's so how would i test that just click these a bunch of times really fast or is there a better way to test this okay nikki says it seems to be working all right we'll we'll just we'll have to keep that in mind and then maybe once we get it all working with more check boxes and things just check it again just to be sure all right so for now we need a way to get this search type to make it a string that we can put in here so let's let's search him let me think where should we make this um thank you i'm gonna make it a separate function right now i'm not sure that it needs to be but uh at least it'll it'll be more obvious what's happening if we make a separate function so we're gonna say create types okay not the best name in the world but it'll work create search types for now let's just put that in there and put that in there so basically let's search string equal all right i want to do this um tag is this string equals search string type this this is going to be value all right so what's the best way to loop through an object this always gets me what's the best for arrays and what's the best for objects i always forget so we don't want to use map on objects right but we can do we can do this right i don't know did we do this it comes from exhaustion this they form that's it object values yes i knew it thank you nikki i knew that there was a way to uh still use map with that that's what i was looking at the other project for i don't think we did it in the other project though okay so we're gonna you do object values um state check boxes dot map and we're gonna do um okay key value oops oops we're gonna do if um give value then search string equals key uh can i not do an if statement no i can't just return in this statement so i need to change this up now can i there we go okay let me and i can take yeah this shouldn't be there right yeah this one shouldn't be there but this one should be there right okay uh let me change your id value oh okay uh nikki i just saw that that message so let me switch this up here okay key value object entries okay object entries all right thank you and was that actually what we're using no we still weren't using it there where did we use that at i know we used it as at a project at some point object entries yeah so we definitely need both okay so let me go through let me go through this just to explain what we're doing um so we're we're taking this object and we're basically all right so this we're treating this object as if it were an array okay so that lets us map over it we're getting the key value pairs and then we're checking to see if the value is true which means the box is checked we're adding to the search string the and type and then we're putting that name of key so it'll search through everything here and create a string that's going to have all the values that we need to pass in here for our search types so that's the idea and then what we what we need to do though is um set state so this set states oops search string and this needs to be is that what we called it actually if we called it search string they were okay no we called it search tight didn't we okay um search type search string oops and let's do this let's do this here i don't think this is the best place to put it but let's do this here so we can see it building it uh every time that we we check this so all right so my timer is up and i do have a meeting very soon so i just want to test this out briefly where we can look at state there we are okay so the search term or search type is what should be changing when we do this there we go and we should get awesome okay check this out uh let me make it a little bigger whoa that's really big see we can see it okay but hopefully you can see it so what happened here so we checked both these boxes faculty and department so now we have research type of string that's and type department and type faculty and that's exactly what we need to pass in and so that that should work so unfortunately i don't have enough time to actually test this with a real search so i have to stop here but is creating the string as we want it so we did test the search with a string that was very similar to this and it worked so assuming i mean really it should work so should work isn't the same as does work but uh it's looking good so far let me scroll up to where he left off at and try to get through all these questions this is going to be a close one i'm going to do my best to get through the questions but if i don't get through them all i'm apologizing now and uh you can reask the question in the comments or you know send me a message on some social media platform or wait till the next stream uh stephen asks about what what is next js next js is very similar to create react app if you're familiar with that it just builds out a lot of the like boilerplate react stuff that you need it uh automatically has a webpack config the thing that i like about next.js is it comes with a basic router that lets you just create routes by putting components in a folder called pages and then it also comes built in with server side rendering so that's why we chose next for this project instead of create react app basically for the server side rendering chad says hello hey chad thanks for watching uh chris says which type of projects would warrant using react over other frameworks is it when you are handling state um yeah if if you need to handle state i think react is is a good choice so if you're building just like a onepage website you don't really need react you could definitely use react if you wanted to i built really basic things with react you know mainly for practice but if you were building more of a web app where you would have you know things changing uh if you want kind of like an easy way to handle clientside routing in your web app uh using like react with something like react router just makes it so much easier than trying to create your own routing system whether in vanilla js or jquery or something like that so that's when i would use it react isn't the only option though there are a lot of people using vue for that same sort of thing some people prefer something like angular so that's what i would use it for if there's definitely like a blurry line as to like well when do i need a framework and when do i not need a framework and so you're gonna find different answers to that question depending on what article you read or what video you watch um so i generally say if you want to learn a framework do a really basic project even if it seems like overkill because you'll get practice uh you know don't try to tackle some huge thing first if you're just trying to learn uh later on you know then you you get a hang of what it could do and then you'll know when that particular framework is going to be useful or when it'll just be more than you need so so okay uh saksham said the words are a little small please zoom a bit okay hopefully i i did make things bigger in dev tool so i'm hoping that that it did help you out uh sorry about that uh nino asks is there a method in react that gets called when you set the state and use the class component that it's called uh component did mount yes there is a component did mount uh so anything inside component did mount will run when the component has mounted right just like it says and there are other those are called life cycle methods so if you type in react lifecycle methods you should get as one of the search results a list of all the different life cycle methods that are available so there's like component will mount component did mount those are the two that i've mainly used there are others i can't remember them off the top of my head right now um but yes they're they are very helpful oh nikki says on that routing very interested to hear also please feedback on pr from a week ago pull requests oh i'm sorry nikki i just i totally forgot about that uh i will take a look at that pr before i make changes to the routing um i wish i had time right now to explain more to you i'll have to explain on tomorrow's stream or something like that uh but the changes i want to make i think they should fit in pretty easily with what's already there with just like very very minimal um changes so hopefully we can integrate your changes from that pr and you know maybe my changes if they're even needed um and we can make it do what we want basically there's just a lot more complexity to the url structure as i keep digging into it that i'm finding so uh i i was just had thought up a way to deal with that complexity um in in kind of a different way and let us handle it and still keep things the look of it kind of simple and easy to figure out what's going on as much as we can all right thank you so much everyone uh for watching and for all the help uh you all helped me so much in the stream today uh i i definitely appreciate it uh oh one more question is that sublime text no this is visual studio code uh okay all right so i really do i have to go and uh and get to another meeting i should be back tomorrow for another stream we'll probably be working on this again uh or maybe the router we'll see ah let's see oh nikki nikki i see that comment that's exactly what i was thinking of doing so i'm definitely going to look at your code i can't believe all right i can't believe you both thought of this we both thought of the same solution i mean you thought of it a week before i did but i should have just looked at that pull request all right i would definitely check it out and uh i may not even need to do what i was thinking of doing uh i could probably just do what you did sorry about that all right i'll be back tomorrow thank you for watching thank you for all your help you all are awesome and until tomorrow have a wonderful day
