hey everybody's Jessie and today we're gonna do some security work for our file uploader so we we built the uploader using node and we didn't even do any type of security at first we just got it working and left it alone for a while now I want to go back to it and I want to white make a whitelist for the different file types that were in accept set a maximum file size and we'll see what else we could put on here that's that's reasonable for for security and if you all have any suggestions or experience with node and file uploads let me know you can check out the code our server dot J's file in the repository the link is in the description so I've changed it slightly from from what's in the repo so I haven't committed any of this yet I'm doing this all on a separate branch and what's the name the file type check is the branch name so that that branch is committed to the repository but there's a little bit that hasn't been committed yet so you'll be able to see most of this file and I'll show you the parts that have changed yesterday I mentioned that I was having some trouble with the server and it wasn't working and I had an idea of what it was and it turns out I was actually right about what the problem was I just missed a step so it did have to do with that home page in package.json that was added to give us support for github pages but so what I had done and I mentioned yesterday was I took out that part of package JSON the home page part and then I tried to run the server again well with the step that I missed was building so I didn't rebuild before I've tried to run it so it was still using the old build that had the homepage set from package.json so once I rebuilt after removing it everything works so for now we're gonna leave out that homepage we're getting to the point where we'll probably have a version on a real server soon so we won't we won't need the github pages version when we have that we can just link to that so for now if you I guess if we really wanted to we could probably keep one branch with that in there but I don't know let me know I don't know if anybody's going to the github pages page or not if if a lot of people are using it then maybe I'll make another branch otherwise I'll just wait a little while until I get the server up and running for this all right so I'm gonna check the live chat quickly say hello okay so have a question so Andy says Dee's create react app for all your projects and the answer is no i you i also use next jazz for some projects if I need serverside rendering I use next if I don't need serverside rendering I usually use create react app Ivan create react app I don't really know for sure but it just it seems this is gonna seem weird because it makes a lot of decisions for you but it seems like I have more freedom with create react app in terms of what I want to use like for instance I can use react router Redux I'm sure there's a way to do that with next but next comes with routing new things builtin so I experiment with more things when I use create react app so I don't I'm not sure that that's a great reason to choose one or the other but that's what that's what I've been doing and it's nice to try out different different things alright so Matteo is joining us from from Italy for the first time live welcome it's a I'm glad you could you could join us Brett said first time on the livestream as well awesome so we have at least two firsttimers so welcome that's exciting alright so first thing we'll do is let me go over briefly a pull request that we got actually within I think we got it within the last hour and I was able to merge that and that's part of the the master branch now so well we got a lot more so john s is the first time a metamer not sure how to say that is first time to so awesome that's really exciting sometimes I wonder if I said the same people watching or if I do get new people so alright ones first time Christian first time wow this is really cool I'm excited alright so since there's so many firsttimers let me take a few seconds just to explain now I'm you may it's maybe your first time live and you may have watched this before so sorry if this is a repeat but the way this this show works so basically you're watching me do my everyday job I'm a frontend developer at a university Sebastian says it's his first time yeah yeah so my goal this is not really a tutorial the goal is just to give you an idea of what things are like for me I don't really know if I have kind of an average experience as a developer or not I've usually worked alone and that's why I kind of felt the need for something like this because I don't really know what it's like for other developers I've always been freelance or now in my current role I'm the only frontend developer there is you know there's one other person that does a lot of development work but we usually work on separate projects so I don't really have a team so I thought it would be cool to just share what I'm doing and it's kind of built into this team now where we have a lot of different people contributing to the project and helping out in the live chat so I try to keep it kind of this as interactive as possible where I take your suggestions and a lot of your suggestions get incorporated I learn a lot from you all hopefully you all can learn something from me or at least learn from my mistakes which I make frequently and I don't obviously it's live I don't edit anything out so the format is I give a little introduction a review pull requests and then we get to the code will code for usually about an hour maybe sometimes more every 25 minutes I take a five minute break to check the live chat and answer questions and then at the end whatever questions are left over I just take that time to answer all the questions usually I can get to all of them it's very rare maybe like two or three times it's happened that I couldn't get to all the questions so so don't worry about putting any questions you have in there be patient if I don't get to them at first though if there's a lot of questions in there I may not get to until the end but I'll do my best to get to get to everything the recording of this will be available on the free code camp Channel just a few minutes after the stream ends ok so I think that's all the normal stuff that that I need to say about the stream so I see there are some questions and so I'm gonna get to those I'm gonna start into the code and then I'll get to those on my first break so just tank hang in there a bit also there's a lot of really knowledgeable people in the live chat so sometimes they get to the questions before I do and give great answers better answers than I could could give so make sure you check if you ask you a question you know keep an eye on a live chat and you'll probably get some some really good answers ok so first things first let me just show you this pull request and I'm getting it ready on my other screens and then I'll pull it over ok so this is the pull request we get so Thank You Sebastian and you can see here you can check it out pull request number 53 if you want to see the files to change and everything but basically added some padding and we had talked about that maybe last week sometime or earlier I think it was last week at a page title had some consistency with the way we were using map from lodash and corrected my spelling for the SVG and we I wasted so much time because of a typo but if you was it last week yeah so really nice pull request Thank You Sebastian also I forgot to mention this yesterday and I think it'll be really helpful for a lot of you it certainly will be for me and I have no idea how I forgot to mention this because it was so awesome but as kind of a note on the end of the description of Matt's pool request yesterday he added some stuff about Redux he actually made a repository all about it's basically just an example of using redux and it's really well commented so if you're interested in learning Redux check that out you can the links here and I I forked it as well so it's it's on my github profile too but really really cool and useful I had mentioned last week that I was having trouble with Redux on the Udacity react nanodegree course and Matt last week had said it had offered to help and then without me even asking just provided so much so I really appreciate that and I haven't had time to work on that course yet but I'm gonna work on it probably at some point this week hopefully I'll have some time on the weekend as well and I'm definitely going to go through that repository and you know learn as much as I can okay let's get started I do want to apologize to anyone who was watching the Instagram stream yesterday which if you're not familiar with that my on Instagram I have a second stream at the same time as this one and you can see my face if you're interested in that but it's just kind of a like novelty type of fun thing so but anyway I had the wrong camera on so everybody was looking at my desk instead of my face for the first few minutes so sorry about that I just I didn't even notice it until a few minutes in but today the streams good howto right off the bat alright so here's my here's what I've added so let me show you what I brought in so I brought in this file type package so with this package at least for my understanding what it's supposed to do is read a stream read the just enough of bytes to know what type the file is and so I thought yeah definitely I want that but then I couldn't get it to work probably because I was trying to read files that were not being streamed in then I found on Stack Overflow someone trying to do a similar thing and you can just check right from formidable which is what we're using to handle or form data you can just check the file type now here's the thing I'm not sure about on the formidable documentation it mentions that doing it this way so just getting the file type is not it says it's the file type is it as reported by the client let me see I have the documentation up on my other screen I want to read you with what it says exactly type it says the M IME type of this file according to the uploading client so I wasn't sure what that was saying exactly is the and here was my worry was if that is is that being sent clientside could that be faked would it be more reliable to try to get that file type plugin working because that's actually reading the bytes of the file instead so let me know what you think about that if you have any experience with that I think I'm gonna go with this for now and maybe try to do a little bit more research I've already read through a lot of stuff without without really finding a definitive answer but for now I'll I'll try this out and hopefully this works and you know I don't want I'm not like really really worried about malicious files and things I mean I'm reasonably worried about it but it wouldn't be the end of the world this is going to be on its own separate server not connected to anything else that has to do with any of our sites or databases or anything so even if it were to happen which I'm gonna try my best to make sure it doesn't happen but even if something were to happen it's going to be contained which is good but I'd still like to do it the best way possible if I can so if you know of any resources that I can use to learn more about this you know please please let me know alright so we're going to go along with with this so right before I started this dream I just added this in here from the stack overflow question and what I'm doing is I've just created a constant called type and actually copied and pasted and say here we go I wanted it to be called file type okay so file type equals this this is from formidable that we can go file dot type now that will give us something like image slash in PNG right jpg something so that that's what it'll it'll give us but I don't want to have to type image slash for everything to check so that's where we're doing the split in the pop so that it returns something like this which is a little bit easier to check so all basically most of this if not all of it well not all of it I did change a bit but most of it is just copy and pasted right from Stack Overflow and for the most part unedited so I figure we'll try it out and I'm gonna upload some files and see if this will actually work basically what we're doing is checking for the file type if it is one of these types then we'll go ahead with this otherwise we'll console.log incorrect file type and we'll also make sure we check the uploads directory to see what is actually been uploaded and let me yeah I definitely want to I want to delete that because that that one's going to be the unsupported file type all right so I've there's not really any sense pulling the the site up on the screen right now because all I'm gonna do is just hit hit the submit button but I'm will look at the output here and this is what we really want to look at so let me make sure I'm uploading something with a different file site alright so I'm just uploading a bunch of things with one dot xcf file whoa an error occurred let's see maybe I didn't hit save I thought I fixed that all right let's hit save and chat again there we go alright so let's see what happened okay so once it got to here its we see it says incorrect file type and then we do we get a message we still got a message that it's uploaded but it should not have actually uploaded that's right and it did not upload so we will have to I guess we could probably change this so that it checks the same thing I'm not sure that it really matters whether or not we have this anyway we're not this is nice for testing but we're not really gonna see this for most of the time so this will probably get removed at some point anyway so I'm not too worried about that right now but we can confirm this is probably too small for most of you to see but there are no dot x CF files in the uploads folder all right and I forgot to start my Pomodoro timer all right I'm gonna do just a tenminute right now since I forgot to start it and after the ten minutes I'll do my fiveminute break and I'll go back to the live chat since we're about 20 minutes in anyway that that'll be close to what it would have been if I would have remembered to start it all right so that's the kind of the first layer that I wanted to do obviously this needs cleaned up we need to add more things to this list just figure out what I want on this list and and add it all I'm sure there's a better way to do it than this this is going to get really long and let's see it would be nice to also do the same type of validation clientside is to let the user know if they're trying to upload a file that's the wrong type so we may not get to that today but I just wanted to mention that that that's that's going to be a good thing to do otherwise people are going to upload a file thinking that it worked and it's not going to work and that could result in some confusion we don't want to rely on the client side stuff we definitely want the server side as well and let's go with let's try to limit the file size now so formidable comes with let me try to find there we go I'm going to bring over the documentation on formidable so we can all make sure we're all looking at the same thing so sighs so this we can get the file size right from here there's also an option so we can also limit the fields side so I'm not I guess I'm not super worried about the fields but there's already a default max in here so I'm not gonna change this right now I'm okay with this default max right and this says accept file so this doesn't really have anything to do with the files it's just the fields so the defaults fine but what we want to do is check the file size and then reject any files let me think what a reasonable sizes I'll just put just any size in there for now just to test it make sure you have it working and then I'm gonna check to see what what size limit I have in place currently for the the older version of this that's live right now and I'll probably stick with the same size limitation since you know users are already familiar with that the other thing that I'll mention why well it's in my head is we're gonna want to change the file names so as far as I understand security wise the reason you'd want to change the file names is potentially so like we want users to be able to access these files right so I want people I want to be able to access the files on people in my department to be able to access the files on the server by the link in case for some reason the files don't get transferred over to our project management system so that folder where the files are is going to be accessible so I don't want somebody uploading something and then trying to run it so we're going to change the file name alright so they won't they won't be able to just type the file name the day enter in and run it they'll have no idea what the file name is that file name is going to get sent the new file name will get sent in the email that's going to go to our project manager so she'll be able to click on those links the user is going to get sent the old file names just so that they can confirm that those were the files that they intended to send but they're not going to be able to click the link and check their files out so that should you know prevent some malicious activity I suppose and correct me if I'm wrong but that that was my understanding of the benefit of changing file names and I guess there's also a benefit of people not over writing files if they happen to upload a file with the same name it would overwrite the file that was in there so this way files are going to have a unique name and you won't have you know either of the problems that I just mentioned alright but first let's check out where the file size alright so I'm just going to console.log file size just to make sure that it is working I think it will I really don't have any reason to doubt that this would work but rather check it out now okay all right so it's not working in there probably because we have it in file begin let's see all right so we need some other way to check the file size I mean obviously if I put it here then we should get the real file size right so we're getting that here but at that point the files already been uploaded and we want to stop it from even being uploaded it seems like I'm missing something that's really obvious here right there should be a way to limit the file size yeah I think I still have yeah I still have the stackoverflow question where I got the the previous code from as well I'm interested to see how they're handling that so it looks like they're not they're not checking size at all all right let me check the latch act quickly and I'm about to the end anyway so I want to see if anyone's put anything in here about about our problem okay all right so looks like you have some suggestions so thanks John Hanson suggested sanitizing fields and suggest github.com dome purify so I'll check that out thank you for that let me let me go ahead and do my five minutes now so we'll take a break from the code for five minutes and I'm going to answer questions in the live chat then we'll come back and try to figure out what to do about this file size and actually maybe I'll explain when we come back I'll explain a little bit about how we're uploading files in the first place because if you didn't catch the the episode whenever we did that then you may may be a little bit confused if you've never handled file uploads and node makalah says I'm of you I'm a huge a s user but I like Jesse that's cool I really I appreciate you saying that that's cool Christian says this is pretty nice thank you thank you I appreciate you saying that I Abdul Azeez says I joined free code camp last week and I'm excited awesome awesome glad you glad you joined I hope you're making it through the the exercises and everything and feel free to ask any questions Christian says the idea about the team sounds fantastic yeah I actually the team thing came as kind of a surprise to me so well the first thing was I didn't know if anybody would even want to watch this at all and the first week or so I had there were maybe like two streams where I had no one watched at all and then I had just maybe like one or two people that watched consistently and then whenever I got invited to do this for the free code camp Channel I got a lot more viewers you know just because of how wellknown free code camp is at that point it really started it started to pick up and feel more like a team when people started contributing to the project both from pool requests and from suggestions and the live chat from you know messages on Twitter and things so now that team is just kind of grown and yeah I can't take credit for planning that at all it just it happened it's been it's been great and I've learned so much from the suggestions and all the code that has been contributed because obviously I go through it all I can't just merge stuff in without looking at it and to get when I go through it all I have to try my best to understand it all as well so I know my my coding has gotten at least I think it's gotten a lot better maybe one day I'll go back and watch some of the first dreams and compare and maybe you all have seen some sort of change if you've been watching from the beginning but yeah that's been a really really pleasant surprise having you know this community now Sergey asks what do you think about react Redux and rxjs I I like them i I think I really enjoy working with react Redux is confusing to me at this point I guess the big picture concepts of Redux are not that confusing like I get the flow of everything but the actual implementation of particularly trying to get data from an API and then put it in the component right now I'm getting the problem where my components are rendering before the data comes in and then they don't they don't ever get the correct data so I'm missing something somewhere along the way so I don't know if it's in my reducers or my actions or what so that's just kind of the the thing that I'm working with right now that's confusing to me I'm not really sure you know how to troubleshoot and the best way to go about that so I'm not to that point I think at least for me when I work with something new a lot of what I'm doing at first is just trying to adapt what other people have done without fully understanding everything after you work with it for a long time is after I work with it for a long time I get to the point where I can start doing my own thing more at that point then it's it gets a lot easier when something goes wrong but I'm at that first stage right now where since I don't fully understand everything when something goes wrong then it's really hard to figure out why it went wrong and sometimes you know I'll change something without even realizing you know what it does but I mean that's how you learn it's just it's this second project for the Udacity course is taking a lot longer than I had hoped it would take just because of that because of having to troubleshoot what I'm doing with Redux so anyway don't know how great of an answer that was to your question but let's just I guess a little bit of what I think about react and redux all right so I'm gonna go back to the code now I didn't make it through everything that's currently in the live chat but I'll come back to it I'm actually I'm gonna write down the timestamp for where I left off so I don't forget and I'll be able to get back to it more quickly on our next break so let me start up our 25 minute timer and as I mentioned a few minutes ago let me just take a moment just to go through what what we're doing so we have a form so we have this form and when we hit submit the form goes to our uploads path and so everything within so we're using Express so we're using nodejs right which is JavaScript running on the server side we're using Express with that okay and a bunch of other stuff to help us make handling forms easier so in particular formidable we're doing some things with that so we're using send grid to send mail okay but you know basically the main thing we're doing is we're listening for for that uploads let me see where it's at I lost it for when something comes in to that uploads directory and then we're going to do some stuff if that happens so in particular we're using formidable to handle that form data all right so that that helps take care of some things for us and then well particularly what we're working on right now is what do we do with the files so on file begins so when we varied the first time we start to get a file and we're uploading it right to our upload directory with with a certain file name and right now we're just keeping the same name and and that's our file uploader basically so that's what we started with and it works I mean down here we're just console logging the file name down here we're making an array of the files because we use that later on when we want to send things to different places so we're this is where we're getting all the values of all the other inputs and we're creating a string out of all those inputs and adding breaks in between it and then that way we can send this data in a more readable format and then down here we're doing some sending emails right so we're sending that string and we're also sending file names and then we're also sending some things to our project management system which is called rike so we're sending that same data that we send the email but in addition we're also sending the actual files so that's pretty much everything that's going on in our server dot J's file so if you haven't seen one of these or worked with one before I said what it might look confusing it is it's JavaScript and it's using a lot of different packages from from NPM but you know the basics of what's going on I think it or not it's not that hard to understand so hopefully you know that was a decent overview for you to understand the context of what we're doing and now we'll get back to ok file size that's what we want so we tried putting getting the file size on file begin that's not gonna work because the file has just begun being loaded being uploaded and it's showing up as zero what we want is to get the file size let's see let's get the fuss re I just I just got distracted I looked over at the lab chat and saw someone Christian s are you in are you Jesse in San Francisco I am NOT in San Francisco I am in Ohio right now house quite far away from San Francisco but I like San Francisco it's a really nice City I like that there are very few traffic lights and a lot of stop signs I think that's really cool and all the streets are in like an alphabetical grid and in numbered so you really can't get lost there's a lot of other really cool things about San Francisco but I just I that was just really cool to me anyway I guess I'm gonna have to do some some googling here quickly see all right so here's my I don't know if you actually want to see my googling but just in case here it is so not bad we got some stuff it's pretty old so let's go for past year so cynical edition okay yeah this is yeah this is what I want looks like some people are using jQuery I don't want jQuery we're not using jQuery all right well let's see what we have these first two I mean I'd rather this is all client side of course I think we should have a client side check but I'd rather have both the server side and client side check yeah so maybe I should be more specific in node okay this see so we are we we are we do have FS already okay so this person is trying to do the same thing that I want to do want to check it without actually uploading it the state class will not upload the file as I think all right well let's check that documentation then all right so we're checking the documentation for getting the file size mmm all right yes we can try this all right so let's see what what did all right I'm gonna move this over to my other screen so I can keep looking at it while we while we test it out all right let me see someone just asked in a live chat to see the website so here's the at least one page in the site I'm eating some suggestions here and the live chat so let me check them out oh okay so Brett's saying to use the on progress and and check it like that okay cool hey Phillip how's it going Phillips in the live chat says it's been a while yeah it's been a while hopefully everything is going well with you welcome back alright so that's always formidable here we go alright so let me show you what I think it's down here what we're talking about okay so we were checking this we're gonna use this to check on our file size and see how we're gonna do this well let's copy it first and play around with it okay alright let's just put this in here for now and let's console.log all right so let's just check out what we get when we do this so this should the documentation says for each chunk of data that's downloaded this should give us values okay so submit that awesome all right great so we are getting received and expected nice so really as long as we know the expected I guess we could roll right away we could rule out a file if the expected amount of data is more than our cap and then we did further check it to make sure that the received amount of data is under the cap so I don't know if it's possible but maybe the expected data it could be incorrect and file the real file size is much bigger so I can see value in checking both all right awesome so thank you Brett that was definitely what we needed all right so now let's just figure out how we're going to hook this up into what we're currently doing the the easiest thing would just be to put this this form on right in here I don't really think that'll work but it's it's such an easy thing that I think it's worthwhile to just try it even though I have just really small hopes of it actually working but let's give it a shot hey well we didn't get an error there which is nice that's interesting it did it actually work I was compared mmhmm okay maybe that did work I I did not think it would work but if it did that's great see so it's always worthwhile to just try something especially if it if it doesn't really take that long to test it and know if it works or not all right so I think this works just like this which makes it a lot easier so what we can do then is now obviously there's always time to refactor so if you're looking at my code during this and thinking like what is he doing certainly I'm definitely I'm open for well number one for me refactoring but also if anybody else really wants to refactor you know this is available on github for pool requests and I appreciate that so for now I guess I'll leave this logs in and let's put let's see if bytes expected or just I don't know what we want to set the limit as I want some of these to not go through so respected it's greater than just cut this down oops I'm here or fights received then we will actually upload and let's also yeah we'll be able to see what gets uploaded so let's save that and deletes I think we can just delete let's delete everything out of here then it'll be really obvious what makes it in whoa so there we go okay all right so everything's deleted now and we'll be able to see what gets uploaded let me see it may not upload anything I'm not sure what all these sizes are but yeah let's see actually not I'm looking at this it's really odd that each one of these files is exactly the same size that makes me think that something's wrong so let's give it a shot okay it's alright cool so nothing was uploaded which is what we expected I definitely want to see though what size these files really are so I'm gonna try to find these files see which ones are trying to upload activity for yeah something's wrong because these files are definitely different sizes all right so what's going on so even when we had it let's doublecheck back to this the first time I want to check the first time we had this where it was outside of the other function there we go all right so we had for that first file 21 okay so it was already happening then hmm all right let me think about this I'm not exactly sure what the problem is it's which which should be happening it's this let's let's look at the documentation it doesn't say much about it I did it doesn't say that this is for every file individually is it possible that this is for everything in the form being sent yes all right well I know I guess we can test this let's remove one of these files so we're gonna go from day for to day seven instead of day eight now if it was giving us the total of all of this it should be different right otherwise if it's something else going on like for instance maybe it's just telling us the value for this first one over and over again then it should still be the same all right okay all right so we got a different value now all right I do want to test one thing and my test was a bit flawed so on the off chance that it was actually giving us the value of the last one over and over again let's do it again where we take the first one off but keep the last one and see what we get okay and that's a different value as well so what what it seems like is happening is that this is not this is not the value I mean yeah this makes sense yeah I think this is giving us the total bytes received not per file if you notice and I didn't notice this before is that this this number keeps going up even regardless of what's being said here when this file actually it's uploaded it just keeps going up and up and up so at first I thought for some reason that it was restarting every time and I just was not paying enough attention but this is giving us the total for everything if that's the best we can do that's not terrible we could just set a max which I mean how would that be different than setting a limit to the number of files and then a max per file it really wouldn't be I guess it doesn't necessarily matter one way or another you know if we set a one megabyte limit and a 10 file limit or if we just set a 10 megabyte total limit it still still gonna be the same I guess it would be less confusing to the user if we could set a per file limit but if we can't this will still work so my timer did go off that was a really fast 25 minutes so let me go back to the live chat and I will scroll up to let's see I'm going to scroll up to the point in the live chat we're in Eastern time it was eight minutes after two so I'm about an hour behind in a live chat and let's try to answer some more questions Brett says learned yarn from you Jesse awesome cool although now people were telling me to use the latest version of NPM instead of yarn but I've seen mixed things about that some people were saying yarn is still faster I don't really know I probably won't change for this project I'm used to the yarn commands now so maybe for a future project I'll try it Igor's asks what's the point of this app basically the main point of the app is to allow users to submit requests for work to my department so I work in the marketing department and we do a lot of different things both print design and writing and videos photography and websites so people will be able to use this form it'll send all the data directly to our project management system and from there our project manager can assign the project to the the correct people it's also a resource where people can download things so logos university logos and the the guide for for writing I guess there's a writing guide for official guidelines for university correspondence and things so there's some other things as well there oh it seems the audio was cutting out for Mandela effect conference so it looks like it's not cutting out for anybody else so I'm guessing then it's not something on my end so sorry about that I'm not really sure if I could do anything about it get success boy you've made me love coding love you brother I'm pretty grateful to you oh that's awesome thank you so much for saying that I really really appreciate that that's that's cool I'm glad sometimes I worry that my streams get boring especially when I can't figure out what to do but if I've made you love coding then I must be doing something right so that's awesome it's Brett says Brett was having a conversation with someone else it was also from San Francisco but he mentioned in that conversation that I like Jesse strange because he goes through the bumps in the road yeah my streams are very bumpy sometimes that was the point I I definitely it's intentional that I don't prepare beforehand for two reasons one of them is a very selfish lazy reason and one of them is a useful reason the lazy reason is if I don't prepare beforehand then I don't have to take time to prepare right so it's I can do these videos without without as much work which is kind of necessary if I if I had to prerecord videos and edit and do everything then there's no way I could do this everyday for a couple hours but the the more useful reason at least for all of you is I wanted you all to see what it's like for me and how often I make mistakes and have to work through that because the prerecorded tutorial videos that are out there are really awesome and I benefited greatly from them but you get the feeling especially when I was starting out you get the feeling like everybody else knows what they're doing and you don't because you you know I messed up a lot and they never mess up and realistically they have time to edit I mean I'm sure that you know fiveminute video takes a lot longer than five minutes to do because their mistakes but those get edited out you don't see those so I really wanted you all to be able to see the mistakes so I was a little bit nervous at everyone thinking that I was a noob because I make so many mistakes but I've gotten over that now and in fact no one calls me a noob you are very understanding of the mistakes and I think that's that's part of the uniqueness of this of this stream is uniqueness a word I'm not sure it just sounded weird when I said it okay I'm gonna I'm actually really close to being at the bottom of the live chat so I'm just going to take another few seconds and look at this if there's any questions before I go back to the code Jordan says hello from Tennessee hey how's it going I've got relatives in Tennessee and who else Patrick Patrick's in Tennessee too right yeah okay I'm glad I looked down because there's a lot in here talking about what was just going on so it seems like you all figured out what was going on before I did that's just great until 230 then not so great without sugar yeah that's uh that's kind of what I was getting at when I was talking about refactoring is this better get at it in later sometimes when I'm really trying to do things I just fall back on the very basics of JavaScript just to get it to work because I know I'm comfortable with the basics and I don't want to be troubleshooting for something and it's just me not remembering how to do some es6 thing okay so let me I didn't get through all the questions let's go we'll probably do see what time it is first hmm I think I'll do one more session of coding I'd really like to get this working and then we'll go go back to the live chat and answer questions so let me start this up one more time and let's see so I see Joseph has said there's a max file size option for note formidable incoming form and is that the one we looked at next file size that's all I did not see the max file size option yeah so I'm not seeing the max file size is am I missing it somewhere okay so it's it's not it's not in here yet but is it let's see can I use it let's see is it in there yeah it's definitely in there nice that's awesome Joseph that's amazing so basically in the documentation for formidable it does not say anything about a max file size option but Joseph checked out the actual source code and found it so you can see it here in incoming form so I don't know why I didn't just do this right off the bat but this is really useful to just search an entire repository for something so right here under max field size there's an option for max file size really awesome so this is cool because this means a lot of the stuff that we just tried to do we can just remove and make this so much more simple so we should be able to just follow the implementation for the field size and instead put file size so hopefully that'll work let's try it out oh excuse me host yawning all right let's get rid of a bunch of this stuff it's actually let's keep this and want that stuff okay awesome and where's our documentation imax file size oops actually this way I want to be is to stop there so we should just be able to go form dot max file size let's just copy this and then change it there we go let's put it up here okay cool now let's test this out so actually probably doesn't matter we can just keep could've just kept the ones we had but let's make sure all right so this is empty submit awesome check it out okay and all right I don't think that should have worked maybe let's check the versions were using alright there's the latest version but yes I mean this hasn't been updated in a while so that should be in there hmm all right let me check so Joseph said he saw it in a pull request that had been merged so let me check it out there we go let's check out what they say not much hmm okay so maybe it's a little bit more complicated it looks like it looks like motor actually has better better limits for this I remember I remember we were first looking into this we were trying to decide between these two Hey okay so basically for whatever reason this didn't work when I just did it but even if I can't get it to work it seems like this is not I don't it's not going to be great for security and if the other way that we are doing it might actually be better but if we can do both that would be the best alright let's see I just saw in the live chat ok Joseph said make it really small that's a good idea that'll definitely tell me if it's working or not yeah let's make this really small so how about this that's pretty small all right oops should've deleted these first let's delete them I'm gonna delete all of them there we go all right let's try not oh there there okay yes it's definitely not working keep losing my place hmm that's a okay Brett says the comment said to check the content length in the dark header that would be a way to reject before downloading starts okay just so so I guess says love you Jesse even though you are in your left brain which one's the left I can't remember there's a difference between left and right ones like more creative and but I can't remember which ones which so which one's the left brain supposed to be it's did they also so Brett okay so I guess as left is for logic right is for pure love and creativity yeah oh my creativity I guess I'm I have a little bit of creativity when I'm doing the design stuff I saved most of my creativity for the kitchen I like to cook okay Joseph says checkout issue 324 all right let's do that all right awesome awesome Thank You Joseph I asked if I could talk about myself maybe a little a little bit after this session so in eight minutes I'll talk about myself a little bit if you want to know anything specific ask it now I mean otherwise like I guess a lot you could talk about all right this should not work because when we checked file size and file began it was always zero we can try it again though I mean I'm gonna scroll down obviously this is not the less the last word on this I'm sorry there's there's been a lot of me reading documentation today I know that's probably not very fun to watch I probably should just enter this dream after the last one and read all this stuff on my own oh then area yeah this is what happened to us on file begin the file size is zero Oh swish some water and if we end up having to switch I mean I guess that would be I guess it would be okay but I'd rather not I don't know maybe it wouldn't be a big deal hopefully we can find a different solution now okay so let's check this out I wish this wasn't an image Wow mmhmm well they have about three minutes since this Pomodoro session is over I don't think that we're gonna get this working in that amount of time all right yeah I think I'll have to read a little bit more try this I'm also gonna look into using a motor see how hard it would be to switch if the switch is easy and we could still do everything we want then it might take less time to just switch than to figure out how to do this especially if it ends up being that the way military does it is more secure than what we would be able to do it was something like this so because this is a lot of code to do what you can do in you know a very short line with mole tears so I have used multi before so I'm not completely unfamiliar with it okay all right well I'm gonna go I'm not really gonna get much done in two minutes so I'm just gonna go back to the live chat and oh well sometimes that happens I really try to get things done but we did at least figure out we figured out a lot of stuff didn't get everything completed but made some good progress on understanding how formidable works and so hopefully I can build on a lot of that and I think thanks for you know everyone helping me out with that and really finding some good stuff in the documentation so let me go I'm gonna scroll up a bit to where I left off and go through some questions so so the coding portion is done for now if you don't want to stick around for the question an answer that's fine thank you so much for watching and tune in again sometime if you can otherwise if you have a question put it in the live chat now I'll do my best to answer it and if if you would rather ask it privately you can direct message me on Twitter or some other social media I'm I'm pretty much on all the the main social media channels okay so what I leave off 312 okay so David asks do you have any advice for beginners I'm 16 and want to become a web so I software developer and still deciding whether I need to go to your university or not so let me see so there was one at least one response I can see to that so let me read the response first before I I talked about it so Mandela effect conference says if it is paid paid for go then if you want to try programming take nine hours a semester and go to boot camp and then look for an internship all four years that you were in university yeah so I agree saying that if it's pagan so if you happen to get scholarships or somehow if it's paid for then it might not be a bad idea to go it does somewhat depend on your situation right if for some reason like you really need money now then even if your school is paid for then you still may not be able to afford it right because there's there's other expenses involved that sometimes that don't get paid for and then there's the you know all the time you spend it in your classes you won't be able to work or make money so there could be some situations where even if school is paid for you and want to but in general I would say in majority of situations if it's paid for you may as well do it because it's a huge value and if you if you take like the cost of school into consideration you'd be making more money doing that then you could probably make doing anything else at that point in your life so that said if you have to go into debt to go to school and what you really want to do is be a web developer or a software developer then I don't really recommend going to school going to university I would recommend like while you're already doing free code camp so go through that I've I've read stories of people who've gone through free code camp and gotten jobs really soon afterwards so that's definitely possible I would just say work with free code camp stuff take advantage of all the free resources you can online do freelance work to build up your portfolio and apply to any job that you're interested in just apply don't worry if you don't meet all the qualifications you know know what could happen and so anyway that's my advice I mean you're only 16 so you know at this point you're probably in high school so you do have some time to work on things before you really have to decide about college you know at least you know at least a year or two depending on what would grade you're in right now so you could work on your coding and even probably pick up some clients build your portfolio a bit and then you'll probably have a much better idea of of what you really want to do hopefully that's helpful Phillips says your videos are super realistic that's what makes them great yeah this is like legit reality TV here right yeah this is a hundred percent what I actually did the only difference between unknowing now and what I do the rest of the day is that I don't talk to myself in my office when i'm not streaming and i don't narrate what i'm doing otherwise it's pretty much the same and i don't have all of you helping me so that that's another big difference that's a benefit to me Raphael says hello everyone hey Raphael glad you could join I love the name Raphael I named my first son Raphael all right so I'm down to the bottom here of the live chat and this is where I go to ask me to talk about myself a little bit okay so let me do that well let me answer there's an easy question here I'll answer first before I get to that one Navan says what's the tool you used to record sessions it's called OBS so I think it works for for Mac and Windows I'm ever checked if it works on Linux or not not sure but OBS it was fairly easy to set up I had to mess with the settings a little bit to get it right but now that I have the settings right it's pretty easy cool and Navin also asks hi once again it's one month like we started 100 days of code would request you to make one session it will be an honor for us please I'm not exactly sure what you're asking so request you to take one session what sessions are so anyway Navin if you could elaborate a little bit on your last comment there about the 100 days of code and everything that would be good because I'm not exactly sure what would you're asking all right so while I'm waiting on the oh okay so Navin says we do online sessions from free code camp from the free code camp algorithms ok cool so all right so let me let me know if I'm wrong on this so is are you saying you have basically like it would just be a session of doing a free code camp algorithm online hey Brett I'll see you sir Brett's gotta go thank you so much Brett you were like a really big help and I really appreciate it so hopefully I could see you back here again okay so I'm okay Navin that seems that seems pretty cool could you so my length to my Twitter is in the description could you direct message me there with more details and time to kind of like get a better idea of exactly what's going on and let me know or I mean if you if you get find me on another social media or email or something that works too but usually Twitter is the most reliable way for me to answer so just let me know let me know some more details we could talk about it but that sounds pretty cool I'm definitely interested all right so I goes let me get C to your question a bit about myself so I just wanted to know a little bit about me also said I will start computer science University in a week so good luck with that just don't know what to expect at the Uni all right so anyway so I'm not I'm not sure exactly what area of my life that you would want to know about but I guess I'll just give you really general general overview so I'm gonna set a timer for five minutes because otherwise I'll just go on and on you all probably know by now that I can I can talk when I get into something so yeah so if you want to know about my my coding journey I did a video on my own channel about like when I first learned to code and kind of the steps along the way to where I am so I'm not gonna go into that so much since you can already watch that that's on my my which i think is linked in the description but basically all right here's the basics my name is Jessie and I I was born and raised in West Virginia in the United States and I had I live in Ohio now I work at a university I'm a frontend developer I'm married I have four kids from the ages of eight down to nine months old not sure if that's the information you expected but anyway yeah I am I I do live streams now and which is crazy because I'm normally pretty private before I did this I really never posted very much on social media I was very nervous about anyone even seeing my code if I would go to a conference I like usually didn't talk to a lot of people you know so it was a little it was kind of odd and like a spurofthemoment decision almost like one day at one morning I think I had thought about it occasionally but I remember one morning waking up and getting ready for work and thinking like oh I'm gonna do this and then I just came in and and did it like that was it yeah so yeah so I was somewhat introverted and I mean I mean like I'd be fine if I didn't leave my house very often like so not that I don't like people I mean I love people and I usually am fine when I'm around people and get into it it's just the act of actually going out to go do that do something it's like jumping in a pool like I don't want to jump in a pool if it's cold but usually once you jump in and get used to the water it's fine that's kind of how I am with like social situations like rather a little bit hard for me to leave but once I'm there I'm okay so yes so that's I guess a little bit about what I'm kind of about how I am NOT on the stream I mentioned earlier that I really like cooking so I've worked at restaurants before never as a chef but just other pretty much everything else you can do at a restaurant besides being a chef and so I've kind of picked up so that's kind of my other passion you know my other hobby besides coding that I'm really into I don't really get to do it as often as I can because I'm usually working but when I do get to do it it's it's really fun I do some gaming not really a lot I enjoy Starcraft which is an oldschool game from the 90s not Starcraft 2 I mean that the original Starcraft and then otherwise I'm pretty much confined to mobile games which I know people say that's not really gaming but when I'm busy and I have four kids it's like so much easier just to play on a phone in one hand while I'm holding a baby and the other hand helps pass the time when you're walking around at night trying to put a crying baby to sleep so anyway so I'm almost done with my five minutes of me so obviously there's a lot more to tell it's just China just kind of throwing out whatever I could think of for right now let's see I'm 31 I don't know if I've ever said I would I am so 31 years old let me think my favorite sport is American football although I rarely ever watch it and certainly don't play it anymore do you think I used to be a high school teacher I've been a high school teacher before I've been a manager at a fast food restaurant I've done a lot of things I used to be a day trader in the stock market so anyway but five minutes is up so I know that was kind of all over the place and didn't necessarily have anything to do with coding but if you want to know about more of coding related things about me then check out my my channel I have at least one video about that yes so I go said you are 31 and wow you have four kids and you worked a lot of places yeah I got married when I was 21 so got started early with being married and having kids and yeah so I jumped around in jobs quite a bit I was only a manager at a fast food place for a few months and that was just not really my thing although I got free food which was awesome that was the best part about the Chuck and I've worked at different places the day trading stock burger thing was really awesome for a while until I lost most of my money and then it wasn't so awesome but good thing my wife was very patient with me whenever that happened yeah I was a high school teacher for a little over three years so that was my longest the longest stay at any job unless you count my high school job with I worked for a city in West Virginia called weirdin so the city of Weirton had me I was a maintenance person basically and I cleaned up playgrounds I did that for like six summers in a row so anyway I've gone over my time so I'm gonna I'm gonna stop now if anyone if anyone wants me to do that again just let me know in the in the live chat so I try to keep it centered on code mostly since this is free code camp but I'm not opposed to a few minutes of talking about me only if you're really interested otherwise I'm not gonna definitely not going to do it so anyway I guess I thank you you're welcome no problem all right so I think I've answered all the questions and let's see yeah I think sorry I'm just just checking my calendar on my other screen to see make sure I can stream at the same time tomorrow actually yeah tomorrow might be a little bit different time for a stream mmhmm it might be a morning in am stream eastern time so I'll try to get in early and let you all know as soon as I can because I have I have to do an interview for a candidate for a web developer position that we have open right around the same time I normally stream so I don't really want to risk it and if that goes longer than expected then I won't be able to stream so probably plan on doing a stream tomorrow morning eastern time maybe like 1000 a.m. somewhere around there Eastern but so I'll see y'all then hopefully I can get some of this figured out that we worked on today and let you know how it went but anyway thank you so much for watching and for all your help I really appreciate that and I'll be back tomorrow have a great day
