hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to do some styling and some ui changes to make this app look a little nicer as you can see there's no video right now so i don't know why uh i i moved so i moved into my new house i unplugged everything moved all my computers over plugged it back in and my webcam now does not work so i'm installing some stuff from the manufacturer that hopefully will help it says it's going to finish in about a minute so the video may turn on it may not but you all don't watch this for my face anyway um so let's get started uh as long as you can see the screen and hear me i think that's uh that's good enough um i'm gonna check real quick and see what everyone's saying in the chat um hey everybody see a lot of people just saying hi how's it going okay let's bring up the app first so that everybody who hasn't seen it yet can at least see it um also sorry the the installation just finished so let's see oh okay no i don't want to sign up for this okay wow all right so i don't think that did anything because nothing happened hey we've got something that's weird huh there we go it works all right let's move it over so it's all right spot there we go okay so i i guess it was just a driver or something um you can see my background has changed so this is my new place um i'm thinking about getting a fish tank back there so i have a fish tank with some goldfish i haven't moved it yet so i don't know let me know what you think if you want to see my goldfish behind me anyway all right let's get started so i do want to give a shout out to chris who did a awesome pull request so let's do uh get pool this is going to pull down all those changes from the port so you can see like the the code changed immediately there um so this is decently significant pull requests especially considering the project's still small this is uh quite a few changes so thank you chris uh we're also gonna do yarn this is a good practice anytime you start a project or i'm sorry anytime you're working on a project first thing you should do um is do a get pull as soon as you you start working on it in the morning you know do get pool do um and then run yarn or npm install that way you know you have the latest you know changes and and the packages right like i've forgotten this before um and i start working realize i don't have the latest changes and then there's like merge conflicts and stuff or i do remember to pull but i don't remember to to run yarn and install the packages and then i get all these errors uh and for a second i'm freaking out before i realized that oh i i just didn't install the new packages so let's start so let's start this up that way we could see the app uh so we'll be able to see it and also let's go to the pull requests so the issues now there's only two issues left i'm sure we'll we'll be able to add some more but we're going to close pull requests and check out this one right so i'm not gonna go through all of this just so that we have time for coding but check this out the link to the uh the repo is in the description so you can check out but basically this fixes two problems one we had said that we don't want the user to get the same question in a row like the exact same question twice in a row also we don't want when you're doing subtraction we don't want subtraction to result in a negative number at least not in in the first the first level uh also it found some bugs that i didn't realize were happening and fix those as well so that's awesome you can check that out there you can check out all the files that it have changed um add a little bit to the the prettier config which is nice i'll probably set up some like automatic linting so that anytime anyone tries to commit code it'll auto lint it and let me know if you want to see how to do that i can do it on a stream otherwise maybe i just try to do it you know on my own and just have it set up but it is kind of a cool setup i usually do it for all my projects and it it avoids having uh like weird commits where you have uh it looks like you have a lot of changes but they're not really changes it's just like formatting things like a semicolon or not using a semicolon or weird spaces so anyway um oh i have some questions about that uh auto link so when i say like auto linting and auto formatting i just mean like as soon as you would do like a git commit there'd be a precommit hook that would run and it would go through all your code it would check it to make sure the syntax is correct according to rules that we set up and then if it's possible for it to just automatically change your code to use the rules we set up it will do that so it's it's pretty cool it keeps a nice standard and it makes it so that if you want to contribute to this project you don't have to learn all the rules you just code how you like to code and then whenever you go to commit it'll change it all and it looks like there is some interest so yeah i'll definitely show you how to do that um maybe on the next stream that's what that's what i'll do so yeah it's a cool little setup and uh let's see i lost my train of thought what were you doing oh i wanted to show everybody the app okay just so you know um the way this is going to go we're going to do a little bit of coding and then i'm going to take a break and we're going to answer some questions and then at the end i'll try to answer all the remaining questions so if you have questions and they're in the chat and i haven't got to them i will get to them uh in in a bit probably in about i don't know 20 minutes or so maybe less i'll go back to the chat all right but this is the game right so if i'm sorry if there's a lot of background noise my kids are all getting ready for school they're about to leave so um i don't know how much of that that mike is picking up hey buddy uh you want to say hi hi i don't know if they can see you there say hi hi all right have a good day at school but um yeah so i'm just in my basement right now eventually i'm going to build like a legit office and hopefully sound proof it but just moved in last week so anyway uh these are the styles we do have different colors for each mode right but we just threw these in here um this is definitely not how i want it to look uh i still am not exactly sure how i want it to look but i think there's some improvements that could be made so let's first thing i want to do is open up dev tools right so if you're not familiar with devtools uh the this is your best friend as a web developer uh devtools will allow you to inspect things on the page see the code make changes basically they're like previews of changes that only you can you can see hey raphael i'm i'm live streaming but my son one of my sons was back there just like moving all these boxes um so what i want to do is see how this will look on a device because eventually we want to make this run on a mobile device as well as on a desktop so we haven't actually checked to see how this would look on a device so let's just uh i don't know which one i'll pick let's pick a small one just to uh to get an idea so this actually isn't terrible i kind of thought it would be worse since we hadn't had this in mind at all but it fits wow that's that's cool it actually fits um okay so just looking at this right now uh i think for sure uh the numbers need to be bigger and the buttons need to be bigger i think the uh the hero character that's here and the enemy characters that here that are here can definitely be smaller so the the perspective uh this is a children's game right uh so their attention is going to be drawn to this when in reality like this there's no interactions they can take here right so we're drawing the user to an area that they can't actually do anything with uh so i think we can we can shrink this uh so this is this stream is going to be a little bit of design and dev together right so i'm i'm a software engineer i've done design before a bit but i'm not primarily a designer so usually i just jump in and start coding and then figure out the design as i go along so if this were a real project on a real team we'd probably have a design a designer already do the design right so let's for now let's see what this looks like when we shrink these up and make this bigger all right and i want to make sure anything that a user would click is really big right because it's going to be a kids game their their dexterity is not going to be as good maybe as the average user potentially so we want to make sure they don't accidentally click in the wrong spot so right here i can see like the submit button needs to be bigger and there needs to be more space right uh so let's let's do that now like so since we're in devtools we can try some things out here without actually even touching our real code so let's click on some of these actually it might be easier in this case so like in the case of uh the numbers we can definitely make them bigger let's see so we can see all the properties that are currently on like the css properties that are currently on this we have the font size of 28 pixels so that actually is uh seems pretty big but as we can see like it doesn't actually look that big on that phone um so if we click that it'll show us where in the code we have the 28 pixels now unfortunately since we're doing this with react native web and it's coming through it won't allow us to edit directly in line if this was just a normal web app we could um so we're gonna have to override it and let's go with let's go with 40 pixels it's going to seem pretty crazy to do 40 pixels but i think it'll be good actually because of the way the styles get split up i can't target a style so let's just go back to our code really quick in this case i think it might be easier to just mess with our code directly normally it is not so we do have all the styles down here and uh i forgot we were using comic sans we'll pro we may change that it's i think since it's a kids game it might work okay so our character has a width of 80 and 80. let's let's cut that down right let's let's give that 40 and now our math container our math row so our math row has a padding on the bottom of eight let's bump that up to 16 okay and then our text size 28 will bump that up to 40. and we do have our inputs of sporticles i believe this is our input for let's give it a 60. let's make it just a square we'll give it a height and width of 60. i'm i didn't finish my thoughts sorry that's our input to put the answer to the the question so let's save all that and then see what it looks like now okay so definitely different we now have bigger text here we have more space i forgot to make the submit button bigger and is this okay so we we didn't actually make the text bigger in here so what we need to do that and let me check my time to make sure i i forgot to start my timer so so what i started at 7 30 so we've been about 20 minutes now all right let me just get just a few more minutes and then i'm gonna go to the live chat and read through the chat okay all right so for now let's uh let's make the button a bit bigger and we'll make the text inside the input match with this text oh don't let me forget i need to check out cypress so uh our testing suite has now changed from using puppeteer to using cypress so i want to give you a preview of that and i forgot to last time and i want to try to do it for sure this time so uh that was an addition from from harshit who i haven't seen in the chat today so i don't think he's here but he's been a big contributor to um to my streams for a long time for like over a year uh let's see where's our button i don't think we have any styles for a button so we're gonna have to go up here and see what we can do here oh okay so we actually have the the default styles for a button so let's look up in the doc the react native documentation what the styles are for button so if you're doing a react native project i definitely recommend just just leave the react native docs open on your tab uh on on one of your tabs because uh i i reference it so much there's just no point in me even closing it so here's the button you'd see i'm pretty sure we just copied this exactly but what i want to see is uh all the the props uh on press how to assist with color disable test id prefer focus okay so here's our props but what i want to see is what kind of styles we could actually give this um which i don't know let's see let's just add some styles and see if we can give it one we may have to switch it up so you can use touchable opacity or touchable native feedback to give your button some custom styles so we may have to switch up to that that's what i normally end up using anyway but for now let's just see if we can do this so i'm just going to do an inline style just as a test so we're going to add style so in uh react native if you want to do an inline style you can you want to uh use an object right so we're doing style we're putting our curly brackets which means hey we're about to do some javascript and then inside of there we have another set of curly brackets which is just normal javascript right it just says like this is an object and then now we're going to do css as if we were writing so like we're converting our normal css into javascript's object syntax right so we're going to camel case everything uh it's key value pairs right so in this case let's just say height hd if i can spell it ht and we're going to give it something crazy so we just know uh we know that it works right so type 200 so this would be obvious if it works and it didn't right so it looks like we're going to have to change that and we can't actually add a height to a button if there is some way to add height to a button let me know in the chat you know but according to the documentation it didn't look like we could i was hoping there would be like some props but it seems like the only thing you can really change style is this the color okay so i'm just going to click on touchable opacity so it's there and we can we can check that out and if anybody wants to read ahead i'm going to put this in the chat the link to touchable opacity if you've never used it before you can check out the docs basically you're just making something clickable and react native and you can give it whatever styles you want all right and i'm gonna take a fiveminute break here so i'm gonna set my my pomodoro timer to five minutes i'm gonna go to the chat and i'm gonna answer some questions okay so i'm scrolling just seeing a lot of people saying hi at first uh charming muhammad says this is a very good thing thank you oh you're welcome i appreciate that uh akeem says is this a react thing yes yes it's react native web so it's all react native syntax but we're actually running it as a web app if you want to know why we're doing like that watch like the first two streams and i i explain more of the benefits of doing that um eric says how can i find your javascript beginner tutorials so i haven't done a lot of tutorials myself it's mostly live streams and it's some streams are more beginner friendly and some streams aren't just depends on what we're working on that day but um there are some awesome beginner javascript tutorials on this channel on the free codecamp channel if you do want to see my tutorials check out my channel the links in the description i don't do as much with my personal youtube channel i'd love to do more just hard to find the time but i do have some tutorials on there for beginners let's see jalal says smile more bro you look better right all right i'll try to smile more uh the dawn says bro i love this channel oh thanks thanks yeah the free code game channel is awesome like not i'm not just talking about my stream like um there are so many really really good contributors uh and just the variety and quality of content on this channel is i mean it's really amazing and it's impressive like no one's getting paid to do this it's all volunteer uh so it's it's really cool and it's helped a lot of people to get their skills up and get jobs like including me uh charming says pulling in pulling and installing yarn before anything in the morning is good advice been a victim of such trust me you don't want to go through the work before you pull yeah for sure um bell bellis sorry angelo i'm sorry i i probably missed your name up uh let me know how i'm supposed to pronounce it this is uh i can anime that uh i'm not sure where you're what you're for are you offering to animate something and so let me know what you mean because i'm not exactly sure what what you're saying uh yes you asked if i have any plans to work on vue.js projects not right now uh i've i'm like curious about vue but i don't have any immediate plans to work on them maybe maybe i'll do it at some point creative girl says hi which one do i have to learn flexbox css grid or maybe bootstrap i have no idea when you use them okay that's a good question uh there are some answers there uh coding technique says i think flexbox is easier um uh is ishmael says i will go with bootstrap but just know a little flexbox okay so they're not exactly comparable right so bootstrap is an entire css library that's you bring in it's css and javascript and there's a lot of like builtin classes that you can use to style an entire app or a website flexbox is a part of css and so is grid so it's a part of just normal css you don't have to import anything uh extra and it's used for positioning right so back in the day people use tables for positioning or we used floats for positioning but flex or flex box gives you a nicer way to position uh like for instance you can vertically center things on a page very easily with flexbox right that was always really hard to do before and not that it was impossible but it was just more difficult grid is another way to align things on a page so it's not exactly comparable so like if you learned all of bootstrap you could style an entire site if you learned flexbox you could just position things which you couldn't really style things so i say definitely if if you want to do react native then you need to know flexbox uh because flexbox is the default positioning system for react native so i definitely recommend using flexbox that's what we use and like bootstrap's not always going to be available to you so you know try to learn the the regular css it'll be easier to work on a variety of sites if you know css bootstraps should be easy to pick up because it's just basically giving you chunks of you know prewritten css attached to classes that you can add to your site so if you know really no css you'd be able to understand all of bootstrap just by looking at the css files and kind of know what's what's happening and be able to change it up and like customize it to what you need okay does that make sense let me know if it doesn't all right didn't get through everything but let me go back to all right here's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna say i'm gonna mark down here where i left off 746. i need to like adjust the tilt of my screen or something it's really hard to see i need new screens period i just i'm using some old screens that i've just gotten from people like when they're getting rid of their screens okay so let's how much time do we have okay so we have about a half hour left so here's what i'd like to accomplish in that half an hour i want to get the styling so i want to get this button a little bit bigger uh commit these new styles i'm not like obviously we're not finished with the styling but this is just a little bit of some updates um i want to demo cypress for testing and then i want to finish the rest of the questions okay so that's the that's the plan so let's switch this up to use touchable opacity first so we can see in with touchable opacity obviously instead of using body button we're replacing it with this but then also we can put things inside of it and in fact we we need to put things inside of it so let me show you what i mean so right now our button we can say like the title is submit and look there's there's nothing there's no children to this button when we switch it to touchable opacity if we did this nothing would appear on the page right so we need to give it children for instance to to say like hey here's what you should display inside of this button all right so let's switch that up now and go to the top of the file and where we have button let's change it to touchable opacity should have changed up here too yep okay we're going to change it to touchable opacity now i know i'm going to need something in here and i will need text and let's say oh wait is this our oh this was our restart button oh i changed the wrong thing i forgot we had i i totally forgot we had a restart button all right let's do that again let's keep button in there because i don't want to mess with the restart button right now just because i want to finish on time right uh so let's touchable opacity now let's find the right button this time where are we at okay whoa actually did we yeah yeah this is what we did for a second i was like have we been working on the wrong button the whole time but i don't think so all right so touchable opacity and now we're going to say text submit and then we're going to close out touchable opacity okay now let me just say so we'll just see what shows up on the page now before we do anything else so you can see it's it's just the button right so it should still work so like right there's no um and you know what i just thought of we should uh not allow a submit if there's nothing in here i can see that being really frustrating for a child if they accidentally hit submit and haven't even put anything in there and then another enemy comes like that especially if a child is really struggling with their math and it would like almost be beat it and they know what the answer is and they just accidentally hit submit like that could be devastating for a little kid right like so let's make that happen so that we check to make sure that basically if there is nothing in this box we don't allow submit all right we're not going to do that right now but um let's just keep that in mind and add that in at some point if somebody wants to make an issue for that feel free to make an issue i'll try to remember and make an issue for it later uh okay so we need to style this this submit button right so you can see like our color you know that's not that's not going to work right we do someone to keep this test id i believe the title is not going to matter here we can double check that there is no title attribute let's see if it shows us yeah so our props here style active opacity yeah okay hmm actually this is kind of weird why do we have it's weird that they don't list on press under this i guess maybe they're just like assuming that you would have that but anyway we can remove where are we at oops here's our code you can definitely remove the color uh let's give this a style though style equals and let's say styles dot we'll just call this button for now i know we're gonna have we have more than one button but we'll just say styles.button and i'm going to group this i'm going to put this under input since it appears under the input all right so we need to give this like a height a width a background color right so let's say our height is going to be 40 pixels so we always want to at least go 40 for touches you know let's go um let's at least bump it up to 50 right i want to make this bigger than you would normally make it for an adult uh like i said i know kids fingers are smaller but they may be a bit more clumsy okay button height uh with let's just go with with like 100 for now let's see how it looks and then background color we can give it that same color that we had i'm not like a huge fan of that color but i don't really have any other color in mind so we might as well just use it okay let's see what that gives us now hey look we've got got a button okay you could see like look it's still just totally bare bones the the submit is not even centered so let's work on this submit as well yeah okay uh so we can actually set this to display i don't know if i should i don't think i need to put display flex on here but let's see so let's say justify content center and align items oops center so this is flexbox so this is what i'm talking about when i say flexbox makes vertically aligning things easy so this is going to vertically and horizontally center submit hopefully let's see yep here we go so now it was up here now it is both vertically and horizontally centered so easy especially if you remember everything that you had to go through to make this happen before flexbox so much easier all right now we want to make our our text a little bit more readable so we're definitely going to give it a color of let's just say white for now all right so fff is going to give us white uh that's the the hex code and let's make the font size so the button itself is what's 50 so let's make our font size 40. i definitely don't want it to be bigger and let's see what it looks like oops we didn't apply it to the text so on the text here let's say style equals styles dot button text whoa okay we need to make that wider and okay yeah definitely need to make it wider and probably taller all right so the button now is 100 uh let's double it to 200 and let's make its height 60. okay that's more reasonable it's still not like a spectacular looking button but it does have a little effect right it has this little kind of flash thing right um and it still works all right i tell you truth like i i'm not thrilled with the way this button turned out but but it allows us to customize it so we can further customize this as we we need to right uh let's see yeah that i'm kind of thinking that the submit button is like dominating the page now i mean i do want to keep track of my time okay but uh i think i'm at a point now where i want to commit this uh and and then check out the testing suite so that i have enough time to get to the um like the the messages uh the chat messages okay so so if if you're totally a beginner and you're not really familiar with version control uh we're using get okay so we have a git status and that tells us what's changed right we've only really worked on one file right so that's to be expected and now we're gonna do a git commit i'm going to give it an am flag okay and then i'm going to put the commit message so i'm going to say feature um this is like a terrible message uh but we we just adjusted styles right so let's commit that and now we can do a get push right and that's gonna push that up to github right okay so that's like very very basic of using get you commit and then you push um now we basically have a save point for our code that we could always go back to that point later on so if we totally mess things up in the next stream it's okay because we could always go back to this point all right now let's check out our package json for a second and see that we have this e2e script all right and that's going to open up cyprus and run some tests okay so let's let's check this out so we're going to run yarn e to e and like i haven't really used cyprus yet so harshit set this up um i think it's really cool i did run it once just to see what it did uh but it's definitely something that i want to learn more about uh because it's pretty cool so while this is doing its thing which why is this taking there we go so you see this is definitely different than what we had in the test before before our tests would just run and you know display some things here in the console but this is bringing up this whole ui right so it says here's our test here's our file right oops this is the following place cool all right so i click that and now it's running i didn't mean to actually run them but so i clicked on that file and you can see it's run all the tests in that file so we only have one file with the test i'm assuming if we had more it would show all the tests and we could run them all at once if we wanted okay but if you saw some flashes up on the screen of basically it it was running this and and going through the motions of clicking everything and it says we can see a title we can see hero and we can we get the if we do a correct addition answer it reduces the enemies by one right so we don't have a lot of tests in there but it's kind of cool to have a ui as well i know some of the people i work with on my team are way more familiar with ui stuff as opposed to like doing things through the command line uh so it definitely could be helpful um to be able to have that that visual uh of this so i can see you've no recorded run yeah so there's a lot of stuff in here that i haven't even messed with wow okay so there's all your settings in here so i mean this is really cool so definitely check this out if you need to do react testing wow really cool all right uh so i'm not gonna go more into that yet because i myself don't know that much about it so i'd rather not mislead you but i promised harshit that i would demo it so definitely uh you know check that out it looks cool it does give us some output in the command line as well um all right let's let's go back to the chat so i've left about 15 minutes before i have to end the show for chat so i hope i can get through everything uh before i have to end it and where'd i do that okay so i ended about there in the chat about 6 46 my time there we go okay and i'm gonna i didn't really display what's changed in our package json so i'm just going to put that up here uh really the dev dispen dependencies change we have cypress and our eslint plugin for cypress and all the stuff with like mocha and chai and puppeteer are gone all right so let's get to these questions uh ab abdullahi says i am fresh to programming and i don't know where to start uh check out freecodecam.org and just start out with with some of the lessons there it's totally free uh just create a free account and like free code camp's never going to try to sell you anything we're not going to spam you with ads nothing like that so just check it out start doing some of the the um the lessons there and see how you like it um web noob says in response to creative girl's question about flexbox and bootstrap and grid says everything is important to learn it yeah i mean ultimately yeah it's great to know everything but i would say like don't don't get overwhelmed thinking that you have to learn everything you definitely don't you know if you just pick something and learn it you're fine right so um i would just try not to be anxious about what to learn what to learn first and in what order uh you know just just learning something and being able to work with it is great like a ton of websites use bootstrap if you just know bootstrap there's a ton of work out there um the same way like if you just know flexbox you don't know bootstrap or grid you can still do a lot of awesome things like so basically my point is like as long as you're learning something that's you're good you know you're already going in the right direction you know and you'll learn more eventually just you know it takes time jimmy says guys please can you help me out how can i animate a button on long press um i'm not exactly sure that would be something i'd have to look up myself so i can't give you an answer right now but maybe somebody else in the in the chat can web noob says uh hey jesse are you teaching your kids and programming can't wait to try with my son yeah so actually i i do so we have like some little kid programming books uh that we we read to the kids sometimes and um we have trying to make what it's called uh tinker so we have a tinker subscription uh so i think it's like tinker.com or something and they have coding exercises for kids and so our my kids do that so we've tried out some other ones too um but my son especially my oldest my nineyearold seems to really like the tinker stuff and he works on it all the time so yeah so we're we're trying to teach him and not like pushing them into that into it but you know just kind of providing them with books and uh you know like lessons and stuff so it's there if they want to want it you know and they're just excited about using a computer so if i tell them like well the only way you can use computers if you're doing the coding stuff then usually that's enough and and they do it uh let's say uh bob i'm i'm really sorry i'm not pronouncing your name right uh but says are you using the windows subsystem for linux uh no so i am using bash on windows but i'm not i haven't done anything with the the subsystem yet it's uh gaming says hello everyone hey how's it going let's see oh cool so michael creel uh answered my question about the button and unfortunately i didn't look over to see that but thanks michael it basically says from stack overflow this component has limited options so you can't resize it to a fixed height all right so uh so that is true so basically we we did have to switch the button over to a touchable opacity in order to basically change anything except the color and text um for fargentius says uh are you doing the mobile or web yeah so right now we're doing web but we're gonna switch it over to mobile so let me give you an update on that actually so i'd like to use expo to help us uh test and build the mobile versions but unfortunately so all right let me give some background to explain this so like expo just takes has its own fork of react native right uh and it allows you to create react native apps more easily it comes with a lot of builtin things to to like developer tools and like different components that work with like hardware on a phone on a device so i'd love to use expo because it comes with all that but since expo has its own fork of react native it's behind a little bit so it's not the latest version so the latest version of react native allows you to use react hooks which we are using right but the expo version of react native doesn't yet support hooks so if we try to use expo right now we would have to switch to not use hooks and that would be a lot of refactoring and i don't want to refactor it back to that i'd rather use hooks so the plan is this i'm going to keep developing the web version i'm going to keep the mobile styles in mind like by using dev tools and mimicking the phone right but we're not actually going to test it on a device we're going to wait for the next update to expo which should allow us to use hooks then we'll pull in expo into our project and we'll be able to run the web version the mobile version the mobile in a simulator side by side so that we make a change we can immediately see how it impacts both the web and mobile versions so hopefully that makes sense we could just use straight up react native and run it like that but like i i really do like everything the additional stuff that expo uses so i'd rather just wait on that if it seems like it's gonna take a really long time then maybe we'll rethink that strategy but that's where i'm at right now so the mobile's coming we're just kind of waiting on the next expo update if anybody had knows like if you've been keeping track of the updates to expo and you have some insight into when that's gonna happen let me know last week or something i did read up on it and at least at that point i don't think there was an exact time for the next release saeed says love you bro oh thanks i love you too um let's see vedant says this channel is great um manu says well thanks thanks i appreciate that man who says please suggest um all right let me hold on let me read this question says i'm i'm intermediate in javascript but i can't build up logics what should i do um i check out some of the more advanced javascript uh problems in free code camp so freecodecam.org i check those out i know i keep recommending free code camp but it's just quality stuff and it's totally free right if you feel like you need more then maybe you know go look at some of the paid things out there but free code camp's always a great place to start there's always links to additional resources on the free code camp lessons so you can go and read more if if you want to but i would say yeah check those out it's gonna you know give you some algorithm problems uh and practice is really i mean that's how you build up your skills so just keep at it um it'll it'll be tough it's it's tough for me um to do the algorithm stuff and kind of the more advanced um like logic based stuff right because as a primarily like web mobile developer you know you're not doing a lot of algorithm based stuff so you don't normally get practice you kind of have to go out of your way to keep up and practice that stuff um jm says have you ever told your youtube audience about how you got into coding your challenges obstacles how you got your first job etc um it would be of interest to us newbies so i have a little so check out my youtube channel the link in this is in the description i have done some videos on like my background and how i got into that so go ahead and check that out um if you check that out and like there's something more specific you want me to talk about let me know and maybe i can make a video about that as well but yeah that's a good question and so i do have kind of a basic overview of how i got into coding um so that should kind of highlight a lot of that oh goodness um somebody said in response to the question about building up skills and logic and stuff uh somebody gave the response of just give up if you can't build logic then coding is not really your thing um so number one i would say please don't do comments like that you know we're trying to help each other out uh so i i don't really want comments like that let's keep it positive secondly like i'm gonna say it again like practice is the difference between people that can do things and people they can't right there's not like you know some people do have more natural ability one way or another or maybe their background gives them more ability but it's still if you practice you can get there so uh if something is really hard that doesn't mean you should give up it doesn't mean you can't do it right it just means you need more practice right that's that's it so yeah don't don't give up uh if this is what you want to do then keep at it right um and uh just don't get discouraged i you know it's easy to say don't get discouraged but just realize that like everyone goes through times where they feel like they just can't figure things out like i was working on a bug on my work project and trying to get something to work for like over a week just trying and trying and everything i tried just didn't work and i just felt like i was never going to figure this out and then then i did and it works it was and it was awesome and my team was excited and my boss took me to his boss and said here demo this thing right it was awesome all right and and but i really thought you know just just like two days before i was like in despair of ever finding a solution right so it's just like you know keep going and you find a solution right i think people that have been doing this for a long time realize that you will always find a solution eventually so you know don't give up so um but just in general everybody try to keep things positive here you know there's enough depressing stuff out there in the world i don't want this stream to add to that okay um icram says anyone know any materials about music recommendation systems which could be helpful to my college project uh i'm really sorry um i don't know anything about that so i won't be able to help you hopefully somebody in the chat can um okay all right so jay says i'm confused between android and react what can i start for job purpose um okay so react is used normally for web apps right react native can be used for android apps so you could start out by just learning react and then transition into react native to build things for android as well so it kind of depends on what you want to do if you know you just want to be an android developer then maybe you you just learn android development and just don't worry about react at all but react is going to allow you to develop things for more devices more platforms so that may be a better path for a job but like it just kind of depends really on what you want to do aman asks can you use react navigation with react native web um so yeah so the navigation is a little bit tricky uh so you can use any navigation that will work on the web with react native web but when you want to also do it on mobile you'd have to have an alternate navigation system that would work with mobile so um i'm actually i'm working with navigation systems on another project right now that's react native web and so right now for the web navigation we're using uh react router but for mobile it's really like we have no mobile navigation system set up we're just kind of using state to navigate so like it's if that is a little bit tricky um i don't know of a navigation system that would work for both as of right now i'm hopeful there is one because i'd like to use it uh but to be honest i need to do more research on it as well all right i mean listen i do want to say like so i can see the the conversation from earlier that kind of got took a wrong turn there is going on so everybody just kind of like chill so um they don't like uh you like you're cool just like kind of like please don't tell people to give up um and then everybody else that's getting on vadon like let's just be cool about it too right like um and let's kind of just let it go for now all right okay michael creel says uh regarding coding with your kids have you tried scratch yes we have done some stuff with scratch that's really cool uh so if you haven't done anything with scratch even if you're an adult coder like check it out it's actually pretty fun um it's kind of like a drag and drop coding interface it's it's cool michael says if you have an android device you can plug it put it in a debug mode connect it to your computer and then dev tools can let you interact live with your phone um yeah that's yeah we have done that i've done that before um so yeah we may end up doing that but i do i want to do something in a way that uh everybody can see it on the stream so i don't want to run stuff on my device let's see oh cool so oman is researching navigation system that works on both okay cool i'll uh if you find anything let me know i i definitely want to want to know more about that um oh okay michael cruz is saying that it shows up live in devtools so maybe that might be something we could do where i could test it on my android uh it would show up live in devtools so you all could see it as well okay so maybe we'll have to to do that um robert boy uh best language to learn for beginners um it depends on what you want really um which you really want to learn but assuming you have no preference for what you want to try to do i'm going to say javascript because you can run javascript in a browser um and you don't need anything special on your uh on your computer right so uh try that out like if you if you know you want to do something different like if you're not interested in web development at all then like don't mess around with javascript right um but if you think you might want to do something that has to do with web development then go with javascript because you're going to have to learn it at some point anyway if you want to do web dev all right uh okay so i went over a little bit uh but i did get all the questions in so anyway uh i guess we'll be we'll wrap things up now i feel like i'm forgetting something but i think we did everything all right so thank you all so much for watching i'm not gonna be able to stream on friday because i'm gonna be at a conference so i'll be at the star trek conference in columbus ohio here in the in the u.s so i believe my talk from that conference is going to be online so whenever it gets posted online i'll i'll mention it in the chat and i'll probably post it on my social media and stuff so if you liked what you saw here subscribe and check out my channel and my social media and stuff links are in the description if you have suggestions for what i could do in the future you know let me know if you want to contribute to this project feel free you can add issues you can submit pull requests like the project's totally open source if you have any other questions that i didn't get to today you didn't get a chance to ask you know put it in the comments um send it to me on social media you know i'm happy to happy to help so uh i guess i'll see you all next week until then have a great week and uh thanks again for watching
