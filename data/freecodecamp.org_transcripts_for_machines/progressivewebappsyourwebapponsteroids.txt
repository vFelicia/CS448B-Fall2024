so thanks for coming uh my name is maxons and i'm pretty happy to be here in indiana this is the first time for me and for now i i really like the city so it's really cool uh we're gonna talk for i'm gonna talk for for the next hour about the the progressive web apps uh yes all of my slide everything uh this is my slide deck um pu dot f slash torque i'm gonna give some some numbers etc so if you want to check the source uh even if you want to to see back the the slide after go go here after you just need to select uh the correct uh the quest torque which is a progressive way back okay so this is the the starting points of of my torch um months ago i read the i i started to find on the on the on twitter on some blog posts were talking about native apps and according to some people uh they were doomed so i start to to dig into uh into that and i find some interesting studios interesting statistics about it first of all fifty percent of the american user download zero up per month uh then only ten percent download one app amounts and after 110 etc okay i also find that most of the time we spend on our smartphone is on the three on the top three app and also uh less points it's more about revenue uh it's pretty hard if you are doing uh an active application to get revenue from this if you are out of this um this publish also all the google et cetera there is another problem if if your company got an app it's hard to to reach people what i mean is on every step you got for on every step you are losing 20 percent of the user so you have to find an app you lost 20 users then you click on the detail you lost uh 20 user etc etc etc so at the end if if you want to reach 1000 user at the end maybe uh 262 according to this today uh 262 yeah it's it's an average but gonna use the app and on this 262 uh the studies say 50 50 75 of the user download an app use it once and never come back on the day two we get uh we are more than eighty percent until at three months after or even yeah three months after we got something close to five percent of the user we still use your application the the reason is one of the reason is sometimes we have to to download an app and we don't really want it when i came here in vienna i had to install the an app for um for lutzfenza i think uh i'm just gonna use this app once and look it's yeah it was pretty similar something like 40 megabytes just to show one qr code to the yeah on the airport that's only why i need an app for this after there is some use case it's still relevant about uh about reachability also um because of all of this friction it's hard for you to to get new customers on the on your app and on the other hand a mobile with the web it's pretty more simple to reach new customers but but uh if you got an app you probably you probably know that the user spend more time on the on the native app than a mobile application why the answer is pretty simple you got notification the user got already taken on the on the desktop so yeah there is more engagement so let's summarize we got two things we got the mobile app and the website we with the mobile app we can do a lot of things there is a lot of capability etc but the rich ability is really hard and here my web app i can reach a lot of people but i cannot retain them so some people mostly from from google they they start from from this starting point and say okay how to put uh how to increase the my website and get something with more capabilities so that's that's the main uh yeah the main reason to you to switch to something called the the progressive web apps so we're gonna try to put at the same level uh in term of functionalities an active app on a web app the progressive web apps it's uh it's just a set of of correct rule that your web apps have to have to reach so take care you don't need to update your your linkedin profile right now you probably do some some of them the first one one of the first rule is get links one page you got one link welcome to http protocol something it's pretty basic so i'm not gonna stay longer on this slide um i was talking about http we could add an s you recognize the lock here for years people didn't switch to https because of monet they did not want to buy a certificate i have a good news since 2016 now there is something called let some scripts and now this organization provide a free certificate and no it's not from hipster or bitnix look there is a lot of look dispenser i mean we can trust this okay the third point really basic as well responsive uh if you still don't know what's responsive remember this picture from stephanie walter uh let me and she said yeah content content is like it's like water so don't want to put all the data from this screen to you to your mobile it's do something uh yeah responsive to adapt to to the device now we start to to reach something a bit more interesting because you probably already follow all this this third yeah this three step the first the fourth one is uh getting something more uh applike so when you are using a progressive web app you should not think about i am on the web i am on the app now it should see it should be the the same experience there is something interesting called the application architecture so given i'm i'm a shop and i want to to show some to show some clothes george.com did that the cash they put this and the the left um sorry the left the left screen so all the architecture etc you keep it uh it's instant instantly loaded and then you do a asynchronous request to the network and you go and you fetch uh the data on when the data are here it's feed the it it fit the screen you got something pretty similar if you are using microsoft teams it's an equivalent to to to slack and there is also this i think in in facebook when you scroll really really fast you just see the architecture here also an interesting study george.com reduced the the page load by 3.8 by using this so it's something very interesting yeah the fifth point the fifth point is uh getting something uh progressive there is a framework i'm using which is called uh with uh i'm using in my company it's called ugs and they say it's a progressive framework it means you can use this uh you can create some small components in this technology in the oldfashioned websites without breaking everything etc so here it's kind of the same there is a lot of diversity of browsers so if you want to add something fancy in your browser it should not impact the the whole browsers because yes unfortunately not every browser are the same this is a screen from firefox firefox 58 so as you can see i cannot i cannot do some bluetooth usb nfc etc but if i check it with my chrome here i think i'm gonna get something slightly different yeah i don't see it yeah for instance uh this and the background background sync etc it's not the same in firefox than in in chrome the six points it's getting a fresh application fresh by fresh i mean always up to date there is something here a new world service workers i will come back in this notion just after the idea behind this is uh to get an application always up to date here if you see this is my uh an app from my bank i updated four days ago and they already asked me to um to do an update well sometime it's it's not a big deal but when i need this app i sometimes i just need it right now like this is what i get the other day i came back from from work and i just wanted to to play to my race game and i got this screen say not today well here it's okay it's 48 megabits but sometime it's even more and it's pretty annoying so the idea behind this is to use something called the background sync to use some tasks in background to update your app um if you are using some browsers like uh firefox chrome it's they're working like this you get an update and they just say oh next time you're gonna you're gonna reload the browser we're gonna get uh you're gonna get a new uh you're gonna get a new a new version but that don't block you so this is the id the seventh point is um about installation as i said before um something good with your uh with native apps is you get the icon on the screen so here the id is exactly the same you should be able to get your web your web icon on screen oops this is the progressive web apps i did with this ugs framework and it's based on the github api so i call it github if you see here there is a small house with a plus so it means it's a progressive web apps you can install you can install this app so if i click here i will get something like this do you want to add this application on your screen i click on add tool screen and here i got it like this so this is my phone you got two icons here in the middle one from firefox and the other one from chrome and the difference between uh this and the shortcut because you know sometimes you can just take a shortcut on the website and put it on your on your on your home on your home page but here it's considered by your um by your uh sorry your um your operating system as an application which means i can after find it if i want to find an application in my phone there is also something so this slide are progressive web apps friendly which means i can also install them so i'm on chrome here and if i want to to install my application wait here i just need i clicked add to home screen and it doesn't work oh no my bad i didn't so look uh there is a at this application to your shelf so you click add and cool my browser is gone well demo effects okay let's restart this okay instead i inspect i go under application at home screen add okay add to uh add to your desktop so here this is how it's working ubuntu and after i got something pretty weird here uh so i click i say trust on launch and tada i got my slide and it's look like uh it's look like an app and look i can also here put it on my uh on my dock you got something pretty similar on osx i didn't test on uh on microsite on microsoft the full screen i didn't test it on microsoft so so yeah every uh every browser got a different way of handling this uh this small house the the install button um i think in in opera it's on the left it's also look like uh it's there is also a plus in chrome you must visit the page uh two time to to get this and yeah that's it the oh you you might think okay it's good oh can i get the this plus button on my on my website there is something called um the manifest.json uh it's it's a web app manifest and it's allow your application to be discoverable so the web app the json it's it's a file where you can put some different uh some different information about your uh about your your web app so you get the name a short name the short name is for the it's to put it on the on the screen on the on your home screen then you got a set of icons as far as remember for chrome you need an icon with 500 pixels something like this start url it's the entry point um check out i put a source equal on screen if you if you check the the spec of the of the web app manifest they say you can you can do this for analytics so after if you got some google analytics or something like this you can say okay i got 10 percent of users using this this web apps from the screen also display fullscreen if you check on my web app on my when i when i checked just before the installation you didn't sew the you didn't sew all the the panel from from the browser and mostly the most important here is we don't see the url bar so it's really look like an a real app from from your phone and after you can put some background color on time color i got another example here so i'm still on chrome if you want to to check your web app manifest on chrome you got the the developers tools and you just yeah go on manifest you will see the the name the shot name etc and the add to home screen so if something is wrong google will the tool will tell you and say oh i cannot add it on the screen because of this this so here i put this some colors and i got all of my sets of icons something cool there is a lot of website you just put one icon and degenerates everything including the the manifest.json so it's pretty easy to do also i was talking about uh microsoft i said i don't i don't know oh how did they manage this but i got the good news microsoft want to crawl all the progressive web app from the from the web convert them into something real i don't know what is app x but after what what they want to do is to to put them in the windows store so as a real application i think it's something really cool but look i put the scientist here so it's it's still in draft so we have to wait they say 2018 so i think but it was in september so i think we have to wait something like six months and after maybe we're gonna see some application in the microsoft store so here for to reach new customer it can be pretty good another point to increase the engagements with your customers is then the notification you probably saw it already in some website well sometime it's a bit annoying because when you open a website say okay can i send you a notification so you accept all your decline and it looks like this so i have to turn off on here when i click i got some notification from uh from the um yeah the operating system and here say okay so you got uh you get a notification from the application called pwa this is the website and this is a message and now the about connection um because the 10 point the this point is about making a websites offline because the the best request is no request it was my face when i saw this i say well i have to do a website offline uh yeah let's explain how it's work oh no before why why well we are in good country with really nice internet connection but unfortunately it's not the same everywhere so yeah in australia it's pretty good uh i'm working in ireland it's pretty good too but if you check in uh some country in asia in africa in south america it's not good well even in france it's one of the best but i'm sure when my parents gonna see this talk on youtube they will not see it in hd because they got a pretty pretty bad connection and also something that we have to keep in mind it's 45 percent of the world population it's still on 2g network so we have to think about these people there is still people in africa they download what the name an android app and after they can give them to each other in uh by usb so yeah unfortunately not everybody got a really fast wifi so how does it work uh there is something called a service worker this is a web page on the network something really basic if you want to to see the the page you do an http get to to the network and something is coming in the in the browser well it's already here but the the document from the w3c is still in draft but it's already implemented in all the browsers basically you got your web page if you want to to access to the network there is something in the middle called service worker um it's not only a proxy some people resume a service worker as a proxy but it's it can do much more but the interesting part for from this point is what we can do with the service worker so i want to access to the network and the service worker say oh i saw this request maybe i can put it in the cache so then if you want to get it again you just need to call the cache and all of this is browser side when i saw this i say wow it's pretty cool because now i can do a lot of things in my in my application jake archibald wrote something called the offline cookbook and in this offline cookbook he gave us some some pattern from offline strategy this one is catch first you want to load a page so first you add to the to the cache if there is no nothing in the cache then you fall back on the network is another one it's the opposite it's network network first otherwise you're going the cache yeah for instance if i'm a shop and i want to show the product i can use this but maybe for a really sensitive data like the price or the availability maybe i want to to do something like network only so no way you don't put anything in the cache some more interesting the cache then network so look i asked in parallel to the cache and to the network the cache returned me the data and the on the same time i'm going on the on the network and after i can retrieve the data so while i'm navigating on the website the data so first at t0 i got the the data from the cache and after why i'm navigating the data are getting up to date something pretty similar it's my favorite it's style while revalidates um you always saw the the assets but from a t minus one uh from the last time you you were on the on the website it can be interesting for assets like javascript files css etc so first page the user so the so when the user go in your website it saw the the result from yesterday or for uh the last time you went to your website and etc but if you got a single page application maybe it doesn't make sense but if you don't have a single page application a website like facebook usually you don't do only one click you just you reload the page several times so on the first page you get the version from yesterday maybe but the page load instantly and on the second page you got the some uptodate data so i gave you some few strategies for offline there is much more in the in this website uh in this cookbook i recommend you to take a look and yeah you can also follow this guy jake archibald is a pretty good guy from from google now how does it work how does it work all of this or i can do that on my website this is some javascript code basically everything is based on promise but i don't know about you but sometimes it can be a bit annoying to to write very huge text use um huge cut code just to to manage my assets there is something called workbox workbox it's a pretty good tool uh sponsored by google by the way and basically it looks like this so on the first parameter of this function so so i define some routes and i say okay everything which look like a png gif etc on the image i want to apply a cache first strategy i can also put some fancy name like the the name of of the cache gonna be image uh you only store 60 or 60 image and for a duration of 30 days or if you want something way more simple you can do something like this here i want to store all the http calls from the github api and then i want to apply the network first strategy i'm sorry for you there is no uh you have to deal with regex so if you are not if like me you are not a big fan of regex it can be a small issue now let's switch to the 11 points single page application no i'm joking and hopefully there is a lot of people that say you have to be you have to build a single page application to do a progressive web apps it's wrong and it's something pretty cool because building and second page application is hard so no single page application so let's summarize this is my definition of a progressive web app it's just something really cool like this so you got a website on the privacy web app but it's not really professional so let's switch to to another definition from alex russell another guy from google which is working on progressive web apps it's a it said uh a pwa it's nothing else than a website which take the good vitamin what are this good vitamin so let's summarize it's something reliable so https you can get it even if you are offline also it's fast thanks to the service workers and you can get some engage you can better engage the your your customers with uh by installing the application getting some um what's the name notification etc another great tool to help you to build uh the best pwa it's lighthouse lighthouse you get it by default on chrome so i opened the dev tools here and you get a pan called audit and here you can click to perform an edit you select what you want so here let's select everything and um lighthouse will scroll your website check uh about performance how performance it is and 2g network so blah blah blah and after it will it will give you a report so here i'm probably gonna blame me for the for the performance because uh i got a lot of image and i did not fully optimize them and maybe also gonna complain for some stuff because i put some css in the html it's not really nice but it's not the the goal do i need to wait no i don't have time to wait so yeah you can see what it is doing and here i got my results here so i'm 64 compliant with progressive web app so there is problem because my application doesn't register a service worker i don't i probably break something here you can also get some the first meaningful paint this is really interesting even if you don't want to build a pwa you can get some good insight from your websites say okay i have to optimize this this to get a better seo something good with lighthouse you can also put it in cli so by using it cli it's mean you can use it in your in your pipeline ci cd etc another point really important it's speed matter i like this picture this is the team from red bull they are changing four tires in two seconds while the average page load on the 3g network is 19 seconds well 19 seconds it's really slow i don't know why well no we know basically it's because of the analytics nonoptimization etc and something you have to keep in mind about speed if half of the pers of the half of the people expect your website to load in less than two seconds and if your website load in more than three seconds yeah three seconds you lost fifty percent uh 50 percent will bounce so it can be something really nice if you want to to sell pwa in your in your company check the bounce rate but unfortunately today um there is things that we still cannot do in your in a progressive web app like i cannot access to nfc to the calendar to my contact list so we have to wait if you remember the the screen from uh the the screen i show you uh about what the web can do uh it's changing it's moving it's moving really fast so uh i discovered yesterday something called the no not yesterday but a few weeks ago something called um web payments api there is a lot of friction today in uh in your application if you want to sell something basically on my phone there is something pretty good is when i want to buy it's already linked to my google accounts it's pretty fast to buy something on uh on a mobile on a mobile app but on the web you have to take your wallet the credit card etc so yeah to avoid this friction they are developing this payment request api and i think i did this in some really few line of javascripts you can get something like this so here i give you a link if you want to buy an iphone for 10 euro it's look like this and i got something from the browser here and i got the detail of of my bills here i can put the my credit card and i just need to click on pay and that's it i don't need it so i will not pay it also unfortunately the user yet are not really used to this to this install button so i don't know maybe in few years people will use this but for now there is still a reflex to go on the on the store so they have to work on it if you check the the first version of the install button and what is it today it changed a lot so they are they're still trying to find the best way to engage user uh through this this button now the last part is about feedbacks some companies move to to prohibit web apps and they give feedback to the community the first one is twitter if you remember the map i saw you i show you in africa for instance there is no uh the network is pretty low um company like twitter want to keep this market and want to better reach these markets so they create something called twitter lit uh it's it's just twitter but uh you in http request you just take what you need to so the there is less less less more uh request i think the the full home page only took one way one megabits one megabyte to load uh it's much more for the other app um and yeah when they did this app after this they take some metrics and it's pretty interesting to see that because the app is better there is better performance on the with the browser etc so the user use more the applications 65 percent it's a lot so and also people people use more apps they tweet more and they come back more often the 20 also uh ford did something pretty similar they switched to pwa plus 100 engagements it's pretty good it's well it's awesome the user use more the application and yeah you got the the source it's also on developer.google.com it's a really good resource to switch to to pwa or to get some insight from company that switched to pwa so it's yeah the developer blog from google and also the the last one is uh what pinterest did pinterest for me it's the the most most important study from from them um so they say okay let's go to pwa and they realize that people stay more on the app they consume more they get more money because they are based on they use advertising fortunately unfortunately for us there is more engagements and after they also did something interesting and they compiled the the statistic from the native app and from the the web app and they realized that it's kind of the same so if you remember at the beginning i was showing you this diagram so today we're here it's in the same level it's not in the same level to be fairly honest but it's changing a lot there is a lot of improvement from the browser it's changing fast so maybe yesterday you didn't wanted a native app for some reason but now you can do it because your web apps can access to your positions your localization you can also buy on your mobile etc so keep an eye on keep an eye on this website what web can do today etc because yeah it's moving it's moving really fast thank you i think i got time for some questions no uh so your question is is it possible today to be in the in the application store application store you mean uh the android store and the ios one uh for now the answer is no um there is nothing already checked the only thing is plan is from the microsoft store to put pwa after i think there is a reason there is a reason why they didn't talk about it it's also because um um because you have to follow some rules mostly for the i think the ios for ios they scan or they scroll your your application et cetera and follow for a web app it's a bit harder to to check what's inside and so for me it's it's the reason after maybe it's gonna change i don't know any other questions so if it's the end the question if it's if it's the end of the native app well i don't have my crystal ball some people say native apps are dooms it was the the introduction i truly believe that today the progressive web app on in few few years they're gonna get challenged um does it still relevant today to build uh to build native apps yes for some companies it's they're making all of the the money here uh after i also saw some even some applications they were only on the on native apps and they switched also to web apps like um tinder they switched to pwa there is a nice blog still on google and they're giving some insight so people so people are switching to to this because there is a need i don't know if if it's gonna get replaced from my point of view yes but i'm pretty i'm not really good for prediction so uh yeah i also put if you check on the on the slide i put some uh some tools also there is one called pwa builder they help you to generate your money first there is a web webpagetest.org to measure the performance of your website yeah also oh yeah you were asking if it's still relevant the native apps it was on my backup slide this is the trend from uh from facebook so the world go on mobile so yes it's relevant to still building uh native apps but pwa for me it's also really interesting because the the mobile on the web it's still the same it doesn't decrease so yeah uh because basically native app has access ah okay yeah uh well i think you can so it's well here so your question is uh what's the website about your privacy right so if there's access to uh i think it's there yeah you got it in chrome settings so you can see here for instance uh your web app can access to your geo localization without asking you i was a bit scared when i saw this i say wow uh they can check a lot of things yeah so your gps localization they don't need to to ask you they can access it directly so here the notification by default ilo but you can also block them but the most important things to watch is what you can get by default so yeah here the camera well not here the location it's the default so they need to ask maybe it was on firefox it's by default i don't really remember so yeah after you you have to uh some stuff are blocks for some of them they allow by default so you have to keep an eye on it uh but yeah something good also with your native apps you know what what they need uh is that answer to your question there yeah i think it's okay for the time maybe a quick class question no it's okay okay thank you very much
