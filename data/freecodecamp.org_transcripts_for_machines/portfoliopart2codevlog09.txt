this week i will be working on styling my portfolio page this code week starts on thursday i just came back from short break from coding holidays are great and relaxing is awesome but it's so awesome to come back to daily code routine today i am going back to styling my portfolio in the evening i will go to yes we tag meetup i'm just going for yes we take meetup come with me so this is how the page looks right now it's a friday in the evening i styled it a bit i added variables so i used variables in sas and i also styled the buttons i also chose different colors um and action color i'm still wondering if i will use these plain colors there's one thing i don't like is this section i mean this section uh clicking applications website design and they will open um these uh portfolio items but the thing is that i don't like how it's styled right now and so i'll have to rethink it but it's going for the next week these will be internal pages and all of these buttons lead to external ones i differentiated the way they look so these are the buttons and here it's a bit different design and it looks more like the text um i'm not satisfied with this gray portfolio part but i will think it later i also added twitter today for this week that's it i will you know this is the basic styling i will have to rethink um i will have to rethink this portfolio section how to style it to be more visible more prominent more important and what to do with covers maybe i will add some arrows depending on the way i will react additional content with react breaks are always a bit the motivating when it comes to work but no that's life during this one and a half week of break i took part in coffee and code meeting coffee and commuting is a frequent camp meeting of local groups i love pair programming because you know you have more eyes that can look at the same code it's really useful especially if you have a problem that you couldn't solve for for a long time and all of a sudden this you know person uh can help you atmosphere coffee and friends who are also learning to code and struggling with the same problems this is really helpful so if you have a chance to go to local meetups of people who are learning to code you should go to the meeting during the break accumulated new energy for coding and for new challenges and during the break i was sightseeing the museums so come on the caves and beautiful cities um so the biggest problem of this week was that one the week was a bit short because it started on thursday two it's a bit hard to come back after vacation to your normal daily code routine this week i was working on styling my portfolio page next week i'm going to look deeper into react and the basics of it because i want to use react in my portfolio page next week i'm also going to test that the site on various browsers and devices and fix the box wherever they appear and also polish a bit the styling and accessibility so right now after the break with full tank of energy let's keep on doing and let's see each other next week you
