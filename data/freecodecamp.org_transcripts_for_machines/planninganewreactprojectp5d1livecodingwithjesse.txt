hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse today i'm really excited because we're going to start what might end up being the biggest project that we've worked on so far since um since i started streaming i don't know in may i think i started streaming in may um so today's stream is going to be dedicated to making some decisions before we actually get started so may not actually be doing some coding but this is an important step that we haven't really gone over before we've made some decisions in the midst of coding but uh the things we talk about today and end up deciding on will really steer the direction that this project goes so i just want to start out by letting you all know what the end goal is for the project and what are some of the requirements that we're going to need and then we can check out our options uh i'll switch it up to the uh the normal view with the really small uh you know camera of me in the corner and then i have a trello board set up which i'll eventually convert over to some issues in github all right so oh one more thing uh by announcement there will be two streams today this first stream is going to be at this this project it'll be on the free code camp channel i'm going to stream again around 6 pm eastern time i'm going to give a uh a guest lecture i'll be a guest lecturer in a computer science course here at the university that i teach at so i will be talking about the work that i do here that you all participate in in the stream and also i'm going to give some advice to how to search for jobs and coding how to improve your skills and i'm going to talk about some of the latest technologies that seem to be trending now and then i'm going to take questions from the students and from all of you so if you're interested and you have an opportunity i know you know those of you in in india it'll be the middle of the night or early early morning so it might be hard for you to make it but if you can make that stream i think that'll end up being on my personal channel so check the link in the description for that channel i didn't know i was going to be guest lecturing until this morning i didn't really have time to check with quincy to see if he wanted something like that on the free code camp channel so i will probably be streaming it from my phone um in the classroom and i'm really excited about this i think this will be cool um all right so let's get to this project let me tell you uh first of all we did talk a little bit about this project a few weeks ago so for some of you this you may remember a bit of this but i now have a date when this project has to be completed by which we didn't have before and it's going to be somewhat of a tight deadline not for us i i know we can get this done but in terms of all the other decisions that have to be made by people at the university higher up content decisions and things like that it's going to be tough so this site needs to launch before march 6 2018 alright so i'm thinking let's try to get this site completed in about three months and then do some testing and get this we're redoing completely from the ground up i'm talking hosting servers all the back end code new content management system new databases certainly new front end everything's going to change for this website and this is a site that currently has over three thousand pages of content on it it gets millions of views a year so by far it's going to be our biggest project yet uh been turned both in terms of size of the website and the number of view users that we need to be able to support okay now having said that the site itself is not that complicated at least for now there are no forms we don't have to handle any form data there's not going to be any user login so that takes out a lot of complexity we're going to have data coming in from multiple sources so we're going to have to handle that it's not just going to be one content management system it's more likely that we may pull in data from different sources but we should be able to handle that the site has to be seo friendly so we're gonna need serverside rendering uh we're gonna be making api calls for all our content search engines will not wait around to display what comes in through the api calls so uh we definitely want whatever we end up going with we're gonna use react so that's already decided we're definitely gonna use react we have i i certainly have the most experience with using react and uh so i'm going with that but pretty much everything else is up for debate all right so here's what i'm thinking right now so we have content management system will be wordpress unless we can find a content management system that's suitable that's based on node i would love to have javascript all the way front end backend in the cms everything that's going to make it so much easier to maintain and to find people to hire to work on this when we just need somebody who knows javascript as opposed to trying some find somebody that knows php and javascript wordpress is php based okay so probably wordpress but i am open i just currently don't know of an open source free node cms that is at that level um nothing's going to be at the level of wordpress in terms of the community that it has um but in terms of user friendliness for the people entering data it has to at least come close to wordpress to consider switching so that that's going to take some serious thought but we don't have to worry about that right now we can certainly begin developing this site before we decide on the cms so that's something that can can hold off we could test some things out um let me see let me switch over now to my my list here in trello so sorry you won't be able to see my face full screen anymore i know you might be disappointed by that but that's definitely a joke by the way i'm not i don't really think that um okay oh we got a lot of viewers right now i just looked over at the analytics so there may be some new people watching if so welcome this is a little bit different than what we normally do normally we do a lot more coding today is more planning but um we'll get into some coding you know in in future videos uh probably the next one we do will actually start setting this project up um let me you know what i'm gonna have to remember to periodically look over at the live chat i haven't been doing a great job so let me give it a little look here but you while i'm looking at that if you can see the screen you can see some of let me go down to some of our questions here we go so let me read off a few of these questions we need to talk about i'll give you a minute to kind of think about it while i catch up on what you all are saying in the live chat so we need to decide on a ui framework so i'm i'm talking about are we going to use material ui are we going to use some other framework i already know what harshit's going to say he's going to say no way for material ui but i'm open to suggestions there only thing is it has to be material design friendly what are we going to use for testing i'd love to have this thing 100 fully covered with with testing so i'm going to need help with that one because if you all have watched before you know i'm not really great with with testing so i'll rely on on your advice for that and then whatever we choose i'll learn it and we'll do it uh should we use redux may not be able to make this decision right away because we'll have to see where the data is coming from how complex it is so we may hold off on that a little bit we can certainly develop a lot and then add in redux afterwards so in terms of the ui we can probably build that all out without having to worry about redux what cms should we use we've talked about that and where am i going to host this are we going to use digital ocean we're going to use aws what what are we going to do and here's the thing right now there's certainly a ton of urls that are being linked to from elsewhere do we want to keep the urls i'm thinking yes it would i would hate to have all those links break but then if we are going to keep them how what's the best way to do this how do we set up our routing structure to be able to best match up our site with the old urls i don't know that we'll be able to keep all of them things are going to change but if we can avoid breaking a lot of of inbound links from elsewhere uh then i'd love to do that okay i do have a phone call coming in i think i'm just gonna let it go to uh to voicemail and um because this isn't going to be a really long stream i do have a meeting to go to um in about an hour so all right so think about all those for a minute and i'm going to see what you all have already said about these uh in the live chat okay so harsh is recommending we should use gatsby uh so if you're not familiar with gatsby gatsy gatsby is um comparable to in in the same class as create react app next js it's like a way to scaffold your react app okay and they all come with with pros and cons so we'll have to consider gatsby i have not used gatsby personally i've used next i've used create react app haven't used gatsby yet so i'll consider it but i mean i'm tending to lean more towards things that i'm more familiar with but if there's something that's clearly better i'm open to learning it um but given our time frame too we have to be reasonable about that let's see hey everybody a lot of people are saying hi hey welcome um let's see okay harsh is recommending use draw.io for planning actually it's not a bad idea i think i'll uh i may do that i'm probably not gonna do it right now but i'll check that out after the stream um yeah and there's definitely harshest says yay more pr opportunities there's gonna be so many opportunities for you all to contribute both in the planning stages and in actual pull requests so um i i don't expect anyone to contribute i'm not asking for contributions i realize your time is very valuable uh but i definitely welcome contributions and i appreciate them very much so if any of you uh would like to build up your uh your github profile a bit and would like to contribute to this project uh i really really appreciate that and there's gonna be plenty of work to do okay okay we got a recommendation to use react materialize for the ui all right i'll check it out i've checked it out a while ago and it wasn't really up to what i needed at the time but i'm welcome to check it out again um semantic we have bootstrap semantic ui okay we can check those out we just need to find some way to easily use material design styles with those so i'm open to going with something that's not material design related by default if there's some easy way to kind of add that on okay harshit says if we use gatsby we don't need to use redux okay um let's see we have uh bulma uh which is another ui framework um let's see okay so we have some suggestions for hosting uh so we have a suggestion of aws because of the traffic that we're getting this site that may be the best um let's see all right i got a lot of stuff coming in so how about let's let's do this let's start writing in uh some of these suggestions here so let me zoom out a bit on this this is trello by the way if you're not familiar with trello it's it's kind of nice um to be able in this case i'm using it like a kanban board but it's nice to help plan out the project so let's go with the the hosting so let's just throw in aws as an option there and ui framework we got a lot of options so i'll zoom in as well here so y'all can see let's make this a checklist how about that and then we can check things off once we rule them out uh that seems like it'll be the easiest alright so material ui we had a bootstrap and i'm going to shorten these like obviously i'm not going to use plain old bootstrap right i'm going to use the react version of bootstrap so somebody some repo that's taken bootstrap and turn it into react components right same way with like materialize right basic materialize is not for react but there is a version for react bulma um was the other one i kept seeing uh semantic semantic okay i think i got i think that's everything i saw um let's see actually you know what i want to do as well since we i didn't have this up here as something to check out but um let's see uh let me just call this should call framework for lack of a better term i'm going to call this framework for now just so that we can have a list to go by go through some pros and cons and let's go with create react app next js and gatsby is that eastfield gatsby i think so but it just looks weird to me for some reason um yeah that's how you spell gatsby okay um let me scroll through just a bit see if i missed anything okay here's another uh another good thing that we haven't talked about yet but we should think about uh database so it depends really on what cms we're using because if it's wordpress usually you typically use my sql with wordpress but if we end up going with some other content management system potentially we could we don't even have to use anything that's sql based we could use mongodb uh we could use whatever we wanted um you know we could go with couch we could anything really um so i'm not sure but that question is going to be tied into the cms so the answer is basically we're going to go with whatever database is best suited to the content management system that we choose uh so i think we can put that question off until we we decide for sure on a content management system um let's see okay so it looks like uh gatsby has this a very similar routing system to next js which is good because i'm familiar with that i definitely need to be able to use i think react router on top of it to do some custom stuff i can see that being somewhat necessary later on down the road which i think that shouldn't be a problem uh gatsby has graphql already built in which is wonderful because i do want to use graphql we're going to talk more about that in in a minute as well so um keep that if anybody's familiar with graphql please stick around because we we have somewhat of a dilemma with where our data is housed right now we've got to fix that before any of this can really happen um in terms of populating what we build with with content all right okay rob is asking what's the best place to go and find out about getting set up to do pull requests i've never used react um i guess uh let me know you can you can ask questions here in the live chat or you can send me a message on twitter or wherever um first i want to know what what is your experience with with github and pull requests in general have you done that before and just never done it with react or have you never done a pull request before um with github at all uh that'll once i know that i think i'll be able to help you out more i just kind of want to know where we're with our where we're starting at but i definitely welcome pull requests from from anyone even if you're not familiar at all with it i'll try to help you out if it needs changes i'll try to suggest changes to you and really help you to be able to make a good pull request all right so definitely welcome i very rarely turn down a pull request always try to grab you know get something useful out of each pull request and merge it in so if you're looking to get your first pull request merged this is a great place to do it not only in this project but any of the other projects that we've done in live coding with jesse so keep that in mind if if you're new and want to get something on your github profile all right michael lee says jesse you are the best we love you i love you all too thanks for saying that i really do i look forward to this stream uh every day i i i really love it um let's see kind of that excited okay so uh amman is saying will be good honestly i really i i would like to work with i've never worked with before i think it would be cool it just kind of depends on what ends up being the best to use with our cms oh okay uh also another plus for gatsby it has plugins for wordpress so we can grab the data and pull it in to that that graphql that's built in which means we don't have to use wp graphql the plugin which we're using on another project that we're working on so i actually have had no problems with the wp graphql program plugin i really like it we had the the um creator of that plugin in on the on the live streams before so i'm not saying there's anything wrong with it but if we have something built in that's also cool uh lenica as can you explain this project um i can i don't know if you joined late so i did explain it earlier so i'm just going to give very very brief overview for all of you that are joining because i can see there's a lot of viewers that have just joined recently let me give a one minute explanation just to catch everybody up if you want to know more after this streams over go back and watch the first like 10 minutes so basically we're going to build a react site it's going to grab data from different data sources content management systems and things it's going to pull it in and it's going to display it on a page it needs to be serverside rendered for search engine optimization purposes but really it's it's simple it just needs to be able to handle a lot of traffic and needs to be able to display data in a very userfriendly way um obviously we're going to go with you know progressive web app style right i think if you're building anything new why not make it a progressive web app but other than that it's not going to be that much different than your typical blog like a react blog it's just going to be huge there's going to be a lot more uh just in terms of different types of pages and different types of content that are going to need to be displayed so but the basic principles of pulling in data and just displaying it are the same no login we don't have to handle user data we don't have to handle form data as far as i know now of course project requirements change i'm sure you all have had projects before the requirements have changed at some point that certainly can happen but as of right now this is what the project needs all right cool uh postgres all right i've never used that before as well but i'm certainly open to you if for those who don't know that's another type of database let's see thank you okay so if you remember rob asked a little while ago about pull requests uh rob says i've done pull requests several times i would say a little above beginner okay great so you're already familiar with the pull request it's going to be the same process and to be honest with you even if you don't know anything about react there's going to be other things that need done and i'm not just talking about the typical like fixed typos in the readme file they're going to be css things that need done so if you know something about css but not particularly about react hey you could take a shot at that um there's going to be i think what else we'll need um we're going to have some node going on right so we're going to write some things uh so if you understand node even if you don't understand react you'll still be able to contribute uh in that way so there's gonna be opportunities uh sometime within the next week i'm gonna build create a repo for this and i'm gonna put a ton of issues in there and then you all be able to see broken down into small chunks what needs done and if you feel like it's something you'd really like to do then take a shot at it and i'm i'm happy to help if if you do need any help okay all right i'm almost nearly through a lot of the discussion now so let me get through this last little bit and then we'll see where we're at in terms of our questions make sure we haven't missed anything and start getting to some of the other uh some of the other things we have to decide on oh okay um dylan asks about a cms it's a content management system so if you're familiar with let's say wordpress drupal joomla those are really popular php based ones it's just a user interface where someone is not really familiar with coding at all can input data and then that data can be not just data but usually like media like images and things like that they can input that and then that can be used in a website all right uh jesse mcintyre says yeah this stream is incredible so helpful to see how a real pro purchase the project uh yeah um i mentioned this before but i am a professional web frontend developer in terms of the if you take the word professional to me and i get paid to do this if the word pro means i'm like really really good at my job i don't claim that all right i'm i'm just trying to do the best work that i can and learn more every day so if if i can help somebody out and learn from that wonderful but more often than not i learn from you all so um i guess just keep that in mind i will make mistakes it will definitely happen uh but hopefully we can all learn uh something from those mistakes and then end up building something awesome let's see world's asked are we gonna use react native not right away i'd really love to do some react native projects that'll take some of the things that we're working on now and just regular react and then convert them to react native if you're not familiar with react native it's really awesome i did a video about it maybe a few weeks ago so i think if you search react native within the free code cam uh set of videos you'll you'll find it i believe it's the only react native video we have right now but anyway react native is a way for you to use react write javascript and then have that be converted into native code that runs on an android device or an ios device so it's really awesome so it's if you were familiar with ionic um or phonegap a little bit older technology it was a way to use javascript and make apps but it didn't it it's not exactly the same this goes a step further and what actually gets on the device is the actual so i believe in in android it's uh java although i don't know uh people are using kotlin now so i'm not sure exactly what it gets converted to and then ios is swift i believe so the device doesn't read the job it's not doing javascript but you get to use javascript which is wonderful um built my first react native app about a month ago really cool process so i'd love to be able to do that on a stream but so maybe after this project we'll get into that michael says i don't understand half of what's going on and i'm still excited awesome i'm really excited as well uh so i think this would be a really cool project uh let's see okay cool so it looks like uh harshit in the live chat is super excited to use gatsby so i'm definitely gonna have to do my research on gatsby uh after the stream today and and tomorrow morning and and check that out uh so if anybody else has used gatsby before please let me know what you think about it in the live chat or you can send me a message on twitter anywhere you can find me on the internet any social media platform feel free to uh message me on there whatever you like the best you can email me if you can find my phone number you can call me um it's out there let's see if the client side of suicide okay good there's a good question so what is the difference between client side react and server side i've never done the server side this is a great question so server side react i'll just take you i think the best way to explain it would be an example so with the server side react your client so that the browser users browser gets basically an html page already completely compiled right so the server on the server all api calls will be made all the content will be there it'll all get rendered html and then sent at least on the first load after that potentially you can switch over to some clientside routing just for speed purposes do prefetching which will probably do but the cool thing about that is that search engines can see that now let's flip it around and only use clientside if we only use clientside routing what the browser gets is not the full html it's just the skeleton that needs to be filled with the data but instead what happens is the client's browser gets all the code then the javascript fires makes your calls to your api pulls in the data and then renders for a typical user that'll happen so fast it's not really that much of a difference but for a web crawler right like google's crawler or bing or whatever they don't stick around long enough for that api data to come back so all they're going to see on the page is just potentially nothing or just the bare minimum that you already had kind of hard coded in there so it's gonna see it's never gonna see the data that you wanted to see for search engine optimization so um yeah and i just see harsh it says google now renders uh javascript yeah it renders javascript that's true but it doesn't stick around on the page long enough to render api calls so if all our data is coming from elsewhere through apis it will not render this so i did a lot of testing with this on some some sites that i built a few months ago and it is true you can get it to render javascript but not uh api data so i'll keep that in mind if you're using react or any type of single page application if you're if the project needs search engine optimization you gotta compensate for that uh and serverside routing is typically the way that uh that that is done or i'm sorry serverside rendering uh sorry i misspoke okay let's see okay so ali says sounds like a longterm project how about using react reason would be a great learning experience um i've i've seen a lot of people on twitter talk about react reason i'm not very familiar with it at all so like i said i'm very open to new things as long as if i'm going to switch from something i know to something new it has to be clearly a better option because that's that's going to set us back because i'll have to learn it so given our time frame which i'm going to say we're only going to spend about three months what's beginning in november december january yeah i want this done by february and then i want to suspend a whole month testing so it's ready to go by the end of february and february is a short month so we get we gotta get it going so anyway so let's keep that in mind when we're choosing what to use is that we there's definitely going to be a tradeoff and in some cases if the difference between what we know already and the new thing that might be better if it's a small difference then we're going to stick with what we know just so that we can get things done faster okay um i think that's that's a reasonable uh that's kind of a reasonable plan right let me know if you disagree um but if we had lots more time then i would think differently about it but this is a shorter deadline than i expected to have just found out about this yesterday after no i just found out about that this morning actually so um yeah so about 9 30 am this i i got an email found out about this date so just to explain the reason for the date our contract i don't think i explained this but the contract for our current system is up on this march the 6th 2018. so we have to pay more money for next year's contract if we still have it but if we can get this done then we'll save a lot of money uh from the our contract because the current content management system is there's a yearly fee for it so there's definitely a decent a good financial incentive to get this done you know sooner okay um so we have a question what are the steps to contribute to this project you know what we're gonna have a a structured uh contribution uh file in the github repo so they'll be very clear steps with the tape or what to do when you wanna contribute so just hold on for that i'll have that ready whenever i make the repo but basically i'm gonna have a bunch of issues ready you can pick out the issue and try to solve it submit a pull request and potentially if everything's good then we'll merge it or if you come up with a feature or something that you think would be really cool and on your own initiative you want to contribute then i'm good with that potentially it might have less of a chance to get merged um depending on on whether or not i i think the feature is needed or not or we should use it so you may want to run it by me first but i'm open there's been a lot of times when somebody has submitted a pull request for a feature that i never even thought of and it's awesome and i'm more than happy to pull it into the project so i don't have a super complicated process for uh submitting pull requests so i like to keep it pretty basic so that those of you who are newer at the process have kind of a low barrier to entry and can get those pull requests in um but i'll have more details for you when we actually get the repo started which which should be maybe tomorrow okay okay here's another question um is it better to use redux with react for large scalable projects and what is the best folder structure architecture um i rec in general i recommend using redux for larger projects it really helps keep your your data flow uh reasonable right it's very easy to deal with data on a small project you can just use state um it's you know component state it's fine once it starts to get bigger it's really hard to pass state and props down through lots of components and it can be a mess redux helps you simplify all that so i would say in general yes the larger more complex projects will benefit from redux but it does depend on your your projects so just because you have a big project doesn't necessarily mean you have to use redux but i found redux to be very helpful see okay uh vishal asks what's the best way to make api calls besides fetch um i i don't know if there's a better way than fetch right now okay i like to use fetch now i know people like to use what is it uh axios i haven't used axios but i maybe it's better here's my thought on it if fetch is already usable um and at least depending on like client side depending on the browser it's already there right um why add in something else if it doesn't add in more functionality than fetch does like keep things light right maybe axios does something that fetch can't do but i'm unaware of that so um i don't really think i could give you a great answer for that because i pretty much stick with fetch um i mean you know before fetch of course you know we use ajax right but um yeah i've uh i'm pretty happy with fetch okay so hacker uc says what about using react static instead of gatsby okay i am not familiar with react static but i'll add it to our list and i'll have to look that up let's see pedro says elm i'm not familiar with elm if there's if there's good reasons we should use that let me know um sorry i'm i'm messing up on the name here um but anyway it says how will you be notified will it be through here or a sign up sheet um i think the best way to notify is if you want to get notified whenever i'm going to go live with videos then subscribe to free code cams channel and make sure you have notifications on for that channel on youtube i also tweet about what i'm doing and when i'm gonna post or do a new live stream so if you'd like to you can follow me on twitter and then you know you you'll be able to see my tweets about when i'm gonna do things and then finally whenever i get the github repo up and running which will likely be tomorrow or the next day you can start that repository uh and then you'll know where to go uh you can get um i guess there's other ways you could do it potentially you could follow me on github i guess and then my activity will show up so there's several different ways you can keep track of the project so those those three ways are probably the most reliable ways to stay up to date on what's going on and of course says what about sagas yeah so i'm not redux sagas is another way to handle um you handle data flow um handle state and react i have not used sagas so far i've i've basically used um thunks to redux thunk so i'm open to using sagas if we find that that's that would be better um but once again that'll be something i'll have to learn so if you all think that would be a better thing to do just you know let me know okay harshit says axios has better api than fetch okay axios then may be easier to use so like i said i've never really had a problem with the fetch api it seems pretty straightforward to me but i haven't actually used axio so i i can't give a good you know opinion on one versus the other uh okay okay world s on the previous projects one through four which do you recommend to get up to speed so if you haven't watched the stream before this is the fifth project that we're working on now we've done four projects before this and um i believe they were all react projects right does it all react maybe we might have done one that wasn't react but anyway we've done at least three react projects before this so if you want to get up to speed uh i would say project three will have kind of the latest stuff with project three we're using react 16 we're using the latest version of material ui so that would be helpful but if you want to learn more about server side rendering then check out project one we use next js for serverside rendering just a disclaimer we did those projects earlier you know months ago so a lot of the things we used have newer versions now so it may not match up exactly with the latest versions so i mean but obviously we can't do anything about that right we we use the latest versions that were available at the time so i just want to warn you all so um you just realize that you may want to check up on the latest docs and see if anything has changed but you know it's only been a few months so it shouldn't be too drastic things should all you know still work but that would be my recommendation one or three for the projects if you have time you know check out um i'm sorry i'm sorry four is where we use react 16 project 4 we use your x16 so my mistake so check out project 1 if you want to look at some how we did serverside rendering check out project 4 if you want to see the latest version of react and the latest version of material ui okay okay another question is it fine to create subfolders for different modules and actions reducers containers components um yeah it's certainly fine uh structure folder structure is there are recommended ways to do it but there's certainly room for adjustment based on your particular situation and what works best for you for your team so i think it's okay it's good to use somewhat of a standard structure especially if it's going to be on github and open source you want people to be able to understand what's going on okay but within somewhat of a standard structure if you need to make you know some adjustments depending on what works best for you then um as long as it's not too drastic i don't see a problem with that at all okay can you post your github for smoothies okay the github i believe i have a link to my github profile in the description but if i don't i'll post it so i don't have this particular repository up yet but i will have it up soon and i'll have the link for you ready in the next live stream which should be tomorrow uh so i'll so i'll get it to you um let's see i always supposed to be bad late to the party as always all right so we have a few people joining in a little bit later uh so inn is here hey anna how's it going thanks for joining us uh albert's uh is asking for update about the project um just real basic it's gonna be react and we're gonna grab data from a content management system and pull it in with graphql uh we're gonna pull that data in we're gonna render it on the server side and uh we're gonna create a react app a progressive web app that is gonna basically just display data um not gonna be a ton of interactivity going on but we needed to be able to handle a pretty significant load um so that's the project now if you want more details go back after the stream and watch the first 10 minutes of it and i go into in more details about it um sweetie projects uh okay another question what is better way to write reducers switch in cases or something like actually when i write reducers i usually use a switch statement there may be a better way but i found switch statements to be really straightforward easy to read easy to write so uh i would stick with that okay we got a question about the start date for this project i'm saying today is the start date right this is the day we start the planning um the actual coding might start tomorrow if we can if i can get some enough information to make a good decision about some things then we might start coding tomorrow uh in terms of design we already actually have quite a bit of the design uh finish from previous projects previous work we've done so that's not going to be too much of an issue okay mean no coupon but you're free coffee and doughnuts while watching john hanson says are you gonna be handing out coupon codes for free coffee and donuts while watching this new project i do not have any coupon codes for free coffee and donuts so sorry about that i can put little coffee emojis in the live chat every once in a while if you want that's that's probably as good as it can as it can get so i apologize if i could i'd send you all free coffee and donuts but not possible right now okay so uh we have a question about links to previous project repos okay so here's the best thing to catch up on new projects uh within freecodecam youtube channel which is what we're on right now just check out the live coding with jesse playlist and um you can see the different projects i usually have in parentheses at the end of the title it will say like p1 um d2 should be project one day two so if you click into any of those videos in the description it will have all the links you need to catch up on the project so the github repo will be there for sure and then potentially a link to a trello board or other things that we're using for that particular project i'm in the process of creating separate playlists for each project project 4 now has its own separate playlist and i'm going to get the other projects into their own playlist soon so it'll be a little bit easier the live coding with jesse playlist what has everything all in one playlist so if you want to see everything that's the one but it's it's a lot there's over 100 videos in there now so we're separating them out into separate playlists make it easier for you uh okay let's see all right so let me i'm gonna stop with the live chat just for a minute to make sure that we've gone over these questions and then we'll wrap this up for a little while and i'll do a little bit of research and if you all uh want to keep giving me suggestions that's fine we do have a getter channel the links in the description if you want to join in on there and talk about it in the getter channel we have a slack channel if you want to send me your email address i can invite you to that channel and then of course i'm available on all the social media things all right so host let's transfer to your database okay here is a very important thing that we need to get up and running and i need your advice for this won't this may not be something that we can have on github although potentially we could but right now we have all the data for the current website in a sql database what we're gonna do is copy that database and then try to build an api so that we can easily pull that data out put it into another database in the format necessary for whatever content management system that we have so what i need then is your opinion on what's the best way to go about doing something like that in terms of creating the api has anyone had experience with things like that before is the idea just silly am i is this just wishful thinking that we can do this so let me know and then potentially if anybody is really experienced at building apis like that pulling data let me know and maybe we could talk more about it so i don't currently have access to the database i'm working with another department here at the university i work for because they have access to that database so i'm gonna get the access soon hopefully and and then we can start working on that but otherwise this is going to be really hard to get the data in because it would then require manually copying and pasting things i don't want to do that i do not want to do that at all it wouldn't be me we'd probably hire student workers to do it but that's in my opinion that's not really an option there's got to be a better way to do it so that's the way i'm thinking right now but i'm definitely open to suggestions all right um that was i think the last major thing that we needed to think of uh so we've gone over all the questions haven't necessarily gone through all the potential answers to them but i just wanted you all to be able to know what's going on with the project right off the bat and just kind of get everybody thinking so let me go back to the live chat probably just a few more minutes for this stream and then i'm gonna have to get ready for my next uh for my next meeting and um and then like i said there'll be another live stream later on today i'm going to be a guest lecturer in a computer science course and i'm going to talk about some advice for new coders and some of the latest trends in frontend development that'll be at six pm eastern time and it'll be on my youtube channel links in the description okay got a couple more questions um okay so austin wants to make an api call every 30 minutes do you have a good way of implementing that i don't know off the top of my head i don't know how i'd implement that for sure if you have a github repo where you're trying to have this code please share the link with me um you don't have to share it in the live chat you can send me a direct message on twitter or something like that i'll be happy to check it out for you and give you some advice but i i would kind of want to see what you're working with right now uh before i could give you a good answer on that let's see can you let's see okay another question i'm thinking of going to hackathon this weekend what can a beginner slash intermediate front end dev do in a hackathon actually i'm i'm going to make a confession right now i've never been to a hackathon so um i'm not entirely sure but i would imagine that you need a frontend dev right if there's gonna be any type of ui for whatever you're creating at a hackathon you need it you need somebody to make it right um so certainly you could you could do that and i mean i'm sure there's going to be other things as well i mean i'm i'm front end dev but i do some back end stuff when necessary i do some devops stuff when i need to i set up servers like so you know potentially you've probably done some of that too when you have to on projects so um and you bring another perspective so at the very least your opinion will probably be valuable now like i said i've not been to a hackathon if somebody else has more experience with hackathons then maybe you could offer some good advice but i'd say i i definitely think you'd have something to contribute how would you know project okay vishal says how would you normally architect your project or plan before actually starting so that you don't hit a dead end later okay um normally a lot of my planning is is somewhat like like this it's just it starts out with really broad categories and then eventually this list will change and it'll start to get really small tiny tasks okay and i estimate how long each task will take and then i have a decent estimate and i can then allocate a certain number of hours per week and figure out what is actually reasonable in the deadline and what features have to be pushed and be added in later um so that's roughly how i do that i'm usually very good about meeting deadlines uh there are some factors you just can't you you just can't um know beforehand so scope creep like project requirements all of a sudden changing and it's it's more difficult or um you know things just going wrong right you have illness um people who you need to get stuff from to continue the project aren't getting it to you on time so i usually build in some padding some time there beyond what i think it will take just to account for those those unknown things but that's how i generally do projects uh especially if it's just kind of me that's the one doing most of the development if i had more of a team that worked right here with me i would probably have a different process there would be um a lot more of scheduling around other people and what they're doing too so it'd be a little bit more complex but anyway this is how i do it i'm sure there's probably better ways to do it and i'd love to learn about them if you all have some advice on that uh but but this is kind of my my workflow as it is right now okay harsh it says which content management system and database is the site using now great question the content management the site's using now is fran it's uh extron so the website is franciscan.edu this content management system is called ektron uh runs off of like dotnet framework it's on a windows server the database i believe some some type of sql database to tell you the truth i don't know i don't even know for sure um what kind of database it is but uh that's it it's it's in bad shape the um the content management system is lacking some features that people have come to expect from content management systems and it's it's very tedious to update even simple things so um we've been wanting to get get move it to something a little bit nicer uh for a while now let's see okay so why not it says why not use firebase uh firestore for a database hey um in terms of of our plan for storing data and databases stuff i'm open to things as long as it fits all the requirements then i'm fine with checking out different things whatever is the best that we can use that we can reasonably use for the project i'm fine with that uh to be honest i have not worked directly with firebase so uh i'm not really in a position to make a decision on that right now i'd have to do some more research okay michael asks if i can link to this this board this trello board yes i can i'll try to make this board public and include a link in the video description uh i'll try to have that ready for for tomorrow and then probably the way i'll do it is i'll just make it viewable from the public otherwise it'll be crazy if everybody can edit this but i'll i'll certainly make this viewable and what i'm gonna do all as well is um once we get some really concrete to do's i'm gonna convert those to issues in the github repo so then we can have discussion within that issue as well okay um all right here's another idea for the database uh we should take uh sql dom import it to our new database make tables according to wordpress uh move the data in them okay um yeah i'm like i said i'm open i'm not familiar enough with databases my my experience with databases is um i've done some copying and transferring of databases in the constant context of moving wordpress sites to different servers so that i'm very limited in that so i'm i'm open and i'm welcoming advice from those who have more experience with databases so um and that's something that i'd definitely like to get done sooner rather than later because it's an important piece to this so um yeah so just let me know what your ideas are i have some people here on campus that are database administrators that i can talk to as well so i'm going to get their input on that and see if maybe they have a better idea as well i haven't had a chance to talk to anybody about that yet um this is all pretty i knew this was coming for a while but i just didn't know for sure when the project was going to start and when the due date was so this this all happened suddenly uh let's see can we join this okay can we join this board yeah definitely i'm gonna make the board public soon and then i'll i'll have the link in the description the video descriptions for these live chats and then you'll be able to check it out whenever you want uh this show says i'm moving from angular to react on a new project i found angular more easy to get on or maybe it's too early to judge but i'm liking react to i am liking react too many stuffs to to learn yeah it's definitely a switch but if you um if you were able to work with angular and learn angular i'd certainly think that that you have the the ability to learn react as well it's just a little bit different way of thinking about things so i think it will be a little bit harder at first but if you like it and you're committed to learning it then no doubt no doubt you can you can learn it okay uh michael says thanks i'm just starting and i really don't know what steps to take for example set up dev environment oh yeah um for this one where i say set up dev environment if you're not familiar with that uh the development environment in terms of um basically all the things that i have running on my local machine when i'm i'm going to do this so that to me at least this encompasses everything from my code editing code editor my linter transpilers um my webpack build which may be taken care of depending on what we go with for our our framework right whether next or gatsby or create react app um so kind of all that is like my development environment okay so a lot of that is already kind of build up and it stays the same for each project but i do like to update in between projects to use better tools or new tools so that's what i mean by dev environment and we'll basically i mean most of the stuff on the list will work through together we'll all be streamed it'll all be live stream we'll work through it together so if you'd like to learn more about any of these things just you know stick around and eventually we're going to get to all of it okay um okay so so harsh it's saying that uh he doesn't think that we'll need to build an api to get the data out he's thinking we should we could just dump the data um since we're making a clone of the original database there's no chance of us harming it all right i'll mention that when i when i talk to the database guys uh here soon i'll mention that as well as an option and i'll see what they think uh that might actually be they might be more comfortable with that to be honest with you let's see vishal says how does redux observable help in development um i have not had experience with using that so i can't i i have no uh advice to give you there no answer there let's see a question about the slack channel if you want to join the slack channel i need your email address and so don't don't put it in the live chat send it to me on twitter or something uh in a direct message and then i can have an invite sent to your email uh so you can't just go to a link and have it work there is a getter channel and you can use the link and it can work it is linkedin oh you know what i didn't put it in the description i forgot i meant to i'm going to put it here in the live chat so if anybody's interested in joining our getter channel click the link that i just put into the live chat and then you can join our gitter channel and i'll try to get that in the video description if i don't forget about it and so that way if if you can't get to live chat now or if you're watching this recording later on you'll still have access to that okay oh okay uh so we have an answer in terms of the redux observables uh so harsh it's saying observables are good for handling data streams and then we had a question about redux thunk thunker for async calls yeah so you use thunk when you're you need to make some async calls like api calls uh things like that so um i mean that's like just really basic what they do um but uh anyway thunks were really helpful for me and really simple to learn so uh if you need to make some calls async calls with redux i would check out funk first before moving on to something else like sagas it seems to me that thunk is like really basic and easy to figure out okay i've gone through everything in the live chat at this point if i missed your question or comment i apologize i tried to get to everything uh feel free to comment on this video if i missed it or ask me uh or comment on any other social media or just come back for another stream and and uh and ask me about it so i'm gonna end this stream in just a minute uh thank you so much everyone uh for joining us in the live stream we had quite a few um viewers in here so i that's awesome i really appreciate it a lot of activity in the live chat a lot of great suggestions so um it's just super helpful for me i thank you so much and you know please join us back for you know i i really want to collaborate and have this project be like our project and all of us contribute ideas and and code and everything and just work through this whole thing start to finish i think that would be really cool uh if you can watch later on don't forget i'm live streaming my guest lecture and computer science course you'll learn a little bit about front end development about some advice for new code coders trying to find jobs and things and get experience um it will be at 6 pm eastern time and that will be on my youtube channel so not the free code camp channel you can find the description to my channel uh in the or the link to my channel in the description for this video i'll probably put out a tweet um before i do that so that you all can link get a link directly to the video and um i've never done a live stream from my phone so i'm going to try that out later hopefully it goes well but the students are going to be able to ask me questions but you all will be able to ask me questions as well on the live chat uh so um you know if you have any questions feel free and uh i'd love to see you all there if you can if you're in a time zone where it'll be a weird time i totally understand so don't worry about it get some sleep uh okay let's see all right get through everything just double check it don't want to miss any anything all right so i'll be back a little later on today and then i'll be back again going continuing with this project tomorrow somewhere around 2pm eastern time i'll let you all know on twitter and there'll be a notification if you're subscribed to the free code cam channel until then have a wonderful day and uh and i'll see y'all tomorrow or later maybe
