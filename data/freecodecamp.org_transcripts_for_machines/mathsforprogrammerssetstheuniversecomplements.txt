in this video i'll be introducing the concept of the universal set and complements so i want to begin by talking about the universal set which is commonly referred to as the universe now the reason i use this fancy looking u here is that i was defining the universe which is to say the maximum boundaries of my set my biggest set everything outside of this blue circle here doesn't exist i mean it in terms of the sets nothing exists i don't even exist computer doesn't exist you don't exist but everything within it does so that's a very important key now if i don't define this if i don't define my universal set then we just assume it to be the real numbers so if i just erase this then um you know this will just be the real numbers which is we've talked about in previous videos so the other thing i want to talk about is complements so if i say if i'm looking for the complement of b and i'll i'll put a more formal definition of if i'm looking for the complement of b then it is everything that is not within b so all the elements not within b are going to be part of the con complement so in this case it would look like this if i just highlighted everything it would be everything within the universe still and then so that is the complement of b it's all the elements that are not in b so that's that's quite a bit of quite a bit i mean you've got one two three four five six seven so since this is the real numbers these little dots here would represent all the numbers all every single value rational irrational that are not within b so if this is one and two or better how about this this is the uh rational numbers and these are the integers so these would be everything outside of this would be the irrational numbers and the noninteger values
