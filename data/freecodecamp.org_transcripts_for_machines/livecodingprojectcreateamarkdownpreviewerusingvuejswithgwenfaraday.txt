hi everyone how are you if you don't know me my name is gwen and i run a youtube channel called faraday academy where i do mostly vue.js and python django content videos and live streams on there and free code camp is letting me stream from their channel again today now last week i built one of the projects the quote machine using basic html and view js and i received some um comments and issues and one pr from that so thank you for all your contributions so i've updated it over the last week and now this week i'm going to be working on the markdown previewer so here's the repo i'm just going to post it in the chat and you can take a look that has all the code from last week and also whatever code that i write from today so yeah if you don't know this is one of free code camp's projects there are front end projects that you usually build with react on their platform but you can really build it with any type of javascript framework so today i'm going to be using view and the view ui framework incline so it's similar to bootstrap it's really good for responsive design and it's also one of the simpler frameworks but still robust enough to have a grid system and a lot of the components that you would need so i'm going to be using this framework today and yeah let me go into the terminal so i have the main repo with all the different markdown preview quote machine and all the different folders in it so i'm going to go into the markdown previewer folder all right let's see by the way if you're here feel free to say hi make comments suggestions anything during the stream all right so now i have markdown previewer and let me see what's in here so right now it's just my readme and mockup so i'm going to create an app folder with my view app and today instead of html i'm going to be using the view cli to create this so if you go to the vue.js website you can just install vue with npm if you want to globally or use npx and then you have access to the vcli so i'm going to do view create a new app and what should i call this i'll call this markdown previewer invalid oh they can't it can't contain capital letters all right so let's see if that works all right cool and now it's taking me through asking me what options i want to install so i'm just going to do the default because i'm not going to need routing and state management and stuff all right so that's installing it'll take a minute and then i'll open this up in a code editor let me go ahead and pull up the ink line getting started so these are all the ways that i can install it the vcli that should be the easiest so i'm just going to add this as a plugin right after i finish installing all right i don't know if i'm seeing the chat have there been any chat messages let me see i guess not okay so i move the oh that's weird i didn't realize it would follow me around on different screens that's interesting all right installing packages oh and the markdown library i looked at a couple just to see which ones were updated the markdown library that i'm going to use is view markdown the last update was about a year and a half ago but it seems to still be working well and it has a live demo so this is the one i'm going to install and use all right cool so now i have the folder markdown previewer and i'll go in there okay now i'm in my folder and let me open my code editor okay so let's see okay so now i have a new vue.js application with the hello world let me run this first actually so let me do npm run serve and then i can open it up in the browser localhost 8080. okay cool so that's working now i'm going to have to stop the server because i want to add incline so i'm going to copy this and stop the server and view add incline there are uncommitted changes yes i still want to proceed because i haven't done anything to the repo yet okay so i'm installing incline and the next thing i want to install before i rerun the server is view markdown so i'm going to go ahead and get the install for this npm install view markdown all right oh i don't know why it's showing this other screen um i was trying to see if there was chat but that's okay um i'll just be talking to myself let's see markdown preview okay so that installed and now i'll do um let's see oh yeah let me run the server again and it's building it's building there you go there we go all right so now i'm going to start setting up the component so in my um if i go into a markdown previewer in that repo i have just a basic um yeah just a basic like side by side right mark down and see the preview on the other side and this is actually i looked back at my old free code camp projects from five years ago and this is the exact same thing that i built in react five years ago so i just borrowed the same design basically for this one so let me go to incline actually and i'm going to set up the grid system for the page so this is exactly um like bootstrap column wise so it has 12 columns and everything and let me just okay let me just take the grid all of the components for inkline are wrapped in i so it's just like most other view frameworks like beautify is v dash container element is e dash container and incline is i dash container all right so let me actually copy all of this the container row and column and i'll go to the app component now i'm going to delete everything that's in there and i'm also going to delete hello world delete the component and delete all of this styling that i'm not going to need all right so in here let me do oops do an eye container i row and let me close the container okay so now i have a row and in this row i want to have two columns because i want a column for this big text field where i input the markdown and the formatted text on the other side so let me go ahead and add that so um yeah a different column so i'll do actually i'll just copy that okay so now i have two columns and inside of the first column and actually i don't want these to be full width so this is taking up all 12 columns so i'm going to put from small screen size up let's see to take up six columns all right and then the same thing on this one so for small and then i'll take up six columns all right cool and now inside of the first one let me find a text area in incline so let me look for text area all right sure why it's not closing there we go so clearable text disabled i just want the basic text area let me grab this one and eventually i'll set a height on it um okay let me grab that and then basically just need to remodel it somewhere so let's see v model to value so i need to create a value so let me add a value variable in data too much okay so let me add data function and return the data variable which will be an empty string to start with and put that on separate lines make it a little bit nicer okay um let's see going to put enter mark down here and it models to the value which oh i accidentally put data there let me put let me actually put text there so now it's text and let me check see if that's working okay cool so i can enter something here and then in my view dev tools i should be able to see the text here a container i row i column i text okay so in the app component i can see the let me move my face i can see the data is equal to whatever i type in it's mapping okay so the twoway data binding is working and now i need to put some kind of a margin top to bring this down and also a vertical divider in between both columns um it's already giving me because i'm using the container element um it's already giving me a nice let's see container yeah it's giving me a really nice margin on the outside so i just need that same margin on the top really so let me add that on the container i'm going to add a class and let me just look in ink line what the spacing actually i'll search for it let me see if they have spacing oops spacing or margin okay so it has sas sas variables that i can use um sas variables for spacing okay now i wonder if i put sas and oh no i didn't actually install sas with this app that's fine i'll add my own spacing in that case because when i set up the vcli i just set up the default so there's just linting and stuff basically so let me do style and i'll give this a class of i guess i'll just call it container and i'm going to style that container so style the container as margin top of 40 pixels okay that adds some margin top and then i'm going to add a title here so i can't remember what i did on the mockups i think oh i just said markdown okay let me add that title then it'll be in the same column right above the text area so i'll do h1 mark down okay i think that looks pretty good and now i have this and now let me add the vertical line here so let's see if it has a vertical line vertical vertical grid flex okay well i guess not so that's fine um i guess i'll add that later let me then just copy this title and then i'll put formatted formatted text here okay so that's fine and then i'll add i guess a border to one of the one of the sides and hope that it's even let's see in the column so i should add it to the column i guess so if i add a border here let me just try it out in the browser so let me move one second let me wonder if i can oh there we go all right so let me add a border right of one pixel solid okay i think that looks pretty good because of the padding that the um that the columns are giving me so it's pushing it it's giving it the same amount of padding pretty much on either side i think so okay so now i have to add that here and so let me add for column here let me add a custom class i'll just call it column and then down here i'm going to add dot column and i'll say does it border right of one pixel solid oh yeah semicolon there okay and that should default to black oh no okay so i think um so this must have the same class of column because it's giving me two so i thought maybe incline would give it a class of i column or something but no it's just column uh which is fine so let me give it i'll just call it custom no no let me call it something what i'm actually doing with it let me call it border right and then i'll update this down here to border right all right okay cool so now it has the border let me set a height on this then on the input so let me go back to text text area and i'll search for height nope um so i might have to just set the height attribute sizes this is just setting the text sizes um yeah it doesn't seem like they have a prop they accept a prop for height so i guess that's just styling which makes sense so i text area um let me put a class here which will be text area um or i'll call it text area height all right so here i'll do a class text area height and then let me say height is i don't know 400 pixels let's see what that looks like oh wait that didn't save um oh wait i made a typo there okay so 400 pixels well that changed the vertical line but it didn't really change um this the text area so i wonder if i just pass in let me see let me edit the html here so if i just say height directly inside the element i think i can do 400 nope because it's draggable but i'd rather just have the height i might have to oh that's kind of cool you can just drag it doesn't expand past its container good so let me look up real quick text setting text area height should i size text area so it seems like you can just do width and height um yeah why can't i use width and height am i doing this wrong you have 400 pixels and let me just do a text area class because text area height as a class seems weird okay so i have i text area and now let me refresh okay well it's not changing the height um i can try one more thing otherwise i'll just move on um let me try setting height directly here because maybe it's just an undocumented api i don't know okay no that didn't work get rid of that all right so i'll just leave that alone for now then and figure out how to do that later anyway so i have the text from here and now i need to get the mark or turn it into formatted markdown on this side so let me um so i already installed the markdown library so actually i need to pull in the component so let me just look at the markdown library okay so i just import it import the component and then register it as a component so let me copy that um and then oops so in script i'll import markdown and then here i can register view markdown okay cool and then it's basically saying to pass in the markdown text into the component so into the default slot so i'll just copy this and put it right here okay first let me see if this displays on the page so let's see can't resolve uh bamboo one time that's interesting bevel doesn't seem to have anything to do with this markdown previewer let me see yeah it's just saying to install view markdown and nothing else okay let me look in the issues um what is it saying module not found error can't resolve babel runtime core get iterator okay so let me copy this real quick and here nope let me see um module not found let me see what it is in the terminal these dependencies were not found babble runtime all right let me try typing that in so these dependency or let me just type in babel babble run time cannot find module battle runtime all right this is electron but that's i mean that's the same error i'm getting delete node modules didn't seem to work for people um this is a popular answer npm install save deb let's see yeah i guess that makes sense install babel runtime and i wonder why they wouldn't list it as a dependency they had to install um let me let me install that i guess i'll install it as a regular dependency if this library is going to need it all the time so let me see if i install babel runtime all right installing all right now let me try running the dev server again um all right still okay let's see if that works okay sweet so this is good it's showing the markdown that i passed in here of course it's not real markdown let me write something in markdown and see let me just make this text bold so now the default should be bold and it's not bold okay it's bold now i had to refresh um all right cool so the markdown is working now i just have to get this text inside of this markdown field so let me just see if i can pass in the v model so my text variable and it doesn't seem to be updating so let me set a default text here and see if that works let me do hello there okay cool oh yeah oh yeah that's right i was like how did i tip it in there because it's v modeling to text okay so i think it just doesn't update as i'm typing it's not um the v model should be updating so let me look let me make sure that v model is updating my view dev tools in my app component yeah so the v model is updating my data my text variable is updating but it's not showing new output here so i wonder how i can get it to rerender where's my library let's see i'm guessing there's something here about rerendering the disk folder contains view okay um okay i think this is it watches which is an array html refresh automatically when the prop in this array changes okay i think this is what i want then let me just see source i wonder so i think instead of um using a default slot maybe i can pass in the string as source but in slots i could probably do things like emojis i'm not sure actually let me just see with watches let me pass an array to it so let me go let's see let me go to my mark down put this on two lines and watches equals oh one second um okay cool so that worked um i just wanted to fix the display but i think that zoomed in a little bit too okay so now let me come back to watches and um oh wait i need to pass an array here so this should be javascript oops and i think the syntax is all right so let's see if this works let me pass in text and let me refresh nope it doesn't work so the syntax must be let me just see so i'm passing in this prop watches to text so when the text variable changes the html should rerender but it's not so let's see what am i doing wrong enable html syntax okay so these are all defaulted to true anyway um dispatch when render finishes these are the events so i don't want to watch for the events um let me see well let me see if they have yeah they have an example folder so let me go into the example of index.html and okay yeah so instead of the slot they're passing in the string as source let me zoom in here the passing in the string is source um anchor oh here okay so they have like four different examples here oh they have a lot of different examples um okay let's see set interval mounted this dot source um but this i think oh so this set interval i think is telling it it's updating this dot source every time um so i wonder if i put it if i pass it in as source if it's going to watch for changes let me try that let me get rid of that and watches and then do source as text and then i'm gonna um find that if you find that okay so now let's see if that's watching for changes i don't know yeah sweet okay cool that was easy so now if i press enter enter and let me do header oh cool awesome that wasn't too bad header 2 and then i can do a checklist awesome it's completely functional um markdown sweet that wasn't too bad um let's see what could i change yeah in the mockups for some reason i thought maybe i'm gonna want to click format manually but actually i think this is good that it just automatically updates and previews that's much better than clicking a button okay cool so um let me just see if i can get this to set a height for some reason i'm not sure okay style height is changing as i drag it the style height so i wonder because when i search for height here on text area it just doesn't say anything about setting the height even in the examples oops did i do something okay my screen just went funny all right so even in the examples i don't know why i'm caught up on the height of it text field so i felt i feel like i should be able to just set it well here i mean it's setting it on style so i have a class of text area so um let's let me see if i can set height i have 400 pixels here um i wonder if that's being overwritten by um incline though by the incline framework this is so weird let me try putting a regular text area just outside of the container i'm going to say text text area and yeah just a plain text area oh let me give it a class let's say class of text area where is it yeah this one this regular plain text area i have is 400 pixels so it's something about um incline that's not accepting that class um let me try one more thing let me try to use a class that they're already oh i guess they aren't assigning a class to it oh because form input so there's a wrapper class around it they wrap it in form input group and then they wrap it in form input so let me try to change the height of one of the other ones oh let me try to change this one okay so if i change apparently so if i change form input the wrapper around text area that should be good so let me access or reference the form input class uh and i'll get rid of this extra class okay let me see if that works it still doesn't work form input so i think i need to um i'm going to try one more thing so is this set this as a module uh no i can't remember so there was something that you could do for dynamically updated classes actually i wonder if incline takes a set of classes that you can pass in let me search nope they don't have anything about classes here so i guess the only thing with incline is to um yeah basically update the sas variables which i don't have sas in my application although i did yeah when i i'm importing all of the sas variables here and registering the components and everything um okay so let me think i think there's so there's something in view for css and i think it's called module view css module in component uh it's been so long since i used this um maybe it wasn't called module let's see so i'm looking for the style tag yeah it is called module okay css modules then add the module attribute okay then it should be available on this let me zoom in it should be available now on the dollar sign style i wonder if that's going to change in v3 let me try that so this style tag is scoped so i'm going to add another style tag that i will put as a module oops so style um mod module and close it and now let me take this and here i'm going to put text area and height of 400 pixels okay let me just make sure they're defining it as a class yeah they are they're defining it as a class so let me um try that let me now go to text area and do class equals style dot text area and actually i'm thinking this might not work because i'm passing this into incline and i don't know which of the three dom elements it renders are going to get that class i have no idea all right so let me try yeah i think it's giving the class to a different element which is let's see app text area yeah it's giving the class to the parent element not to the child elements so this form input group is getting the class but i need it on form input um all right i guess the only other thing i can try is to see if someone else has had this issue on incline let's see text area height and nobody nobody nobody nobody's even said anything about text area all right so that's something that i will have to figure out after the stream or if someone has a recommendation then you can let me know about it oh well um yeah so i think this is pretty much it um if there are no comments in the chat then i think i'll just go ahead and push this code and yeah let me stop the view server let me do git status um markdown previewer oh right right so when i created a generated a view project in this directory um oh i thought it created a new git for me but i guess it didn't because the parent has a get directory as a git project already so let me go up and up to my free code camp projects and i'll do git status git add this new project that i have commit code from live stream on june 25th for markdown previewer okay that looks good now i'll push it okay and sweet so now i have the markdown previewer code from today all right so if there are no comments or chat messages it was a very quiet day next week i'll be building the drum machine at the same time if you want to tune in for that and yeah feel free to make a comment raise an issue on this repo and yeah give me feedback or whatever i'll be doing the view cli again for the drum machine next week and then for i guess the rest of the free code camp projects they get a little bit more complicated with each one so i'll start adding in other things like view router view x and maybe even by the end of this view three will will come out so then i can do something with v3 yeah so thanks for watching everyone if you were snooping and watching i can't see who's watching or anything but i hope you enjoyed this got something out of it uh don't forget to check out my channel faraday academy and have a great day everybody take care
