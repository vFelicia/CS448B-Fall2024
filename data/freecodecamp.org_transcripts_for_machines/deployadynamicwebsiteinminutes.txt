did you know it's possible to build a dynamic website in minutes without the use of heavyweight tools I'll show you how right now first let's grab a basic bootstrap template let's go to start bootstrap.css and unzip it now that I've unzipped it I can just drag the index to Chrome and this is what it looks like so it's got basic introduction it's got the portfolio Elements which I can click on to enlarge and it has an about section and it has a contact form unfortunately this contact form won't work because it's PHP and we don't want to have to mess with PHP we'd rather just have it work without PHP so there's a great tool for us to be able to use Dynamic forms on the web without any hassle at all it's called power. let's go to Power first we're going to create an account now we'll click sign up and we're going to choose from these different uh Dynamic elements we're going to choose contact form and we could use all these different Site Builders but we're just using ra HTML here so we can click VI tutorial all right and here is a quick tutorial so what we're going to do is we're going to add this script power. JS to our HTML at the bottom of the body so let's just open up index we're going to use a text editor I personally like adom which is a free text editor from GitHub and we'll scroll to the bottom of the body and we will just paste in power. JS next what we're going to to do is we're going to add an HTML element uh it's the Power contact form so let's go ahead and grab that and let's go ahead and put that in the contact form section so here's a contact Section what I'll do is I'll just delete everything out of this actually yeah I'll delete everything out of the contact Section except for the container I'll I'll keep the container and just paste it in here and save it and now let's see if we can add one more thing while we're here I really like to have a Twitter tool and there's a Twitter feed tool here too so basically we've already got pojs so all we need to do is add a Twitter feed div I'm not sure that this will look great right but basically I'm just going to put it right underneath the contact form for the purpose of demonstration so now we can save this and we can go to a tool called bit balloon bit balloon. comom makes for really easy deployment except you have to have the website maximized in order to be able to drag and drop it here so now I'm just going to take my entire folder this whole start bootstrap template freelancer thing and I'm going to drag it here it's going to give me a warning about us having Dynamic Pages um the PHP don't worry about that because remember we overwrote the PHP with the Power contact form and it's done so it'll give us a funny little name here and we can click on it and just open up the website and this is live on the internet we'll scroll down we'll see here our contact form that we can edit in line using power let's just change the uh let's change the background color just to show you how real time this is ugly purple all right and then we can just save it and close it and then here's the Twitter feed and right now it's power. but let's change it to me so we'll just do content and I'll just change this to oia or better yet let's do free code Camp save it you can see this is a live page on the internet with a working contact form I'll show you it works submit it and these are my Twitter this is my full Twitter feed which I can click on and it'll take me to actual tweets and I can retweet things from here if I were logged in um so now let's go to Power and let's check and see that the form came back the uh the email that I sent so my contact forms right here and I can mod here as well but what I really want to do is see my responses you can see that I've already received this response so again just to conclude you can create Dynamic websites in minutes using nothing more than HTML CSS and power. JS the power. tool and you can deploy it instantly with bit balloon to a real life place on the internet you can actually go to this URL if you want and check out this website it's live and it should remain live forever enjoy
