crazy that people even like know that the art is out there and everything so just to hear that is amazing honestly makes my day every like every time anyone says like they they like CSS art yeah yeah and uh so we're going to be checking out some of the art here on the video version for people who are listening to the audio version of this podcast no worries we're going to verbally describe everything and I've got a show note link it's CSS artist.com you can check out all of cass's work there so Cass why don't you share your screen and we can just dive in and check out some of your art and you can talk about how you made it yeah awesome let's do it okay all right and here we are on CSS artist.com and can yeah go ahead and talk talk us through what you're doing okay yeah so this is my portfolio website I wanted to make sure that it was a little bit weird a little bit um different uh so I have most of my CSS art on here but the one that I'm like most proud of I think is super cool is the um I made the scrolling animation for the uh photo realistic Polaroid drawing that I made using CSS and HTML so it's basically as you scroll you see how the um how the drawing is getting built so you see like the two boxes then you you know more like shading comes in you see Flash the um the lens so you kind of get to see the progression of it uh that's probably my favorite CSS art ever yeah and it's so cool if you scroll down just so we can see the finished product like the the actual like gloss to it the sheen I mean it looks so delicious for lack of a better word it looks like uh almost like a cake matte finish like that that shininess and then of course the iconic Polaroid slot where you pull your your photo out after you've taken the photo everything looks so photo realistic like the uh the glare on the lens for example the the the glass that covers like that aperture that takes the photo yeah yeah everything and the viewfinder I mean so photo realistic and so cool I love it thank you yeah yeah the um it's those little details that you have to spend so much time looking at and they seem so insignificant at first until you like take a step back and look at the whole thing you're like okay no that was definitely worth it to do yeah yeah let's take a look at some of your other work too so if you scroll down on her page you just get like this amazing grid of photorealistic CSS uh art like uh for example maybe we could click on uh that crayon box uh yeah this is one of the first ones that I did and I believe if I'm not mistaken it's a single div wow so the HTML is just div and everything inside is just backgrounds is it like absolutely positioned or like how how do you do that yeah this one's just absolutely positioned with a sing background and uh it's just Stacks linear gradients yeah and it looks like a photo realistic Crayola box without the Crayola logo it's got that those iconic kind of green and yellow box and like the shadow underneath it and like the the some of the colors have like this matte finish to them to them some are a little bit shiny so beautiful yeah thank you yeah this one was I think one of the first ones that I that I really did as soon as you learn how to stack the gradients with the single div like you're Off to the Races yeah let's take a look at that calculator okay yeah this one was probably the hardest one I've ever done easily probably yeah yeah yeah the buttons the buttons oh my gosh those took forever yeah they just have this concaveness like this concavity whatever the word is like you can almost feel like your fingertip kind of like resting on top of it and like the ergonomic of it and then just pressing it in and feeling that that tactile click uh you can imagine like you're just working really fast like kind of a tanky type thing so cool and it it's got kind of that iconic like orange and gray look uh orange and gray I don't know what it is about them like the NES zapper gun like has that like at least in the US it had that orange and gray look so cool looking yeah like nostalgic oh yeah that off white casing that they used to always put Electronics on in yeah yeah so cool and there's a ton of CSS here how many lines of CSS is this this one is oh it's still loading 1,143 lines yeah so it's a lot and it it was the buttons the buttons they look like you could just copy and paste them but they each need to have their own separate like kind of shading and gradience on it um otherwise it just it just didn't look it just didn't look right so yeah that's took forever and that's pretty much what all of the CSS is I mean like that attention to detail thinking like even though this button is only like you know 5 mm to the right of this one it's going to be hit by the Light slightly differently right like the Shadows look slight long yeah yeah yeah so if you look from the buttons like they're just slightly different not too different just slightly different amazing and that game boy let's check out that that that game game boy so nice this is like one of the second generation game boys I think cuz it's like a little bit less boxy yeah yeah yeah this one um oh my gosh I loved Game Boy I used to play like Pokemon all the time on especially like on trips and stuff so this one was super fun to do I loved doing the shading inside of the screen so it looks like it's kind of inset how the game boys actually look I don't know why I thought that was so cool looking and the shading on the on the arrows and the buttons love that too yeah it's super fun to do amazing again anybody listening to the audio version CSS artist.com you can check all these out um these are so cool all right well let's talk about the woman behind the art C Mareno like let's dive into how you got to this level with your CSS skills and uh maybe what I like to do is I like to start at the very beginning as far back as we can go maybe you could talk a little bit about your early days um and um I understand that you were born in Mexico and that you moved to the us when you were six yeah yeah well I was actually I'm I was born in the US uh but I lived in Mexico um until I was six and then I moved back to the US to San Antonio Texas because my parents started a business so um from there you know English became my main language and uh yeah so I ended up just growing up here uh went to high school I was not a great high school student um skipped a lot all of that good stuff all of the fun stuff but uh at the end I decided that I wanted to go to school for architecture yes so um yeah I did that for three whole years and it was so intense like I remember the first day in class like they sit you down in studio and you get there and you're like you know super excited to be here and the teacher like I hope you don't have a boyfriend and I hope you don't have another job because this is going to be your life from now on and I'm just like oh my gosh what did I do yeah yeah so I did that for three years until I was like the thought it it was fun it was uh it taught me a lot like um that's that school was a lot it was uh wow sorry it really pushed a lot of like HandsOn work instead of computer work for architecture so like at the beginning we did a lot of like art projects um learning like art Theory and all of that photorealistic drawings and stuff which I love but the thought of having to do that and like doing architecture for the rest of my life was uh it just it didn't sound like something I want to do so yeah it's a it's a difficult decision but year three almost done I decided that this was not for me like at all I couldn't wasn't like like can you remember what that that moment of you know Revelation maybe it wasn't maybe it was a gradual sinking feeling but like when you finally decided no I'm really not going to do this I'm not going to spend my life being an architect uh like what did you do at that point uh yeah it was it was gradual you like you start getting less excited to go to class you start getting less excited to learn like you don't really want to do the projects anymore and you know it's uh it finally just kind of clicks one day that like my grades were falling it was it was showing everywhere that I just didn't want to do that anymore so I finally was just like okay no like I need to Pivot it's probably not the best idea I may be making the wrong choice but I feel it like in my heart that like this isn't what I'm going to do forever is going to make me happy you make that decision what do you do call my mom all right call my mom and tell her uh and you know try to be real nice about it because she's paying for school and everything and um thankfully she's very kind and she said you know that's fine you have to do something though so like figure something out get a job at least like we'll go from there so yeah thankfully like my mom was super cool about it and she let me just like no harm no foul like it happens you know just be happy so I I did I ended up getting a job at Sprint I didn't know what I was going to do so I just started working which is where I also found out I really didn't want to be a salesperson yeah Sprint is for for anybody outside the US Sprint is a like cell phone carrier uh it's like one of the big they were did they they were they got bought by TMobile oh okay yeah so yeah you used to like was were there the ones with like so quiet like you can hear a pin drop was that their commercial uh no I think I'm not sure actually but there was like there were like some really interesting like 1980s 1990s nothing was more 80s than you know cell phone carrier commercial or 90s I guess because cell phones were pretty can you hear me in the 90s yeah exactly yeah they had like the big can you hear me now I'm walking around like the entire us to check the coverage yeah uh so so you were you decided you didn't want to do sales like but you spent like two years working in it yeah yeah um but it was I was not good at it I was probably the worst sales person I don't it's really hard for me to try to tell someone that they need this like $40 charger when you don't really need the $40 charger let's be real so no I'm not a sales person at all never put me in any sales position because I'm just going to agree with the customer on everything and be like n you don't really need it yeah wow you're you're too empathetic you're too nice to be a salesperson maybe yes that's that's that's my problem I'm too nice so you know we jump straight to college but I I do want to talk a little bit about uh your early days because you you said you were born in San Antonio uh I was born in Laredo Laredo okay that's here in Texas too sorry I'm like not a native yeah that's Texas so it was kind of funny because I was born in Laro but I lived in noo which is Mexico and um so I would actually I went to school in the US too though so I would like drive across the border every day for elementary for like Kinder in elementary school um so that was interesting uh but yeah I did that until I was six and then we moved to the US okay yeah so you already had some English skills and uh you you told me earlier before we started recording like your sister was really big on English and and she was an inspiration for you to really like bulk up on your English skills yeah yeah well because actually most of the people in my school just spoke Spanish even though it's in the US it was predominantly just Spanish and Mexican people so um we didn't really speak any English but my sister was learning it and I remember she was like kind of talking it with her friends and everything and I'm like you know I want to talk that like I want to speak English too like what and so that's what got me to learn just being like that annoying little sister of like I want to do what you're doing yeah so obviously that worked out really well for you because I mean you sound like a native speaker of of course starting early what about the rest of you uh like uh and so you have an older sister and you have a brother as well yeah yeah I have an older sister I have a younger brother so I'm the middle child and then I have two half sisters um they're both in college right now okay cool and what did your brother and sister like ultimately decide to do I'm just curious what we're talking about them like uh yeah are they they are they here in Texas still yeah yeah so my brother went to UT um then back home yeah University of Texas um he studied business there and so now he's working in my parents' business and so is my sister so it's like a whole family business and they're all working except for me okay cool and yeah so so I'm really excited to talk about your relationship with your mom I know that sounds weird to say but like she my understanding is she was absolutely vital to helping you like launch your uh career as a software developer yeah you could talk about like how that came about yeah so I mean one thing to know my mom is a saint okay like uh she let me kind of flail around and try to figure out what I want to do with my life which is not something that a lot of people get a chance to do like they don't you know she's she's very patient with me um but yeah it was towards the end of my my nonsuccessful tenure at Sprint that she was like hey I need a website for the business I need a new one because theirs was super old she's like you're not doing anything right so like why don't you try to figure this out and she was right I wasn't so I'm like okay yeah that actually sounds like something fun like something I could just dive into and um from there yeah I started reading about WordPress cuz that's what her site was on and then I started like okay so then I need theme okay what's the most popular theme cool so how do I change this header like and then it just snowballed into like oh okay so I should probably like look at this course and then like oh free code camp and then like oh you D me and it just never ended and yeah it was just quite the quite the beginning right it just snowballs once you start you just keep getting more curious about everything else yeah and maybe you can talk about like that process of building that project WordPress of course being this giant ecosystem of plugins and templates and things like that like how did you start out what was the what was the first uh because this is really cool it's like project oriented learning you already have a stakeholder right your mom and yeah of course nobody wants to disappoint their mom so you're probably working really hard to get this done well yeah yeah after dropping out of college and leaving Sprint I definitely needed this to be like a thing that she's like oh thank you like you know I wanted to help her at this point because she's helped me so much so yeah I spent a lot of time on this trying to make sure it's perfect like I found the you know the perfect theme and then I joined the theme groups but that wasn't enough because like what if I want to change something very specifically and like look at all of these other cool sites I want to do what they do like so um I started taking CSS courses and then I'm like oh but if I want to do this you need to learn JavaScript what's that oh my gosh that looks really difficult um and so yeah you just kind of start with that and so the process was just yeah iterations and iterations of just getting better and like I'd be I remember just being at home at night next to my well now husband and just being like look babe I I changed the header to this website like the color was black and now it's red like I was so excited and he was like there just like yeah that's so cool and so then I would show my mom like and so yeah it's we just kept iterating where I would like you know compare their websites see what they do like what is my mom trying to do like it just it was a lot of learning like like you said project oriented learning is incredible because you already you're not like lost you you have like a clear set of things that you need to get done and you just kind of you just jump right in yeah and so you eventually build this this website for your mom is is it still live today is it is it a WordPress no no yeah that was a while ago they already took that one down okay but I mean nothing lasts forever in on on the web as Mark Mark Zuckerberg says like you know when uh you know you can find like ancient ruins of like past civilizations but on the web nothing is left it's just like yeah it's as though nothing were even there sorry it's kind of like a menacing Mark Zuckerberg no no that's true though like even like trying to show clients past work is like uh I can't really show this to you because it's not live anymore but I promise it was cool yeah exactly uh maybe some maybe it's on the internet archive somewhere so um so you build this site and like what happens next like does that kind of like does that serve as a a win that like helps push you to continue learn the win that I needed the the win that I really really needed because I didn't know how bad it like I was I didn't realize how bad I was feeling about myself cuz I'm like no architecture no sales like what am I doing everyone around me was you know all my friends were doing really really great things and I'm just sitting here so that was my way yeah and you're like 28 years old at this point approximately right yeah yeah so so just to put that in perspective like you probably have lots of friends who went to architecture school who are now working at like big contractors or developers or something like right like so a lot of your peer group is like Way Beyond where you were at that time and I hope that doesn't sound insensitive for me to say that because I was not at all like to some extent learning the code at age 31 right so but here you are in a completely different field like getting things done and and this this has to be like a huge win in terms of like motivation and like selfperception like I can actually get things done right yeah yeah it was I remember the feeling it was one of the first times in a long time that I felt like I wanted to do something and I actually did it like and it was hard and I didn't know how to do it at first but I did it like it it really motivates you to be like anything that comes your way now like I could probably figure it out if I could figure that out from nothing yeah so what do you do next okay so next um she so that was like her actual like front end part of the website um she needed something that kept like inventory and stuff and like you had to it's been a while but you had to you know upload prices somewhere and then like view the prices so like basically just like a a rest op so I went and I started learning like full stack um that was interesting and fun it was It was kind of it was doing that by yourself and being like an introvert is really hard because I don't want like I didn't want to reach out to anyone I didn't want to ask anyone any questions like I don't know any web developers like what so I just I really for the longest time I just kind of kept to myself I remember one problem took me like a week to figure out cuz I refused to like ask anyone or like I think I asked something on stack Overflow once and I got downvoted immediately so like just crazy so I'm like okay I'm not doing that anymore so um yeah I I I created this this little app that it's it's super simple but it allows them to upload some pricing and then like view the pricing later and then add their products and whatnot so that is not up anymore either but it was a great learning experience and um my mom was actually proud of me yeah well even though your mom was pretty proud of you like I know I know you've had to uh endure a lot of financial hardship uh during this process cuz I mean you're like a university drop out uh you you left your job at Sprint and you know maybe your mom was compensating you in any way in some way but like what were you doing were you like living with your family at this point or how were you getting by um yeah so I was just living with my boyfriend and I was not really getting by too well cuz I didn't actually have a job I was just helping my mom with this but she wasn't really paying me too much she was just helping me here and there but it wasn't like an actual job that paid you a lot like I I think I was you know she'd give me like $300 a week or something which again added to my feeling of just like what am I doing here like what is going on um yeah I was so broke living with my boyfriend like he had a parttime job I just I felt almost lost but like really excited too just like maybe I could learn to do this maybe I can actually like become a developer but yeah it was it was very difficult for a while um I remember my car my car was so old at the time like and Rusty um I woke up one day I went outside to my car and I had a ticket because they said it was like no abandoned cars on the street and it wasn't abandoned it just looked old cuz I just didn't have any money to get another one but like oh my gosh like that was the moment where I was just like freaked out I was like I can't even pay a $40 ticket cuz my car looks old what am I doing so that was like I don't even want to say low point because it wasn't cuz I was also really excited about like web dead but I was pretty low like something needs to happen like right now I need to figure something out yeah this is not sustainable like and I need a new car cuz the AC in mine did not work and Texas is not forgiving when it comes to that summer yeah so um what did you do like like did did your financial hardship kind of like apply additional pressure did it help you kind of get over some of your introversion start asking people for help how did you meet other developers what did you do from there okay yeah so that definitely not even that helped me get over my intro version like I was still dead set on I am not contacting anyone which for anyone listening by the way just reach out like it's so much easier and I love it when people reach out and I love talking to people and I love having conversations with developers that have questions like I don't know why I didn't didn't do it just do it um but yeah that definitely was just like I needed to do something so I started applying like I thought maybe I'm ready like maybe I can apply and get like an actual coding job like a professional job um that was that was an experience your first trying to apply to your first professional job as a developer as a selftaught developer oh my gosh as an introverted selftaught developer who's also very desperate for something anything was crazy I um I went through like three or four interviews at different companies like didn't even pass the first screening um and I don't even know how this happened honestly like I one day late at night it was like 1200 at night I was like three glasses of wine in playing video games um and I looked at LinkedIn and there was this one post like for a job it wasn't even web developer it was web content administrator and I was like that sounds great like it has it's like kind of Webby you know and I know kind of Webby like so I applied and 10 minutes later the recruiter responded like oh this is great like let's talk tomorrow and that was like the first time that I was like I was I put my glass down I was like oh my gosh okay okay maybe maybe so then the next day I talked to the recruiter she was wonderful like so incredibly kind and just passed me on to the manager and somehow like she gave me this I remember the takehome was the PSD file and I had to code it and I was so scared of like asking questions or anything I remember like can I use a framework can I use bootstrap like I was just thinking all these things but I don't want to ask because I don't ask questions right yeah so um yeah I just coded it CSS whatever but I got it she called me and gave me the job and I I'm still friends with that manager to this day like you're going to have a a call next week I think um yeah but yeah they gave me a shot they took a chance on me and were like you don't have any experience really but like yeah it was I mean if you can do the work you can do the work right that was yeah that was the win that I needed like that that right there that job like it was everything right like they the pay was awful but this large mortgage company like allowed me to like go kind of nuts too right like uh they had like contest sites which were super fun like you know we want to do a cool like um Lottery and so I was like oh okay you want to do like a lottery I'm like okay well what if you get like realistic looking Lottery balls and then what if you have like a screen where they you know flip and then the lottery number comes out then what if you drop it down this like realistic looking little tube and then they like drop down and then confetti comes out and all this really cool stuff stuff and they were like yeah if you can do it just do it and I couldn't but I figured it out like it was all those like cool ideas that you just need someone to be like yeah go nuts when you get excited about something and then that's where you learn right like yeah well it's cool first of all that you're like basically making all this work for yourself a lot of people who are lazy might just be like oh sure good enough but you're like no it could do you see the potential for what this project could be and you're like let's let's go all the way with this project yeah yeah and it's like it's a forgettable project like it was just for that year but it was super fun to do um there was another one where they had like a Halloween contest and I thought what if we make this look old school and so I had like an old school looking TV that I put like a screen over so it looks like we're on the screen and then little I made little CSS Polaroids and like did a cute little I don't know it's so much fun to just do like weird cute little things that people are just like oh that's that's creative that's weird yeah yeah well so what is it like settling in cuz you I mean you mentioned you're like hardcore introvert like afraid to ask people questions willing to toil for an entire week on a problem rather than just asking for help like did you have to report to an office like like who were you working with um I was yeah so I actually worked at an office um and the manager above me she was who I reported directly to it's just me her and this one other girl that were the U developers not really Developers there was one other developer and he was really he was way better than both of us but um pretty much it was just me reporting to my manager and so she was she she's a developer she was selftaught as well um so yeah she she helps me out a lot she gave me a bunch of ideas on things to do and um you know I I remember like freaking out I would have like a bunch of question she like basically calmed me down and told me like you can ask questions like it's not you know or she would she was very patient with me at first because I freak out very easily as well since I don't want to ask questions like I don't know if I'm doing the right thing which I need to just ask if I'm doing the right this so like it's just it's a lot of patience when you're a manager with the first time like Stu like not student with the selftaught firsttime job she was very kind I got very lucky very lucky yeah and I'm thrilled that it worked out well and you and you kind of stayed uh in that uh mortgage space which let's talk about that for a second because I think a lot of people Envision oh I'm going to work at Google or I'm going to work at you know Microsoft or one of these big prominent tech companies that that's their eventual goal and what I always tell people is twothirds of all Developer jobs are outside of what we conventionally think of as Tech right they're they're working at like you know an automotive company or uh Hospital chain or any number of different types of uh Industries right everybody needs developers everybody's trying to push push things to the software developer or to the software layer everybody's trying to figure out uh ways that they can better reach customers through technology things like that right so right yeah maybe you could talk a little bit about that like because you uh up until relatively recently you were working in kind of like the the mortgage industry right yeah yeah and honestly like I for just starting out like I knew that I wasn't ever going to get into like Google or LinkedIn or and Netflix whatever so I you know go for the easier jobs and everything but even I don't know yeah like you said the most of the tech jobs are not in those companies they're and just like what sounds almost like boring companies but it's they're great jobs they're a lot of fun you get to do a lot of things like as long as you have a good manager and good working environment like you're Off to the Races it's great and it's a lot of fun yeah some of the the I mean just because it's like an industry that's like really old doesn't mean there's not really exciting work to be done in that field and a lot of those companies are you know the jobs are a lot more stable and um it can be a lot more like better work life balance and things like that then going to some crazy like Silicon Valley like Tech startup where they expect you to work like all day every day and like yeah exactly yeah like and you know someone at Google isn't going to let me go nuts on a landing page for a lottery like for fun you know but you can do that at companies that aren't only like tech tech yeah you know you can go and just do fun weird crazy things at different companies and it sounds like you were working on a pretty small team you you said there were just a couple other developers yeah uh and I always tell people like working on a small team gives you the ability to do a lot of everything would you agree with that sentiment yeah absolutely yeah you kind of have to wear a bunch of hats because it's the team is so small yeah um and you know you kind of grow and learn together which is a great part of being in a small team yeah so that first couple years of working in Tech like what what were some of and when I say working in Tech we just established it's a it's a mortgage company but working as a developer sometimes I use working in Tech and working as a developer synonymously um but uh what was that like like what were were there any like standout moments in your kind of progression as a developer where you felt like you just unlocked some entire new aspect of your brain that you didn't know existed yeah yeah like just any kind of like the creativity idea like the um creating the little realistic balls you're like oh my gosh okay so I could do that and then I learn illustrator and then I can bring that SVG into into code and then animate that with JavaScript like what yeah I didn't even know I could do that like you just yeah that you unlocked um I remember we read about some sort of uh the accessibility like the lawsuits and everything that was all starting when I first started there uh we started that kind of unlocked everything so I was like I didn't know anything about accessibility really so I started reading more and then we like we uh went back and like made thousands of landing pages that we have for that company just like accessible so that like unlocked something else like oh my gosh like people you know like need people that aren't me that need to like read this everyone needs to be able to like learn and read this so that that was great too like yeah the you know the the late 2010s whatever that decade is called like that was really a Renaissance for accessibility we're still feeling that today like uh there there's so many different websites and and sub pages and everything that can be gone through and made accessible and it's like yeah it's it's not that much work and it makes all the difference for so many people uh I think something like 15% of people on earth live with a disability right um so yeah it sounds like really important impactful work so you were able to like sit down and like okay today I'm making these pages exess Bill and like did that was that a good feeling like were you able to like what was your mom thinking this entire time I guess curious because she's seen her daughter go from you know College Dropout who's like you know getting tickets because her car is too uh old and Rusty old and Rusty uh and you know like like kind of like uh living a hand to mouth existence so to speak and now she's going out there and having such an impact helping uh improve these websites and yeah like what did she ever talk with you about that oh yeah yeah I mean I tell my mom everything so she was very excited for me like anything cool that I did or something I sent her I mean like I even I even called her when I won like this Call of Duty war zone game like I she I tell her like everything right like so yeah no she was proud she's aware like she's like I didn't even know you can do that I remember even my sister she was giving birth and I was in the hospital like learning with my laptop like oh okay so I could move this here and this that because you know giving birth takes forever so I'm just sitting there in the waiting room so and I'm like look Mom I remember showing her like all these like columns I did or something like that and she's like that's great Cass yeah but no she was very excited she was very very proud of me like very just very happy yeah to just see me like settle down a little bit Yeah and speaking of settling down if you don't mind me asking like like you recently changed your last name which is why on your landing page it said Cass Sanchez but now you're cast change that yeah yeah maybe you can talk about about that congratulations on uh marrying sounds like your longtime boyfriend yeah yeah that was great he um he's been wonderful he's supported me through the whole like coding Journey like it's uh he paid off my $40 ticket for me when I was when I was real down in the dumps um yeah it's it's been great it there's nothing like having a supportive spouse when you're trying to learn and like pivot into something completely different like when he met me I didn't even have a job and I didn't know what I was doing and he still was just like yeah I like her yeah so that was great like you know you like he likes you for you so that's great um then he uh he his job got moved to Houston so I had to move to Houston with him so I moved to a different part of the mortgage company to the different office but that's kind of where everything changed too because that's when I was like okay so maybe you know it just once you move cities you kind of start like taking like looking at your life and being like okay I think I can I think I'm like ready you know to do something a little bit bigger than what what this is like I want to I want to move on and my husband was amazing about everything just like yeah like you should like I think you're great like as a husband does but um yeah I think that that move if it weren't for him and that whole move and everything I don't I'm not even sure where I would where I would be like yeah he helps me a lot and without him I don't I wouldn't even be a developer yeah yeah wow well um gooders to him for uh being so supportive that that's really chill my wife was extremely supportive when me as like a 31y old man hey I'm going to stop being a School director I'm going to learn the code she was super she had and she practically as a as an American she had insurance through her company so I had health insurance coverage even though I was just you know heads down for like nine months learning the code while I was at the library and stuff so um yeah that's super chill that he was there uh to support you and um it not just emotionally but like with your your $40 ticket so yeah maybe we can talk about this new Awakening when you arrive in Houston Houston is one of the biggest cities in the United States uh it's like the Metroplex that the Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex and and the Houston Metroplex they're they're like the two biggest parts of Texas which is the second biggest state right behind California in terms of population uh they're even though they're both in Texas they're pretty far away from from each other like it takes me about 4 hours to drive down to Houston from here maybe you could talk about what it was like arriving in this big city is this the biggest city you've ever lived in yeah yeah it is so I mean we and we moved to like a really nice little apartment like in the middle of like the heights so it was just like bustling stuff everywhere like bars restaurants like it was so cool to see all that cuz we didn't have that before we I'd never like lived in like a really cool part of a city you know so it was fun and it was fun seeing like all these people like you know you like successful people around you like it just helps you like you know talk to people like neighbors and stuff just like seeing what they're doing how hard they're working like it it is kind of an Awakening like just being just getting taken out of your comfort zone is an Awakening no matter what you do right like it's so it was just it was a huge inspiration that like I want to I now that I'm like more comfortable with change I want to I want to do more I want to like do a lot more actually so yeah and I was thinking like okay like how do I even improve my code how do I get better like I need to get better like it was I I think I got a little bit complacent at the mortgage company um but that move really helped with that so I was like maybe I'll start like a 100 days of code I've seen that like on Twitter where I uh I started a account like 10 years ago and it was just there I was like okay maybe and then the pandemic hit yeah and that's what like we all started working from home so I had even more time in the day so I really like I was like I'll just do 100 days of code and I started that and I started posting I had five followers like I was just posting yes and then also sending it to my mother um but she wasn't going to join Twitter so it's just five followers and my mom on the side uh and yeah it just like every day I was just striving to just get a little bit better like a little bit better just uh you know it started off with like how to do like a little falling down animation in sequence like a make a word fall down like the letters like hit each other yeah you know things like that like super silly things like I got really into loading animations just to learn animations like and the more I posted the more like I saw people were like oh that's cool that's cool and I'm like oh my gosh other people think that's cool and so then I got inspired looking at other people's code and it just oh my gosh it gets so exciting once you like finally start talking to other people like that that opened up everything like Twitter just like I was like whoa like everyone is so talented 100 days of code Twitter like I mean you've got 50,000 followers now so you literally grew your following by 10,000 times in this time uh posting uh about yeah just posting things that I make that I think are kind of cool like that's it yeah and that I mean that's the secret like there's so much authenticity when I like scroll through your Twitter feed and as like you're just being you you're You're Building you're using your skills to build things that you think are interesting uh let's talk about like agency life like working at an agency so you're no longer at a mortgage company now you're working at a kind of like Dev consultancy agency doing work probably for a lot of different companies can you talk about that a little bit yeah it's so much fun to work at an agency like I don't I even told my husband recently like I don't think I could see myself moving to like another corporate job like that cuz agency like you you get to work on everything like you know it's not just one project and you're improving it forever or whatever it's new projects new projects like can you do this I don't know how but we'll figure it out like it's so much fun it's chaotic agency life is so chaotic and it's like you have to wear so many hats CU you're not a big corporate company you're just an agency so like oh you need to figure out how to do reports on Google analytics okay like I guess we'll figure this out um or oh you need X Y and Z like okay we're going to figure out how to do that or you need like a video platform you know so agency life is just really really fun like if you want to ever level up like crazy it's it's going to be in my opinion at an agency yeah and I've heard the same from so many people that work at agencies like you just get to work on so many more projects uh if you work at a big company that might stick you in a department and you just work on that you know code base for years you know um but you're I mean how many different projects are you taking on a year would you say if you were to estimate oh my gosh probably like probably like 15 or so 15 projects a year that you're touching yeah yeah yeah and then like a lot of them a lot of projects I'm also just like keeping up with and adding to but like new projects new things yeah about 15 I'd say yeah and you're you're able to work remotely yeah yeah most of my all of my coworkers are in seatt and I'm the only one in Texas cuz they said oh it's the pandemic we'll hire someone from out of state yeah I just met them like a month ago in real life for the first time so that's exciting that's cool yeah uh yeah a lot of tech up in Seattle uh and like a lot of you know big customers and stuff so it makes sense that they'd be out there um but that's that's so cool that you know you can live in Houston of course uh you know being a Texan growing up here I used to live in Houston when I was a kid actually uh I probably left Houston because I'm a bit older than you I was probably not living in Houston uh obviously not now but I think I lived there till I was like six or wait I lived there from like age five to like age 10 I think so I lived there for five years yeah and that was my kind of Texas upbringing and my first um encounter with the humidity and the heat of it's insane like you don't think it's going to be that bad and it's like way worse than you could ever imagine yeah especially for someone with curly hair oh my gosh so I'm really excited to learn a little bit more about lessons you've learned from this because overcoming to some extent your introversion and uh being able to get things done on teams working with clients um of course learning the code really well um not just front end development but like going extremely deep on CSS specifically that's so cool what are some observations that you have about your journey that like you think would be like super actionable for someone like what advice would you send back in time to yourself well yeah great question a like um 100% like main one is ask for help when you're stuck because otherwise you're going to spend so much unnecessary time just being stuck when you don't actually have to be and people are a lot nicer than you think they are yeah um anyone needs anything I'm happy to like help always Reach Out me I'm totally here um what else let's see 100 days of code 100 just consistency pretty much is what it is right like you can spend like 3 hours learning how to do something and then you don't touch it again you're going to forget yeah that was a huge deal for me that was something that like feels obvious but I needed to learn like 17 times before I finally got it so really it's just the consistency sharing your code is important to me I mean a lot of people probably don't think it's a good idea maybe you don't want to share on social media maybe you know you're scared to post But like everyone again is so kind and it's fun to get feedback maybe you learn something you can do better um it's just it's very important to like talk to other developers just get out of your box a little bit and just learn you know and if you think something looks cool try to figure out how to do it try to like Decon deconstruct it see how they do that like just being curious when you feel yourself getting complacent and like try to like you know see that that's like a feeling and that's what you're doing like try to recognize it and try to Pivot a little bit from that but also don't get burned out because I've done that so many times that yeah it's like a habit we talk about that real quick because I mean that like that's the biggest occupational hazard other than like repetitive stress injury or eye strain or uh some people uh I know have got like vertigo from staring at a screen too much and things like that which is very debilitating but like burnout is very real and like a lot of people that I've talked to have gone through periods of burnout can when was the I I guess the first time you started feeling burned out and what did that feel like um the first time was when I started posting a lot on social media that I felt like I should probably keep posting I should make I should keep making more CSS art like you kind of start getting in this mode that you're like I need to keep learning I need to keep posting like you kind of start moving into like robotic mode almost um and then I started getting less excited I started getting more tired I started dreading opening up social media like that's when I was like uh oh like this what am I doing but I'm so stubborn that I just kind of try to push through it and then you burn out yeah um and I actually just came out of a burnout recently too because I don't when I get an idea in my head I get so excited I get just so hyped I want to do it night and day like wake up go to sleep do it and then I just just burned myself out so I've kind of resigned myself to the fact that I'm oh sorry that I'm a kind of person that like I'm like a dog with a bone and then once I finish the bone I need like a month break of like extracurriculars and then I can go back yeah I'm so I'm taking so many notes uh because I I feel your description of like you know that that kind of you get into production mode where you're like I've got to ship this and I you know and probably at the same time you know social media is like you see those numbers climb there's uh Jeff Atwood founder of sty overflow whom I've interviewed on uh the uh freeing podcast previously he he has a great saying he says the moment you put a number next to somebody's face that's where like problems happen because people are going to try to make that number go up right and yeah it's it's like a game yeah yeah and I mean you've been so amazing at that game but at the same time it can it can feel like a grind like and it can almost feel like the the the people that are actually like saying kind things and everything that kind of gets abstracted away like people are saying nice things but my number's not going up as fast as it used to or something like that or yeah or like what what's wrong like I just worked really hard on this I published it like have you ever published uh a new piece of art and just felt like it wasn't as well received as your like previous work oh yeah yeah and that's when I have to like step back and be like it's not even it's not even about that like it's just that I get so sad that other people aren't as excited as I am about it but that's okay because like I'm not as excited about everything either it's just like it stings a little bit it stings the heart a little bit after like five hours of working on something yeah like I've written more than 500 articles for like the free C Camp publication and like there was this one that I spent like three days on I worked so hard on it and I was like so proud of it and I published it in like very few people read I mean it was still like you know I feel guilty even saying like oh only a few th000 people read this article but still you know is like you kind of get like acclimated to success and anything that's not like absolute unadulterated success feels like a step down and yeah that definitely kind of like made me question should I really work this hard on a single article if like all of them but obviously like when looking at your art it's clear that you spend a great deal of time on these H how do you do it how do you how do you push forward you know meticulously crafting these pieces uh like is there ever a voice in your head like H people aren't going to like this as much do do you have like a critical voice in your head ever no not when I start it when I start it I like I said dog with the bone I am in it and I'm going to finish this because I'm going to finish this I don't care if this looks weird or hard like I'm going to finish this and then it's not until after that I get like a little hangover like what did I just do or is anyone even going to like this yeah why did I just spend eight hours on this yeah it's it's not during it's after Okay so so that's I mean that's a really con convenient way for your mind to work because for me I'm always doubting things before I even start or as I'm doing it I'm like St to doubt like uh for example like with my music like I created the soundtrack for The learn to code RPG and the whole time like are people going to just think this is janky like is it going to sound amateurish and uh like I was doubting myself the entire time uh so it I would love to have it sounds like a superpower to be able to like just power through and only after you finish working so hard on something do you start to doubt but the work is already done so it's it's like you're not really discourage once the work is already done you just have to like yeah that's that's a really cool Quirk see but that's different though from the from the music because the the art I already know what it needs to look like I know what the endgame is the music you need to be creative and be like okay I have to do this I have to do that the art is already written for like I I just I know I see it and I have to make sure it looks like that at the end so so how does what is your process like so you identify some sort of object or some sort of like maybe you can walk an electronic yeah yeah just walk us through an entire project yeah okay so like I start getting kind of the itch of like okay I kind of want to draw something do creative okay so I start Pinterest um it's already totally geared to like me so it shows me a bunch of electronics with really nice like edges and stuff that um would be easy to draw with CSS art so I just scroll open up a bunch of tabs and then after I have like 10 open I go through those and I'm like okay this one so then I keep that tab open and I put it as a background image on my code and then I just kind of outline the shape of it so that I know the shapes the main shapes are right and then after that I'm off to the races I start with just any little thing that I think is like the easiest thing to start with and from there you just you just go yeah and so so do you do like the big like I mean when you scroll through your landing page it shows like the big squares appear first and then you kind of go through and you add fine details maybe you'll zoom in and really focus on like the flash component and you'll spend a whole lot of time on that and then you'll go do the viewfinder and then you'll do like the lens like how do you because I've seen people draw like I don't I can't draw for the damn but like they'll often like it almost seems arbitrary what they're focused on like they just jump around almost yeah is it so it's just like a yeah it's arbitrary for me it's just whatever looks like I'm going to that's that's what I feel like I'm going to do right now I'm going to just do that and I'm going to focus on it so like I think I did the flash first or I I'm pretty sure it's the flash I'm not very familiar with camera Parts but the flash part um and so I'm like okay I'm going to make this perfect and then I'm like okay that looks good but now it's just like squares and a flash a really nice looking Flash and so then you just move on to the next thing and then the next thing um and then the logo is always the last thing to go on but yeah yeah and I guess how would you recommend somebody if they want to create CSS art like you do if they want to try to create photo realistic images using CSS what would be some tips if somebody let's say that somebody has like a free weekend and they're like I want to get better at CSS and I'm going to use this project I'm going to like you have a a photo real istic Xbox controller right like somebody gets a they they find a photo of an Xbox or maybe like uh some new synthesizer module or something like that that they they just find online and this is like this is a beautiful you know aesthetic piece of hardware and I or or their favorite mechanical keyboard or something they want to recreate that in CSS what would be your advice to getting started with that process and getting better at CSS art yeah so my advice would be for first things first like try to create create something with a single div like learn how to stack backgrounds that's it like that's once you can make like a pretty simple image and you can learn how backgrounds can stack on top of each other how the linear gradients can stack or radial um after that it's pretty simple it's I mean I don't want to say simple but like it's it's tedious but it's simple like it's just very detail oriented but once you figure out how the gradient work in a background and how positioning Works you're you're pretty good it's just starting off like really what I started off with was just single divs and stacking the backgrounds to make something I I think my first one was a window and I just made the window like shiny and I was like oh my gosh and then I was like What if I add a ledge okay let me stock this background and then I can move the background and I can make it be just like x height in the same div and it's a ledge now like it's just that moment that you're just like okay so that's how you do it and then yeah you're good from there really it it looks a lot harder because it than it is because there's so much code but it's it's really not it's the same properties over and over again and it's a lot of fun yeah well are there any projects that you're working on right now and I mean you're working fulltime you know you you got like your own personal life and stuff but like do you have any projects that uh you're like I can't wait to build this you don't have to spoil what they're going to be but do you do you have anything that you're getting ready to start um yeah so I I'm working on a CSS course that's uh it took a little bit of a break because of the whole burnout thing um but I I also want to start uh streaming more code um I'm just I'm not sure 100% on how that would work I want to I want to stream CSS art but it takes so long to do that I'm not sure like if that's even a good idea so like that's kind of running around in my head if anyone has any ideas I want to do with that let me know but um that's yeah definitely I want to do more YouTube videos uh and articles I really want to write articles I never write articles we would love to publish some of your articles on uh the free cocam publication if at some point you're interested in in yeah that would be great like a getting started to CSS art article I think would be solid that would be amazing I'd love to publicize that to the community um one thing like this is some unsolicited advice one thing you might consider doing is just keeping your screen recorder going while you're working and then you have this artifact like a recording of you building an entire project and then you could always just speed that up a little bit if it's slow and uh then you you could you know have like a 20x speed because there have been some really cool videos where people are like building uis and stuff and they'll be jumping back and forth from their Editor to the the browser to see what it looks like and stuff and you could just speed that up and put that with some like copyright free music or some like stream okay music and you can put that out that might be a really good way of like testing the water because live streaming is a commitment I spent like a year or two streaming on Twitch and it was so much work compared to like just recording like a a synchronous video and editing it publishing it yeah so I'm not trying to turn anybody off from streaming but it's very hard to get people to like actually watch your stream because they have to be free at that exact moment they have to be like in a place where they're like oh I'm going to sit down I'm going to watch somebody and at the same time twitch has like terrible discoverability you can stream on YouTube but people don't really look at YouTube as like oh I'm streaming on YouTube people think of twitch and twitch doesn't really have a Cate they've got like just chatting they've got like maybe an art category but they don't really have an a category for coding despite the fact that the developer community's been asking for this forever right um oh interesting and that would make a huge difference in terms of discoverability so my humble advice to anybody who's considering streaming like start with YouTube and start with like asynchronously recorded videos where you can edit them and make them more Punchy and stuff it's so much easier to get people to watch a YouTube video that they can watch at any time than to try to get people to tune in at a very specific time to watch you do that and the fact that you can speed it up even if it's not that exciting everything's exciting if you make it fast enough right I agree I agree I need to watch everything faster listen to everything faster like yeah yeah so anyway I apologize for the unsolicited advice but I hope that's helpful that's helpful saves you like no that is 10 or 15 hours of streaming to basically one or two people which is what everybody starts with stream unless you're like what I was going to do yeah yeah even if you have a big Twitter following it's not necessarily going to translate to a whole lot of people tuning in to watch you on on Twitch uh I mean you may have better luck with it than I did but um so you're also developing this course that's going to teach people how to like is just a general CSS course or is it focused specifically on CSS art it's a CSS course focused on CSS art so it's just going to teach you how to it's going to teach you CSS but with the twist of like while you're creating CSS art because I know sometimes when I'm like learning CSS like they show you things and you're like oh well I don't need to know that right now you know I'm Project based learning pretty much like yeah okay we'll do this you know and so like you have to like make a keyboard and you have to use grid things like that like just uh yeah learn CSS for people that are more like art inclined yeah what are your longer term goals I mean you you've got so much momentum and I mean you literally have CSS artist.com great domain name uh and you You' really like built a niche for yourself as somebody who is exceptionally good at this uh where do you have anything like any goals like five 10 years out I don't want to put you on the spot but like where would you ultimately like to be going uh do you see yourself doing a work indefinitely like like what ises the future hold foro um no yeah I think I think agency life is it like I think I just want to keep getting better at what I do get faster you know that's pretty much my goal I don't want to be a CEO of anything I don't want to own my own company like it's I just want to build fun projects forever and like keep learning how to build cool stuff forever I want to learn 3D rendering um I want to retake Bruno Simon uh 3jf gu course cuz I think that's so cool I just want to like that's it really just get way better at everything and that's what I try to do every day just little by little that's that's it my goal is just be a little bit better yeah and I would absolutely leave it there but let's talk about 3js because it's so amazing it's such a cool tool for for building like 3D potentially interactive experiences in the browser yeah what what Drew you to 3GS and maybe you could describe what the what it does so I mean 3js is really just as someone who likes to look at Art and likes realistic things and stuff 3js what drew me to it was you know realistic actual like 3D things on your computer right now everything is like 2D or is it it's two dimensional yeah one dimensional is just like a single line technically is onedimensional I don't think not anything physical okay some physicists will probably correct me there but yeah yeah although I'm GNA I'm goingon to do a shout out to onedimensional PacMan it's PacMan but there's just it's a line and you can it'll be hard to describe it but I'm going to add a link to onedimensional PacMan in the show notes and if you click this link you are going to waste at least 10 minutes on this thing this game is so it's amazing it's an engineering like design Marvel that it works and is as addictive as it is but all you do is you tap to turn Pacman around and he's either running from the ghost or he's running towards the ghost after he ate a power pet but such an amazing that sounds so cool that but that is like to my knowledge the first onedimensional game I mean not it's not technically one but your the entire gameplay takes it place on a line um that's cool so twodimensional 3js back to 3js it's twodimensional uh you you know all the CD even though they have perceived depth to them uh it's still just a twodimensional thing you can't like grab you know the Polaroid camera and start looking at it from different angles and stuff using CS I mean you might be able to build 3 stuff in CSS but 3js is designed specifically for 3D rendering and like being able to model things and manipulate things in three dimensions right yes right so it's it looks very cool like it's just it brings I don't know it makes the web so much more exciting and I want to get in on that right like you want to learn all of that I've been learning blender and I want to learn how to make animated videos on that I don't know everything 3js 3D and stuff is just like the coolest thing ever for me right now it is what I'm into um so and I've already taken most of Bruno's course Bruno Simon's 3js Journey amazing incredible course I recommend it to everybody okay I'll link to it mhm but yeah no it's so exciting like the whole thing like the things that you can do with your with your code on like using 3js is incredible and I just I want to be that cool what's the most impressive thing you've seen with 3js uh oh my gosh you I'm going to sound like a commercial but Bruno Simon's uh portfolio website is that the one where you're driving the remote control around yes that is amazing I love that uh you're driving like this RC car around and like knocking over bowling pins and stuff okay I'm definitely I'll link to that instead of his course I think that page links to his course but you know along with onedimensional PacMan everybody listening you should spend like five minutes just driving this is the best portfolio I've ever seen ever yeah I mean your portfolio is amazing I would put like if there was AER list yours would be like probably s tier but his is like SS tier I mean it's just yeah his is everything yeah his is creative it's like you're like how did he do it's everything I've everything I admire in web like it's it's amazing yeah really so yeah that's that's what I want to do I just want to comment that it's like so cool that like you went from architecture student kind of like down and out and then now you're this widely recognized like uh popular kind of like artist like you're creating art in a time when it's very hard to break through as an artist like it's like the probably the hardest field to ever go into is creating art right and you're doing it and people are checking out your work and you've also been able to Parlay the same skills that you've been doing to develop this art into working as a software engineer as a senior frontend developer at a consultancy as at a design agency I mean that's so cool that you've been able to like take a second chapter turn over a new leaf and go in a completely different direction and find so much success there and uh yeah I mean like what does that feel like insane I feel like I'm like I've lived two different lives right like if you would have asked me 10 years ago where I would be now I don't know what I would have told you but it would not be this like it's cool and it makes you feel like you know you really can do anything like just you're capable of so much more than you think you are all the time it's it's crazy right like it's just don't be complacent like it's it's insane really it feels great like I it's like a breath of fresh air yeah well it's been such a blast talking with you like Cass you're just like such an enthusiastic like high energy person it's it's very hard for me to imagine you as an introvert who would work on an engineering problem for an entire week because she's too timid to ask for help but I mean obviously you've come an incredibly long way and uh I just I just want to thank you for coming on the podcast and inspiring uh inspiring me and inspiring the many people who are looking to get into software development who needed you in as a role model and have now found you as a role model thank you so much honestly hearing that from you is everything and I cannot wait till tell my mom like she's going to die well if she's listening to this what's your mom's name Rosie Rosie from the free Camp Community I hope you have a fantastic day and your daughter is amazing she's going to love that I'm very excited yeah well everyone uh again check out the many links in the show notes to the many projects we've talked about check out uh cass's portfolio of course check out the the Bruno Simon like uh amazing portfolio as well and uh I hope everybody walks away with a little bit more inspiration a little bit more knowledge about you know CSS HTML frontend development agency life all these things that we've talked about um thank you again for coming on Cass yeah thank you so much really and can I just say one thing like okay if y'all are like stuck on something or like anything CSS you want to talk your portfolio like please feel free to reach out I'm more than happy to like hang out talk things through that's all awesome you're such a chill person for like being so helpful and and like you know sending the elevator back down and as uh as Leon Noel from 100 devs likes to call it um yeah yeah it's so chill so everyone until next week happy coding bye
