hello everybody my name is peter ambanugo and i'm a software developer from nigeria i'm working on a realtime state synchronization service and i should be able to launch it by the end of the month this match i currently work from home that's where i do most of my work i have a small office set up in an unused room here and maybe not too small quite okay and comfortable for me i can show you my decks now so this is my small home office i have just a macbook pro without an external monitor by planning that um here i will keep some small quotes which i do meditate on reflect on this my internet modem for my current project which is a realtime state sync library state sync service i just started working on it and i decided to start with the dashboard so i practically start off my morning with positive intent by reading and reflecting on some audios already a chapter from a book called daily stoic by ryan holiday i that's the first thing i read after before i get to start my work reflect on the words on it then i do some gratitude exercise by by listening some gratitude you like this which i use today or days which i use most of the time after the gratitude exercise i do listen to some motivational inspirational thoughts too to keep my mind boosted and energized so today i listen to this recording and yesterday i listened to this so they helped me to get started with the day with high energy and clarity and some people do start off the idea with emails i sometimes don't look at my email and sometimes i quickly check my email to see if there's any important email coming in that needs to affect how i arranged my day because i do organize my activity for the day the night before so that i can get started immediately so i already have in mind what i'm going to work on for today and after my reflection i'm going to kick start my day with some coding on aws london api gateway i write down my activity for the day on documented visual studio code and you can see what i have for today i do track my the time spent on activities on a tool called kanban flow which i use for time tracking and i have various both here and it helped me with time management i use that to respect at the end of the week to see how much i spent and in what areas i spent them on and they chose the pomodoro technique for me i used 20 minutes time in tower and in a day i aim for three to four hours of focus work not including break times so in total including breaks about i spent about five hours on my laptop five six hours walking but try to do focus work for three to four hours sometimes during my short breaks i do come out to stretch and get a feel of the sun as today it's quite sunny and very hot as you can see so i'm trying to purely small service with slamdan aws flanders api gateway i'm near to using the wwe slambandgate api gateway so followed some basic instruction from their documentation and i've been able to set up a quick lambda and i think the ui is quite easy to use and i've been able to set up some things just with the click of some buttons and it's worked for me and except that i've not been able to connect the api gate with a connected vehicle to an api gateway to give a proper response so i'm getting an error here and i've done a quick google search which has pointed me to this resource that i need to set the response code so i'll be setting up a response code so it behaves properly i run this test again i expect to get a different result so here is saying successfully completed and it works so part of my day involves trying to figure out some new things on how to use things by going through documentations online or equity google search so that i have not going through long tutorials because there are a lot of things in the documentation you need to take weeks to go finish all of them and i just need to achieve what i need to achieve as soon as possible so quick do it yourself and google search helps me to solve this problem so today after walk um i decided to go for a run and i'll be doing a five kilometer today i do this sometimes after walk in the evening on fridays or saturday so today i'll be going for my room
