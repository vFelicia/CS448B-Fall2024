testy okay um yeah so more about me my name's cara this is steven my husband and we own steed interactive um which we've been doing for about the last three years a little over three years now and basically we went like we jumped in feet first i think stephen stephen has been doing code stuff for about 10 years prior to this at oklahoma christian as their web development director and then moved short time to an agency that doing web stuff and it was just not really his cup of tea and then i had been doing some freelance on the side for a while since i was out of school and uh so i i am a graphic designer and that's kind of my background a lot of branding work and um in design and we basically jumped in full uh like he quit his job and i had already quit a while back to stay home with babies and um so we were both doing this at the same time and we started out kind of freelance and then we decided okay we want to start making um the recurring monthly income so we're going to add people and add services and kind of start building up an agency and so for like the last all of 2017 we were we were saying like we're an agency we do content development and that kind of thing and sell our services that way and just this last year we kind of realized okay we've um we've made a lot of mistakes we don't necessarily know how to sell our services and adding people is just kind of adding to the chaos and so we've actually cut back and we're now kind of moving back to the freelance side of things in a more smart way maybe we've learned from a lot of our mistakes we're learning how to sell our services we're learning what like actually appeals to our clients and what's helpful for our clients and instead of just kind of not knowing what we're doing we're working on building up our business with the two of us and making sure that we know how to grow our business without you know without just adding people adding services adding time sold so um that's what's been going on these last three years and i'm hoping to kind of share some of our mistakes with you today so that you can learn from them instead of doing them yourself and um so that's kind of the last three years and i'll i'll tell you there's um there's four things before you jump into freelance and i um i was asking a little while ago um you you do freelance in the back and then who else has done freelance kimberly um and you've done freelance but everyone else is that is freelance a goal for you is that something that you are interested in doing once you learn what you're doing okay yeah um so yeah before you jump into that um there's there's four things that you need to understand and i will say uh there are a ton of resources online like google is your best friend when you're getting started in this like so if you're looking to you know pricing or accounting or you know all that all the technical stuff that gets you know the background of what you are needing to do google is your best friend you can find a lot of help online a lot of free information um but there's four things that you need to understand and kind of work towards for uh freelance if you want to be successful and um and i will say like a lot of a lot of this like we kind of just realized like okay we don't have a good understanding of these things how can we get that and we were pa we paid consultants to figure this out um so that's always an option for you but um some mistakes that we were making over these last three years one we were very attached we were very up close and personal with our deliverables in the actual product that we sold we took a lot of pride in our work which is a really good thing to have it's good to be confident in what you're doing but um when i say we're too attached to what we were selling uh what what we're doing is we kind of put value on our services that someone else doesn't see like it's when you're kind of up there working you're putting in the hours you don't realize like uh what someone else is seeing what your clients actually value it's hard to communicate to them the value of you know your time or your expertise if all you're doing is kind of if it's onesided perspective of your work um we didn't understand money when we started when we started it out we were basically just trying to make up our salary and for freelance there's so much more that goes into pricing your services than just making up your salary a lot of it is like of course you want to survive and you want to be able to pay your bills but there's a lot more that goes into your cost than just the time that goes into each product or each deliverable and so um i'll go into that too and then we didn't understand value and that's kind of the same as uh we were too attached to the deliverables but we didn't really understand how to um communicate to our clients in a way that they understand in a way that kind of leads them to see what why why they need us um so yeah that's that's like the big things and i think that a lot of freelancers uh don't think about you know how they're going to actually sell their services or how they're going to you know make up their time and make make sure that they are full have a full roster of clients a lot of people just kind of jump in blindly saying hey i got this cool thing and that's actually one of the things i i love freelance for is that anyone can do it anyone can jump in anyone has the it's very accessible to people it's kind of a a great neutralizer because you don't have to be part of a bigger company you don't have to be dependent on you know them just kind of feeding you like the scraps um you actually get to set your prices and you know make the money that you want to make through freelance and um if if only like it was that easy and it actually is easy you just have to kind of know what those things are in order to make that money so yeah back to uh the four things that you need to understand if you can detach from your product detach from the deliverables so um you're putting a lot of time into making sure that you have a quality product that you have a quality um that you that you do quality work and you're very up close and personable personable with that but if you can detach from what you're doing each day and and realize you know on a some people are too emotionally close to their product in order to have a kind of bird's eye view of it um and that that goes like for just when you're communicating with your clients when you're trying to price your services and when you're doing sales if you can detach emotionally from that product you are going to be a better business person you can be a better uh you know be more empathetic to your clients when they don't understand what's going on and it just makes you more approachable if you can come at this product as you know a little bit less emotionally attached another reason you want to detach from your products is if you are you know building this business out like if you're if you do end up doing freelance all the time um eventually you're going to want to be able to bring more people on and be able to uh you know sell sell more than just the thing that you're selling and and the way you do that is you know you have to kind of let other developers other other people kind of bring their craft in and they're going to do things different than you but it still is still good so if you can detach just from the product itself a little bit the other thing is money so you need to understand money before you jump into freelance and i will say there's uh three stages of freelance and basically there's the first stage where you're kind of learning freelance and learning how to work with clients learning how to get a deliverable produced that is a quality product and you're basically kind of like feeling it out i would say that this stage is best done when when you are still have a nine to five salary uh not not the way that stephen and i did it um we did a lot of learning that first year just uh trying to figure out um what even like how to go back and forth with clients or you know how many rounds of um what with design you have to kind of do like re revisions and that kind of thing so we were just learning way too much being paid full time and then there's the second stage of freelance where you are confident in the deliverable that you've produced you've worked with clients you can actually lead them through a project and you are filling up your time you are booking basically based on yours you're selling your services based on the time that you it takes you to produce or the deliverables that are produced with it and then after that the third stage of freelance is you're no longer selling your services based on the time and deliverables but the actual value that the clients are getting out of your services and that's when you are able to start leveraging your time where you actually start to start making more money than the time that you are putting in so that's kind of the third stage and i will say time versus leverage so there's also two ways of doing freelance where you are you're actually you have um the time that you put in is okay you can sell your services to a lot of clients and if you're just trying to make up the salary that you had given up then you basically are going from one boss who gives you a salary to a lot of bosses that give you a salary those clients like the the level of expertise that you have if you aren't leading them throughout the whole process through the sales and through everything else and the clients actually become your boss and you aren't your own boss as even though that it's flexible like you have the flexibility you have um you know you can set your own prices it's still there's this point where you know you go from having many bosses to being your own boss and actually leading the clients and you know showing them what the value is of your services and that's where you uh you start to sell not just the time and deliverables but the actual value and so um and so then you can start being your expert being a consultant to your clients and um i'll also say uh pricing like everyone gets very uh nervous about when they go to price their services but pricing is uh it's kind of it doesn't mean anything the actual price tag doesn't ever mean anything uh the same service that you're selling for five hundred dollars someone else is selling for ten thousand um some the websites that we were building for five thousand we learned some people are selling for thirty thousand um like there's no the actual price tag does not matter um now you can't like you can't just like kind of say i'm a freelancer i'm going to go sell my stuff for this much money like there is value that um you have to put into the product that is not based on deliverables or based on the um the time that you put in the actual value that you're able to add is uh is a little bit more if you can make that results based um actually we'll just move on to number three number three if you can understand value of your services um in the value it comes when you have a let's say you have a client and you can see like where they're at where they're struggling and hit on those pain points like okay you obviously need the exact thing that i am doing here um and then talk to them about like what what is their benefit what um what is where does this service get them like what are their goals um what are the emotions tied to you know being a little bit more free like having a lot more flexibility with their website or being able to bring in more leads through their website or if you're doing apps like what what money would they be able to bring in with those apps or what convenience is there if you can point out like they're struggling now they have a vision and they have a gap like so that's where your services go um and it's not necessarily about the time that you put in or the deliverable it's about you solving their problem and if you are the one to solve their problem then um then they're going to give you the money and if they believe that you are the only one who can solve their problem because you fully understand and they will because you fully understand what their pain points are then they're more likely to give you what you asked for so the price becomes um basically what you feel is worth the value to them it's not about the emotional benefits to value there are a lot of different pains that people have like um if you're working with business owners then a lot of their their pain is like they can't they have a bottleneck they can't continue to sell more or they have to um you know they're they're stressed they're over stressed they they don't have the systems in place that they need they don't have the revenue in place like there's a lot of pain there and it's not just business related all the time sometimes it's you know they're stressed they're overworked they their employees don't respect them or you know there's all kinds of things that you can find out that is a problem and then um they they are usually they have the pain and they're also making mistakes and you can tell them like what mistakes they are making you might lead them to through that conversation and ask them what mistakes they are making or or where they want to be instead of just putting up their defenses but and then lead them to their vision and their vision is usually something that brings them money something that lessens their stress and so is that if you can anchor your price to their emotions and the value to what they need instead of what you are needing and the money that you need to bring in you're going to kind of um it makes them think that you are here for them and it makes the project about their needs and not about you so even it's like count it's counterintuitive to make it all about them but that's really all that they care about and it also establishes trust in you they don't think that you're trying you're just out there to get their money they don't think that you're you know they don't think that you need them as much you know that you don't need the sale and that um creates establishes a lot of trust and money follows trust so um if you can get your clients to trust you and a lot of that is you know having good work and having good clients in the past but then if you can establish trust upfront with clients um that that like leads them to want to give you more money and the same is also true if you are doing freelance for a company a larger company except for their pain points are going to be different so if you're kind of filling um doing coding for a agency or something like that then um it's more about you know like they are needing someone who's dependable they're needing someone who can um get the job done on their timeline you know they just need to know that you are going to be present that you're going to get the job done and that you know their their problem is more about impressing their boss than it is about fulfilling the client's need although some of that is there too um so you just like kind of if you can uh instead of selling from your perspective if you can find out what their true needs are and a lot of that is just asking them questions that matter and you know don't be afraid to ask the questions that you need to know in order to price your services and the number four thing that kind of reaches across all of everything is confidence and if you have confidence in the service that you're providing if you can lead your client through through the whole process with confidence that you're going to get the job done so what we found is a lot of times when we would go and go into a first meeting where we're meeting and talking about um you know what what we're going to do for someone before we ever get the job is that the client themselves are not confident like they don't know that we can get the job done and people project feelings on people onto other people so their them feeling not confident um would show up and then we would start to feel less confident about what we were offering and it was kind of like this spiral downwards where like by the end they're just like well i'm not sure if the uh if seed is the right people for the job because they don't know if they're the right people for the job but um we found when we show up with confidence that that projects back to them and when we say like yes you obviously have a need here and it's our services that are going to help you get the results that you want and um when we showed up with that confidence then they just like it's kind of a peaceful feeling that they get that um they're like yes this is uh who we need and then we could quote them the price that we want and like it it doesn't matter um the actual price is anchored to the results anchored to our confidence and we could tell them you know whatever price it is and they would say okay how can i make this work instead of like no that's too much so um if you have and um i will say like as you're starting out if you can find confidence in one area of what you're doing like say you're good at um a certain type of product if you can kind of carry that and push your confidence to other places um you know find your confidence in one area and then use it you know with your clients um you can find your confidence here and then work to yeah just there's there's way if you have the confidence in one place then you can likely have find it in another place and you just have to find it and use it and i think when when you're starting out when you're still in that first phase of freelance where you're learning your product and learning how to work with clients um you can you can tell them like hey this is something you know you can work work out with them what price it needs to be i guess and um if you're if you're getting that project done like you can use that project to fuel your confidence for the next next project so it doesn't really matter like what those first few projects look like as long as you're kind of like making sure that your goal is confidence in the product that you sell that's that's kind of like our four things and i'll open it up to questions so if you if you have any questions about any specific things in freelance i'm happy to answer good um he's asking with contracts if we have um any specific payment schedules or anything that we've learned about contracts so um with contracts and i will say like there's there's two parts of contracts there is the statement of work and that which is we basically turn the proposal into the statement of work and then there's a terms of service and the terms of service is something that we we went to a lawyer for um but there are terms of service online and um ours is ours is probably very specific to design and frontend web development but that statement of work outlines kind of the scope of the project and it outlines the payment schedule and really it just kind of um depends on what you want to get paid but i would say get paid as much as you can up front we we started out doing 50 50 and clients were always pretty happy with that now we try to do 100 up front but we'll work with people if they need to schedule out their payments and it we kind of let them bring it up we don't um so if it's uh right now our our package price is 5500 it's like an eight week program where we do consulting um for ecommerce companies and we uh we say hey it's 5500 and they say do you can i schedule that out and say yes what are you thinking and then they'll say okay can i split it into two payments and then yeah yeah that works or sometimes they'll ask for three payments like yeah that works we don't like for them like we're not a bank so we don't want to be scheduling out payment plans for people they could go to the bank they can put it on a credit card and get payment plans that way but as far as as far as money goes like you cash flow is extremely important for freelancers and if you are putting a lot of work into a project where you get paid up front and then paid at the end that cash flow like will dip each month and be irregular so if you can't collect all the money that you need then um it's just a very unsure way of doing business i guess um we we don't do as many contracts anymore well we don't do as many statement of works oh i will say um there is this there is a contract online so one thing that we've stopped doing is we've stopped listing the deliverables in our contracts because we are results focused and we've always we've always said that we price on value which is not true um we've always pretty much just priced on what we need to make and when we started pricing on the value and like the results that people get then we were also when we when we were doing that and then still listing the deliverables in the contract then people it still looks like your pricing based on the deliverables they get which doesn't always make sense because you know we don't i mean until like that first few meetings we don't even know like exactly what the client needs i think that's very true for scoping on code as well like you get into a project and realize like oh crap this looked really simple but it's not like that's going to take a few more weeks and so if you are listing out the deliverables and not basing your price on results then um for one you're probably undercutting yourself up front and um not not leaving room for there to be the extra time um or you know you just uh yeah it's you're nodding your head are you i agree yes right and that's he was saying um yeah you kind of uh build yourself into a corner and don't allow yourself to pivot and that's very true that's what we were finding in our cl in our contracts is we would say oh um we can do this and this and this for you and then when this and this wasn't we would we would do those things and then it wouldn't provide the results and they were and then we would come back to the client and say actually um you don't you don't need this it turns out you need this and we've already lost that trust that needed to be there up front and so you actually build a lot of front of trust up front if you can say we don't know what you need we need to do we need to like dive into your business and um and learn what you need and then we can build out and um some people also do like uh a discovery package discovery is kind of a buzz buzzword but where you know you take two weeks and really dive in to what they um what they're doing they are paying for that and they can take um your kind of prescription and go you know take it to someone else or they can stay on and take and you know have you do the work but um those two weeks are it's a lot of research on your on your part and it also kind of sets up your project for success so you're not like prescribing anything before you actually know about their business and so having the discovery up front and then doing all that stuff in the background but is that any other questions the question was how do i or what is my advice for someone who's working on fiverr or some of the gig development sites and moving to doing their own um work i guess building their own business is that kind of what yeah um i'd say for one you you aren't completely like you are learning how to do this um if you are learning how to work with clients then that's not a bad way to start because that does give you leads to begin with but to make the jump i think you still have to understand like one detach from that's going to be really hard to detach from uh if you're selling your services for so much little amounts of money and building those larger company businesses selling your own services you have to realize that um you know someone is charging fifty dollars for whatever that someone else is charging five thousand for that same work like if you can realize like you can get that larger amount of money and realize that like that's not the fiber does not um define your business that um there's a lot more potential just like making the um being able to jump is is kind of like you do have that capability to jump and so you should take it i guess um don't let like that mindset hold you back and um i'd say you still have the work you still have the confidence that you built from that and you can use that to put towards your future clients there is you also have to learn how to get those clients and a lot of that is you know talking confidently about their needs and talking confidently about like what they're struggling with and then you know making it like you're the one service that you like the service that you provide is the answer to their problems so kind of learning how to get clients through the way that you talk about your services they don't just show up at your door so yeah did i answer call yeah um so referral is a good way to go especially if you have a history of clients that love you that's a a great way to stay afloat and you want that so that you want kind of that base uh if you don't have clients that have trusted you in the past then it's hard to get future clients to trust you um but steven and i right now are using facebook to get clients and um that is kind of a a very new thing like that's a this year thing since we've hired this consultant and it works but basically with any social media um any profile like if you are talking about your service your expertise and kind of the pain that like the mistakes that people are making um that gets people curious it um it gets it gets them kind of interested in what you're saying and then you need a way to get people to see that and uh what we do is we go into facebook groups and you know post there and um we're going to be using facebook ads we haven't gotten there yet we're getting a lot of great feedback without doing ads right now um and so if you can same with linkedin if you can you know prime your profile like like this is what i do this is my expertise and then um go find people that are your ideal um customer and then they see like if you one of the things that you do have to do is like if you can pinpoint exactly what their needs are and pinpoint who your customer is like just the the way you can talk to them like they automat if they can automatically say like oh this is exactly what i need then you're halfway there so any other questions you're not might okay you might be on the side okay for the camera um sorry um well i was just going to add that when we first got started like you might not have that knowledge base to communicate with people a lot like i literally we printed off business cards and i was walking around to small businesses saying hey i make websites here's you know so you got to do what you got to do at the beginning to kind of build up your experience if you don't have any client work at all you could start off like talk to some small nonprofits or something and just volunteer to help them out like hey i'll build you a website for free and then you'll always have that work to refer back to you i just was making sure like there's kind of an intermediate step there where you kind of scramble around and learn what you're doing while you're trying to talk to people basically if people know they have a problem and they know that you solve it then the more people you meet that have a problem the more you're going to find that want you to solve the problem so it is kind of a numbers game where if you can just meet more people who have problems and make it make them realize like you can help them and not it doesn't have to be like a slimy sales salesy thing yeah good good is yeah um and your question was if i can sum them up for the camera um if yeah if we can it's hard to find a niche up front until we've done the work to decide we did not know our niche up front we actually we worked with a score mentor about a year and a half ago and she advised us to niche down and so that's when we started realizing okay well this is the work we enjoy doing let's let's continue to narrow it down and we spent like a year like actually narrowing down onto ecommerce we had just decided like consumer products or um and that kind of thing and a lot of that was like our own expertise that kind of developed in in what we liked to do that helped us narrow down but um i will say like if you are able to narrow down your target um your ideal customer for one like that makes it easier for them to realize that you are the one person that can help them and it also makes your work easier like if you're able to systemize the stuff that you do that means that you're able to leverage your time and charge more based on their results so you're not charging based on your deliverables and the time that you put in then then you like just having being able to repeat the work that you're doing and sell it again and again if there's any part of your process that you can do that for then you're not starting over from scratch for each client it doesn't take like 16 weeks to get it done it's it's something that you can make money and sell so niching down is actually a really um it makes it fun to be honest i mean it was fun to kind of explore our talents at first whenever we were learning like what we can do but now i i get i just enjoy being able to help more people and i can help more people if if i can sell them the same thing over and over again so yeah any other questions if um how far have you guys gotten with your coding like um only a few people have started freelance uh how many people are like doing this for fulltime like coding for a fulltime job okay yeah um so freelance is probably a little ways out there i will say that if you are able to freelance for people and start selling your services that's a really fast way to learn um because you have like an actual real life problem in front of you and if you can just you know tell your client like hey this is a learning process every every project is different so of course i'm going to be taking time to make sure that you get your results um that's a really great way to get started in freelance without feeling guilty or without feeling like you're doing this client a disservice if you can just be honest up front like hey every project is different for me um i want to take a lot of time make sure that you get the results that you want and you know maybe you give them a price that you feel is fair but if you can just get going on that like that's how you're going to learn the quickest and there's um this is a really great community like i'm sure kimberly and a lot of other people here even in this room would be here to help you um you know if you were to hit a standstill um i think teklahoma slack is also a good place to go for answers but like just this real world experience of freelance is going to push you a lot farther than you know a ninetofive job where you're doing the same thing every day having those different projects up front like learning what niche you like that's going to that's a really good first step and you know like steven was saying all it all it takes is like you know passing out a business card doesn't have to be fancy business card um just meeting some people who might need some help so yeah any other questions before i huh okay yep well thank you for having me um it's good to talk to you guys thanks
