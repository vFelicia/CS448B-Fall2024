prepare for the battle me wait a minute it's monday i started a new project the app is github battle it will be comparing two github users i'm building this project right now with the tutorial later i will style it and add additional functionalities but firstly let's build the basics today i was learning how to set up the webpack both webpack and jsx both of these things are recommended while working with react gs wait a minute right this yesterday i took part in front of malaga frankly speaking i thought i would learn much more about svg and d3 but still it was a nice introduction and simply right now i have to dig deeper into d3js and start building stuff with it the example that was presented during the meetup used for simulation it was pretty attractive but in order to understand more you simply have to get your hands dirty with the code and start building sometimes the all of these frameworks and libraries are too big and and they are not the most effective solution i'm learning a react in order to to be able to to wagon it to build bigger apps and use it when needed it's also the market that requires from you the frameworks and right now i'm practicing even the small apps in it but but the truth is that sometimes vanilla js would be the the simplest and the best option and it wouldn't wave so much so it's worth remembering while working with frameworks such as angular or such as react.js uh it's friday and the app is almost done i want to check it on various devices and browsers let's get back to work and let's start testing so this is how the app looks at the end of the week it's fully responsive on small screens uh horizontally the the home screen looks a bit differently in order to boost uh the usability the home screen is uh centered with flexbox so it's got a bit different layout than the rest of the screens you can enter two users and compare them you can start the bottle or reselect players uh let's start a bottle the loser is always a bit grayed out so i added the filter as you see here it's filter grayscale 100 and opacity is a bit lower than uh done one so it's zero seven in order to differentiate who's the winner and you can start over the game whenever a user introduces the names that are incorrect that are not present in on github they get a notification that warriors are misspelled and and they come back to player one screen so they are ready to introduce new players and start the battle the users chose the wrong players they can reselect them and start the bot i built this graphic using freepik and the whole idea for the app came from react training and that is linked here i also prevented the user from you know clicking enter going further or clicking continue without providing the username because it didn't make any sense when the players are the same the result is of course a tie so i still find it buggy to display it on edge and microsoft's internet explorer if anybody knows how to deal with it what's the problem i'm you know really open to the feedback in order to introduce the changes maybe i'll find it on my own too but so far i haven't i started working on this app on monday on the 7th of november and i started with setting up the webpack later a few comments later i styled it a bit more introduced all the functionalities additional functionalities and optimizations you will also find this link in the video description below so i will provide it for you if you uh if you want to play on the app the app is done of course you can iterate over it i want to give big shout out for react training i will put the link to their page in the video description below react training consists of much more courses this one that i was using github battle is for free so you can give it a try and later decide that you wanna buy the rest of the courses or not for me the big plus was that each step was introduced really uh in details so uh even if there was something new i didn't have to worry a lot because it was explained and and it was clearly explained the only thing missing there in this course was like setting it up to the production when i used npm run start for the development server for the local host the paths were a bit different than later in the production so i had to change that the paths in routing in order to make it work but i managed to do it so it's not a big thing next week i won't be vlogging because i will be moving out and changing flats so i hope to meet with you in two weeks time when i come back i want to work on react challenges from free code camp and i also want to practice more of vanilla javascript because still this is a thing that i want to come back to keep on doing stay motivated and see you in two weeks time you
