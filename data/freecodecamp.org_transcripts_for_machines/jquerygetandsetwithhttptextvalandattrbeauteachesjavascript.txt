jquery comes with a bunch of dom related methods that make it easy to access and manipulate elements and attributes in this video i'm going to talk about getting and setting content and attributes so we have this line that has some html here it's a paragraph tag with a link inside it and then we have a button here so i'm going to use jquery to add a click event here i'm going to use jquery to select the text within this paragraph tag so we see the id is text so i'm going to use a selector to get that so and i'm going to console.log the text so we're going to do console.log and inside the console.log i'm going to do a jquery command so we're going to select the paragraph tag because it has an id of test and then i'm going to use the dot text method this will get all the text within the paragraph tag but it will not get any html within the paragraph tag so let's see what that does so if i click show content oh i was wondering why that didn't work but i forgot to put a pound sign or a hash mark here that's how we're going to select the id to select something an idea to put this this symbol here before it so now let's try it if i click show content it's going to say learn to code with free code camp and as you can see it's not putting any of this anchor tag it's not putting a href stuff like that but if instead of doing text we put html here now it's going to show everything including any html within that so if i click show content now you can see it's going to put all this other html in here if you put text it strips out the html and just put the plain text but if you put html it's going to show all the html we can also get the attribute values so we're going to use the attr method instead of selecting test here i'm going to select the element with the fcc id so that's going to be this link up here so i'm going to get the href attribute i'm going to put attr to get the attribute and then inside the parentheses i'm going to put href let's show that and you can see down here it shows what the link is so we're getting the value from the href tag let's create another button up here instead of show content it's going to be set content and now i'm going to show you how you can actually set the con instead of just getting the text in the html you can set it for this button it's me button button2 just copy this here button2 and let's select that element with jquery okay so we've selected the test element and now we have the text method but this time we actually put something inside the parentheses when you put something inside the parentheses instead of getting the text we're setting the text so let's try that let me run that oh gotta put the parentheses there okay i'm gonna hit set content and the text changes the free code campaign is awesome so if you put html in here it's not gonna work let's show that now let's try this i'm going to do set content and it's going to actually show the the html tags right in here but if i change this into instead of text i use the html method and now here it's actually going to show up as bold okay i also want to show you how you can update the value of an input field but first i have to create an input field okay now we have this input field where you right now you can put your name and it's it's defaults to my name beau carnes so we are going to make another button where we can set the the value of the input field so i'm going to do some more copying and pasting to add a click event to this third button we're not going to set the html or anything i'm going to put button three here so this is what we're going to do we're going to use the jquery selector we're going to get the input field with the name id instead of using using text or html i'm going to do dot val to change the value okay let's try that if i click set value see the name changes to quincy larson now all three of the jquery methods i just talked about the the dot tax.html.val also come with callback functions the callback functions have two parameters so the first one is the index of the current element and the list of elements selected all the examples i showed we were only selecting one element but you can select all the paragraphs or all the links all the buttons and so you're going to get the index of what so the the callback function is going to give you the index of the current element in the list of elements and the original or old value then if you want you can return the string you wish to use as the new value from the function so let's try that up here i'm going to change this back to text so we're going to put in a callback function so remember the parameters are the index and then we're going to put a ridge text so we have the index in the original text and here's what we're going to put inside the callback function we're going to put return the old text is going to be that orig text plus we're just concatenating strings here so the new text is going to be now this we're going to get this value from down here and we're going to just take off these bold tags also to show the index we're going to put that in parentheses okay so we're now going to set the text of this to this whole thing right here so let's run that to see what happens there i'm going to click the set content button so look what it changed to old text learn to code with free code camp new text free cocaine is awesome index zero let's try something see we have two paragraph tags we have so this is the we have this paragraph and we have this paragraph what i'm going to do instead of selecting the id test i'm going to select just the paragraph tag now let's see what happens set content so look it actually just set content to both paragraph tags and it old text learn to code with free code camp new text free codecamp is awesome index zero old text name new text free codecam is awesome index one it's basically an array and the first index is zero that's the first paragraph tag and the second index is one that's the second paragraph tag but let's just change that back here so you can do that with text html method or the attribute method okay well thanks for watching my name is beau carnes
