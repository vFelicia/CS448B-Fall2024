Hello world, in this video I'll be introducing interval notation and talk about some common sets. This will lay the foundation for the next video on set builder notation. The beauty of interval notation is that allows us to officially described all numbers between two values. Suppose we want to say that the variable X is between Zero and 1. Well, we could do just that we can say that X is an element of the interval Zero, 1. Or, which is really saying X is greater than Zero and X is less than 1. Likewise, if we wanted to say that X is greater than or equal to Zero and X is less than 1 then we have to switch this to a square bracket. All we're doing is we're now including the number Zero in the interval. Also we can include Zero and we can also include 1 in the interval by using square brackets on both sides. So it's greater than or equal and less than or equal to. And now talk about some common sets, the first one being the null set, which is the same thing as the empty set, which is just there are no elements contained within the set and this will come in handy future. The funny N here is the natural numbers, which is the set containing elements 1, 2, 3, and then these thre e dots here called an ellipsis, which tells us that the pattern continues. So, N is the set containing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 all the way up to infinity. This funny N with a Zero is the natural numbers, however it includes the value Zero within the set. So it's 0, 1, 2 in the ellipsis tells us all the way to infinity in an integer Zero, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And finally, we have all the integers positive and negative and non which is Zero, negative 1, negative 2 all the way down to negative infinity, and Zero, 1, 2, 3, 4, all the way up to infinity.
