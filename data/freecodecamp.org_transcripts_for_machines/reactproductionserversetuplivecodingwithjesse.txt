hey everybody sorry about that I didn't realize the stream was was already up uh it's Jesse and if you haven't watched before this this show is just about me doing my work I'm a frontend developer and I want to show my normal work and and you'll see all my mistakes and everything and just get an idea for what it's like for a frontend developer to work at least for me today we have a very ambitious plan we want to set up from scratch a digital ocean droplet a server to be able to run react I not I'm almost positive there's no way I can get this down in a half an hour so hey guys everybody saying hi in the live chat so I have two options either I split this up and do it over two days so today and tomorrow or I can just try to do an extra long video today and try to get it all done so I think it'll probably depend on how many people are watching at the end of a half an hour if there's a lot of viewers Maybe just keep going if it's kind of dropping off then we'll see maybe I'll split it up into two videos uh but either way I need to have it done because I'd like to have something up and running to show uh the people that I'm making the site for uh to show them what's going on and to test it uh working with the API where all the content is going to come from okay so uh we have opposing viewpoints in the live chat someone's saying split it up into two videos someone's saying make it work today all right we'll see I'll I'll think about it we'll see how far we get uh if if we're close if we're close to being done then maybe maybe we'll go a little bit longer but if I think it's going to take like an extra hour then maybe I'll split it up uh so I haven't set up a server in this way in probably maybe like three months so uh we'll see I'll be a little rusty so before we start real quick uh the site this site that I'm working on now is probably going to launch May 25th is the official launch date now unless that changes uh after that I'm going to start doing tutorial videos on my channel the link is in the description uh I'll do all the live stream still on free code camp and then I'll just throw the tutorial videos on my own channel I had a lot of suggestions for different things to do tutorials on so I'm I'm keeping a list of everything that you all suggest in the live chat or in the comments and I'd like to uh do some short very focused videos on each one of those topics all right uh the rest of the week in case you haven't seen this yet I've showed it the last couple of of videos uh tomorrow is also a different time than normal it's going to be 1130 a.m. sorry about the time change this is just because I have so many meetings today and tomorrow Wednesday I will be traveling to a conference to syntax conon so I don't know if I'll be able to live stream or when so I'll just put it on Twitter when I'm going to live stream and I think you'll get an alert if you're subscribed to free code Camp uh if you want to get the uh the Tweet as well then uh follow me on Twitter the link to my Twitter account is also in the description and then Thursday and Friday I'll be at syntax conon I did get permission from the people with syntax conon to record and live stream as long as the speakers are cool with it so I have some ideas for what to do but I want to know what you want to see okay so I'm I'm going to this syntax con uh they're going to have frontend stuff backend stuff and uh some talks on different platforms so let me know I was thinking maybe I could do interviews with some of the speakers or even some of other people there maybe I could just do quick Recaps of the sessions that I go to and just show some of the highlights so I'm not really sure what you want to see what would be you know realistic to do I'm also not really sure how good the WiFi is going to be so they might be prerecorded videos instead of live streams but let me know in the live chat or in the comments what you would like to see as long as you comment before you know Thursday morning uh then I I'll be able to read it and hopefully uh do whatever you guys you know want me to do whatever you want to see all right so let's get started since we have a lot to do I'm going to be neglecting the live chat slightly more than usual today because there's so much to do and I don't want to miss a step because it could could mess things up all right cool somebody said just start bro all right so I want to start this from scratch so I I did the very first step beforehand I'll just show you what that was I logged on to digital ocean I already have an account on digital ocean I just went in I clicked create droplet and I came to this screen we're selecting Ubuntu 16.04 we've chosen the $5 a month droplet we can always scale this up later if we get a lot of traffic but for now this should work uh and then you can pick uh New York data centers are closest to my location so that's what I pick I've added the um IPv6 networking I forgot to click the monitoring which I should have you can always add it in later but it's a little bit harder so I would recommend just clicking the monitoring I didn't need any of this other stuff for right now I already have my SSH Keys added in here and these are some of the SSH keys for my colleagues so um if you don't have these added in you can add them in later on after you've created the droplet and then you just give it a name and you click create and it's as easy as that and then you have your droplet up and running so this is my droplet now so I can get my IP address and log into the droplet the first step to log in is simply to put in in the in your terminal SSH and then root at and then you put in your IP address okay assuming that you had your SSH Keys set up already then it logs you in and and you're good to go uh I'm not going to go over the SSH key things since I already had them set up but I definitely recommend using it I'll probably do a video on it at some point because it's it's pretty important you you use it a lot uh but it saves you from having that passwords in fact we're going to completely disable passwords on the server and just have uh you know have the SSH keys and it'll just make it a little bit more secure uh since there'll be no way to log in with the password so if you want to follow along I always use the instructions on digital ocean to set this up when I go through it doesn't matter how many times I do it if you miss a step then things might not work right or it might be bad for security so I always just follow along a lot of the steps I I remember and I could do pretty quickly but I don't want to trust that to memory I have the links in the description first we're going to install uh well we're going to set up Ubuntu it's already installed and then we're going to move on to engine X and then we'll see how far we can go maybe we'll get to node after that but the first two uh tutorials are linked in the description all right so I am now on step two if you want to follow along and we're going to create a user because we don't want to log in as root all the time so we actually are pretty much never going to use root again after we create this other user so I'm just going to go add users sometimes I'm going to type them out sometimes I'm just going to copy and paste them I don't think there's anything wrong with copying and pasting things into the terminal because you know one one mistake in the command doesn't work so for longer commands copying pasting is the way to go and I'm just going to make the user Jesse it can be anything it's going to ask you for password this is not the login password it's going to ask you for some of your info you don't really need to fill this out if you're in uh kind of a bigger organization maybe you might want to fill this out so people know who you are it's primarily going to be me logging in and working on this so it doesn't really matter I'll just put my name okay so now that user is set up and we need to give that user root privileges okay so that password that we just typed in that's not your login password remember there will be no login password it's just going to be SSH keys to get in this password is going to be what you use when you try to use pseudo which means basically this user called Jesse is going to have privileges to do things that only root can normally do I'll need to run the command pseudo to be able to do those things as if I were the root user and I'm going to need that password so if anybody were to ever somehow get on my machine so they had my SSH key and be able to log in as uh as Jesse as me they would still need to know my password to actually do anything as the root user and generally root commands are I mean they could mess up your whole server you can do anything as root so it's a added layer of security it's slightly annoying to have to retype your password but it's definitely uh it's definitely better to have that that little bit of security I don't recommend having no password for that i' I've never tried to do that but I assume it's possible okay so now we're going to give the Privileges I'm going to copy and paste this so the example name they're using in the digital ocean instructions is Sammy so I'm just need to change Sammy to Jesse okay and now that user has uh pseudo privileges if you're following along with me we're going to skip step four because I've I've already done this earlier so if you haven't set up your SSH Keys then you will need to do step four if you are using digital ocean I recommend you know set those up so that you can use them in the the actual creation of the droplet and it'll save you some time so we're skipping all the way to step five and this is optional but recommended we're going to disable password authenication so I don't I don't want anybody to be able to use a password to log into the server so what I'm going to do before that is I'm actually going to log out of the root user let's see I think exit there we go so I just typed exit that logs me out and now I'm going to SSH back in but I'm going to change from root to Jesse and it denied my public no I guess I skipped a step this is the point of doing this live so you see when I mess up and hopefully you don't feel bad as you when you mess up I've already done it I'm going to scroll up quickly and see what I missed oh okay I'm I'm pretty sure I need to add my public key uh to a file in the root directory for that user so good thing I didn't disable the root yet which we will do but because I need to get back in there so what I'm going to do is as the root user I'm going to switch to Jesse so i' I've actually went from roote and now I'm it's as if I am this user uh briefly I'll I'll be this user now I'm automatically in the home directory for this user so we can see the directory we're in so home Jesse and we're going to make a directory for our SSH key so we've just made this directory and now we're going to change the the Privileges for that directory that's what the uh what this command does and we'll change it back to put that kind of lock that down after we we first we first put that in okay so we use Nano so we're going to use Nano okay so if you're not familiar with Nano it's just an editor that you can use in a terminal uh Some people prefer Vim that's a little bit more complicated I'm not really good with it maybe one day I'll I'll take some more time to practice but Nano is the the simplest editor so if you're new uh use use Nano uh it's it's pretty easy okay so what I need to do now is to insert my public key so here's what I'm going to do I'm going to now I have to actually go to my public key should just take me a second find my public key actually let's see sorry for the delay I'm doing this on my other monitor just so that I don't accidentally show the world something that they shouldn't see in terms of passwords or anything like that uh so as soon as I get this I will switch back over and start running some commands again all right okay all right so what I've done done offscreen is I went through the command line uh I went to my SSH folder for my local user on my machine and I found the public key file and I just copied and pasted that public key into this folder here uh when you're done with with Nano the way you exit out is I just press controll X and it'll ask if I want to save I type why I hit enter it ask me what file name I want I obviously wanted to keep the same name so I hit enter so in case you haven't used Nano it's it's pretty easy now what we tried to do a minute ago should work all right I just glanced at the live chat I'm going to answer this question real quick because I think it's important uh someone says is this the work of a friend and developer technically no I I guess like you might consider this like devop stuff I mean correct me if that's not really the right term but uh what will happen is if you're a freelancer you'll probably have to do this stuff if you are working in a small team at a company somewhere you'll probably have to do this stuff uh if if there's no other person dedicated to this kind of thing you will have to do it at some point if you ever want your site to be you know live on a a real server somewhere you'll have to do some something like this so it's good to know not exactly uh frontend developer work but it's you know it's something that you probably should learn how to do because you you may need to do it all right so now let's attempt to do what we did before and that is let's exit and we need to exit twice remember because we went into the the user account with the name of Jesse from root so now we're back in route and we want to get all the way out to my local machine now I'm in my local machine and I'm going to type Jesse if you're wondering uh no oh no this is uh an epic fail guys ah I know exactly what I did I skipped to step sorry guys not a great day today I'm much better in the afternoons if you've watch my other streams they're usually in the afternoons uh all right so remember we we kind of relaxed the permissions on this file and we never restricted them I'm guessing that may have something to do with the reason why this isn't working so we're going to go back into that user and I'm going to check and make sure okay we do have that directory so that that's there okay we do have the authorized keys I'm just going to double check to make sure that the key is there that's why I'm going to move off the screen briefly not that anybody could probably use my public key if they because they won't have a private key but just in case there's some way I don't know about to do something bad with that key I'm I'm doing it off screen okay I'm checking this file at right now it I have the key Okay so all that seems it seems right and so now I'm just going to reset this back to what it should be and we're going to type exit okay and I'm actually going to copy this let's see I'm going to copy this and just try it over here so I don't have to log out again in case it doesn't work ah it's not working again anybody see anybody out there do you see what I'm missing uh this is the first time this has ever happened to me I've set up servers like this several times uh in the past uh six months or So and I've never had this happen so what we can do that I don't normally do is I can just continue on as the root user and do some of these things and I will try to figure out what is wrong later on I'm just I'm I'm double checking my um huh yeah just double checking the directions real quick yeah oh well I didn't miss anything not sure what's happening I suppose it's like some simple thing that I just I'm not seeing so what we'll do is we'll continue as the root user and go as far as we can as the root user and we're almost up to half an hour anyway so I'd hope to be farther along but this is a good example of how things really work sometimes sometimes you go to do something you've done before and it's always worked before and now it doesn't work and you can't figure it out so I'm sure anybody that's been a developer for any length of time has experienced something like this so so is it somebody asked if it's free to try digital ocean no but you can usually find some digital ocean credit so uh yeah all right so somebody mentioned the GitHub student pack gives free credits just search online for um a code to have get free free time on digital ocean you'll find it I think I found something that was like $25 free but usually you can at least find1 or $15 somewhere um I think I can give out a link that'll give you at least $10 but I mean if you want me to send you the link that's fine uh let me know but I think you can find an even better one uh like at least maybe 15 to 25 out there if you uh take the time to look okay so the last thing that we at least can do is I can show you how to disable passwords on your server normally you would do this you can do this as root user but normally after I set up the other user I never use root again and I disable root but obviously I can't do that right now since I can't get that other user working so what I've done let me uh I I've typed in or I've copied and pasted in uh Nano I've opened the sdore config file so that's what we're in this is the our configuration file for SSH login basically and we're going to find the line that talks about password authentication so let's see what is it at did I pass it up probably there we go okay password authentication oh it's actually defaulted to no probably because I H I don't know why it defaulted to no I've done it before and it's been defaulted to yes so we don't have to change that but there are a few other things that we want to change so since we want to do authentication just with the keys we need to check we'll just check these other things out they may already be set when I've sometimes when I've done this in the past these actually have been set to different values so maybe um maybe the defaults have changed so we want to check public key authentication and make sure that that is set to yes sorry I have the font so big it's I can't see the the whole file so I'm doing a lot of scrolling around let's make sure there we go okay public key authentication we need it set to yes and we want to set challenge response authentication to no or at least make sure that it's set to know okay there we go challenge response authentication no that's all we need so let's get out of this by pressing contrl X if you haven't made any changes in Nano when you hit control X it doesn't ask you to save the changes or anything you'll just it'll take you right out okay we didn't really change anything but if we had we would want to do this I'll show you the command in a second we want to reload the system if we had so we'll go ahead and do it just to show you uh and this is the command that you'll want to use okay and then any changes you had would take effect after you've you've done that so the next step if you're following along on the digital ocean uh instructions is actually to test the uh the login for your new user we've tested it several times it won't work so so we're just going to skip to the next step and I'll fix this later on and what we're going to do now is set up a basic firewall so first we can check to see what's going on right now with our firewalls so we have open SSH running or that's available um we want to allow this so we're going to type in ufw allow op SSH we obviously need this to work or we can't log in all right so we've allowed that the rules are updated now we need to enable our firewall so really simple ufw enable Okay so now our firewall command May disrupt existing connections yeah that's fine okay um it always says that but I've never actually had a connection disrupted now we want to check to make sure it's running so we can just type ufw status and it will show we do have our firewall running but we have our open SSH and the V6 for the IPv6 allowed okay so that that lets us log in later on not today but maybe tomorrow's tutorial uh we'll add to this list but for now this is all we need and that takes us to the end of the first guide we've set up Ubuntu next step is to set up engine X that's going to be our reverse proxy at some point and uh we'll go over that probably tomorrow because I don't want to keep going without having this user account uh working I need to figure out why that's not working working so now what I'm going to do is since the uh the half hour is up I'm going to take just maybe a few more minutes I'm going to check out the live chat and see if I can answer any of your questions somebody said now try logging in I guess we could yeah I mean it it couldn't hurt let's go back over here let's go to log in still denied I'm like I'm thinking I might have done something really dumb like put in a space somewhere in in either the the key file or when I added the user and that's what's messing me up because in terms of the steps we took if you were following along we we we hit all the steps the only thing we skipped was actually creating the key which we didn't need to do since we already had one created so um the only other thing I could think of is it's possible I accidentally copied the wrong key I don't want to go through that again uh that I don't think that would be a good use of of your time uh for watching this to just watch me try to copy thing something again so I'll do that after the video and for now let me try to answer some of your questions and also if anybody uh kind of shouted out where they're from I'll read that out too so we have somebody from the Philippines okay somebody asked for a page that should set up a react from scratch uh links in an overall page please yeah maybe I don't know if I've set everything up from scratch already in the live stream it could be possible to go back a few live streams and see that uh as I said I think in the beginning I I really do want to do some very uh focused short tutorials on each one of these steps that I kind of do in my live stream but we go through kind of quickly so those are coming probably not until sometime in June somebody recommended uh Tyler mcginness for his react courses says they're for beginners and they're free that's cool if I get a chance I might check that out too thank you for the the advice okay somebody said you created the user but not put in any key I I actually I put in the key but I put it in on my other monitor but I'm I'm going to put it in again just to make sure I did everything right and I I put in the right key after this video I may just start completely from the beginning someone said they're scared of using the commands still stuck in the old school FTP once you get used to the commands it's you get more comfortable with it especially when you know I first set up this server there's really nothing on it if I completely messed This Server up I would just shut down the droplet and start again and in fact if I can't figure out what I did to mess up this user account I probably will just shut down the droplet and start again um hopefully I don't have to do that but that's kind of the best time you know play with some of these commands on a fresh server or even on your local machine if you can and uh and just get used to him there you know don't don't try him out for the first time on a really important live project but uh once you get used to them they're nice and once again these aren't off the top of my head I'm following the instructions because I don't trust my memory uh for this you know for these type of things for the initial setup I won't I don't trust it to memory oh cool somebody from Phoenix Arizona says first time they got to watch the live stream they've been watching the replays so uh cool yeah maybe the different time worked out better for some people someone from Nepal is watching awesome someone says it's the first time they're watching a server setup well that's cool I wish it would have went a little bit better does the SSH key generated on the local machine work on the remote server well yeah that's so basically the way it works is you generate the key on your local machine on your local machine then get saved your private key and your public key what you want the uh the server to have is the public key so then that public key gets matched up with your private key but basically you never send your private key anywhere that only stays on your your local machine uh and then that's how the keys are matched up so you can see it's I mean it's a pretty secure setup Ian someone would would basically have to actually be on your machine to be able to uh to get in you know through that way okay somebody uh suggested using a virtual machine to play around with even if you break it you can reset it that is great advice yeah and then you don't even have to spend any money on a droplet or anything virtual machine you just set up for free what he said okay somebody uh mentioned I can't see your terminal too well but check that you copied the entire contents of your public key so uh that's what I'm kind of thinking that might be the the problem maybe I I didn't get everything copied uh maybe I was just trying to do it too quickly didn't get it all copied now that I think about that that's probably the most likely solution all right someone says I love the designing and developing rather than setup yeah uh setup it's something that you have to do if you don't have anybody else uh working on I actually had somebody else set up the other server that'll host the WordPress site so uh they set that up for me which is awesome uh I just kind of wanted to do this on camera instead of have uh somebody else do it so that you guys could see it in case you've never seen it before and then we'll get back to the designing and developing stuff after we we get this set up okay someone suggested the Ubuntu forums uh topic permission Deni public key error I'll check that out I'm going to try to copy the key over one more time if that doesn't work I'm definitely going to check that out on the forums uh someone says subscribe to me so monster minor MC says subscribe to me that's not an endorsement I'm just reading it out I don't really know what their channel is is about I guess Minecraft no okay someone asked we're not done with with next and react are we no we're definitely not done we've just gotten to the point where I need to set up the server where this will eventually be housed when it's live I need to set it up put something on there test it out uh get the domain pointed at least the test domain so uh because if we're going to launch this next Thursday I like to have all this set up well in advance in case well something like this happens and I I mess it up so I don't want to put that off until the last minute somebody else said check the pubkey file uh contents that's I'm pretty sure that is the problem someone's from neple someone from India Argentina Holland Brazil Poland Thailand another one from Brazil all right I love it that you guys are you know from all over the place from Jersey in the united the United Kingdom Channel Islands that's cool uh I'm in the United States and when someone says jersey in the United States I always think of the state New Jersey and uh forgetting that it's called New Jersey because there was an original jersey in the UK oh someone says the GitHub student pack was denied oh man yeah check how did I get it uh Microsoft has some sort of developer program that's that's free I got a pretty good code from that one so uh check that one out I forget what it's called for sure but if you type in something like Microsoft developer program if you type that into Google then uh I'm sure it'll come up someone rapael balini has put his email in here in case uh anybody wants him for a freelance job once again that's not an endorsement I've I've never seen his work before but he's put it on there someone asks if there's any way I can practice locally or free online yeah locally I mean you can practice some terminal commands locally on your machine in terms of server setup you you probably will need to run uh like a virtual server if you install Docker you can do some of this in Docker so um You probably you'll need some tutorials to to get used to Docker first but I would check check that out and then you know you can just do whatever you want on the server if you mess it up no big deal because it's just a virtual server anyway so we have someone from Saudi Arabia bellarus see someone mentions virtual box to do the virtual server so you can do server virtual machine so good uh all good suggestions someone says it's my first time watching live in your video channel awesome yeah maybe it's not such a bad thing that I had to do this at a different time of day and now some you know different people get to watch it live when maybe they couldn't otherwise what if my hard drive dies and I lose my SSH Keys why I be able to log in digital ocean does have a way to uh to log in so let me did I I wonder if I closed my my screen with digital ocean I think I did no I have it here I'll show you real quick um let me see I can't remember where it is there is some somewhere sorry guys I wanted to show you but now that I look I can't remember where it is because I've never had to use it there is somewhere on this admin panel for digital ocean there is a spot where you can reset the root password okay you got Brian seore said Brian seore is the guy that set up my WordPress server he's a colleague of mine here so he said you can reset your root password in digital ocean and you can actually Lo use a terminal right there in the browser from your digital ocean panel so you can still get in that way this somebody asked if this will be saved at the channel later it will about five minutes after I stop uh broadcasting it should be saved as a video so you can watch the whole thing or pause or you know whatever you need to if I went too fast someone cheeseburger says Jesse we have to cook so I'm not sure about that actually I I do really like to cook I post pictures of my food on Instagram from time to time so if you like to see pictures of food you can check out my Instagram but uh I don't think I'll be doing any cooking shows anytime soon so we have somebody from uh New York City oh also Brian seiso recommend c9.io so it's Cloud9 uh I forgot about that yeah that will give you like Cloud development environment where there's a server set up so you can test those commands as well Windows Linux subsystem is easy to set up all right so we we have a lot of great suggestions if you want to test out your skills with the command line in in a environment like a live server all right and I've got to the end of the uh live chat if you uh wanted to ask something you didn't get a chance to or you just didn't want to ask in front of everybody uh you can either direct message me on Twitter or if you don't care if everybody sees your question just put it in the comments below this video if you want to see how we got to this point check out my previous videos either on free code camp or on my own channel there's a link in the description I will see you tomorrow at the same time we did today so 1130 a.m. eastern time thanks for watching uh have a great day he
