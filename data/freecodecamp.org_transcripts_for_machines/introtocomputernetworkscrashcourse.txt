hi i'm murali from free code cam today we are going to talk about what is a network so before we answer that question let's take the example of two people who are trying to communicate with each other so what happens here when one person talks he's creating vibrations in the air which is the medium and these vibrations reach the other party and that's how two people communicate so one person talks and the vibrations travel through the medium and reach the other person who is listening now in case of two computers how do they talk they don't have mouths yet or they can't create vibrations in their in the air so how do they talk so here what we have to do is we need to create some sort of connection between these two computers so a connection between two or more computers or more devices to communicate between them is called a network so how do we build a network there are multiple ways you can create a network the easiest way is to buy a simple wireless router and connect all of your devices to that in this example we have connected the desktop and printer using cables and we have connected the laptop using the wireless connection so these three devices can talk among each other easily using the wireless router so we have just created a network a lan is a local area network so what does it mean imagine you have your home and you have your own wireless router you got your desktop connected your laptop connector and a printer connected to this router and your neighbor has a similar setup he has his home router a desktop is connected and he's got two laptops and they're all in their own network so now what happens is this network which is in your home is a lan it is local to your home and this particular network in your neighbor's house is a different land so these two are two different local area networks we are going to talk about an important device in networking called a network interface card or nick so before we talk about that i want to give you an example of how humans communicate now imagine we have three different people john bob and mary how do they talk when you're talking you're using your mouth so you're transmitting information using the mouth and the other person is receiving the information through their ears now how do computers you know talk or listen they have a device called network interface card which acts as the ear and the mouth of the computer so that's how computers talk through the network interface card now imagine you want to connect devices across multiple cities or multiple continents now that's a huge network and that kind of network is called a van in this to explain this let's take an example of an office campus you can have multiple buildings you know multiple floors you have multiple computers in this different floors so how do you connect them you take a router and put it in each floor connect all the computers in in that floor to that particular router and you take a bigger router and you connect all of your routers to that and that's how you can create a small van what is a mac address let me remind you this has got nothing to do with the big mac or the mac operating system now before we get into the details let me give you an analogy now we have three people john bob and mary in a room who want to talk now john when he wants to talk to mary he says hi mary how are you doing now when mary listens to this message how does she know that she has to respond to john it's through his voice so she she replies to john but not bob saying hey john i'm doing good now if you have three different computers who want to talk to each other they don't have any names so to bring the analogy of names and identification to computers we have this concept of mac address which is unique to each computer's network interface card just like humans have names which are composed of alphabets we have hexadecimals for representing the mac addresses a mac address is 6 bytes long or 48 bits it is usually represented in this format you have 1 2 3 4 5 6 bytes which are separated by a colon or you can write two bytes together and separated by a dart we will see how computers talk before we do that i would like to give you an analogy of how people talk in this room we have john bob and mary and when john wants to talk to mary he says hi mary this is john how are you doing now when they are in the same room they are sharing the same medium which is the air and all all of them bob and mary hear to this message but only mary responds because it's addressed to mary in the same way when computers want to talk they share a medium in this example all these three computers are sharing a cable this is how networks were built in the past so you have nic cards for each of these computers and they have their own mac addresses now let's say if a wants to talk to b what a does is it sends a message to b which looks similar to this hey b you know you use the mac address to address b this is a talking and here is my message how are you doing now when this message is put on this medium everybody on this medium can listen to it so in this case b and c can listen to this message now what happens is when c looks at this message it sees that it's addressed to b so it just silently ignores it and b when it gets this message it sees that oh this message is at rest to me so let me reply and when it decides to reply what b does is i want to know who is talking so it looks at the original message and sees oh it's a who is talking so it says hey a this is b and the actual message i'm doing good that's how computers talk let's imagine there's a room and there are like three different people and when two people are talking the third person if he tries to talk the conversation becomes difficult for the other two people in the same way let's say we have three different computers on the same network now if a was talking to b and c suddenly transmits data to a there is a collision and when this collision happens the original message from a to b becomes garbage it's of no use anymore because there is interference so when there is a collision that happens a detects it and it backs off before it tries to send the message back to b again so this was in the original days of the networking but later what happened is they added the concept of collision avoidance so in that what happens is see before it actually starts sending data to a it tries to see if there is a conversation going on already before it sends so that's ca or collision avoidance
