switch statements the switch statement is a basic control structure used to perform different actions based on different conditions it's in most programming languages and let me give you an example you always start with the word switch and then you're going to put what you're going to check against so i'm going to check against this new date get day and this is going to give you a number for the day of the week and now you're going to check then you're going to put the word case and then you're going to put what the value is case 0 if new date that get day is zero day equals sunday and break and when you break it that means it's going to go it's going to be done with the rest of the code here and just go to the end of this the switch statement case one if new date dot get day equals one then day is going to equal monday break that means it's going to go to the end and so on now if you don't have the word break there it will just go on to the next case but when you do have the word break it's going to go all the way to the end so let me add some more things here first i'm going to say let day to create the the day variable and then at the end i'm going to say console.log day and if i run that you can see friday i'm making this video on a friday let me give you an example of a different k switch statement but this time we're going to create an animal giraffe now the switch statement we're going to pass in the animal so we're passing in this variable which happens to be giraffe and there's going to be a few different cases now here you can see that i have cases right one after the other case cow case giraffe case dog case pig and something to look at is that they don't say break until down here so no matter which of these animals it ends up matching with it just keeps going down until you get to where it says console.log and it's going to console.log this this animal will go on noah's ark and then it's going to break and when it breaks it goes down to the bottom it's no thick switch statement but then if it's k spoon it's going to console that log a spoon is on animal break that means it's going to go to the end case dinosaur or default console.log this and will not be on the arc now default means else so if what's being tested does not match any of the cases it's going to go to default so whether it's dinosaur or whether it's anything else it's going to count with that log this will and will not go on the arc so let's try that i'm going to run that and it's going to say this animal not go on the ark because of the giraffe if we change this to spoon and we run that a spoon is not an animal if we change this to chicken and then we run that this animal will not be on the arc because that's the default and if we had put dinosaur it would also go to the default well that's the switch statement thanks for watching my name is beau carnes check the description for links to more information please subscribe and remember use your code for good
