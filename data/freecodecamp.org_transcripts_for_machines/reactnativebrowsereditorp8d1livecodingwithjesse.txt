hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse uh i'm jesse and i'm really sorry for the stream starting late i started up my computer and i was i couldn't connect to the internet uh it said there are no networks which i was connected on all my other devices so that was weird and then once i did get connected i realized that like i was logged out of everything and had to use like my twofactor authentication to get back in so sorry about that uh but now we're up and running and it's been a while so hey everyone uh sorry it's been so long things have been a little bit uh wild for me lately i've been speaking at some conferences and all the talks that i've done are available so um i guess if you want let me know i could give you some links to those uh also i bought a new house and moved in my new house and you already knew that because i i did get moved in before i did my last stream but i've been getting the old house ready to sell so i've been spending time over there cleaning and fixing and moving stuff so uh things have been wild also just want to mention this briefly since i know uh there's there's some of you that are also dealing with this my depression got a little bit rough lately and when i get real depressed then it's hard to do anything let alone live stream so um i want to be totally honest and say that was also part of the reason why i haven't been streaming lately just super hard to get up in the morning when you're like that you know but uh i think i'm i'm getting i'm getting better now so um so enough about me uh let's get let's get to this so we have a new project i'm really excited about this so let me tell uh whoa i got a lot of a lot of chats let me check let me say hello to everybody in the in the chat right now and just let you know that i will get to the chat and read all your comments and um and try to answer all your questions i'm going to take a little break a little later on and do that so if you're talking to me in the chat um i'm not ignoring you at least not for that long and i will get to it so just hang in there um okay so here's the back story behind this project because it was a little unexpected but i think it's going to be really awesome and helpful to the the whole free code camp community so um i was at um ndc minnesota so it's a norwegian developers conference in minnesota and i was lucky enough to be able to speak there uh and i gave a talk about react native and using react native web um like we were doing with with this last project that's going to be just on pause slightly so we're not i'm not abandoning that project i'm just pausing it to work on something which i think is more important right now so after the talk um gwen faraday who's a big contributor to free code camp came up to me and was was talking to me about react native web and she's been working on a react native curriculum for free code camp so if you're not if you haven't checked it out yet on freecodecamp.org there's a ton of lessons on all different types of coding it's it's primarily javascript based but you know you can learn a lot of stuff on there so anyway we already have a curriculum you know about react and redux but we don't have react native yet so she's already built out this amazing curriculum on react native but there's one problem you can't easily run react native in the browser editor so if you haven't seen it before let me just show you how this works i was going to explain it to you but now it seems like i could just show you and it would be so much better so uh let's see if it'll let me sign in quickly there we go all right so we'll go to the curriculum this is um available to everybody right so uh i want to see one that already has stuff written in it so we can see how it works so let me go and go back here and i'll just go to one that's really easy i think the cat app is here all right this one's super easy to understand hello world goes here so you write your code here you could write you know whatever you want let's put an h2 in here right so this part is your code editor in the middle and then over here it automatically shows what you're writing right now html is easy because this is a browser and browsers are on html and even regular react is easy because it's just a javascript framework it runs in in the browser but react native is different this react native is designed to run primarily on mobile devices right so you you can't just do this and have it work over here um so that was that was the issue so uh um gwen and i tried to work on that at the conference and see like could we get this to work and there didn't seem to be an easy way to do it so i said well why don't i try to do this as part of my live stream because i think this would be kind of a cool a cool thing to to work on uh because i think some of what we were doing in the last project will be helpful here namely react native web right so react native web takes react native code and changes it into code that the browser can read and that's exactly what we need here okay but there's one issue that that and that's the one we need to fix right is that with react native web sorry just noticed my camera was like cutting off my head but with react native web like we're running that on our local machine right we have like webpack going and all that so there's things that we have locally that we don't really have in the browser so that's the technical challenge that we need to get around all right so hopefully that wasn't too long of an intro and if it's still confusing i think it'll be less confusing once we get into it so fortunately someone else has already done a lot of the work for this there's an open source project out there that we can start with and try to figure out how we can adapt it to work with free code camp so that's the place that i think we should start so let me get the urls react native web player all right so i'm gonna go react native web oops player okay so there is a project on github let's view the license real quick just to make sure bsd are committed saying the above copyright noticed all right um so what we're gonna do so i was just checking out out the license sorry i didn't explain that i wanted to make sure the license was not restricting us in terms of like not being able to use this so this is bsd license redistribution use in source and binary forms with or without modification are permitted provide the following conditions are met so we got to keep the copyright notice and documentation all right so we can't use facebook or it's contributors to endorse or promote this which it's actually kind of odd that it has facebook in it but anyway um that's that's the license so we should be good we just got to make sure we uh provide attribution right so let me show you what this project does uh let me make this bigger all right so on the left we have react native okay so um we're bringing in all these from react native so we're importing some components and we're using those react native components which normally would not work uh you know by default on the web but over here we could see that it's it's showing up and it's changing see um like on the fly is changing i just deleted some characters and it changes this is exactly what we want okay um the only issue is the way we implement this is it's basically like a whole package right so it wouldn't fit in with the free code camp ui right the way it's set up now but we we want it to fit in like that okay so my there's two options given here we can import that web player like if we're using react we just do the import otherwise we can do an iframe so i have two approaches here to make this work the first one is maybe we can try to import this and work it into the ui and see it if that works like see if we can override styles and things like that enough to make this work i'd say that's probably the faster way the easier way to to do it the other way which we may have to do is look at how this is happening right and kind of pull out the core functionality from this uh from this repo and put it into free code camp so those are my approaches if anybody has any other ideas that i'm missing here let me know but for now i think we got we at least have a plan okay um i do want to let you know like how this basically like this the key to this working is um basically like uh a web worker and let me see where it's at oh no that's sorry i don't know why i opened the desk so i'm not going to go through here i i don't know which file is it the bible worker yeah this is it i was right in front of me the whole time okay so a web worker is like a it's a file in um it's a javascript file that runs in your browser but it's almost like a separate i don't know if this is exactly the right turn but term but it's almost like a separate thread right uh that you can run things in so like you send stuff to this file it can do computations and send it back uh to the browser so i believe that this type of thing right being able to transform things on the fly this is the key uh to how this is working right so if we need to pull functionality out it's gonna be some of this stuff okay but like i said hopefully we can get it to work the other way around uh so now let's check out the actual free code cam repo actually let's check out gwen's all right let's check this out so so gwen faraday has her own fork of free code camp where she's been working on this and that's where we're going to work from because that's where she has all her her updated stuff so let me make sure i'm there i'm on the right branch so let me um once i get it to the right place i'll copy and paste the link so you all can can check it out as well and uh i'll check let me copy and paste the react native web player link for you too i'm gonna have to update the description to this video with all the links later on so hopefully i don't forget to do that for everyone watching later okay there is a react native branch here so react native challenges all right so there's two of them let me make sure this is ready yeah react native challenges okay so i think the react native challenges branch is where we want to go go off of okay and so let's see here is the full link i'm gonna give about maybe like four more minutes and then i'm gonna take a break and answer some questions uh in the chat okay so let's find our curriculum and challenges go english and these are the react native challenges or i'm sorry this is these are all the challenges and we're gonna find the react native ones okay so this is a separate um at least right now it's organized like as this whole separate section so it's section 10. and let's find one class component all right let's find this class component one let's see if this would be a good one to try okay all right yeah this one seems like it's i want to i want to do a simple challenge so that like basically we don't run the risk of messing things up because we mess up the challenge right i want it to be as simple as possible um so this is just rendering a basic component right a basic class component okay all right and we can run this so we'll definitely need to run this project so i'm gonna open this up it's in another tab so we don't lose this one and hopefully we'll go to the directions here when you go to um work on like a repo you've never worked on before you should always check out the documentation first like the readme and there's usually some sort of instructions on how to get started did i miss the contributing there we go here's the contributing so we're gonna have to we're gonna make a fork of this right we'll create a new branch okay so this is going to be a little bit weird because we're we're creating a fork of a fork essentially so like then we're going to submit the pull request to gwen and then if it works for her then it'll be incorporated into her stuff and then she can submit the pull request to free code cam so this is like one extra step from normally doing it but uh that's that's how we have to do it uh for now okay uh so name the branch oh this is is um pretty basic etiquette for uh for pull requests this is what i really wanted to see um was i'm feeling so okay so we're using gulp and bower all right okay and we're gonna have to do the the database okay there's gonna be some cool setup that we'll have to go through here all right but that's fine all right step one let's create a fork oh so we can let's leave this open the contributor guide let's create the fork here make sure we're in staging let's fork that hey i already forgot three code camp all right then i don't want a fork i don't think i forked it from glenn's though actually this this might be a good um i don't know if you can fork based on the branch or if i could pull down a branch how about i delete mine let's do that so oops i forked this a long time ago i don't even want to mess with updating it so i'm just going to delete it all right danger zone delete all right now let's fork this whoops i'm still on jesse i go free code camp but i don't afford that there we go all right there we go all right so while that's working now is a great time for me to stop well i guess that i guess that was really fast but i do want to go back to the chat so i said i would stop and go back to the chat so i'm going to stop now answer some questions in the chat and then we'll get back to this next step is um actually pulling this down and getting it running and yeah i did i did want to verify that we have that see because this one this is for from gwen's and not directly from free code camp so we have all of gwen's stuff okay all right there's a lot of people saying hello so hey everybody good to see you this morning i'm gonna skip through a lot of the hellos though because there's there's so many of them just gonna give one big hello to everyone um um aziz says good luck with your depression uh thank you i appreciate that um yeah i'm uh i actually im possibly got into a study like a depression study uh on using new treatment techniques so i'm really excited about that it's with the university of uh pittsburgh and um the hospital system here is uh upmc um so it's about like using neurofeedback from like an mri to help like train your brain so that's really cool hopefully that that goes well but uh elias is asking what language we use uh javascript we use javascript uh kevin says if you want to develop a web ecommerce project what do you recommend what language um for a web ecommerce project if if you want to do it from scratch then probably should write it in i would recommend full stack javascript because then you only have to learn one language but if i if you're doing ecommerce i recommend maybe trying to take a look at some of the already developed solutions to that um so in like wordpress land woocommerce is where it's at but i've i've heard of uh i haven't used but i've heard of other stuff if you're not in wordpress land i think like magento is um like a prepackaged ecommerce thing so i haven't done ecommerce in a long time so i'm not sure what the latest stuff is but um if you if it's a green field project meaning like if you're doing it all from scratch then i recommend javascript kellen says i want some of that smoothie being made uh i didn't i have headphones on with music playing uh so i didn't hear it but i'm i'm right below the kitchen i'm in the basement and my wife was probably making smoothies so yes you probably heard the blender going i have plans to um try to do like a real office and sound proof it but like right now until i sell my old house i'm not doing any uh major improvements or purchases uh until we get that sold because i'm paying for two houses right now and it's uh that's kind of crazy so it works but only if i don't spend a lot of money on other stuff among says uh have you tried expo web um i haven't tried the latest release but i did get it working before it like officially became the in the last expo release uh so i have tried it but not the latest version i guess uh i'm really excited about it though i want to try to update what my project that at my my regular job uh uses it so i want to try to update to the latest version of expo hopefully sometime this week and and try that out okay i'm almost through all the questions i think and then we'll go back and and try to get this running locally lazy noob says i recently made a classic game using c oh that's really cool um i don't i've i've done very little in c oh jason says how's it going jesse i said hey to you at star trek in between sessions hey how's it going that's awesome um star trek was a great conference right like um if you've never heard of star trek before uh and you're able to go to conferences in the us i definitely recommend it it's in columbus ohio they hold it at a movie theater so all the talks are in in the theaters uh which is i never thought about it before but a movie theater is actually a great venue for a conference because it's it's already set up for people have comfortable seating there are big screens like it's it's perfect um but it was a great conference and there um we all watched avengers the new avengers after apologies for the for the yawns okay uh yale brown says is that the chrome extension to use uh github dark theme it is yeah so if you notice my github probably looks different than uh the normal github uh normally github is has like a white background uh but i'm using this github dark theme so uh i'm using tamper monkey so tamper monkey is a chrome plugin that lets you run uh javascript uh on a website so basically it'll just like match the url of the website and say like when you're at this url run this javascript so i'm using a premade script called github dark and then i'm pairing that with tamper monkey to be able to run it and so every time tamper monkey detects that i'm on github it runs the github dark script and it changes the theme for github um you don't have to use premade stuff you could build your own scripts like it'll it'll work but i prefer dark mode so that's why my github is dark uh tehrang says how do i practice front end i've learned basics but i need projects with solutions so i can force my brain to the actual goal or how the project should have been made in a better way any resources um i guess uh wow so sorry off the top of my head i'm not sure so you need you want like a whole project that you can work on but then also compare to that project like solved already i don't know that there's trying to think if there is a resource that does just that i'm not sure now you could always look at people's existing projects and then just try to build them over again right like look at their site or their app or whatever and say if i was going to build this like how would i do it you build it and then look at their repo so it'd have to be open source project but then you could look at their repo and see like you know what did you do differently what did they do so i mean it could probably work with anything as long as it's open source let's see all right almost done a few more questions uh joanna says why are you using javascript and no typescript um i i think typestrict is cool i just haven't taken the time to really learn it yet also for live streams i kind of would rather use if i can use like plain javascript so that it's less of a barrier to entry for people who are trying to understand the videos but i'm nothing against typescript like i said i just haven't really taken the time to use it for those of you who maybe aren't familiar with typescript it is um like something that you add on to javascript that makes javascript like a strongly typed language so for instance like in javascript i can declare a variable and i don't have to say what type that variable is like it could be anything and it could change right so it could be a string a number an array an object right in in other languages and at least in some other languages you have to say what it is so like in c sharp i can't just say my variable is whatever i have to say like i have to declare it as that so i can declare it as an int if i want an integer and i declare a string if i want a string and then that thing can only be a string or an integer right it so you have to declare what type it is what type of data it is right when you declare that that variable right so there are some um doing it like that kind of helps prevent bugs so it does have its advantages so that that's what typescript does for javascript there are other advantages of typescript at the core that's what typescript does uh innocent heart says i know html and python uh what next language do you prefer uh i would recommend javascript right if if you know html uh then javascript is a great way to do more with html and month says enough now let's get into coding all right the coding is is coming um let's see so rob says you skipped you just skipped my question all right i didn't see it where's saurov's question sarah why is this editor used for is that the question oh i don't understand exactly what the question is so rob so which which editor the free code camp won maybe let me know what you meant by that and i would definitely answer it all right so now that we have a fork of this so basically now that we fork this it means like we own this fork of the repository we can push to it right so we're not directly making changes to somebody else's repo right um let's see sorry says native react um react native is um a way to use javascript to build mobile apps so what we're trying to do sarov is making in browser editor so you can while you're in a normal web browser type in react native code and then see what it would look like displayed on the screen okay so we wanted to have the same behavior as the other free code camp lessons but with react native okay all right so i'm going to take a break from the chat for a little bit and get back to this uh so we want to clone this repo so we go to clone i have ssh set up so i'm going to use the ssh if you don't you can use https right and now i'm going to go to where's my i guess i'll go to vs code whoops and it opened on a different screen let me open this new window so trying to get this over on the right screen here that's weird there we go okay so i got on this screen so i have my terminal open in vs code hopefully make that a little bit bigger and that'll be easier to read all right see where we're at where the heck am i um all right i'm gonna wait to apply the latest updates here my documents i should have a projects folder but i guess i don't so let's make it so we're gonna do make directory projects projects cannot create directory project file exists where is it i did not miss it or i didn't see it projects all right cd that's really weird am i missing that like maybe the list was just longer and it cut it off anyway all right now we're in the projects folder you can see i have uh only one project in there it's a react native popup menu so now we're going to do a clone and we paste in that link that we just got from github uhoh clone sorry so now everything that repo is getting copied over it's a pretty big repo so this might take little bit longer than your your average repository but it shouldn't be too bad yeah oh this comp sci guy says it's in the second column oh i didn't even see this column over there wow good good look i was totally not maybe because these were so long i didn't even notice this column good look all right awesome so now that that's that that's there you can see we we have free code camp now so we can go into the free code camera repository so you have all this stuff in here so since we have our package json we can install that but let's let's make sure we're doing it right so let's go to our um whoops i'm not going there we go let's go to our contributing and take our steps so we can get started we do want to run an npm install and there we go this is what i was looking for we need to install gulp and bower globally all right so let's get that npm install running right away though there we go all right npm install is going to take everything that's in our package json file and it's going to install it all okay okay and i can probably open another window here and do the install for the other ones right so we're gonna do gulp and bower gulp great and then now let's do so uh gulp is like a task runner uh before webpack became big gulp was kind of the thing to let you do things like minify your files run a um like a local server like on localhost like run babble concatenate things minify all right so we should have gulp and bower installed globally now we can do a power install and getting close to everything set up so let's do power install oops no bower.json present uh oh hmm is there supposed to be a power.json no there's a bower rc uh it's probably power components all right so that looks like it gets power json yeah there should be a bower.json why don't we have that all right let's double check make sure oh you know what i'm not in the right directory that's why if you see this one open me up in the uh parent directory so see the projects free code cam there we go now we can run a power install it says uh rem ramas ramasamy says video is not viewable on mobile is anybody else having trouble on mobile and why is it not viewable is the font too small um i can i can fix that for sure just let me know uh tutoring says hey i subbed uh awesome thank you oh and by the way so since the last time i streamed free code camp's youtube channel hit one million subscribers which is amazing so thank you all so much for subscribing and i'm a subscriber too to three code cam i just think that's insane um when i started streaming i think we had like 150 000 uh so it is the growth has just been amazing i'm so happy that uh you know so many people are using free code camp and learning how to code um okay it looks like the font is too small on mobile i could probably bump it up like maybe one more before it starts to get crazy oh you know what actually i see my face is covering this up so i'm not gonna do anything on this side anymore i'm gonna do all my commands over here on the left side so um hopefully the little bit bigger font works as well i'm just afraid if i go too big then there just won't be enough on the screen even make sense um all right cool so i think that's everything installed that we need let's go back to our contributing file contributors guide that was weird i don't know how i got all the way back up to the top okay so private environment videos create a copy of the sample m and name it as dot um populated with necessary api keys and secrets all right so not all the keys are required to run the app locally that's good because i don't have any of the keys all right i don't think i'll hopefully i don't need all these services like mandrill is for sending emails i doubt i need that right we're not sending emails we'll probably need the stuff okay all right so we need let's see let's check out our environment variables file oops let's go here let's open this up so since we're in the free code camp projects folder we could just type in code and then a period and that opens up our project like with the folder there let's update it later space like we have we're already in there we have everything if i open up a new terminal it's going to be um already in that folder so i like doing it like that i could have like tried to navigate directly um through there like through the ui but i prefer to just do it on the command line let's do in uh well let's view the terminal so we have our terminal here and see we start out already in our free code camp project that's nice because then they don't have the mistake i made earlier where i tried to run bower from the wrong folder okay so we want there should be an example environment variable there we go so our sample m um not right now okay so we have a lot of environment variable stuff here that i don't think we'll need right so bloggers yeah trello yeah i do not think we would need any of this stuff hopefully now um this is probably all for the um login like login with google logging with github stuff um and then if you do sign up like you get emails so it's uh what the only thing i think we'll really need is this and i'm hoping that this is this will be default for when we start this up so let's make a dot m file for our environment variables so we can make a new file like this and just call it env and now i'm going to paste that and hope that i don't need the other things just to get this to run now uh looks like we need to we need a command to run this where are we at back here let's see okay so we're gonna start the server mongod and then we're going to do npm run only once i'm going to copy that and then we'll start it with gulp so first things first let's start the server then it says to start it in a new terminal so let's create a second one make this a little bigger i'm going to do it here on this side since we probably won't need to look at it and that way it doesn't matter if my face is covering it up my son my son ambrose just walked by hey ambrose all right i'm doing a live stream buddy okay all right he's he's decided he's going to ride his scooter down here okay come on go d oh no i need don't i actually let's see i'm just going to check the package json for a second and see if we have commands that will help us with this i guess i'm gonna have to install all right that makes sense obviously i need to install logo i should have uh expected that you're able to log in which you can ignore you'll be able to log in if you may get these keys here probably should check out yeah i don't want that i don't want those keys um tv windows there we go okay so you notice i skipped by like the youtube video and the blog i do recommend like if you're going to install a tool like check out that tools documentation their official documentation first uh if if that doesn't work or if it's confusing then you can go to blogs and videos but you're going to get the most uptodate information from the documentation so uh check check that out all right let's see come on man i wonder if i can install with chocolatey chocolatey chocolatey is a package manager for windows it's like uh homebrew for mac and it'd be like your like app get stuff for like uh linux uh chuckle install mongodb yeah let's try that because that's gonna be easier than going through an install wizard well you know what i need to run it from run administrator let's not continue let's do command line from administrator how do we get this so so it came up on my other screen but basically all i'm doing is selecting the command prompt run as administrator let me pull this over so now i'm going to do choco co choco install mongodb so run as administrator on um windows is like sudo for mac or linux yes i'm not really reading that stuff probably should have but i'm just saying yes sure mongodb is a what's called a nosql database so um databases generally fall into two categories one of two categories either sql based uh sql right or no sql or no sequel what's up buddy oh whiskey don't eat that diaper i guess it's too late he pretty much tore it up i don't know why there was a diaper sitting down here though shoot okay sorry so um my my son my my fouryearold just told me that this dog that we're watching for a couple of weeks it just ate a diaper so i didn't realize this doug was eating a diaper right next to me uh anyway it's a pretty good dog though actually uh he follows me around everywhere and um he's become my best friend so i like the dog but this dog does love to eat diapers and my twoyearold still wears diapers at night so there are frequently diapers around all right almost ready with this install hey ambrose the people on the live stream said hi hi he says hi okay i guess this is almost done yay all right cool so hopefully we can use the command right away nope we may have to do this in a different terminal so let's do this real quick let's shut that down and oops um let's open this up again and see if we can sometimes when you install something new you need to restart it before you can use any new commands is that it is that the command no it's not what the heck i think i missed something let me check the chat because maybe one of you saw what i missed okay i don't think anybody said anything about it so let me try i'm gonna get back to the chat in just a minute but i do want to at least try to run this all right so start the server did it say anything about oh prerequisites mongodb i totally missed that as the prerequisite learn all right hopefully this uh package worked package parameters and we don't have to install some other way uh how to run longer db on airline i don't want to install it how do i start mongodb there we go how do we start mongodb from windows yeah yeah okay enter the command on go d okay so d is the command even on windows okay download mongodb all right let me s it says here they need to create a folder and then go into that folder go to bin servers we're going to bend this is interesting i think i need to go into where manga was installed and run that okay did i install another terminal program i thought i installed a a terminal for windows i guess not oh okay shout out on discount or you can add a location in the path okay comps that guy saying where did choco install all right let's let's see if it program data db okay so you're thinking maybe if we go into that directory we can run it from there okay seen the hat program files in here program data sorry program data and where the heck is program data c program data all right so we need to go back out then there we go to the program data now we should see longer db what do we have in there data log um let's see nope whoa okay nope temp chan says i guess the binaries are installed inside c program data chocolaty all right okay all right if you're not familiar at all with the command line uh cd is how we traverse directories so it change directory let's see what we have here choco to get a bin i don't know where all the chocolatey stuff is um tony says if you get an error you have not created a collection um go to bin and try okay hmm comp size guy says it's interesting that although vs code is a microsoft product they still use a bash terminal you can uh bash is an option so i've set bash as my default but i don't think it's the default on windows um you know the only other thing i could think of is shutting down vs code completely and reopening i it has happened to me frequently yeah don't save that when i install something new i can't use it with vs code until um until i restart battle math nope we need free cocaine okay yeah i definitely can't do that here what do we have try running okay no not all right let's see i think maybe now would be a good point to finish answering the questions and then just finish up with the show and then i can try to debug this um let's see all right here's one temp chan says can you try c program files mongodb server 3.2 bin try that all right let's try that i'm going to open another one so i don't totally lose my place um program files okay do you want to do program files or was it program data all right we'll go to program data um or i'm sorry program files do we have we do have one go in there all right andreas says you have to add the binaries file at path system okay so should be able to do here access try not mongodb uh i did try temp chan says because you're using bash i have okay then i have to try it right there did i try as well on here i wanna go the longer okay yeah i do try on there bash needs to have mongo.exe okay all right i'm gonna copy that so we have it and let's check our one level up from system 32 it says you may have to use the command prompt to use mongodb not the bash i was going to see if i could add this to path um um now what is it cd or sorry lsa that's what i wanted i'm able to see everything okay so temp chan is saying bash don't work so i do i have to go back to the command prompt then okay i just wanted to check that how do i change directories in the command prompt it's been so long since i've used the regular command prompt i do not remember it's cd directory why did that not work for me last time oh ls is what didn't work for me sorry all right cd um i should be able to cd into program files let's go db and then um what was the next one server 4.0 bin okay okay it's directory yeah all right cool that works all right well we got something now we guessed something it was an error but it was something data is not found terminating okay cool what's this welcome to the show all right so if i just type it does the show um all right looks like comps i guess says sent a link need to create a data folder docs says now run dot exe uh okay babash gupta says i believe it's done now we can minimize and continue uh i guess it's worth a shot right i mean so it's something is running right uh let's double check only these here we'll start by default see i think that what we wanted to run was the mongod and it was supposed to run this on the port 27017 but the problem is it it aired out and i think because we didn't have any like database file um but i think we we do inside okay so we need to give it a path the database path okay then create data in the bin i need a data location for the server okay all right let me try this i'm gonna try copy and paste in this command from the chat um there we go i like that it said bye to me okay oops i guess it did not work when i tried to copy that command nah it's still shut down data could not be found i have maybe i'd need to create it first okay so we need to make the directory first i guess i could do that from this one if it's open so i'm already on c and i could do make directory data and data.db all right so now we made some directories let's run this again dang it data director you see data not found why is it not found did we not just make that directory i am gonna have to end the stream soon and uh and work so we have limited amount of time but let's see let's verify that we did actually just make this right yes we have data and what is my present working oh that's because i'm not in the seizure i thought i was already out i guess not there we go i was hoping i could do them both but i guess not all right my mistake let's see if it works now it worked it worked right oh temp chan noticed that i made it in the wrong directory sorry i didn't see that that was definitely the problem okay cool so this worked cool all right all right that was pretty sweet we got it working let's go back here and see what the next step is oh this is the npm run only once to seed the database actually let's change the branch while we're here get check out um react native challenges there we go ah come on no package lock json i don't care i don't um just gonna get rid of it and then now we'll go there we go i want to make sure we're on the right uh branch before i see this database because i don't want to miss stuff okay um let me see if there's some more questions to answer before i got to finish this stream up i guess i can run this now no all right something did not work hmm wait we don't have that script anymore i think uh on this branch a lot more changed than i thought i don't think we even have that right yeah we don't have that anymore dang it all right now's a great time i think to stop though because we um yeah there's definitely some new stuff here we got like lerna on here okay i think now is a good time to stop and answer questions finish up next time we'll continue on we'll see the database we'll get this running and then we can work on it but not a bad session we had a lot of nice troubleshooting here which troubleshooting is a big part of being a developer an engineer so uh it may seem like we didn't do a lot of coding but what we did do is actually a lot of what my job is like uh it says you you have to figure stuff like this out so i would say it's realistic in terms of live coding which is why i wanted to do this show anyway i wanted it to be a realistic look at what i do all right i think i found where i left off apologies if i end up missing a question here wanted recommendations for programming glasses uh because the the eyes the blue light hurts hurts his eyes so i do you have these programming glasses unfortunately i don't remember maybe see i got the case here there's sixes cyxus is the brand that i have here i like these ones i have another pair at work i can't remember what brand they are but they're they're smaller like the frames are the lenses are smaller so i actually prefer these because the big lenses seem to block out more light but i think that's not really a brand thing that's more of just a style so i recommend getting a lens and frame style that has like big lenses to block out more i do like these at home it's not as big of a deal because i can control the lighting better but at work there's such a glare on the screen and so many like fluorescent lights that i do get a headache if i don't wear my blue light blocking glasses let's see uh i'm gonna skip some of the comments so sorry for not reading out all the comments but i just have to get to work so i'm going to try to just get to the questions um crack says where can i learn in codecamp.org go to freecodecamp.org and check out the curriculum and that's where all the lessons are um like someone has an in pronounceable name so uh so wondering if you could help me give me some idea to start a project this web dab i'm stuck on learning um oh there's there's so many different things you could do to start a project uh it's hard to say um there are websites that have lists of like potential projects you could do so i would try searching for those websites and then you'll get a ton of good ideas for projects i don't know what the urls are for those sites off the top of my head unfortunately but it shouldn't be too hard to find um on on wagba collins i'm really sorry i mispronounced your name let me know how i should pronounce it says uh is there a terminal plugin for sublime i don't really know because i've never used sublime any sublime users out there know of a terminal plugin uh joshua wolff asks what language is react native in or is that the framework yeah react native is a framework but um the language is javascript zac asks if this was the baby math game still no we're taking a break from that to work on something for the free code camp curriculum but we're going to come back to that and uh fortunately there's been um the part of the reason why i felt kind of stuck with the baby math game was um i wanted to use expo to run it on a mobile device but expo didn't support react hooks yet but the latest version of expo does so we should be able to use expo to run and test it on mobile emulators and to create builds for mobile devices so i'm excited about that and we will get back to that and i'm gonna try to have my oldest son who's nine years old uh i'm gonna try to set him up with some sort of like i don't know online drawing tool or something to maybe make some some characters and artwork for the game so that might be cool see what he comes up with uh we got a question um about react native versus flutter who will win i have no idea who will win really it's hard to say i mean react native is already has been out there longer so i guess it already has a bigger user base sorry but honestly i haven't actually tried out flutter yet so i don't think i could give a really good answer to that question uh josh wolfe says can you really use this to make android apps you can definitely use react native to make android apps all right i'm skipping there's a lot of stuff that was in relation to what we were trying to install here which seems like this kind of stalled out i'll have to figure that out later um let's see almost to the end of the chat here uh rust um says uh which computer can you offer for programming but not imac uh so i guess recommendations um yeah i mean imacs are pretty expensive if if you can find a good deal on a macbook pro i think that's i really like those like for in term if you want a laptop i recommend the macbook pro if you want a desktop though you i i personally think that you will get more power for your money if you go with a windows computer and try to get basically get your custom build for what you want like i switched to windows desktop for live streaming because my macbook pro could not handle it uh and it ended up being way cheaper to get what i needed with a pc than it was for a mac in particular i needed a powerful processor with as many cores is possible uh because i from what i read that would help the most with streaming um and to be to get that in a mac would be very expensive uh so i think if you figure out what you want your computer to do do the research to see what components you need that will help the most you're way more likely to find a good deal and exactly what you want with a pc but in terms of laptops you can't beat the mac track pads they're just really nice i've never seen one anything come close to that on a chromebook or on windows laptop if if it's too expensive though to get the mac i would honestly i would look into getting a chromebook and running a cloud editor because they're way less expensive very reliable um startup is super fast like faster than anything i've ever seen so i think that's probably the route i would go like if i was going to buy a new laptop and not go with a mac um i lost my place i'm sorry uh which coding language to use um i use javascript mostly uh so i think javascript is definitely good good language to use um you have a question uh if if react is javascript why does it need installed um it's a javascript uh library so you need to install it just like any npm package would need installed comp sci guy says do you use expo at work i do i do use expo uh expo is a uh a tool or set of tools that work well with react native if you're using react native i definitely recommend checking out expo it it makes some things like um like running yours and testing locally and bundling uh a lot easier and it has a lot of cool builtin um like modules it's uh it's definitely useful and marketing wants to know what language you use to build a facebook like website uh i if it were me i'd use javascript because that's what i'm best with right but you could probably build something similar with almost anything um it does seem to make sense to use like react since react is a facebook thing that kind of seems fitting if you're trying to build a facebook clone um uh will ask is react native just a front end or could it have like all logic for example a game built out of javascript yeah actually react native could have all the logic for a game uh if you wanted like persistent storage or something you know you'd have to link it up to a database but i mean yeah you could definitely build a game and just use react native um let's see i keep losing my place sorry the scroll the scroll with my mouse is a little bit rough here um you know let me see if i can pop this chat window out and get a little bit nicer experience here uh comp sci guys says i was told expo isn't ideal for prod um you know what we're not in pride yet at work so i'm not i'm not sure about that um right now we don't have any like shortterm plans to take the mobile version in the prod so i don't really have to deal with that yet when i get closer to that then i'll have to decide whether or not i want to stick with expo for doing the prod bundle or just use regular react native but i'll keep that in mind though i haven't heard anything one way or another though creative girl says hi i am starting to learn javascript do i need to start with vanilla javascript what do you think about jquery any javascript books to recommend which framework is best thank you it's a lot of questions one yeah start with vanilla javascript that's always good to know jquery is is not bad um to learn there are a lot of jobs where you need to use jquery because a lot of sites are built on it if you want to build brand new sites though i would recommend not going with jquery and maybe trying to do vanilla javascript or maybe a framework um which brings me to the framework question i personally like react um but there are other frameworks out there that are used for a lot of things so angular and vue seem to be pretty popular as well but but certainly that's up to you they all have their strengths and weaknesses any javascript books check out the series called you don't know js i believe you can read them for free i think they're all up on github and then there's also a book called eloquent javascript and there is an online version of that available for free as well those are definitely great places to start if you're learning javascript v web code says do you have a car if so what's the name i drive a 2017 honda civic when i have all the kids and everything i have a honda pilot it's a 2009 honda pilot but um the car i normally drive to work is honda civic i want to get a tesla one day because they're just really cool um but they're expensive so that's not gonna happen anytime soon um let's see uh v web code says tell me five ways to make money from coding five ways i don't know i mean you just you get a job uh build websites um sell your website it's like i i don't know um anybody help with that uh charlie swagger says hey jesse windows and linux have a big issue in react native ios development and no one uses expo in industry okay that's an interesting take um i have to keep that in mind for expo i do know that there are issues with ios development um i usually develop on a mac so it's not really an issue for me um obviously like when i'm streaming i'm using a pc so that's going to limit us if to do things like that we'll have to stick with android but you know in terms of my job i have a mac so that's not going to be an issue for that the comp sci guy mentions there is async storage in react native that's true we were talking about building a game with react native and i mentioned database i assume that's what you're talking about yeah so you could do async storage i was thinking more like um in terms of persistent data like if you wanted the user to be able to like let's say change phones and still get access to their data then you'd need some sort of database but yeah if you just want the data stored locally to persist you can definitely use async storage which basically behaves very similarly to what local storage does in a browser uh shirangi sony says hey jesse i'm almost completed with react now what are the steps like redux what are the next steps like redux component api flux i don't know these um if you're almost finished with react i'd say the next step is build stuff with react if you find that you need help with state management check out redux or like context api or something i think if you know react just start building as you find you need something else then learn that other thing but you could build a lot of cool stuff with just react so that's where i would personally would go next okay um and marketing says which language is basic to coding i mean i i don't really know exactly what you mean by that um but you can do pretty much anything in most of the main languages now um so i don't know if there is one that is like the basic coding language uh mulick says can you start learning rec directly skipping vanilla javascript uh you should definitely know some javascript first before you learn react i mean you don't have to be a javascript master but react uses a lot of javascript so you're going to have to learn javascript to use react anyway rustdmz says what can you tell about gaming laptops should i buy them for programming um i've thought about getting like gaming pcs and laptops for programming before i think they would work but i kind of think you would be spending more money than you need to so if you have the money great but if you don't really want to do a lot of gaming and you just want to do programming i think like the gaming setups would have way more um graphics capabilities then you would need so you probably could get something less expensive and it may be as good or better for programming uh v web code says what do you think about angular and vue are they dead oh no i don't think they're dead i think it's just um they're just different right uh i think angular is used by a lot of big companies um view seems to have i don't see view being used as much in big companies i i don't obviously don't know about all the companies here um but and i like i haven't used view and i haven't used the newer versions of angular uh so this is just kind of an outsider perspective but i still see a lot of jobs for angular developers some jobs for view um but i don't think either one is dead now v webb says can i buy a tesla car with a javascript coding job i mean maybe it depends like i really can't yeah so i have four kids and um so i have a coding job but i can't with four kids i can't afford a tesla if i decided to like really save up and um uh not spend my money on anything else for a while then maybe i could buy one but it's it's not an easily affordable option for me but if i was single i could probably buy a tesla and be fine not like the roadster but you know like the cheapest version of the tesla let's see all right cool so i've gotten through all if not most of the questions uh reverse that most if not all of the questions and i gotta get started with my my normal job now um thank you all so much for watching i'm gonna really try my best to start doing live streams regularly again uh i know i got away from it for a while sorry about that um bother me on twitter and instagram and stuff if i don't stream ask me what i'm doing and why i'm not streaming and that'll help me to get back into it um if you like the streams if you don't then just you know forget about it and maybe i'll go away um okay i think that's all uh i need to do maybe a little bit of uh debugging maybe i'll save that for the stream maybe i'll do it outside the stream we'll see but thank you all so much for your help it was definitely useful to get all this stuff working and i'll be back again i really want to do at least one more stream this week if i can um i do have more conferences and a vacation coming up so i'm gonna have some more breaks coming up but hopefully not as long as this last break was so until next time uh thank you all so much and have a great day
