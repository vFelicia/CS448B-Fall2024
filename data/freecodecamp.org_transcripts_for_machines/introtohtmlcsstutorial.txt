in this video I'm going to teach you how to create a website just like other professionals do it now you will find yourself tempted to memorize the code but in reality most programmers don't memorize the code at all they usually follow documentation and anytime they want to remember something they just copy it from the other files so don't feel tempted to memorize everything to get started you want to go ahead and open your web browser because we're going to install the required software but before we do so I want to go ahead and talk to you about HTML which is the first language you're gonna have to learn in order to create a website so hTML is not a programming language instead it's a markup language so basically a markup language is like the outside template of your website so to give you a demonstration on how this will work let's visit a very simple website like like for instance this website what saw out if I were to click on I want to open a source code so yep you're gonna right click on the web page and click on View page source all right there we go this is more legible so if we scroll down everything it's from here down until about here is HTML then we have HTML right here downwards so this may look a little tempting but don't worry this is a very large website very large scale it has a lot of JavaScript a lot of indentation so there's no need to worry about doing this and has some styling in the middle so it's not like pure HTML so no need to compare but every web site is so basically the every web site has to be outputting in HTML because the browser can only read HTML now for this course you will need a browser and a text editor so for a browser I have Google Chrome but you can choose your own so for our text editor we will be using visual studio code so you can go together from code visual studio now you want to go ahead and download this please just do the code and then so while you're setting I have it installed already but while you're setting it up it'll ask you an option to add it to like the file context menu like with LC like open with Co which is generally this so if I were to open my file explorer like here for instance I can just click on open a code and I'll be able to open it with Visual Studio coding on your on your desktop or anywhere you want to create a file I mean this is where we're gonna store our website a basically a new folder this and you want to call this folder web development course so inside of that folder now today we're gonna be creating three websites in which two websites are just sand boxes so they're not gonna look very pretty the first website is gonna be called it's going to be called HTML sandbox now you can do the manual way of creating folder but if you want you can follow along and download get bash from I'll show you where you can get it from just search on google get bash this the second link and it's download the Windows version and then you can get get bash and then so these are basically Unix commands available on Windows so this will allow you to do is use like sort of like Linux commands on a Windows system so I'm gonna go ahead and make the font size bigger so you can read it alright so now you want to go in and you want to create a new file inside of this folder so for the UNIX command for creating a new file is touch and then the name of the file which is index out HTML which one Korea but we do not want to create inside this folder we will create a new folder which is a directory in which you will say make door so basically make directory what do you want to call your folder well I want to call it HTML underscore sandbox and you'll see it's created here now we want to get inside our folders you can create our next files now we want to go ahead and see so basically go into that folder in which what we call but well I should say you don't remember what you call this folder and you don't have this open so you can use a command called LS it'll tell you what folders you have so you can see here I have HTML sandbox so now I'm going to basically do CD into HTML underscore sandbox now I'm inside of HTML sandbox and you can clearly verify for right here so inside of here I want to talk about in that's how HTML so index.html is the entry point for a website home page so whenever you upload the website to a server to a service whatever it's gonna look for index.html to load your web page so basically your home page now you do not want to call it home dot HTML the server is not going to know which file to open you're just going to show a directory list of files and then let the user decide but we do not want to let the user decide on what file to open in which we will specify index.html now you can go ahead now we can do an LS here and see we have index.html and if I were to open this you will see index our HTML now at this point you can go ahead and rightclick inside the folder and click on open with code but if you follow the other method of just using windows itself it's simple just new new folder and just follow along now for a dog dog HTML extension now you may not have this available at your first just want to go down to view and write and check file name extensions which will allow you this now you can either right click in here and fold and click on open with code but I'm not gonna do that if you have git bash and you and when you were installing visuals to your clothing and clicked on add visual studio to pass then you should be able to do code and then dart for inside this folder and they'll open visual studio code on its own now you'll see that visual studio code that it displays index.html now do not be worried by just looking at the format this text editor is mate might be overwhelming for some of you but don't worry it's simple now one extension busy extension so let me talk with sentience for a while so extensions are like addins for a text letter which make them more and more powerful so you can see here have a couple of extensions but one extension we will need it's called live server right here so you want to go ahead and click install and install and automatically but if so basically I will show you them what the live server does so you have two options of viewing that so go ahead and type hello world here to stimulate that and now go ahead and go back to your files and now you have two options you can either open this file manually double clicking now the downside to opening like that is almost split screen for a second the downside for opening that way is let's just a triad whole world and I save here so if I do say ctrl s for save I had to come back here and reload which can be tiring as soon as you get into more so what that so what live server does for us is it allows us to just right click and click on open with live server so inside a live server you can see it has went ahead and opened it for us now if I were to split screen these now it will give me some alerts to let me know about so now I can just gonna do how I can like remove the house and then do control s and visual pseudocode and it should automatically so it won't automatically reload right now until we get into talking about the structure of a web page then I'll show you reloading but basically if I click ctrl s inside a code editor it should automatically reload the browser so now if you want to increase the font size which is inside of file preferences and settings and you're gonna control the font size so I'm going in for this purpose of the video I'm your 20 all right so now this should be pretty big all right now let's going to talk about the structure of a web page so each web page has a structure and now we're creating HTML file but there's different types of HTML and now we're learning html5 which is the latest everyone use is everyone's using it basically so every webpage is displayed in that and Google and all browsers are supported now here's one thing if you if you haven't just defined like Chrome as your default browser and it opens live server and edge just going to copy the URL close out of it open Chrome paste it in just give it a second and ocean this should be fine now we want to declare this document as an html5 document so there's this weird syntax you have to learn its angle bracket open explanation point doctype and HTML now once again just in case if you is doctype and then HTML now you do not have to do capitalize as i sometimes become lazy and just do like that totally dependent on you but the main point is you're getting the main point of doctype and an HTML so basically this is declaration of the defines that this is an html5 document so no one can come now and say there's a HTML for HTML 3 which ever like it doesn't matter now we want to create the roots of this web page so our roots live inside an element called HTML so now all elements come in pairs so if I were to do HTML so I start angle bracket HTML sound watch what happens as soon as I break my right angle bracket automatically the ESCOs tries to be helpful and gives us the second pair so now all elements come in pairs so it makes sense why I did that now if you press ENTER between it creates this space which is totally fine the space is totally fine in which inside we're gonna call something called nesting elements so we're gonna nest another element inside of this so now we want to where would we define the web page title because if we go here you can see visual studio code as its own title but here we have like 127.0.0.1 port number 550 500 index our HTML this is not very user friendly so inside if you here we want to go to head element so now the same thing press enter in between elements which will give you the space inside a head elements we can define the meta information the titles style sheets everything so mostly anything that isn't displayed on the webpage is usually going to be in here and it's like external so we can go in and create a title element and now let's call this title hello world and if I save not reload here hello world now I can change this to anything and call it HTML and now if I save here it automatically reloads here because it has the necessary tasks to reload but now I'm we're just gonna stick to the title HTML sandbox because this is only has our sandbox where we play with HTML code we creating you we like create elements all that fun stuff don't worry it's not gonna be hard this is a challenge so now inside of here we don't create a body so now body is where the elements are visible to the user so if I do body now inside of your you can do this is everything you type in here gibberish even is displayed to the user all right but this is very small but I'm gonna teach you tags that will make a very bigger now let me save this once again hTML is on the more go so right now our webpages are not going to look as beautiful until we get to something called CSS which is cascading style sheets now do not worry about CSS right now as I will go over that in this video don't worry but you'll eventually get to that so I want to go ahead and teach you something on so mouse display element on a web page so gonna do h1 once again visual studio code becomes helpful so let me explain to you what's going on so we're in jizan type go ahead and type hello world and then you have like you have hello world displayed on your browser yeh so just have created your first web page now let me tell you what is basically happening here so here's what you're saying hey browser this is html5 document so this tag you're telling the browser this is html5 and then now we're calling for browser again disturbing the browser again and be like hey browser here's the root of our webpage and then hey browser take our meta information and our title a browser I want this title to be the title of my webpage now hey browser close the header because I finished my meta and then now we're hey browsers start to open workspace we're gonna start and then each one so this is a one heading so this is a largest heading available in HTML so you're basically saying the brother hey browser give me a heading one by declaring this so anything inside is h1 is gonna look very similar until you get into CSS but this is one heading this is one element you just have successfully created an HTML element that displays on a web page so now this isn't very helpful to us just learning h1 so let's just say I want to comment this so comments are useful to let like if I other developer was to come over and wants to see how much work you put into your webpage they can come over and then see that oh so this means this that means that basically so how will we put this in like human form like how will we tell another human that this is an h1 element that says our world without it them actually open the code so that's where comments come in so we go laughing go bracket exclamation point double hyphens and then inside it there you can type anything so videos to your code has become inside you that and then so basically that's the beginning of that comment and then you can close a comment just like that and then inside of this you can put a comment so we're gonna say hello world okay now comments are not displayed to the user so everything in the comment is going to be displayed here not hear anything on comments is only displayed to the developer that's working inside the code editor so while this is not you fall at the moment where doesn't start so now we want the clip now to declare a comment inside Visual Studio code the fastest way is to control and then you might press ctrl on your keyboard and then forward slash and increase the automatic comment so let's talk about all of our headings so I'm gonna create a comment of headings so now we couldn't merrily type out h1 which takes a lot of time but I want to show you visuals to your code shortcut just type h1 and then tab it will create this h1 element for us so inside of this h1 I want to go so we're creating like a cheat sheet sandbox sort of thing so it's like easy for you to study with so I won't put some text in here which is gonna help you understand h1 so this is a heading with an h1 time so you can put almost anything in the sound of h1 so any word add anything you basically want but for the purpose of this video I'm just gonna put heading with h1 tags so like we know that's the h1 like you do not want to mess this up so now we're using our short cover and create another element which is the h2 which is going to be smaller than our each one but not significantly so heading with h2 time and it's definitely it is smaller now you will see that by default some of these have like space in between of them now we can get rid of that space using CSS but don't worry we'll get to that as well the next element you want to create is a h3 so this is a heading with an h3 tag now you can go on out going to now there's six types of heading so you can go ahead and move on and create your own element until it's eight six so going to explore alright so now we have created six different headings now you can see eight six it's pretty tiny I'm pretty sure no one's to read that on a web page so for that that's what CSS exists so you know how to deal with this mini eight six which in reality I haven't used a six and a long time since doing web development so now we've I've showed you headings but it doesn't look very pretty like headings they're like bolded so you don't want your text like that so that's why paragraphs exist so put another comment and I'm gonna say paragraph so now there's only one time to remember about paragraph so yeh we don't have to remember too much so you want to pee cow now inside these P tags we want to go ahead and type any paragraph one so inside this is a paragraph but that isn't very helpful at all now that is helpful indeed but it isn't very helpful to us to like display like a paragraph so now there's a now let's just say we're prototyping a website like testing a website to see how it will look and play around we might not have content so for that reason Visual Studio has a very handy tag which is Laura and then now how many words you want so we can see even 3,000 words 3 million whatever but I want 30 words alarm so you do Lauren 30 tab and just develop 30 words and lorem ipsum which is dummy text basically so now this is how a paragraph look like now Google Chrome might prompt you to translate the page just because lorem is not pure English but yeah you don't have to worry about that now let's talk about links so now you go on a web page on visuals to a web page again now we just find a link to click on well let's look on our privacy there's privacy statement so now it basically takes you to an external page now we can do accomplish the same thing with our website so you want to go and put a comment for links and then here the links have it so now they're there used a a tag with H ref is where you're pointing to so why are you pointing to which is href and then closing time so now inside of a crowd that's where you put where you want to go you can so if I were to go and like let's just say you were extra now this was your website and you told someone to go to Google calm number one they just have left your website so you just lost a visitor apparently just because you made them click on that link so now there's a really easy way to make this open in a new tab in which is so now elements have attributes so attribute is define very different things so we have an attribute which is called target now if I type in target visual studio code we'll add an equal sign and then the quotation basically this href is also attribute for this link so inside of here just type in underscore blank now there's would be something different if I click on clicked me we're in a new tab so we still have that visitor that came to our website so let's review what we have learned so the first thing that I taught you guys was that every file that that is a HTML file must have the extension dot HTML now sorry if you can't see this but it's really small the dot HTML is right here it is literally everywhere reminding you that you need dot HTML now the first time that we learned when creating a web site was the doctype HTML now this declares his file as an html5 document and not a XHTML file document so we are writing HTML file 5 and not any other time and then first begin the roots of the document like basically the beginning and the end point of the document is HTML the tags the HTML now we learned also that HTML tags come in pairs like always and then the head tag same thing in pairs is Z like where the titles held a meta tag everything now here's one topic I haven't talked about and that is nesting elements so here you will see that the title tag is actually nested inside the head tag and so is all this nested inside the this stuff is nested inside of the body to the body is nested inside the HTML tag head tag is also nested inside HTML and everything is basically one hierarchy now here's one thing I haven't talked about and that is the indentation so you want to keep your file neat and clean so it is easy to read now if I were to go ahead and now indentation not important for the browser so you can literally do is basic rewrite just the whole entire thing that we have written so far in a very ugly format so just watch how ugly it could get and you will soon to find out that it is impossible to nearly read and then we had to get out the head they're gonna get into the body tag and then inside of here we have to put an h1 that says hello world so now this might be one line so yeah but just by looking at this if I had more of this so like if I put let's just say all this in there but let's just I was four more elements you can clearly see that it is becoming hard to read and we won't know where elements end we got soon as we get into the harder elements it will become harder to read so that's why indenting documents is better so if I was to go ahead and indent this a little bit maybe not the best intention but a lot better they're a lot more suitable to me so number one you do not want to do this how to doc types and one document to HTML and two bodies and two heads that will confuse it but yeah you can you can clearly take away that indentation makes the document easier to read and so does nesting so nest so every time you Nessa element inside an element just have it over it will be so much easier so now let's move on to something with organization so we want to organize our like let's just say one McCrystal it's now you can create a list but what we have learned just by using paragraphs so we can say list item this item so you can sort of create a list I mean not the best list of the world but hey it's a list alright so instead we're going to learn something proper so let's include our comment for lists now we have two types of listen hmm so if we have two types so now you have unordered list and order the list so now on the order list have a tag of UL while order lists have a tag of oh well so now inside of each list you still use the same tag so you nest list items inside of a list container basically so you're basically clearing a container so let's start with an unordered list so you well now inside of here we're nesting so we're gonna be nesting upon list item so let me go ahead and like save so we can get rid of this but anyway let's move let's type in Li so this is list I saw a lie stands for list item so it's gonna comment that up your li stands for list item so inside of each list item you can inside of every alike of one list item or many as you want but I would understand why would you want to do that so inside this Li let's do list item one and you will see they have some pre format tation like we get this bullet point for free and basically we almost did nothing except by ul and Li now here let me teach you one interesting thing if I were to create an li without it it creates it but it doesn't have that nice indentation of going on to the right like it will just stay like that so you can do allies basically which will create a bullet point but it's better to do inside a ul so it looks more indicated but once again just CSS this won't be wrong so let's just create larger list now you can get the idea of what I'm talking about now this is a nautilus how about odorless well we already mentioned that order list or oh well tax so let's do oh well inside if you're going to the same allies so we'll do list item one list item two now guess what an order list will look like I haven't told you what order list looks like so I want you to pause the video and think about it how would an order list look like alright so order list spoiler alert has numbers now for you guys to not look all the way this down so now you don't have to copy this time and quickly do some funky magic there so you guys do not have to you do not have to copy this don't worry but I just did this so you don't have to keep on looking on the bottom so if you have order list so bees have numbers basically now basically the purpose of a list is to organize your data and while this is pretty good organized let's talk about text formats text formatting like bold in our words italics underline highlighting subscript superscript like if you're like creating a Matthew close you might want to do exponents or subscripts whatever so I'm Creole create a common for text formatting now some of the most popular tabs for text formatting will be if you want to bold your text you will want to use the strong ties and then if you wanted to italic your text you would use the e/m tags if you wanted to underline your text you would you will use au tags if you wanted to highlight your text or highlight you would use the mark tags and then if you wanted to add a subscript so that will be a small number on the bottom which you'll see in a second you will see subtext and then if you want it to superscript which is like an exponent you will do the soup tags now let's going to test some of these tags out so we're going now these can be nested inside of a paragraph and these are some inline elements which I'm going to mention right now so basically inline elements are elements that stay on the same line so for instance a tags are also in line but since its parent was a block level element a block level element basically means it's gonna be honest um on line then this moved on the next so let me show you how that will look like so if I were to go in and create a paragraph inside this paragraph we're gonna type this board is going to be and then inside of here let's go in create a strong tax for bolding this text bold so this is an inline element it did not move to its own line like it did not do this so it did not move to his own line has said it stayed on the same line and it took the same amount of width as it needed it's like this thing did not take up like a whole entire space so look if I were to continue typing after the strong to this it still it took up the space and needed that's a inline element well block line element just takes up a whole new line so that is bold now it's going to look at italics this is a table italicized then let's gonna look at sorry this now we're gonna look at underlined so underlined it which is gonna be the you tax really easy to remember now it's gonna look at a tag I haven't talked about sorry which is a small tag so basically dislike smalls your text up we will see in a second but we use the small ties so really easy I remember so first that we'll just use small small small now you can use actually use all these extra tags on your own but if so I could do strong this text is bold you could do that you could do but then these will have like their own type of styling like they won't be a paragraph tag like you can do this to this Texas italics and then you could also do this text is underlined but many times you won't want to do it with an element and now you can see these are inline elements so they don't go on their own line automatically so they just continue after one another even though they're on separate lines now let's talk about spacing I could press 100 inners and then even have a small tag down here and to save this and it still comes here but what happened to all these spaces I have like I worked so hard to create these well apparently whitespace does not matter to the browser instead for that reason we have something called line breaks now you will see I did not put a I did not put an ending time so I did not do this now that is in correct format but this is a self closing time so busy selfclosing tags close themselves like you won't need anything else so if I were to go ahead and create this break tag this is a line break you won't see anything happen but if I was to go ahead and do like a paragraph with lorem 20 and then like for like couple line breaks under that as well now you can do them on the same line and then we do lorem 10 again we have all this extra space due to this break so I could even to prove it to you do this and we still have extra space build our line break so there are auto closing tags so we can gonna talk about line breaks right now beforehand and say they're self closing and create and use the BR tag all right now let's going to move back so let's go back to the small tags I was talking about so let's go back up here to our disk and box now let's not talk about the highlighting example so this word is going to the we do mark tag highlight it and then voila just Texas highlighting now it's gonna do a subscript so this word is going to be a sub so just subscript and then this is a basically a subscript let me zoom in more this is a subscript basically but what though that so subscript is basically it goes below the word sorter and then we have another paragraph time this is gonna be a superscript basically like an exponent sooo first correct exactly so this is raised basically alright now we have talked about most of the text formatting I want to talk about grouping your elements but while we were talking on line breaks what if you want a straight line like your separate your content with well that's why what's like a charge exists so these are visiting lines to separate your content and they use the HR tab these are also self closing so so clothing so I can go in and put an HR between let's just sit here and if we get a pretty organizational line here now I'll move this so now let's go back and see where we could actually use the line HR so we can do a chart here HR here to separate our content width so we know what we're talking about this is all this this is all text formatting now if we go back our content looks a lot more organized like it's a lot easier to read instead of the other gibberish now here I kind of went on my own so I might want to do HR now so this is great right now at the moment so let's move on to grouping our elements so you want to group your elements a little like let's just say you had a blog article which we're about to write so there's an element for this is called a div so a div is basically and does nothing except it groups your elements so we can do div and then we can go ahead and group our elements so we'll go ahead and add a h1 say this is some text now we're running an article later but we can do like P then lorem xx and then you go see here this text will always be inside this div so it's a lot easier to see what's going on now how can we like get our groups our name so think back to elementary school when your teacher divided you guys into groups now inside of these groups you guys had to decide a name now basically that's what we're gonna do be doing we're gonna add an attribute to our div so an attribute to our discipline now these so attributes to a div that give it a name or called classes and ID's now you may be thinking what do these do well they actually they are therefore to identify a group of elements for a single purpose so basically for like multiple purposes or so you might we will catch on these classes and ID's in CSS more and JavaScript and by the way javascript is a programming language used with HTML so let's gonna create let's just create a h1 again we'll just call it hello and then a pair when Lauren like lorem 20 what's happening there and then let's create another paragraph to simulate this so Brenda have to paragraph let's add an HR to divide our content there so you can see we're like using what we're learning to help us learn more stuff now let's go add your view to this div so I'm gonna start with a class now a class is basically a name so let's just give this element like this whole entire group a name so we just called it the hello alright so now we can catch on this later with the hello but let's just create another one of this to show to simulate ID and an ID it's basically so basically the difference between ID and a div is that a div and sorry an ID in the class is that a class is you can be most used multiple time so let's just say we were saying that this is a article while she's saying no let's call this a hello live right just like we did before but let's just call now we can ID v to be more specific like this is all about your you like you don't have to use ID that don't even just rely on classes all the time but we can call this like hello this is a second hello but Hello is more my class is more like general so like you can use this class any else where you want when ID is unique to itself stuff like a driver's license is unique to you like you can give it to your son and tell them to drive now using what we have learned we can actually create a blog article so we can put an HR and then call it a blog article now it won't be the prettiest blog article but hey it'll be an article so let's start with a div and let me teach you a quick shortcut if after it if I put a dot so that's how you identify classes you're gonna after that dot you can actually create the class name so we can call it article tab and then I press ENTER here to get the spacing voila so our class our class is article now so it already gave that identification now inside of here let's put in a ch3 with some title and then let's do a small tag and we'll now let's gonna say it is post and usually use small tagging the blog for who was opposed to by so let's call it let's say it's post by nano and if I were to scroll down here we have this extra space in between bubbling get rid of that with CSS which we're not gonna get into right now and then we create a paragraph tag for the article content and dualarm 20y does not want to work there we have just created an article but lushes saying we want to link this to an external page so we use the a now whenever you're testing like you're building a website prototyping basically you can use a hash sign instead of an actual link so it will still work just like a normal link except it just won't go anywhere except we'll just take it to talk to page apparently yeah but it just doesn't go anywhere so you can have a link without it going anywhere so this is our mini blog article HR again and we have a blog article now you see how this line is sort of close to this well with CSS you could fix that but with HTML just put a blame break looks even now now we talked about lists which are great ways to organize your content but let's talk about tables now tables are a great way to organize your content but the tags for the table are pretty hard to remember and then we're also running out of time so let me going to create a table tag now this just identifies the table and then now we want a table head that is where the content will be bolded and that'll be like the top content of your table so let's do a tea head exactly you're behind remember this now let's create a table role so basically a row is this way call them this way but you don't create columns and you do create columns but you can create them right now so to create a table head column you do th and then let's go to fictional table for like a customer list so ID and for like they're like IDs like one two three four let's have another table head what column for our name and then for their phone number this is the end of your table head now also buddy now if I were to save this these columns are bolded that's the purpose of having th and T table head now how about a table body well we can do the same and then here's one thing I messed up I'm sorry you want to create a table also and copy this create a table row and then put it now that you look a lot better and then you're going to fix the indentation by using shift tab to go back now inside this table body when create a table row every time you're creating new row remember table row table book and then in stuff now we're going to change up a bit so we're going to create a regular table content so we're gonna do TD tag inside the CD tagging up some anything so we put one here for instance and then next TD tag I put Smith and then the next TD tag I put the number if I say hey you can see it displays here now this is very very ugly but this can be easily fixed with CSS so don't worry so let's create another table row and then in here I'll another TD they'll be one and then I'll have another TD which will be Smith and another TD which will be another weird phone number so I'll just come up with a weird one and then yeah sorry this should be Tom this should've been okay now let's gonna now let me teach you a little a visual studio code shortcut so if you're using those students code you can go ahead and highlight this TR edit press ctrl shift and then down now this will create another table row for you go to three and then this can be used on any line of code and then we'll do David at this and then we'll just do 99 now this looks pretty ugly but don't worry CSS can easily fix that now let's move on to something that I think many people should be excited about and that is buttons now apparently sorry but there's only one type of button as you can create and I'll be with a button tag and then we'll call this whoops a button is clicked and I was gonna create our HR here I've discussed earlier about now just like everything else the buttons can take attributes too so we'll do another button and then let's take an attribute of disabled and it'll say this abled as our name now you can see I cannot no longer click on that now let's create another button and we can do it we can give it up attribute or reset and then Risa alright let's move on to the next type of stuff now I'm gonna start speeding up a bit because I think you guys got the drill of HTML and then if you want to look into this more on future I want to review or something there's a really helpful website so let me just show you guys you can go ahead and visit w3 schools calm and then they have an HTML reference list so everything I have talked about can probably be found in here if not then I mean I probably talked something wrong but most likely it should be found in here if you want to review it can be easily found in here so let's just move on to forms and then we'll go ahead and like then we'll have to start we'll just move on so let me find my notes all right so forth so for form a form has starts with the form tag so when you think both as soon as I press tab on visuals through your code it gives me this action attribute now by default it's not like so if you have created a website with Webley Wix you would have never had to dealt with this so like you go to this create a form and then it'll be submit when ever come someone comes you can submit it and you won't have to give me care about it apparently but now in HTML is all about your own database so like so right now you can be cannot submit this form anywhere but I'll show you really cool way you could submit this form but it won't submit it will instead will just create like our own search box sort of thing for Google search box so you'll see later in the tutorial so and here usually people will pull like form dot PHP or something but since we have none of that we can go and get rid of that we won't have even care about that so inside of these form tasks now inside of a form you might you might see the label book let's go and create our a chart here before doing that so inside we can gonna put a label now our label how the automatic attribute as well this is a four attribute now you now the four attribute is basically the name of us so I want to create feel for first name but if I save nothing shows because the 4rq boot is not displayed to the user instead between these tags is whatever displayed to the user so instead of label first name now you do not need this if you do not want it and then it'll still look the same but hey Japan now it's going to create our input now you will see an attribute is known as text a type which is text so now there's different types of types in HTML let me show you so so we just got a form here's our input now you're going to input unless anything almost anything so now you will see this is on the same line but how do we learn to like break your lines or some sort well we learned with the break the BR tag which is line break now this is still touching which I do not like another line break this still looks ugly but I see ie 34 into CSS so it's no big deal why so now someone now there's more types so one of the types of input there is an email type which is amazing now let me talk about the shortcut I just did so I did input and then colon and then you have all these types seriously you're gonna play all all around but now I can type in the type on one so let's do email type and then press tab it gives these two extra so we learned about one attribute which is the ID attribute and then the second attribute is the name attribute so basically you're just giving this field a name like you just gave yourself a name when you were born now you're giving this thing a name which you're not even worried about and then it creates an email field but let's gonna create a label so we know what we're talking about so email now this looks ugly break and then you need another break here and then we need another break here to situate that issue there we go now by default this comes with some validation so I cannot I can just do Jo at gmail.com this will let me through but if I were to do like Jo if I press ENTER yeah we're going to need some advice so don't worry let me make sure that I'm not screwing up all right yeah we're gonna get some abundancy now lets going to talk about the summit but I'm like because we need one right now apparently so it's an input type so we do input summit for this is shortcut now by what these shortcuts are because we were using Emmet which is preinstalled and visuals to go so no needed work now there's value attributes a new one so if I were to just save we have a blink button but the value is what's displayed to the user so we'll say some it there I was going to add another line break to make it look good so now if I were to just say Jo and click Submit it gives me this amazing alerts like pre color everything so well you know you might want to use an email attribute the next time you do it now there's one type of attribute I think you're gonna love and that is you just have to put this here and this is the required attribute so if I were to submit this form without it which apparently did apparently but let's just say I put like a a a and then click Submit apparently I didn't work oh wait we put this required on the submit button so obviously you click on the submit button why did I even do that so now if I were to sum it please fill this field out this is a required field now if I were just say a it still it's like there's odd sign you can't so I can do act and then it's still bugging me saying that's not completely I can do Gmail calm and it'll probably let me submit yep probably submit and it did but apparently did not go anywhere because we have nothing to find so now you could now we can sit here all day defining attributes and all but if same website again now in here they have they talked about forms so if I were just go ahead and show you so this is under the HTML tab and then we went to HTML forms or input attributes here that so we just go into forms we have like hundreds of difference so I will talk about not any more of these forms but you can get them all from here like copy and paste Lorne it's pretty simple stuff and then you have improved attributes which I talked about one right now and that would so you have a disabled attribute your size max links and then you have like autocomplete your min max disabled amazing so quick we just talked about it required and let me talk about one more attribute which is the placeholder so let's just say you wanted your customer to enter this data in some sort of format so we use placeholder and we'll say enter first name and then we'll like have like xxx to show it and then like they can enter so that was amazing but before so before this even existed in HTML you had to do this through the JavaScript and then now there is one type of attribute which is a value attribute and we'll say enter first name but you will find this immediately this is basically playing tax this is not anything so when you click on it you'll still have it that's why placeholder is a valuable resource because it works it just works so let's quickly do a select list so I'm not leaving you hanging anywhere so a form select list I will quickly speed through this so we have a select and then you have all these extra attributes which once again they're now required by default we do option and then let me teach you omit abbreviation shortcut so if I were to do option and then I want to create three options I just do the asterisk sign and then three if I took that we got three options but they do nothing apparently so I just have to do option one option two and then option three and then here's our select list but let's just say but sometimes on websites you're not allowed to click on the first one and then there's like a weird new type so we can actually have an option and then we can have an attribute of disabled and then we'll say select like we're gonna do like select to make it look professional but you will soon to realize it's only visible here not anywhere else so being added another attribute which is a selected attribute save and then this is preselected so this option will be preselected and then your user cannot click on this they have to choose one of this one of these all right now this does look weird since the submit button this is after the submit so I can just copy the submit button and then move it down here alright so now let's talk about text areas which or four messages basically still be kind of label for message and it's a message and then yeah we're gonna you line breaks apparently because CSS is not available at the moment so if I were to do in line break there so inside of here let's do a text area now text areas are not self closing and I can get rid of all these attributes you want able to care about them and then you have to put nothing but for a line break and then here this is extendable and you said this is a message it has this weird font which can also be fixed with CSS so no big issue right now we're going to CSS later now let's go ahead and yeah there's a lot of solace so there's a lot of what's called input types that you don't have to worry about now let's talk about images so we do if we talk about so we can create an image tag with IMG tap now in now this is a new attribute just like our href attribute this is a source attribute so inside of here we put our image so we can just go to Google and say image literally with our images and just find a good image so I like let's just say we like that image I just click on a copy image or address and paste it in here and if I say we will hopefully see it but this number one this image is way too big number two let's talk about this attribute the alternate text attribute so if I were to say image of night sky let's just say you know if it was probably not and if I save you will see nothing yet but let's just say there was an issue loading the image let's just say I had a mistake and I made a stupid mistake well we will have this text and stuff so you just still get the message out to your user in some way all right now let's go ahead and so let me go in same images and it's gonna do a break time to actually space it out all right so now we're going to do that our nap ball creating a nav bar no I think you're gonna be pretty excited about learning by the nav bar so basically nav bar has an HTML tag of math if I do mouse inside of here it's an unordered list now in now won't create links so we use the a tag inside of a lie and then in here we don't specify where we want to go so index.html is gonna be our home so now here is where you put it home so we just click on home we're back to our home page now let's create a new page now to create a new page of an HTML document you go here a new file inside the same directory the same folder about dart HTML now let me teach you a vs code shortcut is or M a shortcut in other words if you do shift 1 or exclamation point basically now you will see M an abbreviation just click on new tab and you get a predefined template ready to go so I'm going to say this my about page and I'm ready to rock and roll I'd say about something just say about pain now let's head back to index.html and let's create another navbar item and we called about our HTML and then I do about given about now if I click on about what about that yay so we have just created our about page so this is really cool now I want to go ahead and get to talk about basically like section structuring and everything so if I was to go back to this website and I want to show you guys I'm just if I go back to the home page and I do like learn there will be an image here or it used to be there I hope still there it's probably yeah so exactly so it gives you this thing gives you a lot of information like you don't even need my hope you could just have read this but you know it's great to watch a video and learn you can do it anywhere almost someone's a formatting where would I be exactly it's somewhere definitely but let's just look it up on Google so we'll do a HTML page structure probably somewhere something like this if I can there there we go this is what I'm looking for so if I were to just open this in a new tab so you can just do open image a new tab so I can zoom in now so you'll see this is how you like basically create a web page you have your header on top nav and then section article footer aside so now I do not use the article tag I use so basically I create this whole area as a section this is my horse right now Bart is my aside and it's my footer so to give you an idea what I mean I mean none of this will be structured this way until you CSS so I can go in and structure it header now inside this header I like having my navbar so I just do now have now inside of my navbar so you can see they use the exact same time now the inside navbar we can create our nav bar just as I've taught you guys and we'll do index.html and then this will be our home page and then let's do about dot HTML that will be my about page now if I were to look back here in the sandbox and let's go into about me this might include on home and we're here yay and then outside of my nav and outside of my header now let's have a title quickly so inside the header let's put an h1 for inside a header obviously I'm saying my about page and then if I was to go to about it is there now it's outside my header loss critter section inside this section we might want a paragraph that says this is an about a section and then we have another paragraph for like lorem 20 30 something like that and then outside the section let's put it aside so this will be like your sidebar but it won't look like a sidebar so if you occur in like a blog or something you Marvin like have links to external categories are talking about something so you might want to Li and then you'll see like item one as you're a sidebar or like it would be like item two there so this like your snap aside to even though it doesn't look like it now footer there's something really cool about the footer now I want you to know so I can do copyright so this inside a paragraph tag now if you do now we one create that see with the circles of the copyright symbol you can do ampere stamp copy semicolon and then we do 2019 and we get that simple so you know a little trick and then we can do all rights reserved now on maybe the best webpage but hey is pretty good all right so so far we can create a website I mean not the best looking but hey it's a website so why do you care so now let's move on to the CSS so the thing I've been bragging about all along and you'll see why I've been bragging about so we could apply CSS directly to this file but I want to keep just like a separate notes for you guys so go ahead and close this folder in your text editor and go in and close out of your text editor and then going to now you can keep your browser open but this one close the tab because that live service off and then everything I talk about is fountain can be found at w3 schools thing so let's just go back to our folder structure and and then we're gonna move on to basically where you store that project which was right on my desktop HTML sandbox and let's move now it's been create a new folder so outside of HTML sandbox so we're in here when do needle and then folder run call this CSS underscore sandbox and then here just going to open this with your code editor so create a new file so now we're going to start with our HTML because you need an index on an HTML file to um you know what's a call like link your CSS to because you cannot create a website without the index.html file so now let's create a style dot CSS file but before you do that create a new folder for your CSS stay organized one word stay organized inside of that folder you can gonna create your style of CSS all right so now so now let's move back to the nefesh ml we can use that shortcut i've taught you and then what's gonna name is our CSS sandbox now we're gonna medially go press open open with live server now this will open not if you in your default browser but I will going to open up on here so now inside of here I want to create a header and that was pretty div and we'll give it a class of header by the way you can give this also a class of main header or an ID also of main header so I can have like multiple so instead like header main so we can have like multiple classes and ID's between and I won't code in one more class let's just say not just only main header you can say like title you can do that too that'll be two classes is that one so inside this header I want to create an h1 that says my web site alright so once again very ugly looking download resets the size so it'll be easier now we gave this thing a class of header but before we do that you can actually target these elements B so let me teach you one way of doing CSS and that is with the style of attribute so adding a style now let's just say I want to make is the color of its own font color so they'll be color red if I save CSS applied alright very lucky now we could even do let's just say font size and make that 20 pixels there but that's not big different hundred pixels there actually be a lot better to read all right but that looks very ugly so now you can do all that the second way of applying CSS is so basically our main goal is to keep your CSS separate from your HTML so if I were to create a style tag in there twice now learn this new syntax so what should say on target this header so just the element header so I would use header curly brace braces and enter so we can get this nice format inside of here you can have multiple CSS Styles per attribute so you will see I targeted the element header here but if I want to target the class of header I put a dot for class let's just I want to target the idea of header which it doesn't exist right now but you could add it hash tag for ID alright so real easy right now we're just targeting regular header and then we want the color of it to be green alright doesn't look really good by red so get the point now the third way to supply CSS which is the most recommended is your external but how do we link this file inside of here because if I were to go ahead and do header and if I did color to be red nothing's done like nothing's happening here and that is because we haven't linked it so if I do a link tag now I can say start I can now get to go to this folder so the C is inside the CSS folder so if I were to do CSS style of CSS if I press save we have a color all right so that's now being learned about one attribute which is color now how am I gonna get rid of this now the first thing I want to do is get rid of something I want to get rid of this default margin that a house and padding whatever it has so to get rid of something default so like basically the roots are like the root of your root is a fasters curly braces and not even sent margin zero so no more margin so now is gonna get rid of padding which I'll explain later so now explain padding quickly it's gonna create a div with the ID so let's use ideals practice already skills and call a box and more specifically box one so now box one it doesn't display yet because we had to create box one because is it empty so there's an attribute of sounds gonna do a background color attribute which will make it red now still doesn't display because there is nothing in here so if I was to put an age let's just I was to put hello it would display with the background of red but that's not very helpful now I'm trying to display how padding works so I'm inside I'm just gonna saying I can put box basically all right so you see this element so it has box right now this back has a background color of red so with margin if I was use margin watch what happens so I can do margin top and let's do 10 pixels we move from the top so this thing moved away from the top if I were to do 30 pixels it really went further away from the top if I was to do margin bottom with you and I see let's do margin left this thing move left away but let's just say I want to keep this red color consistent right like I did not want to move the red close by when you move the element inside so I can do padding top it'll be closest to 10 pixels we had this color I'm gonna be paddingbottom that is we had that color too I'm gonna do padding left ten pixels we got that I can do padding right which you won't see at a moment but ten pixels now you can see that all this it's the same ten pixels so there's an easier way to write this so you could have done padding basically and instead 10 pixels 10 pixels 10 pixels for all four but being it was shortened to see one more 10 pixels and then if I were to comment it so basic comment this is the same shortcuts of control and a forward slash but this is how comments look like so there's app for slash asterisk asterisk for slash so if I were to comment that out it's the same to prove it to those of you who don't believe comments do anything get rid of the same patent so I can do 20 pixels same thing so this is pretty consistent so that was padding and margin so I can get rid of that now I want to create a nicelooking header so if I can go now the font let me talk mention about font this font is very ugly Times New Roman I do not like it I'll be surprised if you like it so let's target our body all right this this is like the main so I want the font of the whole entire web page should be the same if I can do body and let's do font family now by default visual studio code gives you all these options Alfonse and now let's gonna choose sansserif this is much better in my in my vision oh so this looks a lot better now let's gonna give this a background color oh let's just give it so now it's not all about colors so let's not like that by the way yeah sorry so to give this my website a background color about we just learned something you can get body go back on coloring the whole webpage will be that color so if I was to get rid of that and let's target our header but more specifically on targeted class so we've learned so I want here's one rule use classes and ID's more than the actual element will make your life a lot easier so dot header so inside of this header we'll go ahead and say well I want souls to save to get rid of that let's do a background color of hash tag see you cc or three three three sorry all right now you can get all these hex these are called hex hex colors so we're gonna do a hex color and then like pick your own color so Google has a pretty good format for choosing so colors so like this is your hexadecimal value that you would use alright so let's move back to our web page and then now here's one thing you realize that you're realizing there's not much space the font isn't the right color everything so if you recall from the first example you can change the color of elements it's a font color white I'm still this looks kind of ugly so let's do padding because we want the background color to extend it listed 10 pixels padding so all around not too bad those do 20 pixels even better so this looks a lot better than this this is a lot now lets them do something more better so red looks a lot vibrant now let's add some content to play around with so let's so I want to style a list or more specifically let's top buttons so something that's very exciting to style will be a button and let's go say button now the first thing we do not want inside the header we want to criticize ssin there and then if we can fix this by shifttab now first thing you'll realize when I'm zoomed in only a hundred percent so normal the button is really small has no margin so we might want to use margin on the button so let's gonna target a button because buttons are like general so you don't specifically want like you'll want a button to be like the same everywhere like you want to want your one area have a button that's like nine huge and another one be small you want them like all similar so for this button this give us some margin Barwon and i want to give this a margin top of 10 pixels all right margin left 10 pixels now to increase select the size of this button you have two ways you can use height and the width property so we can do height of this to be like 20 pixels and then the width to be 20 pixels but as really small so let's do 200 pixels and then just to be hundred but that's pretty big still it's a fixing pistol all right this is pretty okay let's do 25 and then just to be 75 I can see I can play around with this button all day but we have a better way to do this I mean just do padding basically and then for a top and bottom so on so let's see let me show you yeah so let's do top and bottom padding to be let's do 30 pixels top and bottom padding and then 40 pixels left and right all right that's kind of big exactly so you don't split these in half since they're not what you think they'll be it's still big but you're accumulating music all right this is a good side buddy now if I were to zoom in this button has a weird border so we can get rid of that border or going to create a new border so because a border property and unless it say none no border all right we got rid that border yay now let's go ahead and do a good nice background color I did not like the background go let's do the hashtag see see all right let's do three two three and let's give it a color attribute a white so the text inside is white and then looks a lot better than used to but in a hundred percent actually looks a lot better let's give it a radius border radius like make us circular so we can do border radius and then it's dependent on pixels so let's do five pixels border radius and you can already see this buttons kind of rounded looks a lot better let's do ten pixels we need to even do 30 pixels now looking the better we can even do 50 pixels now you can do percentages so I'm going to look 50 percent which will make it like a weird circle you can do a hundred percent which is the same but you can actually do 25 percent yeah is like your weird stuff I think 25 pixels looks pretty good but five pixels looks better if you like a box button where I go along and I wrong all right so our border radius is 5 pixels so this looks pretty nice but here's one thing might be realizing there is no like cursor place like if you were to click on like you don't necessarily need a cursor click since most of Chrome doesn't do it but like if you were on a website and you want to click on something your cursor turns like that well that's why you get a property of pointer no cursor and then we can say pointer so I want to cursor be pointer when you on it so whenever on this button little cursor yeah now so you will see that most buttons like anything that you almost hover on hover is the new ones like when you put your mouse over as a different color or like a different style to it so to access this in your styling we do button hover so almost anything can have a hover State so with this let's change the background color to be transparent so but then we lose the text so we want to change it to black all right still good but that doesn't look very beautiful now let's add a border of let's do late one pixel border so we want to solve it and then we want it black all right those do that all right now bad but you'll see it's kind of moving and to show you that is actually moving do a paragraph or lorem 10 let me share all right look watch what happens to the paragraph the paragraph moves and that is because there's no border defined previously so it adds an extra one pixel to it which moves everything by one pixel so for that reason you can have a one pick so you want to have a one pixel border that just solid as well and transparent so no color and then now it looks a lot better now this is also very fastmoving so you can have a transition property now don't worry if you do not understand everything all this can be found in the w3 schools so now what trap is it smoothly feeds in so it kind of had that animation so basically get this done and animation amazing so you have that as well which I mean looks amazing I like stir this all day so we have to style the button now you guys you get like the basic purpose of CSS so far now we can actually so I want to go in and style form so forms are very ugly by default and you can see this text like she looks pretty good if I show you the section actually looks pretty good so let's go to style form so form so once again we have that action which we don't need now the label for first name so let's recreate that form we were trying to create before and this time we're not have no line breaks no none that so input text and then look how it placeholder will sing into her first name and then was to label yarn so for last name last name and it'll be like input type text and then we live like an art placeholder for entire last name and then have another label for email and it will mean looks an email address and then let's do input type of email and then have a place holder of enter email address let's gonna all right so I did not apply any styling on this and let's have an input for submit and put submit with the value of submit and then let's give it a class so now let me go to move back so looks like I say classes are general what if we give this a class with dot so we make this element styling into a dart so a class based just for class so this button change back but what if we give this to class a button and you will see our submit button gets default because the default thing now it's gonna make our button so we want to make a display so we want it to be a block line element all right so block so this is on its own line automatically right now it's gonna play with our form that with you earlier create we just created so we do form and let's start so now I want to give us a margin all round of 10 pixels so this is moved around but I want a margin top to be even more so let's make a 20 pixel margin top all right now let's do nothing else here let's move on to our inputs so you're gonna like nest elements just like an HTML your nesting elements here now this is an input we do not want to play with this so if we can do bracket and we just give it a type so I wanted to type to be only the inputs our text and then we can do a comma for another one and we'll stay input that and we'll say type equals for email because and then now we can do curly braces so we can actually target to three elements all at the same time for the same silent just because of that alright so before we move on to this let's target our labels and make them a display a block and then let's make them have an all around margin of ten pixels but only on the top and bottom not on the left or right all right let's give this five pixels instead all right so let's give these forms inside a padding of all around of so on not all right so on top and bottom I want 20 pixels and I'm left and right let's just do yes I could so 20 pizzas tops in bottom but nothing on the left or right all right that looks pretty ugly ten I think eight will look amazing there's seven there got seven looks a lot better all right don't worry we'll get a margin too so we'll get the marginal ten pixels and then zero left to right all right let's actually give this a margin three pixels luckily that was a lot better so now let's give it a width so there's a new attribute so we talked about this for width let's give it a 100% width so the whole entire page basically now this looks okay so we actually just created a really good form so test yeah I know whatever now let's give it a border radius so let's make a look even better let's give it a border radius of five pixels now you will see this ugly stuff so we just got a very ugly looking form but I can actually do border and let's fix that so we do one pixel border which is gonna be solid it'll make it hashtag CCC all right so pretty good so far but let's give it margin so let's give it padding on the left or right of one pixel alright so that looks a lot better it's a little sulfur here's our form so this looks a lot better so we did like nano and they're productions and then like nano productions add in gmail.com plate what is our email address yeah I'll figure that out but yeah so basically we just dialed our form so this may look a lot better broad kind of zoom in like if you were to zoom out a bit so this looks a lot better trust me like this looks a whole lot better than the previous form if you have seen alright so this is most we talked about a lot of attributes so far now let's go ahead now table styling lovely can actually create a quick table alright so I do not want to waste much time though so table inside this table let's just go ahead and do a tea head Deonte age only like first name day something like last name and then tea body well I like tea or teeny well like love it um and then anything will be Smith then he another table row you know like TD will be like John and then another TD would be like role whatever alright so we have this form now first of all the font looks a lot better so this looks pretty good I don't know what to say but alright so with the table let's make this a width of a hundred percentage like alright there we go we got a lot more spacing I'll give this a border or one pixel solid and let's do like hashtag thing to do alright pretty good but I want to give us some margin so let's give it actually let me teach you something real cool so if I were to do margin of nine to five same width of ninety percent and if we did margin Auto it's already Center so basically we have centered this and one way or the other and then let's target our tables T arms let's see if they can get a border of one pixel solid I should get moving alright so we can do no TDs and th there we go so we just got a border for our elements but we can actually fix this issue by just giving them a background color background color Alysha st. hash so I have four or four and four all right there we go this looks a lot better table and yeah we just got in really handy table or let's just have now we can actually play around so if we look back our is th so we did ttable th elements you can just say we want to board a bottom on them a 1 pixel solid and I should I see anything right 3 3 3 exactly so that look hashtag for anything so this will look pretty good too still not bad if I do see some myself at all very nice with me so let's move so this is basically not everything else ESS obviously if I was to check w3schools there is like a bucket load of more stuff to cover trust me but this is enough to get you started on like like you can just read this for a bit and then like the archer boots we have talked about can actually help you with everything else so I we have basically just like created like a short cheat sheet of like the basic like introduction to these new attributes that you have never ever heard about but this is amazing so far now in this view we will not cover of creating a website so of all day but check out a video sooner on my channel which we will learn on which you can create we will like create a website using everything that we have learned alright so check out Nano productions for that type of video and then we'll I'll see you
