hi guys welcome back to today i'm doing a crash course on foundation now foundation is a css responsive framework that makes every website available on mobile tablet and desktop devices my name is shadow and i'm going to be showing you guys today how to implement a css sponsor framework called foundation now for this tutorial i'm using specifically foundation version 6 made by zurb let's get straight into the crash course i'm gonna go to google or your browser and you're gonna type in foundation dot zerb.com it should bring you to this website if it doesn't look like this might have been outdated so we're gonna go ahead and click download we're gonna download the complete because it just gives us everything click download it should give you a zip file down here now you're gonna go to your desktop and you're going to click you're going to right click go to new folder you're going to name i'm going to name this foundation you can name it whatever you want back to your browser and go to your um your foundation download file click extract all click browse go to desktop click foundation click select folder and then click extract and what that does is basically takes all the files that we just downloaded and put it into our desktop file called foundation and we come down here and we read a little bit about it and how it works and it down here and it shows sites and emails you can also do foundation for emails but for this tutorial we're just going to do sites so we're going to want to do is you're going to go over to getting started then you're going to click sites kitchen sync and you should be in this giant long list called kitchen sink now kitchen sink is every element available in foundation all on one page as you see if you scroll down there's tons of tons of stuff you can put on to it we're going to go through all of it what you're going to want to do now is you're going to want to go down to your editor i'm using adam in this example and you're going to want to click open a project and we're going to select on foundation it should bring us okay so what we get is this large html file pretty long so what we're gonna want to do is we're going to want to delete everything out of the body tags keep the body tags delete everything inside of the body tags except for the javascript and you should be left with this okay so what we want to going to do next is we're going to build some simple form validation inside of foundation now we're gonna just start off with some form tags so we're gonna select that we're gonna write perform just like that we're gonna put some javascript data values in here so we're gonna put data dash abide and no validate we're gonna put a div inside of here we're gonna give it a class called grid x and grid dash margin dash x now inside of that dip we're gonna put another div and we're just gonna give it a class of cell we're gonna make another div we're gonna give it a class called alert blur all out we're gonna give it a style display none we're gonna go back and we're gonna add some javascript values data dash abide dash alert okay so next you're going to make another div and you're going to call it you're going to get a class of grid x and grid margin x and it's the same thing as this one up here it's just how foundation sorts out its uh their divs you're gonna put another div in here you're gonna give it a class called cell small dash 12. what you're going to do next is inside of this div you're going to put a label and you're going to put number number required now you're going to write an input tag and set the type to text or keep it as text and then put a placeholder of one two three four since we are validating numbers and we want the user to know what kind of input to put and then you're gonna put something called area dash describe describe i'm gonna set it equal and inside these are you're gonna put example help text make sure you capitalize the last two in camel case next you're going to put a required pattern so you're going to type in required and then you're going to put a space and then pattern and you're going to set it equal to number and then you can just take out this name and value it's not needed inside of there now next you're going to make a span and you're going to give it a class of form dash air and inside of this you can basically put whatever you want for when the user misspells something or something so you can say yo you've forgot something um like that so when there's an error message it'll just give you this this is basically the error message and after the span make sure you close out the label and after that label you can put paragraph tag and uh give it a class of help text so we're gonna put class help dash text save it and then you're gonna give it an id of example help text to make sure you camel case those and then next you're going to put whatever you want however you want to help the user so i'm gonna put here is how you fill it out and then just save it it's whatever help text you really want to put into it okay so next you're gonna wanna make a div you're going to give it the class the same one as the one up here you can just copy it and paste save it you're going to put a label and you're just gonna put password required and then after that you're gonna put an input and you're gonna put the type as pass word make sure the label is outside on the very end make sure you add an id and set it to password and you can set the placeholder to whatever you want as long as it looks like a password so like um like let's say if this was a password and we're gonna do the same thing we did up here with the area described by so we're just gonna copy this and paste it down here and then we're gonna write after it required and we could take out these name and values because we don't need them and after that we're going to put a span and add a class to it and in that class we're going to call it form air and then we're just going to put i'm required make sure your span and label end after that if you want you can indent them and after the span and label we're going to put a paragraph tag we're going to give it the class as help text and then we're going to give them the id as example help text camel cased inside of this we're going to put enter a password please now if you open it up in your browser the html file you see you get these two uh input fields in here now if you're the type in something other than numbers let's say abc and press enter it's going to say yo you forgot something and if you go to this password area and you just press enter it's going to say i'm required so it basically validates your form to make sure there's an input now these are just placeholders but other than the placeholders it's pretty much empty and you press enter and it says i'm required and if you put letters inside of the numbers it's gonna say you forgot something in your form so that's just some simple form validation for numbers and passwords you can always just change it as you see in the code it's pretty much a pattern up here and we can even add a comment right here um we just say uh about error message ballot right here and this is basically what validates it and then down here is the number valid date and then after that there is the password validate and basically what you can do is you can copy any of these and just change the classes and stuff you can always check the foundation website too it'll also tell you how to change it but these are just some simple form validation for uh foundation okay so up next is the accordion menu or just the accordion and so we're just gonna add a comment down here we're just gonna call it and i'm just gonna tab it down here so basically what we're gonna first do is put it in an unordered list and we're gonna put a class up here we're gonna call it accordion and then we're gonna put a data value called data core in inside of here we're going to put a list item tag and then we're going to give it class name called accordion item is active and then we're just going to give it a javascript value called data accordion item after that we're going to put a link so we're just going to type in a an anchor tag we're going to give it a class and we're going to give it the class called accordion title we're just gonna call this one accordion one and then after that we're gonna put a div we're gonna give this one a class called accordion dash content and then we're going to give it a javascript value called data dash tab dash content and then after this we're going to put a paragraph tag and we're gonna go give it a class next we're gonna put a paragraph tag and we're just gonna say hello world for this one and then we're just gonna put a link and we're just going to put link in it and it's just going to be an empty link now if we go to our website and reload we get this little panel right here but as you see there's only one so we're going to go back into our code and copy and paste it so we get more accordions so see we're back in here and we're going to copy and paste all of this actually we're only going to copy and paste what's inside of the list item we're just going to do it three times and then at the end you're just gonna put the closing tag for the unordered list and then if you go back to your code you see here you can minimize each tab so it's like an accordion and you can open them up by going like this it's pretty cool so we so we're gonna customize it a little bit more so instead of this being panel one we're gonna put panel two we're gonna take out this uh dummy text and we're gonna call this one panel two this one back to panel one this one panel three we're gonna take out all this dummy text and now if we go back to it we reload we get all of these where it's like this and we can customize it even more changing these i'm saving it and then we reload and you see you get it all organized with its content inside of it so accordion one panel one they're just empty links and you can open up each one and it gives you a new panel now up next are something called badges badges are an interesting kind of uh element inside of foundation so i'm just gonna show you what they are so let's just put a comment saying badges and we're gonna make a span tag we're gonna give it a class we're gonna call it primary badge and inside of that we're just gonna put the letter a as capitalized so we can view it and if you go over to your browser and you click reload you see down here down in the bottom left corner of your screen you should see the letter a and tying up inside of a little circle now we can copy this code make another version of it instead of primary we can do something called secondary secondary badge and then we can just put a b go back to the page and reload you get this you get this gray badge down here do now i've added a a div that has a margin bottom of 200 pixels just so you guys can view the badges easily now if we go down here and make another span or copy and paste it instead of primary or secondary we're going to do warning and then we're going to put this one with a c save it go to your web page and click reload and you'll get a yellow one with the letter c inside of it now if you go back to your code make another one there's also another class called alert and alert badge and success badge and if you reload you see you have all different colors of badges and the purpose of a badge is kind of like when something goes successfully or some sort of warning it shows up this badge next to like some words saying your form did not validate and it's has a red badge to it it can signify something about your form or about something you're trying to fill out these are also just great little decorations but if i zoom out to normal you can almost barely see them and i don't know why that is i don't think it's meant for reading i think i think it's meant just for the color and for signifying that something's not correctly filled out so up next we have buttons and we're just going to start off by putting a comment saying buttons or just button we're going to start off by obviously making a button and we're going to keep the type as button but we're going to take away the the name of the button because we don't need the name then we're going to give it a class called button now if you look at your uh website and you reload it you see down here you get an empty blue box that's because you have to put text inside of it so we're just gonna put button and if you go back and reload you see you have a button down here now i'm gonna add that padding back in here just so that we can get so you can see it clearly we reload as you see it's down here now you can give each button a type of class that changes the color or look of the button so for example if we copy this paste it and put a second or um success button and you reload it gives you a blue button if we were to paste it again and say alert button with a space and reload it you would get a red one you can also do the same for uh sizing so you can do tiny button and it gives you a tinier button or you could do a large button will give you even bigger button and you can even do things like expanded button so if we go to the class and put expanded button reload you see it takes up the whole width of the screen you can also have a small button too so it's in between the tiny and large button so if you just put small button and you reload you get this medium sized button and these are basically all the buttons obviously they're not linked to anything because we didn't uh put a hyper reference into here but you can link these two different things such as exists such as a success page or an error page take up the whole bottom of a portfolio object or you can just have different sizing buttons and colors they all have automatic hover and whenever it's like a green button or a black button it'll turn to white text or black text next we're going to do something called call outs now callouts are like little messages that show up on your screen they're not really messages they're more like sections so i'ma show you what they are and how they're useful now we're gonna um just put a comment like always and we're gonna just call this call out and then just indent it here and then we're gonna make a div and we're gonna have the class as call out we're gonna put an h5 and we're just gonna say hello world and then we're gonna put a paragraph tag we're just gonna say this is a call out we're gonna save it and you know just for fun we're gonna put a link we're just gonna say link now if we go to our browser you see down here we have a call out it's just a simple little section that we have that says hello world this is a call out and a link which does nothing and but what we can do with it is we can change it so let's copy this and we're going to set um actually just copy the the callout part not the um the margin we're gonna do call out warning and it gives us this yellow call out now we can do this for success and alert too so if we do call out success and call out alert and we reload you get the green one and the red one which are just basically um like like the buttons and the badges success and um warning now there's also a secondary one that shows the gray if we um but call out suck on dairy we save it we reload you get this grayish kind of one now another thing too about this is there's also a primary one where you can set it back to its default called calm call out primary and if you save and you reload you get back to this blue one there's the difference between just call out and call out primary and secondary obviously alert warning and success are completely different but you always have to watch out for these um these class changes so in foundation there's things called close boxes or just closeouts what you can basically do with them is you can add them to callouts for example and you can be able to close out of a call out and wipe it from your screen and i'm going to show you how to do that so what you're going to want to do is you're going to want to add a data value after your class called data dash close level then after that you're going to want to add a button so just type in a button and you can keep the type as button and you can take out the name you're going to add a data value to this called data close we're going to add an area label before the data close so area dash label i'm going to set that equal to you're gonna write close alert and you're gonna give it a class called close button and save the file after this you're going to make a span inside of the first span tag you need to put area dash hidden and you can set it equal to true colon and then save the file now you're going to want to put this span you're going to copy it and then you're going to put it inside of the closed i mean you're going to put it inside of the button and then you're going to save now if you go to your website now if you check your web browser you should see this little x over here and when you click it it just disappears now when you reload the page it obviously comes back because it's not saved into your local data or caches but there's a way you can do that but you can basically exit out of any call out you want just by adding those data variables and the classes now make sure you do wrap the variables into the div so make sure there's one large div around the whole thing like in here i added a div so it would close off the call out make sure you put a div so you close out the call out and the close button and the span and yeah basically that's how you add an exit out button or a a closeout tab on any call out okay so up next we're going to do a drop down pane now drop down pane is basically where you click the button and it shows a little message below it these can be used for many things such as errors with badges or panels you can use this as a little help text so we're gonna i'm gonna show you how to do this so first we're gonna scroll down after all the call outs we're gonna make a comment or tab it in and we're gonna call it drop down pane and save it and then first we're going to put a button we're going to leave the type alone we're just going to take out the name so we don't need it we're going to give it a class called button so class button this just gives primary button standards we're gonna put data dash toggle and set it equal to we're gonna name it to example dash drop down and now inside of this button we're just gonna put um drop actually we're just gonna say toggle drop down and after this button we're going to make a div it's going to have the class drop down dash pane we're going to give it the id of example dash drop down and then we're going to give it data dash drop down and then we're just going to call this one drop down pain and if we go to our website this should be working and down in the bottom right you should see this little button saying toggle drop down if you click it and scroll down you get this little text bubble saying drop down pane now if we center this it works a little easier and if we add padding so we're going to do that just to show for a full example now we're going to give this um now we're going to put this in inside of the larger div so we're going to put div we're going to copy all of this inside of here and we're going to just um we're not going to give this a class we're just going to do inline styling we're going to do um display flex and then we're going to do just if i dash content center and text dash align center and we're just going to add margin 15 pixels if we save this this should give it a nice look to it so as you see it has pretty good but we're going to add some more margin to it so that it centers more up we're just going to say 25 and if you reload it looks nicer now if you click it you get this little text below it saying drop down pane now if we want to see the full example we're going to add about 50 and then we're just going to do from margin we're going to do margin bottom that way we get what we want we reload we click it says drop down pane and we've clicked the button again it goes away just like a help text or an error so up next is floating classes and we're going to be floating buttons to left or right so first we're going to add a comment and we're going to just say flow buttons we're going to put floating buttons and then just indent it a little and then what you're going to do first is just put you're going to put button you're going to take out the type and you're gonna actually you can keep the type you're gonna take out the name you're gonna add class as just button then you're gonna put a space and then float dash left and then you're gonna put inside of the button just some text saying float left and if you go to your browser you should have a button floating to the left now as you see down here you have a button floating to the left also you don't always have to use just the normal um primary button you can always go like you can always go uh success button and make it a green button or even a an alert button so alert button left and then you can just copy this and let's say we want this to be a success button and we're just going to make it float to the right we're just going to change the text saying right we go back to our tab reload you have a green button floating on the right and a red button floating on the left and those are basically the floating classes for buttons so up next are labels and labels are basically almost like the badges but you can actually put a word inside of them and be able to read the word so i'm gonna show you what that is so we're gonna make a comment and we're just gonna put labels and then indent so what you're going to first want to do is you're going to put a span you're going to give it a class called primary label and then inside of that you're going to put primary label and then you save it if you go to your browser as you see at the bottom you see this little blue thing called primary label now if we go back and we copy it and you can put things like success and just keep pasting it you can do um you copy it and you can paste it you can put um warning you could put alert and you can even do um secondary if you save it and go view it in your browser you see in the bottom left you have all these labels right here and they're not buttons so you can't really click on them and expect to go somewhere the more like the badges where they're just there to show you like a message of some sort but like a very small message such as success or virus or hello so they're they're kind of useful but sometimes they're not so up next we're doing off campuses now off campuses are those things you kind of see when you're on mobile devices so for example you're trying to look at the menu but you're on your phone you usually have it off canvas appear and it's the three little lines that you click on opens up a side canvas or an off canvas and also referred to as off menus or side menus we're going to learn how to make one of those in foundation first you're going to start off with div tags obviously you're going to give it a class called off dash canvas dash wrapper and you're going to give it another div and the class is going to be off canvas enter off canvas wrapper dash inner you're going to save that i'm going to give it the data type data off wrapper after this you're going to put another div and you're going to give this one a class name of off dash can s position dash left you're going to add an id called off canvas left and then you're going to add data off dash off dash and this and then after all that we're going to leave those divs empty for now after that they're going to add a button you're going to take out the name like we usually do i'm gonna give it a class we're just gonna put it as the button class or the primary button we're gonna add data toggle we're going to set it equal to off can this left and then we're just going to put in here open or we're just going to put uh off canvas forgot to add the comment so we're just gonna add that really quick or just say off cam this save it now if you go to your browser you should see this button down here and when you click it it gives you this off canvas kind of look but it has no content inside of that so we're going to add that really quick so over here in these inner divs all the way into the middle we're just going to put an h2 tag and we're just say hello world and then we're just gonna put an h4 just saying docs or we're just put html and then another h4 saying css um just another one called java script and save that reload and we click off canvas and gives us this little side menu we could bank we can make these links too just by adding opening and closing tags to the very ends copying and pasting them adding placeholders as hashtags save it and you reload and now they're links and you click on them and it just brings you back to the top of the page open it and this is just these are just links and this is an off campus menu but when you minimize it if we inspect and we go to mobile let's just go to a google pixel 2. when we click off canvas it looks like one of those menus that you would have for a phone so and this works on any phone we can go all the way down to an uh an iphone 5se and it still works which are usually the smaller phones so it's good to know that these still work on all devices so up next is pagnation now pagnation is like a type of navigation that hangs out at the bottom and you can go through multiple pages usually at the bottom of product pages or blog pages you can go through multiple pages without having to navigate through the top navigation bar i'm going to show you how to do that down here we're just going to make a another comment as usual just so we can divide up our code we're just going to say pagnation bar indented a little and then we're gonna start off with an unordered list give it a class of tag and nation we're gonna give it a roll and set it equal to navigation and then we're gonna put area and then set it equal to pagination with the capital p inside of this we're going to put in list item we're going to give it a class called disable inside of this we're going to put previous and inside of this uh list item we're going to put a span tag we're gonna give it a class called show dash four dash sr and then we're just gonna put page in between this span tag and we could just close off the ends like that and then after this you're gonna you're gonna copy this and paste it below you're gonna change the class name to current actually you're not gonna put any you're not gonna put anything between those so you're gonna take out the previous you're gonna just put you are on or on page and then in between the span and the list item you're just gonna put one after that you're gonna put another list item list item you're just gonna put a list item a link inside of this you're going to set it to just the hashtag as the placeholder you put area label and set it equal to page two in between you're gonna just put a two between the anchor tag and then you're just gonna copy and paste this and you're just gonna change the numbers from two to three to four and you can just take out this last one we only need to go to four you can change this to three four so next you're gonna add a list item you're gonna give it a class of ellipse and you're gonna do it area hidden equal you're gonna just do true and you're just gonna leave this as that and you're gonna copy just two of these and then you just put in for now we'll just put uh pages 12 and 13. we're going to change this for that after that you're going to copy this this item right here you're going to paste it you're going to set the area labeled to capital next space page make sure the page is not capitalized and then after that instead of 13 you're just gonna put next and then you're gonna copy this uh span right here you're gonna paste it after next instead of uh putting you are on page you're just gonna put page if you reload your web page you should get this down here that looks like a little navigation that you would have for a website as you see the disabled class works perfectly with previous and then you can go on to next pages and stuff except for we only have one page so it's not going to go anywhere but uh we're going to style it stylize this a little bit more so you go to your um unordered list we're going to add a style tag we're going to say display flex and then we're gonna put justify content and then we're gonna set it to center and if we go back to our web browser we reload it it should be in the middle just like most web pages would look like now flexbox does work pretty well with uh foundation i haven't found any errors with it as you can see i easily centered that div or that um unordered list into the middle with no problem so foundation does work pretty well with uh flexbox and this is uh what a pagnation looks like on a web browser and that's how you make it in foundation so up next is progress bars now um just a disclaimer in my opinion bulma's uh progress bars are much better than foundations but we're still gonna learn them anyway just to see the difference between the two so let's just go ahead and make them um you're gonna go down here just make a comment uh progress and then down here you're gonna make a div you're gonna give it a class of primary progress save that and you're going to go inside so inside of this div you're going to make another dip and you're going to put the class name at progress meter and then style with 25 inside of this you're going to put paragraph tag you're going to put 25 percent you're gonna give this paragraph tag a class it's gonna be progress dash meter dash text and this is gonna be all there is to your progress bar now if you check your browser now if you check your browser you see you have this progress bar in here and you can customize it even more with the warning and success labels as here all we have to do is copy it and we just put a warning progress when we reload it we have a yellow one we do this the same for alert and we could do this the same for success and if we reload you have all these different colors there is not a secondary one because the background's already gray so it'd be kind of useless you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between the progress so they just decided not to have a secondary one now the ways you change the the progress on the bars is you go up to this width styling and you just change it to whatever percent you want and then down here in the paragraph you want to change it to match that so this primary progress should now be at 50 change any of these so we change this to 65 change this one to 3 percent and yeah basically if we reload you have all different types of widths and stuff and different colors for different types of labeling and yeah that's basically it for progress bars so um next are switches now switches are kind of pointless without a back end but i'm still going to show you the front end and how they're used in foundation so first we're going to make a comment right as always my foundation uh switch and then we're gonna save that we're gonna make a div we're gonna give this a class called tiny switch we're gonna put an input we're gonna give this a class of switch dash input and save it we're gonna give it an id of tiny switch and then we're going to change the type from text to check box and we're going to change the name to example switch and we can take out the value as well now after that we're gonna put a label we're gonna add a class to it and this one's gonna be called switch dash paddle let's save that and then we're gonna put four small switch we're gonna put a span inside of the label we're gonna give it a class it's gonna be show dash four dash sr and inside of this we're going to put small porsche only we're going to capitalize each of these and this should basically give you a switch now if you go ahead and check your browser so in your browser you're going to see this little switch down here and it this is all it does kind of uh misleading but it still looks cool to play with click it a million times if you'd like with some back end i guess it'd be kind of cool you can fill it out as a form so like yes no yes no now you can also add different classes so that you can make them bigger or smaller so we're basically going to copy this we're going to paste it down here we're going to change every tiny too small so we're just going to go ahead and take every tiny we're going to go small and then save it and if you reload you have another one that's slightly bigger than the first one and we do the same thing and make it bigger we're just going to copy this and we're going to find everywhere where it says small and the way i'm doing this is i'm holding ctrl while i'm clicking and you're just going to backspace and put large and you're going to save that you're going to reload and you're going to have a very large button or switch and this is basically how switches work in foundation up next we're going to make tables now tables look a little different in uh foundation and i'll you'll see why in a minute but uh we're just gonna go ahead and start making that now so obviously you know the drill we're just gonna make some comment so we can keep organized and then and then you're gonna put a table tag just like that and then t head or table head and then we're going to make a table row now we're going to make a table header we're going to give it a width of 200. we're just going to name this table header and then we're going to do another table header we're just gonna add no width to this and just say table header now we're gonna copy and paste this one twice we're gonna change this one to 150 we're going to change this one the 150 as well now after the table head we're going to make a table body and then we're going to make a table row and then table data and inside of this data we're gonna put just some text some filler text so we're just gonna say content goes here and next one we're just gonna do table data lorem ispium and we're just gonna minimize this down a little bit so it's not too long and then we can just copy this one and paste it twice over there and after that we're gonna copy this and paste it three more times or two more times as you see we have a perfectly made table over here you see the first row goes gray or a light gray the second one goes full white and then it's a pattern after that and basically what we did is we made one with a certain amount of width and basically organizes it like in a css grid so that it goes one large and then two small ones and this is basically how a table works in foundation so up next is the title bar now the title bar is very responsive navigation usually used on mobile and web apps or mobile websites when you're designing for mobile first they usually have the little cutout on the side where the breadcrumbs that you can easily navigate through and they're very responsive so i'm gonna show you how to make one in foundation so just going to make comment title bar like that indent and then you're going to give it a class called title dash bar inside of there you're gonna make another div and it's gonna be called title dash r gosh left because we're gonna make it to the left we're gonna put a button we're gonna leave the type as button but we can take out the name we're gonna give it a class we're gonna call this menu icon we're gonna put a span after this this is going to have a class called title dash bar left inside of here we're just going to put foundation and then after that div inside of the title bar div but not inside of the title bar left we're gonna make another div we're gonna call this one title dash bar dash right we're gonna put a button we're gonna take out the name we're gonna put a class in here we called menu i put a dash in between and this should give you your little title bar and if you check your browser should have this little title bar now you want to uh obviously put at the top of your web page so it looks like a title now i added some margins so it looks like it's at the top of the page it's really not it's just uh it's just some margin but it looks like it's at the top of a page and this is basically what it looks like the pages don't do anything but you can actually connect the off canvas to those um those to the menu icons and they can open up side menus especially if you're on mobile that can be useful and this is all responsive if i were to go like this it's all responsive there's not much to respond about but it it's still responsive if you have actual navigations inside of this black bar right here it becomes responsive and yeah that's basically how you make a navigation slash title bar in foundation so up next is a tool tip and a tool tip is like um you'll see them in wikipedia a lot and it kind of gives you a general definition of a word that the user might not quite understand right away so i'm gonna show you how to do that now we're just gonna make a comment we're gonna call this tool tip and we're gonna make a paragraph tag because it is a sentence and we're just gonna put the and we're going to space it but we're going to take out that space now inside of this paragraph tag we're going to put a span now the span is going to have a data type called data dash tool tip and then it's going to have area that has pop up we're going to set that equal to true we're going to set a class to has dash tip now we're going to say data dash disable dash hover we're going to set that equal to false and then we're going to put tab index and we're going to set tab index equal to 1 and then we're going to put title fantasy word for a beetle and then this is just another word for a beetle i just copied and pasted it and then this is just some filler text i found well we're just going to do laura mistbium we're going to save that and if you go into your browser and you reload you see down here you get the sentence and oops make sure you put a space after the title not a space uh after the uh the definition word and if you reload you get this and when you hover over it says fancy word for a beetle and it's just a basic definition of what it is you'll see these a lot on wikipedia you can add these to your docs on your website or whatever and that's how it works in foundation so up next is something called html templates and foundation foundation has their own set of templates they have a total of eight if you go to foundation.zurb.com templates.html you'll find these html templates now there's a total of eight and you can download any of them or you can just watch the demo they have news magazines real estate ecommerce blogs portfolios and product pages and a few more these are very helpful if you're just trying to create a portfolio for your business or for getting a job and you don't have too much experience and you just need something to get out there with today we're just going to do the portfolio so you're going to click see demo and as you see this is what the portfolio looks like or the template and if we right click and click view page source there's all this code right here we're going to click control a control c so basically what we're going to do is we're going to click control a and control v and you're going to save it now the first thing you're going to notice is everything is in one straight line and nothing is organized like we are organizing it earlier and that's okay you just need an atom package or a package to go along with your code there's gonna be a link in the description it's an atom package called atom beautify and this organizes your code just like we were doing with all the indentations and white space now uh you can install this package just by clicking install and open with atom and it should install like that if not you can uh install using npm um or the apm command line and just install it that way but it's so much easier if you just clicked install here but once you've installed this you should be able to go to your code and click packages adam beautify and then click beautify what this does is it organizes all the code automatically with all of its indentations and stuff now if you go to your file folder and you click your text or your document you should find this as your document not the link anymore and here's where we will reload and edit our website so we can just minimize out of this minimize out of that and the first things we can change is the title we're going to change this to portfolio so portfolio save we can leave all these links alone we can leave all these script tags alone as you see it it just does its own functionality and you see off canvas position left reveal for large this is what the off campus looks like in this website but there's not a button to open it so it's just always open so we're going to edit this uh off canvas first the height is a hundred percent then down here we're just going to change this to liam stockton save that and then this is a little bio it looks like right yeah it's a little bio so i'm gonna copy and paste the bio from my portfolio so this is my portfolio and we're just gonna go to about and i'm gonna just copy this and then i don't need that anymore then we're gonna go down here i'm gonna paste it into this paragraph tag and then if we save it reload i have my own about down here now you can obviously write your own and you probably should and just change the span below to you know stockton save that then down here there's a call out call out primary what this call out is is this thing up here and they set the width so that it takes up the entire um heading basically and so we're going to change this we're going to just change this to x and expand your creativity and it's just going to have some words down here we're just going to change this text to something whatever you really want it's going to come up here so you just can kind of choose what you want to say up here i'm going to just write some stuff so i wrote this just a little phrase right here and if we go ahead and reload you see we get this over here and now we need to move on to the pictures so i pulled an image from my um my personal images and i'ma just paste it into here and we're gonna rename this to me and it's a jpeg file so down in or we're gonna go back up to the image instead of this right here we're just going to do me dot jpg if we reload there's a picture of me up here now now if um as far as these projects go we need to find images for them so over here are basically projects now of course you're not going to have like 12 projects as it's shown here but uh you're going to at least have at least three or four good ones so we're going to take out some of these so if we go down here we're gonna look for it there's all these cells so we can take out the first one two three four five six we'll just take out the first six and save it and we could take out two more because it kind of looks weird actually no we're just gonna uh copy and paste these two paste them back because we need them if we reload you should have only eight and what we're gonna do is we're gonna fill in these projects so we're just gonna put um uh we're just gonna put port folio as a project and then we're gonna make it a link the portfolio is one project we're going to make this one javascript book marker that's another project and we just replace this pasting and we're going to put this one as let's just say personal website or we're going to do a personal blog and we're gonna save that as a website and these are just different projects that i'm filling in as obviously you can come up with your own projects these are just things that i've done javascript um javascript calculator and we're just going to put one here we're just going to put python e logger we need three more word press plug ends actually we need to make this a link so we're gonna do word press plugins down here we're just gonna put uh react js projects and down here we're just going to do u dot js projects if we reload you see we have oops this one is not a link make sure you make them all links because you want to link to your uh project obviously so we're just going to do this reload and you see they're all links they don't go anywhere you can put your own links so i'm gonna just link these so i've linked some of my uh personal projects in here so if we click portfolio you get to my portfolio click javascript bookmarker you get to all my projects now what we need to do is add pictures or thumbnails so that they want to click on them so this is where we go to google images we need to search for port folio we need it um so we're just search for portfolio and then in tools we're gonna click size and then exactly 550 by 550 because that's what's over in here and it even tells you the pixel size so i found this image it's not really an image of a portfolio but it's going to work for now since it's just a stock image so we're going to right click and click um copy image address and then we're gonna put it in for each of these placehold dot it pictures you're just gonna paste it in and you can even do the control version and just paste it in like that you do it however you want it's just how you paste it in and replace the the thumbnail pictures with this link that we have if we go over and we reload you see we have a bunch of phones and this doesn't look very nice so we're gonna um add some variety to it so we're just gonna keep finding random images and we're just gonna keep copying the image address and replacing them with different uh thumbnails all images will be in the link in the description i'm just finding random images and clicking copy image address and just pasting them in that way it doesn't all look the same we can get some variety to our portfolio as you see if i reload okay so once you're done copying all these images and finding them you should have a variety like this now um if you want to find these images you can find them in the description i found most of them from just google images so it's not that hard to find but do remember that you have to cite and credit each of these authors they're not you can't just take these images you can always put it down in your footer somewhere but uh just make sure you credit these uh people who took the pictures or made the pictures just so you don't get copyrighted claimed or even sued okay so after this you're going to look at this contact me and you're going to want to change uh the text obviously because it's just dummy text we're going to go ahead and change the text so it says contact me and we're going to change out this text so we're just going to say contact me through my social media or through the form um i will try i will respond within 72 hours or we're just going to say uh 24 hours so i just put some text contact me through social media or through the forum i'll try my best to respond within 24 hours and now we now we just need to check this so um change this social media so but uh we're not gonna use dribble we're just gonna do youtube instagram and we're gonna do twitter i'm gonna just paste in these links and instagram save that and we go back and we reload you see we have each of these and if you click on them they lead to your social media in this case my youtube channel this form does not work um obviously you need to set up some back end there is a way you can plug in mailchimp into foundations um into foundations uh back in but and for this tutorial we're just doing front end so we're not going to do that but we're going to go ahead and look at the form and you can change the uh placeholder so it says um type here or we can just say message here and if we go back and reload instead of ola designer it's going to say message here now we have a simple portfolio made in foundation right here and it looks pretty good it's pretty good for a starter portfolio even if you don't have much experience with foundation or with any of these you still can make a pretty good portfolio using an html template and foundation you're probably wondering great i can build a website with a template i know all the factors of foundation and all of its responsiveness but how do i build a website from scratch and that's exactly what we're gonna do right now so right now we're going to build a website from scratch so completely no templates no um no copying pasting all just pure code so we're going to open up a new uh tab and doc uh in adam and we're gonna um open the project as foundation we're just gonna open up our foundation and then we're just gonna exit out of all of these tabs and we're gonna keep this untitled um tab right here we're gonna press uh control shift s and then we're gonna name this one port folio dot html we're gonna save that and then we're gonna make control n and then we're going to put ctrl shift s i'm going to name this one style.css this is going to be our new folders for this new website we're going to make we're going to keep the old folders just so we can refer back to other elements of foundation if we ever need to so what we're going to do first we're just going to type in some basic html just type in the words html it should shortcut to just this uh nice 10 lines of code it'll give you just the the head title body and closing and opening html tags we're going to give html a class called called no dash js we're going to add some more meta tags so we're just going to go meta oops meta tag then we're going to set um and we're going to set http equivalent set at the x equals ua and then dash com compatible and then we're going to set content ie equals edge save that and after that we're going to add another meta tag its name is going to be view port viewport like that now we're going to set content to width equals device width and we're going to add a comma we're going to set initial scale equal to 1.0 and that should be it for that meta tag and now we're going to give it a title we're going to call this portfolio save that and now we're going to link in our links so we're going to just put link tags going to keep style sheet and we're going to put in tss foundation dot css and after that we're gonna put another link and it's gonna be the same thing except for it's gonna be css slash app css that way it has css for mobile too after that we're gonna link our style sheet that's up here right now so we're just going to put in link and then it's going to be just style.css because we didn't put in any folders as you see here it's out right here in the open it's not in any folders so that should set up our head part now we're going to go into the actual code for the body so we're going to start off with a div i'm going to call it title bar and we're going to add another div we're going to give it a class of title bar left so title our left because we're gonna have a title bar on the left we're gonna add another div and the class is gonna be off canvas and then position left so we're gonna we're basically making a um a off canvas menu kind of thing so that when you're on mobile it can work for off canvas as well and then we're gonna add an id not an idea and i d be equal to off can this left and then we're going to add a data off canvas like that now inside of here we're going to add an unloaded list we're going to give this our list a class and it's going to be sub menu gonna be sub menu menu and then bird too cool so it's a vertical menu and then it's gonna have data data submenu now we're going to add list item and inside of these list items are going to be links so we're going to copy this now and we're going to paste it five times or four times and you should have five um link menus now you're just gonna put home skills projects about and then contact so we can navigate through them later we're just going to put home skills projects about and contact and this we're going to put ids in these sections down further into the website so we can navigate to them when we do get there but we're not there just yet so after this unordered list we're gonna put a div and inside of here we're gonna put a button and we can just take out the or we don't have to take out any of this we're gonna put data toggle and then it's gonna equal off canvas left and we don't need the div in this class right here so we can just take that out just to organize it and we're going to give this a class not cool class of menu dash icon and we don't need this type or actually no we don't need this name after that we're gonna put a span it's gonna have a class of title r title we're gonna put portfolio inside of there so inside of the body we're gonna um we're gonna put a div and we're gonna and inside of this div we're gonna give it an id of home and this is what i was talking about up here so when you click the home it's going to lead you down to this div and then we're going to give it a class of hero section and hero section is not in foundation so we're going to add our own personal css that's why we made the file earlier but we'll get to that in a second inside of here we're going to put another div and we're going to put the class as hero dash section dash text and then we're going to put each one and we're going to put your name or in this case my name then we're going to do an h5 i'm going to do front and web developer now obviously you can add this to whatever you do uh this is just for the tutorial and so what we need to do now is we need to stylize this so you're gonna go up and click on your css file it's not there you can click this little arrow and click style that css and it'll bring you there um so what we're going to do first we're going to do a hero we're going to 0section and go like that now before i start typing realize that it may seem like a lot of css but it's 10 times shorter if you were doing it without foundation so just have that in mind i'm going to do background and then url parentheses and i'm gonna copy and paste the image url i found earlier um the link will be in the description obviously we're gonna put parentheses and just paste it in and then at the very end we're gonna put fifty percent no repeat put a semicolon and press enter i'm going to do background size and then cover i'm going to do height 96 vh which is a vertical horizontal is what that means and then text line center and then we're going to do some web kits for the internet explorer users display i'm going to do dash web kit dash flex you're gonna do display and then msflex box and make sure you put a dash before that and then after this we're just gonna do normal display flex and then after that you can put webkit dash align dash items and you can just put center and then we're gonna tab and put ms dash flex dash align center and then we're just gonna do normal align items center make sure you put semicolons after all this and after this we're going to put we're going to go back from our indentation put webkit dash defy dash content and we'll just put center and then after that we're going to tap and put dash ms dash flex dash pack center and after that we're just going to do uh justify content center and what this code basically does all these web kits and stuff are basically so that other users can use them as well sometimes it doesn't work on all computers but the webkits make sure that it does work on computers that use internet explorer windows edge or microsoft edge even sometimes web browsers like that are a little bit more complicated so uh web kits tend to help with that and after this we're just going to put euro section and then we're just going to add the second class hero section text and this puts it in a hierarchy so that only text inside of the hero section will work and then we're just gonna add brackets and we're gonna have the color u f e f e we have text shadow one pixel one pixel two pixel and then we add color to it as zero a zero a zero a semicolon and this is all the css we're gonna need for right now so we can go back to our html now before we open it in the browser we need to come down here and add our javascript so we're gonna go in the body we're just gonna kind of indent so we're gonna make a script tag and we're just gonna take out this break right here we're gonna put it as js slash vendor slash jquery js and we're just gonna copy this paste it three more times should have four script tags just change this to what input change this to foundation dot js and this one to app.js and now it should work if we go ahead and check our browser you should get this looking right here now this is a pretty good home page you have our own custommade heroes section um our little welcome and if you come up here to the navigation you get this side menu right here with all of the basically navigation of the website and if you click home not gonna bring this anywhere because this is already home so but that would work if we were to scroll down and have more parts of the website that would work after this we're gonna add another div we're going to give it an id of skills which we will use later for the navigation and we're going to give it a class of skills we're going to add an h2 with the style of text line s then colon center semicolon inside of here we're going to put skills and after this we're going to add an h3 called html and after this we're going to add some progress bars and that's going to show how well we know the skill for this portfolio i'm going to add a div we're going to give this class a and it's going to have primary progress as its class and then roll is going to be progress bar tab index equals zero now we're going to set area value now equal to or we're gonna take out this dash and set it equal to zero actually we're gonna set it equal to 25 and we're gonna copy this and we're gonna paste it instead of now we're gonna put min and we're gonna set it to zero we're gonna set we're gonna paste it again instead of now we're gonna put text we're gonna set it equal to 25 percent we're gonna paste it again we're gonna set max as instead of now and we're gonna set it to a hundred and then we're gonna uh take this back and we're gonna press enter so there's room inside of this div i'm gonna add another div can it be called progress dash meter and then style we're going to set width to width to 90 percent and then paragraph tag set class equal to progress dash meter text and this should give us one of the progress bars if we check our browser we reload we scroll down we see we get this little uh progress bar down here and then we're gonna uh make a div up here after skills and call it skills dash enter and we're gonna copy uh the progress bar and everything with that inside of here and then we're gonna go into our css tab and uh stylize this skills thing so we're just gonna go skills um curly bracket and then we're gonna set height to 35 vh and then text align center and then background and set it we're going to set it to 4d5768 and then put a semicolon and then we're going to set the skills inner class to width of 50 and then margin left 25 and then padding bottom 5 pixels and what this basically does is it takes um the normal hero section it makes it smaller and then everything inside of it is going to be centered in the middle inside of a smaller box you go to your browser and reload you should see it like so that this is like all one section and then the the progress bars are in a smaller section inside of it that's what the skills inner class is for so now we can basically copy and paste everything from the h3 html tags down to the end of the primary progress so we're just gonna copy this and paste it three times like that and i'm gonna change this to css3 and this one to java script es6 and then if you want you can change probably should change each of these so let's say each our css is only 85 and we change the text down here so 85 percent and then javascript let's say it's only 75 percent or just change these values down here if you go to your browser and you reload you should have three more progress bars with different values in them or the values you set to it so um here it shows that html is known ninety percent and i know it css three eighty five percent of the way and javascript es6 about 75 percent of the way now this is just hypothetical for this portfolio but you can change these values to whatever you'd like so after all these divs we're gonna put a div we're gonna give it a class of projects and then we're gonna give it an id of go down here and save that and inside of here we're going to give it a div and a class called project dash box and then we're going to do a a tag or an anchor tag inside of the anchor tag you're gonna do an image now i found this image offline if you want it it's down in the description along with everything else and so i just copied the uh image address and i pasted it and now we're going to add some alt text of port polio after that you're going to put an h2 tag and set the style to uh text dash align center and then we're just gonna put project as filler we're gonna do um we're just gonna do uh personal blog and then after this we're gonna copy this project box two more times we're gonna change the text from uh personal blog to java script bookmarker then we're just going to do um portfolio because i have a second portfolio and if we go ahead and check our browser so before we check the browser we're going to go to our style.css and we're going to make a projects and project project box and we're going to style these so for this one we're going to display flex make sure it's a semicolon and we're going to justify content into the center i'm going to do flex direction and we're going to do row and then flex wrap and then we're gonna do wrap that way if the browser gets smaller it will wrap and make it into a column instead of row and then we're just gonna set the height to 100 percent and down in the project box we're going to do margin 15 pixels we're going to do with 250 pixels and height 250 pixels i'm going to order we're gonna do border radius 25 pixels and then background color is going to be black make sure you set this project box to image i forgot about that so the styling won't work correctly without the image um that's just uh targeting the image part of the box we're gonna go ahead and change uh javascript bookmarker because it's kind of a long title and we're just gonna put um js book marker and reload and you should have it looking like this now um you can obviously switch out the pictures i just you i just used the same one for all three just for convenience you should probably change each one of these to your own pictures of your actual uh project but for now this is good after this we're going to add a div and we're going to call it um we're going to give it a class of about and we're going to give it an id of about and then we're going to put a div inside of it call and give it a class of about box i'm going to put an h2 tag in here call it about and then a paragraph tag and then i'mma copy and paste my about from earlier so i'm gonna just paste that in here and then go back and now we're gonna go into the styling and we're gonna add a class of about and about box just set the height to 35 vh not 25 35 and then we're going to set text align center set background color for the background color we're just going to use the same color we did for skills we're just going to paste it down here in semicolon we're going to display flex we're going to align items and then into the center and then we're gonna go down to the about box we're gonna give it a background color we're gonna set it to five e four seven nine nine semicolon and then order radius 25 pixels and then height of 20 vh makes you semicolon and then width is going to be 50 and then we're going to margin left about 25 pixels or a percent and just add a little bit of a padding bottom of five pixels change this four seven to seven four i messed up there it will give you purple if you type in four seven so make sure it's seven four you should get this blue color if you reload like this and it gives you a nice soft kind of grayish blue color that kind of looks nice on the eyes and also matches these pictures which i did not plan if you don't like the color scheme you can always change it there wasn't too much designing going into this um website it was mostly just to test every foundation function now one more thing we're just gonna um add another about box so about dash box comma paragraph tag and we're just going to set the padding on this for 5 pixels if you go back to your browser and you reload you see it just gives a nice padding to the the text of the so you can read it so after this we're going to give it another div we're going to add class to contact we're going to give it an id of contact it's just going to be an h2 of contact i just put user at domain for the email this is gonna be email just because i'm not gonna put my actual email but you guys should put your actual email if you want your employer to contact you also you don't have to put uh email sometimes it might get confusing it might annoy the user and then we're just gonna put paragraph and we're gonna put a phone number so i'm just putting some random numbers so actually we're just gonna go one two three four five six seven eight nine euro like that i don't know if that's a real phone number i wouldn't find out and after this we're gonna go to our style and we're gonna add a class of contact i'm going to set a background color to uh hashtag 006 ea d and then we're going to set a height of 20 vh and then text align center and then after that if you check your browser and you reload you should have this little blue thing down here contact and then email and phone number and obviously style is that easier this is just like looking like kind of a call out kind of after your body and you're going to type in a footer tag now we're going to just make a quick little footer just for convenience and it's just going to say shadow tech i copied and pasted a copyright sign offline and you can just save that you're going to go back to your style and you're just going to add footer and then you're just going to do text align center and then just set a background color and for convenience just gray and after that if you check your website you should have a fully completed um simple portfolio that was made completely from scratch completely from foundation and it was only in about 80 lines of css and around roughly 92 lines of html which is very small for a portfolio our html template was way more than that and this was this is a lot more than the template as well so you get more for less basically so more content for less lines of code for both uh portfolio and css so now that you've built your website in foundation there's a few more things that i think you guys should check out because they're kind of cool and it might be useful so if you go to foundation's website and you click getting started and then you click sites you see you get this little um page here and well this is where we found the html templates and there's some other things called building blocks now as it may seem you can literally click see code and add this to your um to your website and you can basically give ratings based off of you know like what you would be rating it on basically like you can copy this code click copy copy and copy and just paste each one in and you'd have to add your own javascript through a script tag inside of your uh website but that shouldn't be much of a problem and it basically gives you all the code for the um what it the building block is so in this case it's a star rating block and these are created by other people as you see this person made this but you can have your own profiles i guess but if you go back there's different things so you can go to navigation you can have these cool little uh navigations that people have made in foundation um status you can add status alerts and uh graphs and stuff um you can also do control and see social icons there's a lot of social buttons look at the social buttons easy so you can literally copy which parts you want so if i only wanted facebook twitter and youtube and instagram i would just copy these and then just copy all this because if you want to add more you can add more basically take out which links you want out and you can link in your own social media inside of these hashtags there's also mobile dashboards and instead of making our own hero we've could have we could have gone here and just clicked full screen hero and copy this code down here and could have done it that way but we decided to make it our own since we were creating our own website from scratch but if you do want to make another hero you can just come in here to the building blocks and find full screen hero and just edit it that way if you go back we go back all the way to where it says html templates you're gonna click uh resources and down here there's all sorts of addons for angular and for text editors and wordpress all this backend stuff and this is where we would connect the back end with like our buttons and stuff where is it down here django your net.net and uh it looks like other backend stuff like flask for python php um ass foundation anyway up here you can see there's uh icon fonts which are just some like random stuff i guess you could put into your website svg icons oh so like social media icons and if you click getting started this is where we downloaded uh you can click kitchen sink and obviously go through kitchen sink you click home it gives you like a description of how foundation works so uh 50 code reduction so half the size of foundation five this is foundation six so they've upgraded it and if you keep scrolling through you can read all about their development and how foundation is apparently the best uh frontend framework that's responsive in the world is what they claim so throughout this entire course or crash course we've learned a lot and let's go over what we have learned so we went through all of kitchen sync which gave us every element of foundation all in one let's say document and we saved that website just as foundation after that we went on to html templates and we basically learned how foundation is structured using one of their templates and we edited the template so that it looks like our personal pro portfolio then after that we basically made our own portfolio from scratch and we made it so that we coded the entire thing we basically coded the entire portfolio from scratch not using any templates or anything just using foundation and it gave us a 50 code reduction from the normal portfolio without foundation so basically um that's all for foundation i know this was a kind of a long crash course especially just for foundation but i made sure that you guys got all the content of foundation so don't forget to leave a like down below it
