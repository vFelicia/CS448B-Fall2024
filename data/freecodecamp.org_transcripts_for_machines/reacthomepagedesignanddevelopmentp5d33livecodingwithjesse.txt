everyone welcome to live coding with Jessie it's been a few days it's been kind of crazy we had a big ice storm here and everything was covered and I don't know like this much ice it was wild so the offices were closed yesterday I had like unexpected things going on and meetings getting moved around and so I just didn't really have like I wasn't confident that I would have enough time to stream so today I'm gonna catch you up with some of the things that I've been doing some pool requests and then we're gonna work a little bit on the layout for the homepage so to understand why I'm doing this let me tell you what's what's been happening so I all right let me how to try to start from the beginning here okay so some people higher up in the university that I work for have decided that they don't want the website to go live by the end of this month which is what we were shooting for we'll see if that stands from from what I understand I wasn't involved in any of these meetings but from what I understand I think that there's a misunderstanding here about with this website kind of redesigned and development is involving and I think there's a fear that it's going to be such a big change that prospective students are going to be confused so now I'm gonna have meetings with different groups of people within the university some different people you know higher up in the university and I'm gonna demo this website to them show them what we're doing explain it my hope is that after people see how far along this is and and what we're actually doing then they'll be okay with us launching now if we have to push back the launch date we have to but it's going to cost you know the university some extra money to renew the contract for the old websites content management system so I'd rather not push it back if it's unnecessary if the reason we push it back is simply because you know there's a misunderstanding then that's even if it's not that much money it's still a waste you know it's a waste of money so I'm gonna do what I can in terms of the meetings but that changes the plan a little bit for how we we develop this so the plan right now is get the homepage looking as good as possible and as functional as possible right away like within the next few days well today and then the next few days of next week's like Monday Tuesday Wednesday I have to present it to the first group on Thursday so I just leaves us a few days and then also we want to get as many interior pages as we can looking good so I can demo things so here's what I've been doing to make that happen let me switch over so I can show you on my screen so we have this is kind of small what if I can I can't really zoom in let me take this out of the mobile view so that I can just make it bigger of course we're still doing kind of a mobile first development but so this is one of the things that I've added I know that one of the people who is really concerned probably the main person that is really concerned about the launch date wants to delay it it's also probably going to be looking for this type of thing these student profiles so I brought over some student profiles and I made sure that the images comes and that some videos come through so this is really basic we're gonna have to do some styling on on this kind of thing I don't like that look but overall it came through it came through okay I'll show you what I had I had to do some stuff to get these to come through all right now I'll show you more about that but then also these links on the side I've been adding in the URLs so these will now actually link to the right places the assuming that we have the correct data so let me see alright cool so that one did work these are links and they also use the next link prefetch so that next has a link component built in and then we can add prefetch so that should make the transition between pages extra fast that's another feature I want to really show off is how fast this website is compared to the old one it's going to be fast compared to any website but especially compared to the old one I think that's a huge selling point and maybe I'm going to bring in some statistics on the likely number of prospective students that are actually leaving our current site before it even loads because the load times are so terrible and how many more students we would have if we switch the site over so if anyone has any other ideas of things that I could bring up potentially in a meeting to try to convince people that this website should go live sooner rather than later let me know thankfully most of the people that are meeting with I already know what their concerns are so I have a good idea of how I want to frame this there are some new people that I haven't even met yet so that's going to be kind of an unknown for me as a you know kind of what what their concerns are so let's see those are two big things I've just been pulling over more content and let's see I guess let's go back to the homepage so you can see the homepage has really like nothing nothing changed from what we had on it before I did I did change this a little bit as you see there's a I don't think we had this before but there's a change in the color that's kind of like another indicator of the hierarchy in the menu I'm sure I'm missing a few other things that happen oh we upgraded to an even newer version of next and that helps the the problem that we were to solve on you know a few days ago that helped to fix that problem so thank you to harsh it for getting on the next github repo and you're communicating with the maintainer zz alright so this is going to be the first thing that the people see when I I present this what I'm thinking is that I'm gonna present the mobile view first so I'm gonna have on a projector my phone the screen on my phone to show what this looks like and then I'm also going to invite them to view it on their phones which is a little bit of a risk right because you know maybe they have a really old phone with an old outdated browser maybe it looks weird but I think it would be nice to have them actually be able to click around I'm gonna invite them to try to load the current website the really slow one on their phone try to click around on that just to get an idea of you know just really kind of the difference in the experience after that I will show them the desktop version if they want to see it but I want I really think that their audience of high school students is way more likely to view this on their phone based on data that I've seen unfortunately in Google Analytics the lowest age group I can that it'll show me is 18 to 24 year olds that's not really a good group that's that's not our target audience so that's kind of like eighteen year olds our target audience but we want eighteen in below so I can't get actual analytics data from our current site for that audience but regardless I don't think it'll be disputed that mobile is going to be the primary means so assuming this is the first thing people see one thing we definitely need an image that fits of the school we may or may not put that image in today I don't really want to spend time going through the photos that we have on the stream I'd rather do some code so we will be changing the image just so you know these buttons will probably remain the same for now what we really need to do is scroll through and just make sure what we got to put something right here you know this first section needs to grab attention so that's that's my big thing you know further down the page is becomes less and less important but probably anything like from here up we need to put something you know special in those those sections you know not only for the end user which will be this perspective students but for the meetings we need to grab you'll grab the attention so I'm thinking you know something like this with a nice impressive quote is fine potentially a video I think would be good but I know that some of the people that are going to be in these meetings are going to want to see a student profile so since we already brought in the student profile data well I already brought it in earlier today I think that's what we should do is really try to make a card or a section that highlights current students and I mean I don't know I guess maybe they found that the prospective students really like to see stories occurrence so for whatever reason that's what we're gonna show them so that's what we're gonna work on first we're gonna try to design and then develop as a react component some element which we'll showcase on a mobile screen an image a name and then a little bit of information about a student and we'll provide a link to a page that has more information maybe even a video so we have some things that we could work from right now like we were going to use this this doesn't look good on mobile so let's start out maybe we'll start from here at least we'll have something and then let's see how we can switch this around to make it look make it look better so now I think about it I don't want to use this first this looks better on desk desktop but I think something like this would work better on a mobile view all right let's start with that let me read through the live chat really quickly since I know there's it seems like there's a lot a lot in the live chat are ready hey everyone okay we I do have some good advice for the meetings here John Hanson says you have to push the ease speed booze and AHS don't go for the power under the hood Tech Talk that's good advice definitely I'm gonna have I'm gonna really try to remember that to not talk technology probably the only thing I'll get into that is just simply there's gonna be reliability and there's gonna be no downtime when we update I don't really need to get into why unless somebody asks see juggernaut says Pete speed is key 47% of customers expect a website to two seconds or less 40% of customers will abandon a website that takes more than three seconds to load that's awesome those are the kind of statistics that I really want to lead with juggernaut says every second that customers have to wait longer than three seconds reduces their satisfaction by 16% 79% of customers who are dissatisfied with website performance are less likely to repeat the purchase 44 percent of online shoppers tell friends and family about a bad online shopping experience cool juggernaut if you have a source for this like a link or something please send that to me because I like I want to use some of these statistics but in case somebody says where are you getting this info I'd like to be able to point them you know somewhere so if you do have that that'd be great otherwise I'll probably spend some time looking up sources myself just to have it ready all right let's start this timer let's let's start doing some code well some design slash slash code here right it kind of makes them together alright so we're gonna be on our index.html component let me start in grok so you all can what was it already started I guess I never shut off an grukk it's been on for days well not that anybody's really been on it okay so try this link for n grow up let me know if it doesn't work I assume it's still gonna work but I don't know that I've ever kept it on this long looks like it's working awesome okay where's our index page let's make this a lot bigger okay so for right now we're going to do everything in the index page well obviously we want to break this out into its own component at some point well let's go down and find a card let's see which one this one all right you should be the second card that we have here there we are okay so let's just work with this card and start to change it since we already have it here what I'd like to do is grab let's check out a student let's check out that student page that I showed you at the beginning so let's open a new tab low blows nice there we go the student profile so let's look at Noah Fisher I've never met Noah Fisher don't really know who Noah is but let's take Noah's stuff here so let's just get this is just a demo so I'm not gonna actually pull in real data yet it's it doesn't make sense for at this point which is really kind of like more of a design stage but I do want to grab the image URL okay we are getting right now I'm pulling the images from the current database so that's all going to change at some point for now it'll be okay so let's change this image to this first of all let's change the name we need a title right yeah we're gonna need that the title which would be the students name we can see right away does this image work right I don't care about the larger screen for now okay that image actually works for a card like this great okay so there's the image I think materiai has a title component built in let's grab that component I know I'm material I open somewhere on my screen there it is so we're using material UI's beta version if anyone wants to check out the docs as well it's material UI next comm to make this a little bigger for everyone also I'm gonna try and make this stream like kind of a shorter stream because I forgot to eat forget these lunch before the stream I was just working in like on a roll and so I know I'm gonna be getting super hungry soon I've been waking up really early so like 900 a.m. is like lunchtime for me now so I'm definitely past that that time all right where's our card here it is all right so let's check out oops yeah I want the demo so let's look okay this is kind of what I'm looking for a card that looks more like this let's just check out a few other examples yeah I think this one is the best fit for us here so let's see what else we're using all right so there's not really a special component they're just using typography headline okay that that works fine let's just grab let's grab all of this inside here and copy it over just so you know in case you haven't watched before I am definitely going to get to you all your questions in the live chat as soon as this Pomodoro session is over so if you if you are asking questions and I'm not answering back please be patient and I will answer all the questions in about 20 minutes or so car okay let's save that so we get the auto formatting what you're not gonna auto format for me I was pretty sure I had it all set up I guess not you know what I don't think I copied everything that I call content actions actions all right the indentation just came over really weird I'm gonna leave it alone for now let's change this to be the name though uh how you suppose are saying so like if this year okay Noah Fisher and let's grab a little bit of the content that's here you know what let me let me grab some of the content that actually came through from the content management system so when I pulled this in from the database it had it already had some like an excerpt basically already there hmm looks like the excerpt has the name in it as well I don't like that this we may have to manually go in and change this but I'm gonna grab what was what was in that excerpt out of WordPress that's on my other screen and let's paste that into here just for testing we can worry about how we get that data in there later I really think after looking at some of this data I'm definitely gonna have to have somebody go through it manually and make some changes there's just not going to be any way around it there's some things that just I just can't work with all right fr unipi great and then for our buttons we're gonna make that's good learn more yeah let's just leave a learn more button in there for now all right let's see what we have yeah you know what I really don't like that this is showing up like that I want this to be more everything else I gotta really like about that headline h2 why's this let's check out why this h2 is looking like really not like an h2 at all all right sighs did we change I'm wondering if we changed something earlier I don't remember this I remember changing the size of this let's see what it's supposed to be in material you I was supposed to look like yeah it's supposed to look like this something's up I suspect maybe I just changed something so let's check out our code let me look at the live chat as well to see if you all caught the error okay it doesn't lose anything about it in there right now check up here hmm yeah I don't really see anything here that would be causing that the only place I'm even messing with font size is here but I don't think that's that would do anything there yeah all right well maybe I'll just switch this up let's just try some different H values see what changes if anything looks like nothing Wow so an h1 ends up with the same value let's see so I'm just checking the live chat quickly yeah I'm not sure what's happening with this we could certainly just put some inline styles in here to override this I suppose rather not do that if I don't have to let's see what we've done here here's nine oh yeah let's let's check out the code for this next one down typography type headline component that's exactly what we wanted to do right very type headline all right this is variant headline let's go with type I'm not sure what the deal was with the variant so if we switch it to type though maybe that'll work there we are that's interesting see I did have it does say variant headline here that's weird unless it's possible that this changed in a very new version of material UI and we haven't upgraded it yet I mean maybe maybe we need to upgrade and then change that we'll see I'm not interested in doing that right now though all right so let's see what you all think then so I don't know this doesn't seem very eyecatching to me right now I am gonna I'm gonna get on the end Rock server on my phone so that I can see what it looks like on a real device let's see i'ma send it to myself on slag okay actually that looks a lot better on a real phone all right so here's what if you all can look at this on your mobile devices I think that would actually be helpful you there's definitely a much different feel looking at this on a phone than I'm getting from here so I'm just a better way to do it really happy for an grukk right now although I know you can do this through dev tools as well but juggernut says good luck Jessie thanks for the streams oh you're welcome thanks for for all your advice you put in there I mean shake my tongue all right we're good it's been about eight minutes I'm gonna go back to the live chat and answer questions so if you just hang in for a little bit longer I'll get to them so here's a few things that I'm noticing this text here could definitely be smaller it's kind of overkill being this large so we should definitely decrease the size of that text at least for mobile and then for this do you all think it would be helpful to have some sort of indicator that this is a student profile right now it's just someone's name we don't really know anything about who this person is we have to read this to get some sense and even then this could be a like an alumni profile we don't really know so let's think I don't want to add too much onto here maybe yeah maybe we can add something maybe right at the top here maybe like student profile and small like small font all caps though in a different color so I'm thinking maybe something like we did for C eyes catechetical Institute's their resource cards so if you all see that how we have you know obviously this is the text we want people to see but you can see here in a different color you know just like I said all caps it tells us what it is what category that is let me know what you think about it I'm gonna try to implement this then I can't unfortunately I can't just take what we did here because we used a different system for this a different UI system we use materialized CSS it would be kind of nice if I could just copy it over you know we did use it in our bulletin project let's go to github the react version of the bulletin I believe did the same thing so let's check it out it should be under components and attachments a little post preview I think that's it so the post preview the card view yeah here's our card view and what did we do we are using material UI ear typography caption okay so we use typography caption and we did have some styles we will pull over the styles as well but see this is the benefit I think I've talked about this before but the benefit of trying to use a system and stick with the system is stuff like this to where we have these use cases that are similar enough that we can just go back to a previous project pull the code and really get a jumpstart on what we're doing all right so we're gonna copy this first and then I'll bring the Styles over oops wrong way so right here and we're gonna change this for now we're gonna say zoom profile and then we're gonna pull over this category color class we'll probably change the name of it once we pull it over and now category category actually works here that makes sense area category color I don't know where any the other the other stuff is coming from it seems like this we're doing some other stuff too can I wear your color oh we were doing category to uppercase we yeah we can definitely change that with with CSS alright so we'll change it a little bit let's see oops keep going the wrong way nice let's change this to category and then up here we'll add it in this category we're obviously gonna change the color we'll keep it like this for now though and then let's go what is a text there's a text transform let's check this out I can't remember what the very value is we'll see if this works yeah that worked okay cool so it is text transform uppercase so here we go we have it here let me check on a phone before I smell swith the size even on my phone it's still a little small so I don't want it to be too large but that's that's definitely too small so let's let's increase the font size slightly see what we're working with right now in terms of font size computer 12 pixels yeah 12 is no good let's make it at least 14 you know I really don't like going much lower than like 18 or 16 let's just change it right here and see let's see about 16 pixels see what that does that's too big we're gonna have to go to 14 the only other option is if we made this title a bit bigger but I really don't want to alright so let's try 14 is the font size and see how that looks on a phone as well obviously it doesn't come through and dev tools we'll have to add it to the code and save that to see what it looks like font size and got a comma and what do we say 14 yeah and I definitely yeah I think I wanted different color as well student profile let me refresh okay so that should be coming true now on my phone too to do anything yeah I did okay cool all right I think that's that's not bad I don't know how many you can see it on your phone as well but I like that I like that I think the the font for the body of it could be a little bit better and then we could potentially put this in quotes so that it's more obvious that this is Noah Fisher talking okay alright so my timer went off let's take a short fiveminute break i'ma go to a live chat answer any questions that you all have so I'm gonna scroll up and start up near the top so the older questions first let's see there was some advice for kind of that circle view that I had so I don't think we're gonna go with that and not that we won't use it somewhere else but just for this particular case I think I'm gonna go with this on a desktop view I may actually go with that circle view that that we had so I'm talking about this I think it it works a lot better when it's larger so we may use that nikki is asking about the HTTP sites being marked is unsafe so Google announced that chrome is going to start marking sites unsafe that have HTTP instead of HTTP so iniki's asking does that mean that images also have to be HTTPS like everything I believe so so right now I think what happens is if you're loading insecure assets on to a site that's supposed to be HTTPS it won't display like the full HTTPS there'll be some sort of warning icon for that so well it looks like John Hanson already answered but yeah you need to make sure all your assets are HTTPS blake ass if anyone's checked out react ql you know what i read a little bit about it but i haven't tried it yet probably for this project since we're so far along I'm gonna stick with Apollo for the graph QL stuff but I'm open to trying it out on other projects quanti Xie asks if this is react yeah definitely we're using react right now so we're doing more of like the design stuff so not getting heavily into react components but we are working in react components so you know this is inside a react component we're using you know styles as a JavaScript object which is one way to do styles and react so potentially this may be helpful if you're learning react let's see I jog you're not saying I don't know which what technology univer University uses now but adopting two open standards will allow University to share data between services and systems more easily avoid getting locked into specific piece of technology or supplier reuse software components built by others including open source components reduce overall cost of your digital service change your services design every time we're easily yeah okay so that's definitely the the reason one of the reasons behind the switch is exactly that I don't want us to get locked in like we're we're currently have been locked into a system we're moving everything to open source stuff and we're trying to use things that like okay so let me tou is open source we're using react which is used everywhere our content management system is WordPress but since we're pulling the data in with graph QL we could grab data from wherever we're not really locked into that also says looks good on the phone checking on an s8 awesome alright Nicky says rename the type property to variant and material UI update beta 32 so you are okay so Nicky is it was confirming that it is in the latest version of material UI they did change that type property to variant so where we were I had this wasn't working for us that's because I copied this from the latest documentation and type is now variant so whenever we do update to that we'll just have to keep that in mind and go through and change every instance of type to variant assuming that there's no backwards compatibility built in also says maybe below the name as well yeah we could do it below the name we should maybe think about that right now do you all think it would be better to have student profile above or below the name right now I I kind of would rather have it above the name but if enough of you disagree I can try to put it below it wouldn't be that big of a deal just to try it out let's see I'm almost to the bottom of the live chat so I'm going to glance quickly to see if there's anything I should address right now okay looks like you Yoshi knows if I'm pronouncing it wrong please let me know but I know she knows says above the name looks nice to be honest awesome I mean we'll probably just stick with that alright one last question before we start I arose in please let me know if that's if I'm pronouncing that wrong says what's the best IDE I use adamant is is that meaning visual studio cut better than these I use Adam and visual studio code I like them both visual studio code does seem to be a little bit faster but if you have a good computer it really doesn't make a difference I have not used sublime but I've heard it's good a juggernaut also did a adopting open standards in modern tech also attract future students exactly exactly a juggernaut that's you you definitely get like exactly what like I've been trying to do here gradually you know over over the last two years that's kind of been my you know trying to just update and move things forward and this is kind of like the pinnacle of that and finally getting the main website off of you know this old stuff so hopefully I can convince everyone that I need to convince that that is the way to go and we can get this up and running soon someone in a meeting like that I wasn't in threw out a date of July June first I think of June first there's no way we need till June first to finish this site and I'm afraid if we did take till June first then everybody in the university would want to have their saying and how things go and we would just get swamped with all these competing ideas but I'm all for collaboration on that but sometimes you can have too many people you know putting their input in and then we'd end up with a very cluttered kind of mess of a site and that's not what we want all right let's go start our Pomodoro clock and all right let's see okay I did want to try to make this see how big we can make this while it still looks reasonable and we want to decrease and see how small we can make this that it would still stand out all right so let's check inspect this right now and I'm gonna see what they have 14 oh yeah I'd really rather that be 16 pixels so let's see what 16 looks like on here first oh yeah for sure this I think 16 looks a lot better let's try putting this in and then on the phone let's see so component Peas I think how I can do this what's the best way to do this would be for now I'm just gonna do it like this and this will show a different way to do styles and react sty and let's go with whoops I did not need this font size yeah 16 right 16 pixels okay so if you want to do inline styles what did I mess that up it's possible that I just messed that up I think it was just a style thing okay so you can do inline styles like this you need to use curly brackets to drop in the JavaScript mode and then more curly brackets to make this a JavaScript object then you know just like we did up at the top we're putting styles in a JavaScript object so we use camel case for our keys and then our values for the most part you want to put your values in quotes if it's just simply a numerical value with no units you don't have to put it in quotes alright let's see how that looks great and that is coming through like this I don't know that I would want to leave this probably what I want to do is maybe find some solution where every component that has PE here for under type with the typography component would then automatically be minimum of 16 pixels I don't really want to figure out how to do that right now with material UI but that's probably a better solution that would just take place across the board let's see oh I want to look at it on a phone as opposed miss Andrew there's one more step oh yeah I yeah that is I don't know if you all can see that on your phones if you can that's just so much more readable I like that I really like that I want to see what it looks like in those quotes as well so let's do it like that I wonder for a second I thought what if we do a blockquote right what about how would that look maybe we can take a look at that yeah the quotes are okay I'm looking at on my phone let me go over maybe there is some other way to format this that might look nicer but for now this I think is acceptable let's adjust the font size here so let's go with maybe 20 pixels whoa way too small all right let's see 3030 is actually not that bad yeah let's see what I'm using here for this typography display yeah let's just try to go with a different type here display three maybe I'm not sure if there is a display three but we'll try it out well let's take this off whoa displace still too big display for okay as you go up it gets bigger let's try display one I was thinking they were like age tags okay all right display one is much more reasonable let's just go with that those will set it to display one let's check it all these different display values they're built in the material UI so if you're not familiar with that that's what we're doing yeah that's that's much more reasonable and that reduces the amount of scrolling significantly great that's wonderful cool all right now let's go we're gonna try Nikki says plus one for trying blockquote okay let's do that for sure let's try block quote I want to see I'm assuming that there's a block quote no a scooter that typography component we go to the API and check out the props here we display four three two one headline titles subheading body one body two caption button maybe they don't have all right so based on my three seconds I spent searching it doesn't look like there's a blockquote component or option here so let's just use the block quote element you know straight up just the HTML element and see how that looks oh yeah okay so I'm going to do is copy this and let's just put it over over here this is kind of just my place just throw stuff if I want to save it for later and I keep forgetting to implement the search well that's what this is up here what maybe we'll do that on Monday I think it would be cool to have the search function available because that that's the search works as you're typing you automatically get results and that seems to impress people so I'd like to have the search function working as well for our demos alright so let's take this and say quote chuckle die let's see what happens okay so when we make that a blockquote yeah I'm not I don't think that really adds much it's seems maybe like material I doesn't have a blockquote kind of built in let's see what I'm saying Brooke says just give it a left border that's like gray I guess before it was better okay yeah let's switch it back actually I can just I don't need to copy that over we'll switch it back and then maybe we could add let's add that border so you see which all right yeah let's grab that P let's do a border left and we'll go two pixels two pickles might be too small we might have to go three Bobble the two pixels solid and let's go or G be a zero zero zero and goes zero point five four and that should give us a nice gray mmm yeah it's too thin and the gray seems too dark so let's bump this down and go maybe 14mm twentyfour all right 24 and then let's jump up I think four pixels might be better yeah I like four pixels and then let's give this some padding padding left of eight pixels wonderful all right what do you all think of that so yeah so we've given a four pixel border with a pixel padding the padding goes between the border and the content if we went margarine it would be on this side so that's why we went with padding instead let me let me put that in the code and then you all can see that on your screens or on your phones let's make this a class now so let's make a blockquote class and classname classes let's just call it quote I don't want to confuse it with the element blockquote so we're just gonna call it quote we can take this out of here because we'll add this in as part of the quote class quotes and we'll just paste that in and then we'll change it up font size 16 pixels we're trying we need to camelcase everything and put the proper wou quotation marks get rid of the semicolons and now this should work let's go back here and great looks good refresh great alright there we are I'm gonna check this out on my phone I Nikki that was a great idea I think I really that adds something that looks nice it's just a little thing but I don't know it makes a difference let me know what you all think I don't want things to be too busy but really I mean this is gonna this is really kind of a clean minimalist site so I'm not worried yet that it's getting busy but I I like it I'm hoping other opinions though see looks like so far so far everyone likes it awesome Nikki again great idea on that cool alright cool and I did go with that RG oops I just realized I had my phone right next to the mic so I'm sorry if there was any distortion in the audio huh that sometimes happens when I have my phone too close anyway so say I go with that rgba because especially when I'm trying to do black I usually don't use it for other colors very often but for black it's so nice to be able to just you know on a scale of 0 to 1 being able to adjust the you make different shades of gray essentially you know by adjusting that is just really nice and then you know there are certain values that I use consistently this so like usually for gray text for alt text I don't use regular black I use you know 0 0 0.87 and then for text that I'm using in a form like the little hint text you put in there and in like a form element like an input that's iu 0 0 0 point 5 4 so those values are always consistent throughout all the sites that I do for the university so there's there's some consistency and then you know for little elements like that obviously we adjust you know but for at least for the font it's very consistent alright great the only thing we didn't really do anything about was this learn more but you know what I like that it's coming up with the University Green already which which i think is fun that looks good and so on I'm okay with that all right let me check my timer alright about eight minutes so at this point what would be nice to do would be to pull this out into its own component potentially add in some some options right so we would want to have the option to change this type here this category right so that we could use it with multiple things so maybe we want to use this as a faculty profile or an alumni profile this component could definitely work for all of those we could also have options potentially for more buttons and we definitely want this button to be a link as well so we want this we wouldn't leave it just like this we would want to put a link component in here yeah for sure those would be options and then we could just fill in the data you know as we pull it in from from WordPress we had another suggestion to try out okay so nikki says maybe we can remove the quotes and Ahmed says we could try italic let's try it out right I think I don't think I have time to really you know take on a whole nother component before my my timer runs out but I we do have some time to try out some of these piece ideas what do you all think about the idea to take out the quotation marks would it still be obvious that this is a quote if we take them out now that we have this let me know what you all think because I'm definitely open to taking them out I don't think they really looked at great we could maybe add something a little bit more stylish like an icon to denote I'm thinking like maybe like a larger you know quotation mark I don't know like I said I don't want this to get too busy all right let's try there's a fright Alex there's a textdecoration thought oh no it's not is it all right John says take out the quotes yo she notices italics might fit and make the marks look better if we do keep the clothes all fontstyle it's uh I'm sorry I'll met you you typed it right there I don't know what I was thinking filling font style all right oh let's just check that out sorry let me get this down to one area all right what do you all think oops I didn't put it in there let me put it in so I can see it and we can all see it on our our devices so class quote all right I'm gonna give you all a chance to look at it and let me know what you think before I say what I think about it I'm gonna check quickly about I wonder what's the is there any anything within material design that designates when italics should be used I don't remember seeing anything in the documentation I'm scrolling through the typography section right now seeing anything hmm all right so here's my impression I think it looks nice it makes it even more obvious that it's a quote but it makes it less readable so I think we have a tradeoff here do we want to sacrifice some readability or or have it look I don't know I'm a little bit I'm torn between this let's let's do this and you check my time oops alright only have a minute left let's go down here alright so I'm gonna remove italic from here and I just added an inline so we should be able to see both both versions did it not work I did something wrong oops I put it on the wrong wrong thing okay now we should be able to see him together and on different devices I can't decide I'm gonna leave both my timer just went up so I'm gonna leave both of them one for now and I think I'll probably even commit these to github like that as well we can worry about refactoring into another component sometime some other time or if anybody really wants to make a pull request you know doing that then that's that would be great as well but maybe I'll show my boss or show it to some people around here too and get their input hmm sorry sorry about the yawning okay I'm gonna go back to the live chat go through and finish up if any questions that I missed from from the last break and then I'll wrap things up here on Hill says why not work with pixels and why work with pixels and not percentage it would be better for Responsive actually yeah I would like to have the responsive text so basically what I want is a minimum that the text will never go below which is going to be like 16 pixels and then it could get larger from there so I'm open to doing that I mean for now which just was easier for me to use pixels and I mean I pretty much think in pixels I'm used to using pixels so I know in my head like here's how this will look with the other units that I could potentially use I I just can't see in my head what that's gonna look like so when I'm doing things like this I'm always in pixels but I'm open to doing other things you know when it's time to actually you make the final version of this also says what if you put the name below the text on the right side and remove the italic text all right so it would look more like like the citation for the quote I think about that I'm not gonna try it right now because you know at a time my time I ran up but I'll keep that in mind is an alternative what I'll probably do is show these to my boss too and if it looks like he's not that excited about this design I'll bring that up as an alternative to okay all right I see y'all were talking more about putting it below yeah yeah I think about that anything yeah I'm wondering just from like a marketing standpoint would it if you put the quote with a small name below it then the quote itself is highlighted and the name is in a secondary place if you put the name at the top with the quote underneath in the name is higher up I think like if we want the student to identify with hey this is another student like a real person to say student profile and then a name makes that immediate connection and then they could read more if we want them just though to connect more with what the student is saying and just know like hey this is a student then the other way around would work better I like to think about that because I mean I could see if the quote was really good or or profound you definitely want to highlight the quote I don't know that that's necessarily the case with all these quotes maybe also the quote is is kind of like large I'm gonna think about it I do agree that putting the name below would definitely make it more evident right away that it is a quote hmm this would be a really good thing to do for a be testing I potentially have multiple versions of the homepage where we have one with this style and and another card with the style with the name below and then we measure how many people click on that learn more button one that says with the name below it would make it like a testimonial actually you're you're right really what we're doing here is a testimonial maybe we should look at some common design patterns for testimonials and see if we can get some ideas how this is it like I could we could spend so much time on this one component really at some point I have to make a decision and say okay we have to move on Sean saying more graphical quotation marks yeah I think I could be a good idea all right I'm gonna think about these ideas if anybody would like to mess with this component and you know just to try some things out feel free if you do want to make a pull request for something like this I suggest not removing these but just adding another one like add a third one with the alternate design so that we could compare you know one after another I'm also gonna have to think about given the limited time I have before I have to present this is it worth it for me to worry about this like longer term yeah for sure I think so and I think it might be worth it to do the a/b testing but before my presentation would it be worth it for me to worry about this I don't know that I have time so I guess I'm gonna leave it at that point for now but I really do appreciate all the input because I don't think I would have thought about those things on my own okay yeah and I this is going to be really prominent I think this type of component will be prominent it will be important I definitely want to measure clicks on this this is a really good candidate for a be testing yeah so I'm going to go with that I think at some point probably not before we I do the presentation but potentially before or like shortly after we launch I think I want to do another version of this taking into account your suggestions and then test the impact that's really the only way to know which one is really gonna resonate with prospective students who more alright cool let me commit this right now so I don't forget and then you all can have access to everything that we've done in the repo so let's do it get status see what we've done great that's exactly what we modified so no surprises there we do it get add and then we'll do a yarn CM this is something like custom that we have on this project that it walks you through the pattern of making a good commit message so it's going to ask us if what this is a new feature yeah this is a new feature let's say let's see create create component for student profile card great actually that's kind of misleading I'm gonna leave it there but we didn't really make a separate component because we didn't pull it out yet into its own file but I'm not gonna go back and change it right now we did not break anything and we didn't have any issues open so all our tests are gonna run our linting is gonna run I don't know what did we do HTML entities must be escaped where is the set oh it doesn't like the quote alright let's just take the quotes out for now then I'm okay with that well I can change my message now all right creates even profile card all right that's more accurate because we didn't turn into a component just yet there we go should pass this time looks like Nikki wasn't a fan of the quotation works anyway so now they're gone Noble and savage says forget what hi Jesse tis Savage banana soup hey how's it going thanks for joining us all right cool to get was origin Oh between last stream and now I also did merge that next five branch with masters so after I upgraded it again and checked everything out everything was working fine so I thought okay let's just merge it back and now if you see any weird things happening please let me know but I think we'll be okay with it for now okay Nikki says you can do yarn cm retry to commit the exact same thing messages and all it's better yeah yeah that's really helpful because a few times that's happened to me and I've had to type it in again and it's really frustrating especially if you get errors like three times in a row which has happened so yeah I'm definitely gonna try my best to remember that and use it so that is helpful yeah in this case I wanted to change the commit message anyway but thank you Thank You Nikki alright so I think I've gotten through everything and so I'm gonna finish things up here and go get something to eat thank you so much for all your help I think we made a really nice component today I think it looks great and then we also have some ideas for some variations on this component as well which is also awesome at the very least it might not be a bad idea to use different variations of the same component on the page at the same time just to kind of mix it up for people yeah yeah I think that would be good now that I think about it we probably could get some quotes from some more like famous people like since this is a Catholic school like we could probably get some quotes from some bishops and stuff that might be impressive to prospective students or their parents and we could use this for that as well so I could see this component as being very useful for a variety of you know different pieces of content all right well it's Friday have a wonderful weekend I'll see you all on Monday
