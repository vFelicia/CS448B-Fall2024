when an event occurs in the HTML Dom JavaScript code can be executed an example of an event is when a user clicks on an HTML element to execute code when a user clicks on an element just add JavaScript code to the onclick HTML attribute if you look at the HTML section we have the onclick attribute and there's a JavaScript Command right in here this doin HTML equals serial so I don't have anything in the JavaScript section over here but still when I click on what is my favorite food it becomes cereal you'll notice I also have some CSS here this is kind of just for fun I just thought it was kind of cool that you can use the word papaya Whip and your browser knows that's a color that's just a builtin color papaya whip now besides running a command right here we can also call a function from our other JavaScript code so if we have the onclick event we can call change color and then pass in this that means we're passing in this H1 tab we're passing in this whole thing here to the change color function so over in the JavaScript section we're going to put this change color function it's going to take an object and then we're going to do object. style. color equals Peru because Peru is not just a country it's a color also at least according to your browser so I've reset this if I click here it's now change to the color Peru now on these two we set the onclick event right in the HTML however you can also set the onclick event in the JavaScript so here's a button here and there's nothing in this button that shows what happens when you click the button but over in the JavaScript I'm going to put in some code here first we're going to get the element document. get element by ID my button that's this button over here and then we're going to set an onclick event right in the JavaScript and the event is set to change background color to medium Orchid now this is just a function call that we now have to create okay here's the function function change background color to medium Orchid and we're going to do document. query selector body so that's going to apply to the whole body of the HTML and we're going to set the style. background to medium Orchid medium Orchid is another color in your browser so if I click the button here it's medium Orchid for the background so that's how you can change the background of your whole page besides on click you can also use on load or on unload so that would be something like this you would normally put it on your body tag which would be at the beginning and cod pen you don't use a body tag but if you put an onload event on your body and you run a function here uh these events are often triggered when the user enters or leaves the page and they often are used to deal with with cookies when you're just using the onload and on unload but we're not going to use this right now so another thing I wanted to show you is on input let's bring this down a little bit on input means whenever you input any characters or anything it's going to call a function here so here we have the text box down here and now every time I put in any letter it's calling a function I haven't created the function yet so now it's not doing anything so let's create that function so the function is remove letter from H1 so we're going to set H1 variable to document. query selector H1 that's just going to select the first H1 tag on the HTML page which is this one up here now we're going to find the h1t content that's the text inside the H1 right here what is my favorite food and we're going to set that equal to H1 text content so we're setting equal to itself but then we're slicing it passing in 0ga 1 that means we're just taking off the last letter of that field now this whole function is kind of just for fun just to see what you can do so let's see how it works as you can see every time I type a letter another letter from the H1 tag gets removed also interestingly anytime I delete a letter something is removed too because I'm putting an input of delete and it's still removing letters oh the whole text is gone and let me show you some other events you can do so here I have a div and there's an on Mouse over event that calls this function here and it passes in the div and we have an on Mouse out event that calls the M out function and passes in the div again and we have a class of box so let me put some CSS in here to make it look how we want it to look so dobox just means we're setting the class box to have these things for background we're using the color Rebecca purple so for some reason Rebecca gets her own purple and then the color of the text is light Golden Rod yellow one of the longest text names and we're just going to set the height and the width the font size and some other things so let's see what that looks like and there's the box and right now if we Mouse over and mouse out nothing happens so let's create these JavaScript functions the M over and M out okay here's M over and we're receiving this object that's gets passed into it and we're setting the OBS doin HTML to get off me and then for M out which means Mouse out we're setting the inter HML to thank you smiley face because you can put Emoji in JavaScript code so let's see what happens I'm going to bring my mouse over over oh get off me thank you get off me thank you there are a lot of other events that you can use to trigger JavaScript code check the link in the description to see a list of more events also in the description is a link to the code from this video on code pin thanks for watching my name is
