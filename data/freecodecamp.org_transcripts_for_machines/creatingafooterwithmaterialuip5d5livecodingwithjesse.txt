hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse um today we make a footer so we've completed well pretty much completed the header or the app bar the the drawer which is our side nav now we're going to move on to the footer i like to start with those things because they're going to be pretty much consistent across the entire site so i like to go with those first that gives us more time to look at it you know kind of perfect it you know it'll be tested more just by us looking at it you know constantly and as we're building out the rest of the site so the footer is probably the least important of those three components a lot of people won't even see the footer but it's still nice to have uh it's a place where you can put a lot of the links that you know especially with higher education there's a lot of regulations and things so uh you know we'll put privacy policy and different things like that you know down there at the bottom you gotta have them there but you don't really want to waste you know prying real estate at the top on things like that so basically we're going to make a footer that matches the colors of the university and has space you know for all those links at the bottom maybe um like an address it's nice to have an address there i think it's pretty common that people look um you know at the footer for contact information so that's the plan today i do have a sore throat so i've been taking zinc lozenges and um like cough drops and things so hopefully i have a cop dropping cough drop in right now so if i sound weird sorry it's the cough drop but i want to be able to get through the stream uh without my throat just getting crazy and me losing my voice the weird side effect is though my taste buds like totally don't work um i just tried to drink something and it it didn't taste at all like it normally tastes so anyway um miroslav says drink more tea actually i did have a cup of tea before the stream as well but the tea bag was really old i just found it laying in the bottom of one of my uh one of my drawers here and i thought why not i'll try it and so the tea was really really weak but anyway all right enough about my uh health problems and beverages let's get started um what did i do since the last time oh harshit harshit added endtoend testing so we have some new testing so if you um have this repo running locally you'll see some new options for testing and i'm getting a weird okay let me show this now let me change my view here and show you this this error that i've been getting and see what you all think about it so check this out i keep getting this error now it's pretty uh selfexplanatory it actually says check out this github repo to add this so i haven't added it yet i did check out the repo it seems pretty simple um so right now it's not it's not breaking anything it just brings up you know a million warnings like oh there's a lot of warnings here uh so you probably need to fix that i'll try it you know doing what it says in this repo first and then see how it goes uh i also think that i fixed the problem we were having where the um the styles just went all crazy and our fonts were um were just really huge so i went in and just there's an example in material ui's beta github repo for using material ui beta with next so i went through the um the appropriate files in that repository and then compared them to our files and i went through line by line our files are were almost identical they were really just two lines that were different so i changed those two lines to make them the same you could check it out it's it's my the last commit that i made i changed some some lines in there so since i've done that the problem has not happened again but i certainly haven't tested it thoroughly so we'll see if i don't see the problem you know at all for the rest of the day i'll be pretty confident that the problem has been fixed but it did seem like there were other people that were having that same problem or similar problems so i guess it's somewhat common all right oops i wanted to show you here's the footer that we have now this will give you a preview of kind of what it's going to look like so we're going to go with this green color i don't usually like having giant blocks of the green color but i think it's it's okay with the footer uh somewhat appropriate we'll have that gold border so it'll kind of match you know what we have going on here you know at the top here uh we'll have the same thing also i changed the background image so we've had the same background image for for a long time uh not just for this project but um i think did we use it for home test we did actually it's not showing up so at one point we were using it for that too so anyway i found this cute little pug dog and i might have to change it because it's just so cute i just want to look at it all the time i don't even want to code anymore um but anyway i thought that would be fun to look at my um my wife's parents have a little dog that looks pretty much just like this except their dog is way fatter than this dog um but uh it reminds me of that dog all right so here's what we're gonna do we'll have our regular green color here and then a slightly darker shade of that color down here for kind of like the the sub footer i don't know what you'd really call it um we're gonna have our our copyright stuff and then all these links for all the kind of legal stuff that we need and uh i think i'll just i'll keep this set up for now and uh if we want to change it later we can uh but it would be good if somebody happens to get to the bottom of the page then you know why not give them an apply button and donate button again since uh that's what we that's what we expect to be the main actions that someone would take and the main things that we want them to do when they get to this site primarily apply but then also potentially donate depending on whether they're a prospective student or not all right so that's the plan uh this was done i believe we we use material ui for this so we can't just grab all the code we can grab some of it um yeah some of it like basically the content i guess i'm pretty sure material ui does not have any type of premade footer at least they didn't the last time i checked which wasn't that long ago so these are the components we have so far probably what we need to do what we ought to do is maybe just use their um their grid system to build this out so that's my plan if anybody you know has has used material ui and and has done something like this and knows of a better way to do this maybe more simple let me know otherwise uh let's start out by checking out the grid let's see layouts let's check out this grid so we're going to be using a grid component and this is there we go so we'll have these um let's see we can auto layout we can exactly shift available space okay uh so i guess we'll go with this um full width that seems like that'll fit our use case um yeah let's just copy two classes we have going on here yeah we're we're good um let's grab this grid we'll just grab the whole thing and then we'll get rid of what we don't need okay um let's go over oops almost forgot to set the timer uh so we're going to do we're going to break up the stream into 25 minute periods and that'll be broken up by five minute periods in between so 25 minutes of code five minutes of question and answer we'll try to get two sessions in today and then i'll do question and answer after that uh also i see there's a lot of activity in the live chat so um i'll come back to that if you've asked a question already after this 25 minute session i'm gonna come back and go through everything that's already been in the live chat um i see in general a lot of you are just saying hi uh and uh hey everybody actually someone arivan says say hello to us from brazil so i will do that hey um hey everybody in brazil uh everything thanks for watching okay let's copy that and we'll go over to we definitely want to make this its own component so let's go here in components and make a new file we'll call this footer.js for now i'm going to put everything in this footer component but it's possible that we may want to refactor a bit and extract out you know some of what's going to be in the footer component in it that we'll do in this stream extract some of that out and make it into its own components we'll see how large it gets usually i don't like to have really large components uh if if it's avoidable and usually is avoidable all right so let's um actually let's just grab something here this is really big let me grab the drawer is that smaller yeah this looks smaller let's grab this drawer first yeah let's grab the drawer and let's paste that and then that'll save us some time now let's get rid of all this stuff and paste that in and actually we might be able to just keep grid here so let's let's take out drawer as well let's see what it'll look like with just grid let's get rid of some of this stuff and get rid of this footer and let's change this to footer i don't think we need state but we will need we're going to put one function in here and i'm not going to do it yet we'll save it for a little while later um toggle we don't need toggle drawer we don't need to open and let's see this is full nested function we don't need any of these let's grab let's see what we need really search icon button divider we get rid of all of these and this and that and we're not actually using the prop types right now i don't think we'll have any props to be honest with you um well i guess we'll still have the classes did we even have that in the prop types before no we didn't okay so we don't need those either great so now this is looking a lot smaller which is nice and let's see what kind of grid we need so we'll need let's do it like this so definitely we want small let's change this to i'm assuming this is a 12 column system i guess i'll find out in a minute um so if it's a 12 column system i want to change this to be four columns each on a small screen i just want to get some on here so we can see most likely going to be adjusting this at some point and then i would like this to be 12 all the time and that's going to be our bottom our bottom bar there and then we don't need any of these so all right one two three four yep that's what i want glasses paper oh let's get the styles in there you know what i didn't add that root i don't want to add that let's add this uh root um like we have in the example it says class name classes yeah let's add that in may we may not need it but the closer we get to the example the less likely we are to have any problems okay so not bad let's see okay so we do have some text in here i'll leave that in there for now just so we can see it and that looks alright so i'm going to save that and then let's go to our layout component and let's put in below below this part we're going to put in our footer and then we need to import our footer as well so i'm just going to copy what we have here for drawer and then i can put in footer i'm going to save that let's see if we've done anything ah we didn't import grid i'll see when i read the live chat if anybody caught that i thought i had everything okay so let's see let's grab something here make it easier divider and we'll change this to grid and while we're at it let's double check to make sure you don't have anything else in your paper okay so we'll probably need to import paper all right so grid and paper and i think that'll do it yay okay awesome so we have down here at the bottom full width we have our three uh across here like we wanted and then one below obviously this isn't you know this is not how we want it styled but it's just um just the first step in here so at this point we want to do for sure a few things that container that we put in if you remember that that that div that we wrapped everything in i'm kind of glad i did that now because it'll be good to have a wrapper component so that what we'll do is that wrapper component will put our background color of green that hash that's um 21412a um the hex color we'll put that as the background color on that and then we'll put our border on that as well of course we'll take out all these paper styles we'll remove the paper component completely we don't need that and then at the bottom here we'll make sure that there's nothing here no padding margin anything like that so this is flat on the bottom but on this we'll put a background that's just going to be black but it's going to be transparent so it'll show the green behind it but it'll darken it slightly so i think that'll work so for now i'm not going to worry about content let's worry about getting the colors and the positioning down then we can worry about throwing in some of that content all right we got 15 minutes to do this i think we're definitely gonna at least get that part done and then the second pomodoro session uh will probably be where we throw in some links and uh and some of that content okay so we're gonna get rid of paper we don't need that and we also don't need these styles for paper but our roots now we're gonna put a background color of and let me grab let's grab this color here there we go okay so we have our um the color that i'd like to use is already in our theme our material ui custom theme so we're going to use that when we do it like that it allows us then to go back in later on and we can change our primary color and not have to go and change it in every component works basically just like sas variables do i mean not like the inner functioning of it but in terms of being able to change it in one place and have it change everywhere uh it's similar to how the sas variables are okay so we got the background color there we go and we're going to give it a border top and it's gonna be you know what i don't think i can do it like this let me try it like this but i'm almost positive i've tried to do it before and it didn't work so let's try uh border top solid three pixels and then where's our gold color i thought i had it over here and our style guide i have the style guide open somewhere but i don't know where it is so i'm just gonna open it up again i guess i already had that already using it in the at bar component so i could have just grabbed it from there let's see and we need to remove all of these paper uh elements here read this and this as well okay and let's see how that works for now let's go with um let's add one more style and we're going to say this let's call this sub footer and that's going to be that bottom footer and let's put background background color here and let's go with r g b a and we want 2 5 5 2 5 5 2 5 5. um and then let's go with a point zero point one let's see how dark that gets us here okay and let's add that to this bottom one here and so we'll go class name classes sub footer okay save that oh not bad check it out okay so it looks like we have not not perfect here but oh all right so we do have some weird stuff going on we have a little bit of a problem i guess with um being able to scroll over a bit so we'll sort that out at a different time i don't want to get distracted by that right now it looks like that that's affecting everything um yeah but not bad so we have a border so evidently this did work um i don't know what i did last time maybe i'm remembering wrong but looks like that worked awesome uh let's see so put her back interesting all right well let's just put in some some content uh just to get an idea of how it looks so for now i think i'm just gonna put in i'm just gonna put in some divs actually not even that let's just put in some p tags with some lorem ipsum in it don't i have low room i used to have lower mipsum that just popped up guess not all right let's grab some laura mipsum text and i'm going to use bacon ipsum and let's see what that gives us let's see what we have going on here so we have oh goodness i put the uh the wrong um hex wrong colors here uh i'm afraid to check the live chat and see who called me out on that let's try it like this there we go so i instead of doing black with a transparent black i did a transparent white so anyway i usually never do that by hand i always copy it from somewhere or use the color picker and dev tools okay cool not bad that's that's pretty much exactly what we want i could probably stand to go with a little bit darker color here let's increase this and do a 1.5 or 0.15 see how that looks i like that i like that much better okay and that border looks very thin i'm thinking it's not going to work so it works up here i don't want a huge thick border up here and it works it's it's subtle but that's what i want down here we'll leave it like that for now see what i think about it but it may have to make that maybe just one pixel thicker all right let's check my time here wow six minutes okay all right well let's put in some um some text and so we could use the material ui typography component so i guess let's let's check it out it's not here am i missing this style there we go typography all right let's check it out okay so let's try to use typography and maybe give it a um what's the default the defaults body one so we'll just leave it uh blank so we get a default on there and for color actually i don't even know what our secondary set at default we're going to want this to be white okay so for now let's just go in and use typography instead of these p tags oops it's not i wanted to do it like this there we go typography and then we need to bring in typography up here all right let's see if it works did i miss something i didn't really see much of a change let's see what we have let's see what we can do here classes usually stylify the components well let's add a color here footer text and let's go color and let's give it oops okay give it that color we're gonna go font size 16 pixels uh and so then on these typography no just on the first ones we're going to get class name classes let me call this footer footer text all right see what happens oh footer text oops i'm always forgetting the commas here okay awesome so we've got the white text let's check yep we got our font size we wanted uh 16. i may want to make that bigger for the top section leave it smaller down here i think i do i don't know about you but that just looks really small let's bump that up then to 18 and see what it looks like yeah that's that's better change the line height as well okay all right cool um we definitely need some some padding right need some padding on the sides top and bottom so let's do that for here we can put let's just put some general so we need padding and uh we need our top padding to be let's try eight first we might have to go with 16. so we're gonna go eight and on the sides we are gonna go 16 and 16 and we're going to go 16 on the sides especially because we have that scroll bar to deal with and then we'll do 16 on both sides be just to be consistent and then the bottom i want it to be zero for right now because remember we have that section with that different cut background color so we don't want to add padding there because that's going to push that section up and there'll be a small stripe of our original base color so we don't want that so we're going to put the padding directly on that sub footer so padding bottom and that's where we'll have uh eight yeah let's give it eight pixels on the bottom and we want um to push it up push the content up above it right so we have the the padding covered everywhere else except for there so let's do a margin top and first we'll try out 8 pixels and we'll go from there right we want to do a margin and not padding because we did padding top that would make the entire section color included get bigger we don't want that so that's why we went with margin let's save that and see what happens huh okay so we we got a little bit of let's inspect this we got a little bit of what we wanted but not not everything we wanted so we have our padding here so check out that padding whoa and then our margin okay 12. looks like we already had some padding going on there by default so maybe we won't need to do that but i do like the uh the margin all right so let's stop right there because my timer is up i'm going to take a short break now go over some questions in the live chat and then we'll come back and we'll mess around a little bit more with our margin and padding so scroll all the way up and i'll try to get through as much as i can there's quite a bit here in the live chat so we'll see how it goes uh jimmy says hi i'm new hey how's it going uh welcome to the uh welcome to the the live stream and uh feel free to ask any questions uh or put comments in the chat i'd love to hear your opinion on things okay jimmy had asked does does this dude reply so not sure if you're still here jimmy sorry i didn't see that but uh i did explain it earlier hopefully you stuck around and got the explanation that i will i do reply to things in the live chat but during the the breaks that i take to go to the live chat i did try before to you know try to monitor the live chat while i'm coding and uh it ended up not being so good it took forever to code anything and um yeah so i can't can't do that thank you uh for everyone who's giving me suggestions on what to take uh for my sore throat uh i i really appreciate that uh erivon asks what operating system do you guys use to code i'm on mac os right now i almost exclusively use mac to code my servers are usually ubuntu linux and i do have pcs at home but i don't code on them often i i just use them for gaming okay horseshit asked about the end and testing if it works on my machine yes it did work um so yeah it worked it worked perfectly well with the exception of those errors that were on there but that's not due to the testing those errors showed up before i merged your pull request so uh but the the end end testing itself uh worked perfectly so thank you for that hardship rook said that picture is the best the dog yeah that's such a cute dog i want to like get rid of this text now so i could see this dog better oh cool so a heart should ask if we could if i could demo the end end testing yeah so let's do that so i'm going to go yarn test and uh if you have the most the uptodate version of this on your local machine when you uh when you pull the latest make sure you run yarn to install all the new npm packages but then after you've done that you can type yarn test and we'll see our tests running so those tests passed those were unit tests now this is our endtoend test so you see it actually did the testing in the browser which is awesome and we can see it even gives us uh timing in milliseconds so really cool if anybody's interested in testing or learning more about it or if you know about it and would like to get some more practice you know feel free to add to the test that we already have on there and then as we add new components if you'd like to write tests for them you know that would be very helpful um i'm still pretty new with testing so i'll do my best to uh keep up to date when we add new components but to to be honest if i'm really like if i have a lot to do the testing is gonna get put off uh that's just i am working on a few other projects right now so i may not be able to put in the time that i i ought to on that uh jesse says uh jesse mcintyre says that pick is awesome philip says i hope the pick is production ready jesse says it's way too distracting yeah as soon as i saw that picture i knew like i have to have this on here okay uh so didn't get through everything in the chat right now but i will after this next pomodoro session so i took a note of where i'm at in the live chat i'll go right back to where i left off uh after the next session and let's see okay all right so we put in some padding and things but it didn't exactly work like i expected it to so let's check out what's going on is it this i might have to pull this over a bit um okay so our footer is supposed to have all right i need to do something else with this let's do it like this um let's take this and dock it to the bottom and let's make this full screen all right so when i do it like this unfortunately i won't be able to make this very much bigger we'd never be able to see anything and also i realize that this section is now covered up but i will do my best to talk about what's going on all right so what we have here that i'm i'm wondering about is we should have padding top left oh goodness it was my mistake i messed it up uh i'm sure you all noticed this already we're mad here all right let's um arrange this a bit better there we go okay so unfortunately i don't know what happened to my brain for a second but this is not how you do positioning so the correct order is top right bottom left why why i didn't remember that at the moment i have no idea but that was our problem so you can see now we have uh our eight or was it eight or sixteen yes sixteen pixels of padding on both sides here and eight at the top at the bottom our container has nothing in terms of padding oh goodness i didn't even think about this but we can't do that right because then we're going to have these little spots here let's fix that so here's what we need to do we have these these grid items here we'll need to put our padding directly into these we can keep top the top padding here so let's do padding top and how did that look okay i think we can go 16 for the padding top so let's do that and then we're going to make let's see footer text let's just go footer footer sections and let's say padding for footer sections and we'll give a we're going to give them padding of zero for the top and bottom and then for left and right let's give them 16. we'll see how this looks it may be too much between sections but uh it's worth a shot so let's put in here in these grids so just those first three class name we're going to say classes dot footer sections great all right now let's see what it looks like and i forgot my comma again goodness i need to get like a little jar on my desk and uh i'll like every time i forget a comma i'll have to put a coin in the jar and then it can go to like some charity or something but then i'll learn my lesson to quit forgetting that didn't work like i wanted it to but i'll learn my lesson to quit for getting the commas in javascript arrays all right let's see here's a grid item oops you know what our padding is being overridden that's fine let's go with a margin instead i don't think we have a margin on any of these yet no no margin but margins will work in this case so yeah let's not try to fight what's already there we'll just switch it up to a margin no all right let's try this let's try to use what's already built in here oh man so okay how about we'll do this let's see if this works instead of putting it on these grid components whoops didn't grab it all instead of the grid components we're going to put these on typography how do we do this can i just do a comma oh goodness no i can't see if i can do a comma classes. footer sections i think i can do that no i can't uh let's oops let's see if that works yeah there we go i need i need to make it an array and then it will work okay all right awesome so we finally got what we wanted that took way longer than expected uh but it's not overall not bad i think we're making pretty quick progress uh and did i find it yes okay i found the issue uh can you all see that here's what's causing our i literally have my face like a few inches away from the screen right now so uh i don't know if you could all see that yeah it's right uh uh right here in the corner the bottom uh right hand corner our our shadow right is not a shadow but you know our i guess our overlay is extending out you know past this so that's where our issue is where we're getting this little section on the sides we definitely don't want that so why is this extending out when oh goodness our grid our grids extending out as well so all of our great items are extending out we don't want that hmm so hmm okay so it's has to do with what's going on here all right let's re uh reload that just to get rid of what i did oh let's continue spacing all right let's check out our grid stuff what's the spacing hmm okay this is our problem here so this is exactly what's happening let me zoom in on that a bit uh so you probably couldn't see this in dev tools because the the it was too small and i think it was covered up by the um by the video feed of my face but there's a negative margin and that's how they're getting this to work so it's the the official width of this grid is 100 of the screen plus 24 pixels and then there's a negative margin all around of negative 12 pixels um so let's see not using the spacing feature and implementing it in user space adding a padding on the parent with at least the spacing value adding overflow x hidden on the parent actually if this works this will be the easiest way let's try it we can try it oops right here in dev tools so the parent would be this so let's go with overflow x hidden all right cool that solves the problem um awesome so we're going to add this here so our root component is our parent and we're going to say we're gonna remember a comma this time overflow x hidden save that and all right so now we don't have our horizontal scroll wonderful we still have what do we have going on here what happened to our our top hmm goodness yeah i want to do this too all right so i'm going to take off the spacing or i think the example said set it to zero i'm going to take that off as well because that's seems like it's complicating a lot of what's going on here so let's check okay good so our padding is now working properly great okay okay great okay that seems to work so um so what we ended up doing then is uh there's this builtin spacing uh property that you can use with the grid container uh component and it was it was kind of messing up what we were trying to do you know manually with our styles here so i just got rid of that i know it's easier for me just to work with the css or the css and js directly uh then to try to figure out you know what i'm what i'm doing here because i know exactly what i want with this footer component so i think it's just going to be a lot faster to do it like this all right let me check my time seven minutes all right okay so let's get some stuff here in this sub footer and yeah that'll be all we will do let's find our example okay yes we just have the copyright and these links let me grab this and for this i want to put a span and within that this is going to be this dot get here and up here we're gonna have get here and this will be what is it i always have to lift this up uh i wonder if we're doing that here already i think we are okay so we just need to get let's say this const uh date today equals new date and then we'll say return i'm going to return date today dot get full year all right all right let's see if that works what do we get yep no it didn't work all right let's see what comes up here so this afternoon components all right what did i do you're still getting it class name looks like and two errors let's see just 44. let's check the first one saying i'm giving it an invalid prop but it's working all right so it's just a prop type thing now this one i'm pretty sure we've done this before in react yeah we have right maybe we haven't uh is this not working hmm okay let me just skip that right now for some reason i'm just not seeing what the problem is i'm sure it's just something silly that i'm forgetting to do or doing wrong um let's we need a little bit of padding here a little bit more than we currently have let's see adding bottom margins up actually yeah we don't have any padding right now so let's add some adding top and let's go with eight pixels on the top good so we have eight on the top eight on the bottom it's pretty slim might have to increase the padding a bit but i i kind of like to have it a little bit more slim i think it looks nicer okay not bad so let's add that padding on the top and that'll be the last thing that we do for uh for this stream in terms of coding let's see you know what we need some padding on the sides as well so let's go ahead and just change our sub footer instead of doing a padding bottom we're just going to do padding and we'll go with that top of 8 pixels and then left and right of 16 and bottom of zero since we already have padding on the entire thing wait did we no we didn't are we getting that padding on the bottom oh i had it separately how did i have that stuff for this somehow i had padding bottom on there i'm not sure how okay um let's add eight pixels then and then 16 pixels sorry everybody i'm starting a little bit of a headache so i'm just kind of i don't know if i'm making a lot of sense at this point but in general we're getting done what we want to get done okay that looks good we have our the right amount of padding okay all right not bad so uh you know we have you know let's just compare a bit let me get rid of this and uh we'll compare so we have them side by side here uh this is what we are going for and so that looks okay now forget contentwise because i'm not worried about content right now but just in terms of design we basically matched it right we've gone with a little bit thinner subfooter um a little bit thinner of our our top border but we have recreated that design now and this was done with materialized um framework and now we've recreated that with material ui so not bad not bad for uh for two pomodoro sessions and uh especially on a live stream everything takes longer on the live stream okay so let me commit this so you all can see all the code and you know what i'm i'm so sorry i didn't start the ngrok server i completely forgot to start it um my apologies for that like i said i'm just i hope i don't get really sick if i'm gonna get sick i hope i get sick right now and get it over with because we have thanksgiving coming up here in the united states and then uh right after that i have the uh um to talk at the november conference so i wanted one or the other i either need to not get sick or just get sick right now and get it over with um all right anyway let's do a git status and see what's changed layout footer yeah that looks about right git commits and i'm gonna use the am flag to just combine it all into one step git commit am and we'll say add footer components let's run all our tests so now on commit we have what we had before whoa all right okay those are just our normal errors for a second i i got nervous for a second okay so in addition to all the stuff we had before which was our uh unit tests and our auto formatting uh with with linting now we have our end to end tests that run so for now there's not that much going on and i have a pretty fast computer so it all happens quickly hopefully it stays somewhat quick although if we end up getting a really large application at some point on a slower computer that may take longer so but at this point it's entirely manageable and now i'm going to push this up to github awesome so now all the code is available to you at the github repo the links in the description at this point i'm going to try to go through all the questions and comments in the live chat i'll respond to uh to all the questions as best i can uh if for those of you maybe can't stick around for the q a session thank you so much for watching i really appreciate it and i will most likely be back tomorrow around the same time assuming my my sore throat doesn't get any worse all right so i left off here let's see i left off in in a discussion between a few of the uh live chat participants so i'm going to skip through that okay rook said that keyboard shortcut he used uh is super useful so the one where i selected um the text so let's go down here so i would highlight something and then hit command d or control d if you're on windows and it highlights everything that's the same right so it's kind of like doing a find except uh it's a lot faster and it immediately highlights that and then it's i think it's called multiple cursors and then you can see i can go in and tab over or type things right and i can type in three places at once not it's very useful it's not as powerful as doing a you know find and replace but if you only have a few things that you need to change it's faster than doing a find and replace so normally if i have well like less than 10 things that i need to change i do the control d or command d the multiple cursors otherwise i go with the control fine but super useful i remember first time i found out about that it was like blew my mind it's like wow this is the coolest thing i think i found out about it on will stern's youtube channel um it's uh learn code academy and um that was it was just it looked really cool when i saw it for the first time all right and yeah she says hello hey yeshu how's it going and all right n is here she says hey hey anna how's it going thanks for watching also says your project looks cool awesome i'm glad you like it let me know uh if there's any anything i could change with that to make it look nicer okay tim asks uh jesse what's cms so what content management system is the old site using is the database behind it public wondering if it can be just migrated to something else and wrapped into a docker container that's a good thought as far as i know the database is not public i need to double check that on friday i think is it friday no no i think it's next week i think next tuesday i'll have a meeting with some of the people from the it department and i'm going to ask them more about the database at that meeting the content management system is called ektron so ektron so i haven't come across many people who have ever heard of it let alone worked with it i try not to work with it as much as possible uh it's it's not very user friendly at least the way it's set up for us who knows maybe there's maybe it can be better than it is but in its current state right now it's it's frustrating for the people that have to manage the content uh yes she says hey jesse why don't you install this package it's a teletype it's an atom package using this people can collaborate with each other actually that looks really cool i might have to try that out i'm not gonna install it right now on the stream but um that sounds like it would be really cool to use especially on like some side projects i could see that being really fun or a good teaching tool that would definitely be a good teaching tool i think my wife's learning how to code when she finally gets to the point where she sets up her own code editor i think that would be really fun um the problem would be getting both of us able to code at the same time uh i don't know what i'd do with the kids but uh i that that could be really fun uh california boy asks how long have you been coding um i've been doing front end stuff for about five years now the first year of that was not really like coding it was just like basic basic css changes to wordpress sites and then gradually i got more into things and so about three years ago i started like very deliberately learning more about javascript and getting more into javascript and at the same time getting more indepth into css as well and then for sure for the last two years uh maybe a little bit longer than two years i've been doing uh you know more with javascript development and um not reacted first i did a lot of single page apps with um with jo with jquery and then i've moved into react you know over the last year or so if you'd like to know more about my journey to becoming a um uh front end developer i go into more depth about like what i learned and when i learned it uh there's a video on my youtube channel which i think is linked in the description um i think it's called like how i became a frontend developer or something like that but you can check that out and um i think it's only about 10 minutes or so but i i talked more about um when i learned a code and how long it took michael says i keep asking my son why he watches game walkthroughs on youtube and now i figured it out well that that's cool um i never thought of this uh as comparable to a game walkthrough but i guess it's um i guess it is you know now that you say that that's kind of cool uh blake says hey guys what games do you play it's a cool question i don't think we've gotten this one before um right now i'm pretty much limited to mobile games because i just don't have the time with uh with four kids all eight years old and under uh to really like sit down at a you know computer or console to play things uh so mostly some some games on mobile um i like to play games from supercell um trying to think what i i have minecraft on on my phone i play that the kids like to you know to watch when i play that uh my son's been getting into minecraft on the pc uh but i can't i can't help him with it i get motion sick when he plays it and uh lately i've been playing super smash brothers with my son just a bit um and i have an old super nintendo that still works and i've been playing super mario rpg with my son as well i did get the the newest version of starcraft so they they remastered so it's like starcraft remastered i got that and i never played it um i just was so busy with my react nano degree course that i never played it i actually connected with one of my old friends from high school and um we were trying to get together to play online but it's never worked out maybe i have to make a better effort maybe over christmas break or something anyway i'm i'm kind of interested at what games you all play if anybody into into video games and if so would you like to play okay uh yes you asked what testing uh you did so the yarn test yeah so it's set up um let's go to the package json for a second so car should set it up that test runs our unit tests and our unit test is jest we're using jest for that and then we have a test.js file that you know configures all that and then also we're running the e2e so the e2e testing is uh we're using mocha and then if you want to so like all these are available in the github repo so you can check out runner.js and um spec js anything that's dot spec.js so if you want to look you know more into exactly what's going on check those files out let's see michael says i want a two shot of you and harshet all right i don't do i don't understand what you want let me know explain explain that please uh michael uh yes you asked um are are we using webpack what yeah so behind the scenes webpack is going here but since we use next to scaffold things we didn't configure webpack ourselves so there's a webpack config going on here that's just the default from next i believe you can do some custom configuration uh next now has a next.config file i don't think we're yeah we're not using it but if we wanted to do some more custom stuff uh then with our webpack build then we could do that but right now the default is working for us all right i see michael um notice the comma thing so thank you for noticing that sorry i didn't look over at the live chat and see michael also said i thought margins and paddings were completely different they are different let me take a second just to run through some margin and padding stuff um where are we at let's let's check this out well let's do this since we're just working on that so i'm gonna inspect this and yeah let's make sure that we're not let's see if i can increase whoa too big all right so let's try this so this i think is a really great demonstration right here in devtools of how margins and paddings work so we can look you know we'll take a look here actually would be better if we had something let's let's go up a bit so when you have something with a border it's it's better okay so right now this is our container div for our footer and you can see here's our border is this thin gold line so our margin of 30 pixels you see is is that orange area it's outside of the border right and then here's our border three pixels and then inside of the border is our padding right so padding is inside the container right so it's inside the container inside the border and it's between the content and the border margin is outside of the border so it's outside of the width of the container and it's between one container let's say another so your padding actually will increase the container so you see like the background color extends to the padding but margin is outside of that so your background color doesn't affect that okay so that's how margins and padding work so that's why sometimes we go with a margin sometimes we go with padding so it just kind of depends if if you're using a div that doesn't really have a background color you can kind of use margin and padding interchangeably the user won't even know because of you know if you have no background color you know in all your divs that you're trying to space out if you do have a color though then it becomes a lot more important as to whether you use padding or margins if you just use padding it's going to look like there's no space between anything because that background color is going to extend but if you just use margin then you may not get like you know like we have here where we have some space between the content and the background color right so it depends on what you're going for but they are definitely different uh blake said that teletype package could be a reason for switching over to adam for me actually uh i saw on twitter this morning that visual studio code has come out with something similar where you can i didn't check it out for sure i just know what i from what i read on twitter uh that you can collaboratively code on the same uh the same document the same um you know file that's what it seemed like like i said i didn't check it out yet i didn't try to use it yet but so potentially visual studio code can do the same thing now michael also asked what's the purpose of setting a margin um i kind of explained that but it basically like in this case we have a margin because i want there to be space between the footer and the content that's up here but i i don't want the color of the footer to be extended here so i want this this white space between so that's where you would set a margin at least in this case that's why we set the margin we could have different reasons for wanting to do a margin as opposed to padding blake asks if anybody has built a pc i built a pc um it's been a long time it's probably been over 10 years since i built a pc i think it's kind of fun but if you mess up like if there's sparks or something you could really mess up all your stuff so that part is not fun i've done that before and ruined things but if it all goes well then it is kind of it's really fun you know to build everything yourself definitely not as easy as just buying it or have a custom having one made but if you if you like that kind of thing then it it was fun uh john asks is box sizing border box on these elements actually i didn't check that's that's kind of important though i should have checked exciting do we not have box sizing on here it's not making a difference let's look at one of these interior ones yeah it is border box on these grid components box sizing border box yeah so the interior grid components are a border box uh you can see i wonder if i can see if we can get it to change yeah okay so look at this huge difference we have depending on on what we do with our um with our box sizing so in terms of our footer it's actually not causing that much of a difference right now but the rest of the elements on the page are like huge different okay blake sorry your uh your comment about uh with the link to the computer um parts it was hidden so i just unhid it so if anybody wants to check it out um at some point towards the bottom of the live chat uh blake pasted a link asking about what what you all think uh about the parts um that he's thinking of using uh to build a pc uh so nope says tested out firefox quantum and it's three times faster than google chrome that's really cool uh and actually has test results in a video uh on on their youtube channel so let's check that out uh if you're interested and thanks for the info oh no shoot i'm sorry so rook just reminded me that when you do get with the flag am it doesn't add a new file so my footer component did not get added i i do this frequently i should remember so let's do a git add now it's there so now i'm gonna do uh git commit m and let's say get footer add footer component for real this time all right sorry about that everyone i actually think i did that last week too and i didn't realize it until the next day all right now let's do okay push to github all right so now the footer component will be there really sorry if anybody tried to check out that code and even more sorry if you tried to uh do a get pool and get everything running and uh thanks for letting me know about that rook smiler says firefox quantum is really cool stuff i'm gonna have to check that out then uh let's see have you ever used bulma css uh if yes what do you think about it i have not used bulma so i i don't really have any opinion about bulma uh because i haven't done anything with it firsthand i i remember checking it out at one point but it's been so long ago i don't i don't really remember what i thought about it uh rick says do you have tests for javascript uh java on public uni github um i think all our tests should be on um on github let's see we have um yeah we should have all our testing stuff on github uh peter says hi jesse do you have any an opinion on linux and the fail of the city uh munich and germany with it regards no i i i actually did not hear anything about that so i'm i'm out i'm at a loss because i didn't hear anything about it so i guess i don't have an opinion in general my opinion on linux is i i really like it for running my servers on it seems to be easy to work with but since i don't really have any information about the particular incident you're talking about i'm sorry but i really can't give you a good answer new york says um i play racing games uh project cars and others with steering wheel and a bucket seat it's really enjoyable that sounds really fun actually that's that's cool let's see dave's talk about super mario bros yeah um let's see yeah actually so i'm gonna share a secret with you all and you cannot tell my eightyearold or any of my kids not that any of you talk to them but i think i may get my kids the new nintendo the nintendo switch for christmas so i wasn't going to because it's expensive and i don't really have the money to spare right now but my son my oldest raphael who's eight he really wants it and he's been so good lately helping out with the baby and with his younger brother and he's been cleaning he wakes up in the morning before school now every day he's been doing this he wakes up he cleans the bathroom and then reads a book for 20 minutes takes care of his baby sister and his little brother reads his brother a book just been super super helpful so he's acting like that and now i i'm like man i gotta get him something nice so anyway i just wanted to share that with you all because i'm kind of excited about it and i i can't tell my kids be obviously it'd ruin the surprise but if anybody has a switch let me know what you think about it i'm going to end the stream in a minute or so so i may not catch it unless you put in a live chat really quickly but let me know what you think about it is it worth it is it fun what games do you like that you think would be appropriate for little kids are there any games that i should definitely stay away from because they're either not appropriate or they're just terrible games uh anyway let me know because i haven't even used it yet so i'm i i don't really know what's good and what's not good all right um alexandria says hello uh hey how's it going thanks for watching uh eric says inline styles and react yay or nay i don't have a problem with inline styles and react i use them occasionally the only thing is if you need just one element to have a certain style and you don't plan on reusing it anywhere then i don't really see the problem with inline styles at all if you find yourself using inline styles frequently then you probably would be better off using something else could be css and js it could be just a plain style sheet or any of the the many different ways to do css in react uh john says your son sounds like a great person yeah i don't know what happened uh just recently within the past couple weeks he started being super helpful i mean he's always been a pretty good boy but man he just like he just matured all of a sudden um it's kind of bittersweet though like he's not he's not like a little kid anymore he's you know now he's he's way more mature and being helpful so you know it's part of me misses him being little but now i'm just so proud of him now you know for being so helpful uh so anyway yeah so i want him to i want him to like show him how proud i am i can say it to him but i think he'll appreciate it much more if i get him something nice i remember how excited i was when i was about his age and my parents bought me a super nintendo i was just so excited so i think it'd be cool you know to see how excited he gets and his his little brother's uh his little brother and sisters will probably be super excited as well not the baby i mean she'll just chew on the controllers but the other ones will be excited let's see um david says that typography tag sounds like something really interesting yeah i haven't used it that much but it seems like it could be really versatile i'd like to learn more about it so as i use it i'm sure i'll pick up you know more of what it can do and get better with it rook says that's very nice of him those things don't just happen so you and your wife must be good at parenting i don't know about that i tried my best the way i figure you can't really know whether you've done a good job at parenting till till they grow up and you see what they came out as right you know at this point like they're still they're still baking right you don't know whether you've done a good job until until the cookies are done baking and you actually get to taste them right you know so if my kids grow up and have families and they end up being good parents then i'll know that i've been a good parent you know if they grow up and they they're good people then i'll know i've i've done a good job so until then i just trying to do my best david says no problemo we keep the secret thank you i appreciate that uh smilers ask how old are you i am 32 so i just turned 32 at the end of october so just a few weeks ago and uh yes i'm 32 and i have four kids i've been married for 10 years like 10 and a half years okay oh blake got his uh hacktober shirt awesome awesome that's that's really cool i'm still waiting on mine uh when i get it i'll let you all know um i'll probably take a picture of it and i think you get a sticker too i'll probably take a picture of him put on instagram um so i'll be super excited about that as well but um anyway i am at the bottom of the live chat now i'm all through everything and i'm feeling really tired right now my throat's starting to hurt again so now's a great time to wrap things up um all right i got one more question let's rick asks besides free code cam what sources you all use to increase the needed skill sets who has referrals um youtube videos i like youtube videos and just reading articles tutorials documentation um yeah so i guess i could give you more specific things i'm going to do a video at some point i know i've been saying this for months but i'm going to do a video at some point where i list kind of all my top sources for learning how to code but um oh cool blake says you get five stickers for uh hacktober um or for for the hacktoberfest uh awesome looking forward to that okay so i'm gonna end the stream for real this time uh thank you so much for watching and uh for all you're contributing in the in the live chat all your comments and questions and uh like i said i'll probably be back tomorrow probably around the same time 2 p.m eastern time uh if i'm feeling all right um if i feel any worse tomorrow i may end up just staying at home so i'll let you all know on on twitter if i'm not going to stream and i'll put something in the slack channel and the getter channel too otherwise i will be back tomorrow and until then i hope you all have a wonderful day
