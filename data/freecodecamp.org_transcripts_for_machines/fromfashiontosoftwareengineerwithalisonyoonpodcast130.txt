it is true that there are a lot of jobs out there there like a lot of companies looking for developers engineers and then like how you can progress over time like the career aspect is great too but don't just change your career because of that just make sure that you are going to like it you're going to enjoy it welcome back to the free Cod Camp podcast I'm I'm Quincy Larsson teacher and founder of freecodecamp.org each week we're bringing you Insight from developers Founders and ambitious people getting into Tech this week I'm joined by Allison Yun she's a software engineer she works at octopus energy in the UK and uh she is also in charge of the free code Camp Korean language localization effort Allison how's everything going with you hi Quincy thanks so much for having me it's great to be here yeah it's exciting to talk with you and uh you're you're based in uh London right that's right yeah so if there's a little if I accidentally interrupt you or anything it's just transatlantic latency uh but I I'm so excited to talk with you because you and I have known each other for several years at this point and you've been hard at work on localizing free Cod Camp into Korean there are so many Koreans around the world who benefit from reading the translated version of uh the freeo camp tutorials and I understand that you're making steady progress toward localizing the Core Curriculum as well yeah it's been like when you first talked to me about contributing to fre code cam I still remember that they very clearly because I'm someone um who transitioned from completely nonrelated background to programming and I myself benefited a lot from free code camp and I was very honored to have an opportunity to contribute to free code Camp awesome yeah well I I just want to say for the benefit of everybody listening like thank you to everybody who is supporting our community we have about um I think it's like n uh 8,000 932 people around the world who are donating each month to support our efforts and one of the things that does is support having very capable people like Allison on our staff helping localize into Korean and uh also helping just contribute in many other ways so uh yeah if you want to become one of these cool supporters who who support our Chari Mission and make a tax deductible donation each month of free Cod Camp just go to freecodecamp.org donate we would welcome your funds and we will put them to good use toward the mission so Allison let's talk about your Early Childhood I always like to do things kind of in chronological order so we don't have to keep jumping back and forth uh but you have a really unique upbringing and uh I want to talk about that because you are an expatriate essentially you're living outside of your country of origin uh maybe we can talk about what your early years were like sure um I was born and raised in South Korea so until I graduated University back in 201 20 12ish yeah something something like around that time um I lived in many different places growing up because my dad was a military officer he's retired now but because he worked as a military officer I moved from City to City quite frequently growing up um and what else I can talk about yeah I mean yeah yeah I I think that's what's unique about my childhood like I always wonder what it felt what it feels like to be just live in one place for many years because For Me growing up the longest time I lived I stayed in one place is about 2 years and I was constantly moving around which was quite challenging for me cuz like for a kid like I have to constantly say goodbye to friends and what I'm used to and then have to go to a new place and then made me friends and just do that again repeat yeah yeah that uh I mean I moved a few times as a kid and I just remember every time I moved and had to say goodbye to my friends it was like absolutely devastating and so I can only imagine doing that every year or two like that has got to be heartbreaking like at some point when you were moving so frequently did you just was there ever a point where you're like I'm not going to bother making new friends cuz I'm just going to be saying goodbye to them soon or how how did that affect you yeah absolutely I I remember I I cried only once in my lifetime because I had like I didn't want to leave my friends and in the school that happened only once when I was in third grade elementary school after that you know never cried and I just kind of accepted it there I cannot fight it you know it's just what it is and this is something I didn't remember myself but a friend of mine from like sixth grade um she told me that I once said that you know what's the point of making really really close friends anyway like we have to say goodbye at some point she told me that I said that when I was when I was in sixth grade and she was very surprised to hear that because I don't know it's not something that you will hear a lot from sixth grade um kids but yeah I think at some point you you just get used to it right your environment and situation so yeah well um I'm sad that you had to go through all that uh but you know it sounds like your dad was doing important work and uh I'm sure he would have loved to just settle down if that was an option I I mean I say I'm sure but uh you know I I don't know very much about your dad but uh I I imagine he didn't want to put you through all that tumultuous uh moving and stuff well I guess one of the benefits is you've lived a lot of places can you talk about some of the different places you've lived yeah so I lived um in Soul and the suburb of soul and one time in kangwan which is like the um East Side from Soul like east coast of Korea and this place where my dad worked at the time was actually very close to like the border to North Korea so um the military hospital that my dad was working at the time would like sometimes get like I don't know if I can mention this but like sometimes get like the dead bodies of like North Korean soldiers you know and and something like that which was really I didn't like think people trying to defect like people trying to leave North Korea I mean because they I don't remember exactly because this happened when I was very young and I didn't pay much attention I had absolutely no interest in whatsoever going on in North Korea and you know the conflict between two countries but um I I think it was the soldiers but again like my memory isn't 100% clear yeah yeah I mean it's it's a conflict that continues to rage on and uh we've talked about it a lot on this podcast because I have tons of friends who had to serve in the military in Korea it's like two years of your life really like the prime years of your life like uh and you just have to go and drop everything and put your life on hold essentially um and uh I guess fortunately like women are currently Exempted from having to do that for the most part right you didn't have to serve in in the the Korean military but like uh a lot like do you have any do you have a lot of friends who had to uh basically if you're are male if you're identified as male then you have to unless you um unless there are I think there are some like conditions where you can be Exempted like healthwise mhm but I don't know um exactly what the conditions are but if you're healthy if you're male then yeah you have to yeah I mean everybody serves like it doesn't matter if if you're in BTS you have to go serve right exactly yeah so uh it's just kind of like Elvis had to serve in the US military when he got drafted right um yeah and he and he went and fought in in the war right uh I can't remember which one I think it was like Korea uh the the Korean uh War uh actually I'm not certain is it early I don't is it that time yeah uh he was yeah 1960s uh yeah Korean war was way before 1960s though yeah so it wasn't the Korean War it was the 19 it was um yeah he served from 1958 to 1960 in a tank unit um and it was just like a cold war operation but my understanding is he was drafted uh Elvis recurring character on the freeo camp podcast uh let me see yeah um cuz they still had I think a draft going into this period uh yeah he was drafted to serve and he uh he worked in active duty for two years anyway this is very very uh ancillary details that I'm just looking up on the fly so I apologize he didn't serve in the Korean War that that was early 1950s I believe uh but um but yeah like it's like that uh except it's just never ending like every Korean male uh and it's quite likely you know if your kids have Korean citizenship or or you know your nephews and nieces and stuff that they will also have to serve like there there this conflict probably isn't going to come to an end anytime soon right yeah unfortunately yeah well what were your early aspirations I mean you were moving around quite a bit but what were uh what did you want to do when you when you grew up I don't know about you Quincy but my dream growing up like changes every year I can I can tell from the records or like a diary that I kept when I was young like this year it was scientist next year it was dentist next year it was teacher like it just keep changes and me I don't know cuz when I was young whatever I thought it was the coolest at that moment I would write that as my dream without knowing what's involved to become one um so like really never once in my lifetime grow growing up I thought that I would be a programmer yeah yeah yeah well you went to school for fashion right yes yes I did yeah what was that experience like you went to uh a very famous university in Korea Soul Women's University um what was your time like there yeah so the first time I got interested in fashion is probably when I was a teenager I started reading fashion magazines because in Korea I think it's the same now if you go to middle school and high school most schools require you to wear school uniforms I don't think it's like that in the States but in Korea you each school has school uniform and so like naturally you don't have much freedom on like what you and where and like how you express yourself basically by choing your outfits and use you know your hairstyle and and things like that um and maybe that was why I I was looking for some kind of Outlet you know from like take being taken away this kind of freedom and I really enjoyed it I really enjoyed like every season the runway from like designers you know to show and everything and I think when I applied for fashion major um so finishing up my high school I wanted to become a fashion buyer so it's it's different from designer um is buyer is someone who would go to like different brands and basically like select and buy something that you think what people are going to like this season you know that was that was my goal the time and then I joined I started University and I had a great time uh cuz the school provided me with many different opportunities to be in abroad study abroad doing internship abroad so um yeah had a great time yeah and so it's like so Women's University like is it's only women basically are there very many guys on campus at all uh there are some exchange students so like from different countries different schools who would come to our school and who are boys but um if you are student in Soul Woman's University then you're a woman woman yeah yeah like you know this was in like the you know 201 probably right like so so it's like that that's pretty uncommon to have like just a All Women's University though yeah today but but you had a great time there you told me yeah absolutely I think um I think I really had a great experience doing internship in Paris so I think I was um sophomore M and and then I had a chance to spend like one semester in Paris working for a designer's boutique the time and yeah I mean if you're a fashion student and you're in par is like you in kind of a dream place just like in Devil wor Prada like it it describes how like every woman wants to be there you know kind of it I don't know it it was like a dream at the time yeah devil Weare is part A really exciting movie great performance by Merill stre and uh yeah like they they go to like Paris fashion week that's like the kind of the big climax of the movie it it's a cool movie like I watched it I also watched Zoolander which is maybe like a less realistic uh portrayal of fashion but like my friends all love Zoolander and so we like use Zoolander quotes a lot uh it's also classic movie about the fashion industry but uh that's cool so you you got to go to Paris but like being I imagine the fashion industry is like pretty competitive and also like like because so many people want to work in it it's like working in the game development industry so many people want to build video games that as a result there can be like toxic kind of like work culture and and um and it can also be very clicky where like you have to know somebody to be able to get a job and like like even like lowlevel internships and things like that are coveted whereas you know being like a a general software engineer there's tons of opportunity and you also can potentially have work life balance and things like that was is fashion like that at all am I mischaracterizing fashion or is it extremely competitive like that yeah so um I worked just like very short time after I graduated in a fashion company about like 6 months I believe so like less than a year because I quickly realized how different it was to be in the industry um compared to when I was in school when when I was in school like they encourage you to be creative explore express yourself it's all about that so it's just it's very fun to be in school studying fashion but working in fashion industry is nothing like that um it was very exhausting and like you said you know toxic cuz like when when you're surrounded by unhappy people you know it's not that people want to be toxic but because they are also unhappy and exhausted is it naturally becomes like that you know whole environment and the atmosphere um yeah so that's why I don't know I felt like I I remember I got my paycheck like my first paycheck and second paycheck and every time I see the the money in my bank account I felt like I'm just dying little bit inside and that's you know after a few months I was like no I can't do it I can't do it anymore so I left yeah what is that experience like like youve you've trained for like three or four years to get this degree you did an internship uh you're working in fashion and like to just walk away from that world can you kind of describe like what your thought process was and and where you go from there yeah I think because I didn't have that much and I think it it will be similar to a lot of the students who are in the University right now that um you you don't know what's actually involved to work in that industry that you want to be in because what they teach you in school um doesn't always represent what your daytoday work is going to be like when you starts working and it could be very different it could be different from what you expect you know and so something that you felt like you know oh this is my calling you know like I'm going to be very good at this I'm going to you know enjoy doing this may if you are thinking that while you're in school maybe there is a chance that you know it's going to be different when you start working it happens a lot I've seen a lot around myself too you know and my friends um so yeah but at the time cuz I was still very young when I I graduated you know one semester early earlier and started working and you know just 6 months after I was still like early 20s so I didn't think too serious I I wasn't afraid to leave at that time cuz I felt like I still there is time for me to explore and I think I'm my personality I when I know that that I want something and when I know that I don't want something like like it's very clear like I don't have to think second you know yeah it's time to like put into an action but I I know that not everybody you know is it's it's not that easy for everyone I know that's just my personality yeah so you're just like a decisive person essentially like like when you feel it in your heart you make a move you don't like just stay in a situation that is not comfortable for you exactly yeah yeah awesome what did you do like you're leaving this industry like how did your parents react if you don't want me asking like that's like yeah what was what was the reaction of your friends and family yeah um my mom suggested that I I stay a little bit longer and see how it goes um my dad didn't say anything because my parents also it's I guess it's their style like they don't really tell me what to do and they just kind of you know let me do whatever I decide to do and I really appreciate that you know when looking back like my parents never really pressured me to do something or study something or go this way that way it was always on me the decision you know and I really appreciate it cuz I know that not everyone gets that kind of environment yeah yeah so from from a like a practical standpoint okay you've decided to leave your parents are on board that's cool uh but you still have the Practical question of like what are you going to do how did you go about evaluating your options and like where do you go from there yeah sure so after I came back from the internship in haris you know like from the day I came back I've only thought about how can I go back because I really Lov the time there um but unfortunately I don't speak French so there there was very little chance that I can be accepted to any kind of school um or just can start working there because of the language barrier so what I did is cuz I I speak English you know I can maybe apply for master's program abroad so I apply for Master's um to when school in the UK to study fashion marketing and I got accepted and then I couldn't go because I couldn't afford a tuition um that happened and then yeah and then after that um I started um volunteering for this like nonprofit organization it turned out it was a nonprofit organization later but yeah volunt started volunteering there and then they that organization sent me to Canada and then to to America to work from you know work in different centers and from there um I spend a lot of time like teaching meditation and also like spend a lot of time doing some graphic design work and web design work for the organization yeah so you you kind of like just through your work there you were able to find Opportunities to learn new skills and some of the skills you learned uh included uh essentially like the precursors of software development yeah I think that's that's how it started because at the time what I taught myself is to um how to make a website using WordPress and then at that time I also taught myself how to like what's HTML what CSS this sort of stuff which was incredibly fun at the time that was the first time um I learned about like how website is made and was behind you know was behind the screen and uh after I came back to Korea so left I left the organization and came back to Korea and then I continued my career with this experience um doing web design so I started working as a UI ux designer awesome what was your first uh uiux development gig was it like a contract for somebody or did you get a job like how did how did you go like okay I've got these skills let's get on the market and let's let's get paid to code essentially yeah so the uiux designer I so my title was designer so programming wasn't part of my daytoday work but then I still like you know suggested that can I program as well it will be easier for me if I design it and then I can at least do the HTML CSS simple JavaScript you know and then give it to the front end developer that way they will understand better what I want to achieve and also because programming was fun I wanted to do it um so I my first job as a UI ux designer was for this startup um that was their product was to create like this kind of video meting platform at the time and yeah so that wasn't my first job as a developer that was um uiux designer job you said video Nanny no video video meeting sorry video meeting oh okay like video like you can't afford it any but just somebody to watch your kids I just heard video dting sorry about that um but yeah that that's cool wanty is it what you want right now yeah that's what we need for the kids because I'm doing a podcast interview and they're and they're watching Magic School Bus in Chinese of course cuz we only let them watch uh Netflix in Chinese because we want them to improve their Chinese yeah that's like one of those things just immersive they can watch Netflix but it has to be in ch Chinese so they can improve their Chinese nice yeah but but having a video Nanny wouldn't wouldn't be bad I guess stop eating [Laughter] PopTarts yeah okay so so a video meeting platform that's that sounds like pretty heavy duty so what were you building um so the company name was it uh is was Roundy I I I think it's inspired by other company um little few years ago but yeah they were making a like a you know think Google meets right yeah um but they wanted to incorporate like different like features there such as like taking meeting notes and scheduling the meeting like the calendar and like kind of like different participants can create meeting notes together at the same time this and the recording this sort of things yeah yeah that's cool so a lot of features to plan a lot of features to implement how big was your team so it was a startup I was the only designer there and there were um I think six seven Engineers total one frontend developer and two mobile developers and um backend and server Engineers yeah awesome and uh what was it like being on a team like uh because I mean this is probably pretty different from working in fashion like suddenly you're in an office was it like a cubicle layout or did you have offices like did you was it all Co located this or this wasn't like was this a remote job or did you actually report to an office in so this was way before covid so it was in office job not remote job not cubicle it was a startup it was like very casual so like a bunch of tables pushed together essentially no no like you you have your own desk and then like it's not like facing each other but then is opened you know so like you can easily talk to each other and things like that um and yeah like it was very different from the time when I was working for a fashion company because at the time I was like just fresh graduate out of University and then not knowing anything about what it's like to be in the industry and just started working and then you know I guess my expectation and dream just kind of destroyed when I started working uh but this time because I knew better what is involved what what your daytoday task is going to be like if you are U uiux designer so it was great like I it was fun for me you know I was able to use the skills that I learned throughout the year and it was fun collaborating with others and then especially with other developers together um and the work was never like I never had to work over time which is great it was like the work life balance was great um I think it was yeah I think it was a great first job for me yeah and you got to learn and apply a lot of design principles like I imagine there is some overlap between what you learned at fashion design school and doing web design right like were some of the concepts transferable uh yeah I wouldn't say concepts but some of the things that I learned in school studying fashion um is to use the software like Adobe Photoshop and illustrator this kind of thing and I also taught myself how to use in Design This is another Adobe software um and that skill you know is important when you are working as a uiux designer and I also learn how to use canvas which is an app in in Mac basically like Photoshop or illustrator like graphic design tool yeah so that skill is transferable not very much the concept but then also I um took some classes and courses to learn more about UI design before I got this job so that was also helpful yeah how did you get the job was it were they like did they ask you questions like oh but you saided fashion why are you applying to be like a web designer like what was the application process like so I I it it was like a startup job fair that I went and then I was really interested in this specific company so I scheduled an appointment with him you know how like in job fair there are different Booth of companies so these was all like startups and then they would say that we are looking for this kind of person or this kind of skill set right so um I I sent my CV and then just went to the job fair and then met with them in the booth and then Lu the the CEO of the company um uh he like he he think I will be very qualified so he just got me the job then and there wow so your career transition if if I can recapitulate I just want to make sure I'm getting this right like you you left fashion school or like I guess you finished did you you finished school I I fin I finished the school yeah yeah and and like you couldn't afford to go get a master's degree uh so you you just traveled around and worked for this organization and uh de like learned the skills on your own essentially and then when you got this was this in Korea or that you got the that you got the first job the first job yeah in Korea yeah so you just walked into basically a job fair you were prepared you had your CV um and you kind of knew what you were looking for and I mean did you apply for a lot of other jobs or was this just kind of like a very fortuitous like job search yeah definitely definitely actually like before I appli for this job I worked in different company just for a month as a frontend developer MH um but then that company was like very very small and they didn't have enough funding so you know my uh my classmate at the time who had loads of experience working experience in different um industry I mean he was still like programmer but not a front endend developer you know what I mean like a server developer or something so he he understand the industry and he can like see the company so he I kind of described what it's like and then he told me maybe it's a good idea to look for a different place cuz it doesn't sound very stable so that's what I did and that's how I got this job yeah that's good that you had people looking out for you and saving you from like I mean it does happen sometimes you get a job at a startup and they run out of money but they don't tell you they ran out of money and next thing you know you've got they're like Hey where's my uh where's my paycheck and like oh it's we're a little bit behind and then next thing you know you worked like you know a month or two without any sort of compensation at all to show for it right that does happen sometimes and it sounds like you're uh your friend was like looking out for you and making sure that didn't happen to you yeah um this like highlights kind of like a path that a lot of people don't appreciate like just how viable it is uh which is go work at startups like startups you can talk potentially to the top person right the founder or the CEO or or the CTO or somebody like there's not a lot of hierarchy at these organizations and they don't have usually this really regimented hiring process and a lot of times when you can actually talk to a human being they're going to like look at your portfolio and they're going to read your CV whereas if you apply to like IBM or Dell or some giant like tech company you may not hear anything back because the you know that maybe no human even reviewed your application because it just got filtered out by uh you know the software the applicant tracking software ATS systems uh so going directly to a essentially a job fair for startups that we're trying to find people that is like a a very brilliant kind of like round like a way to go around the uh very difficult process of getting a first developer job and it sounds like you've done a little bit of development work you weren't coming in completely cold but that's really cool tell me about your experience so you said it was called like roundly what what was the name of the company yeah Roundy um round e round e was the product name and the company name was linear Hub at the time linear Hub okay but is acquired by different companies so I don't think it's that name anymore okay yeah yeah that that's cool that that always happens to linear hub.com uh yeah it looks like it's a completely different product uh but uh okay that's cool so while you were working there um how long did you stay at this company did Were You There When They got acquired or no no no that it happened a few years after I left yeah yeah so and I I worked for this company for a little bit over a year so until we moved to the UK in 201 yeah tell me about that move like what precipitated you moving when you say we yeah me me and my husband and our dog okay very cool yeah so so you and your husband decided to move to the UK big decision how are you able to move to the UK cuz like moving to a different country uh can be tricky like immigration wise and stuff yeah yeah so my husband is um is Korean ameran and we met in Korea um got marri married in Korea and he was staying in Korea for a few years when we met he was going to um Language Institute to learn Korean language because he didn't have the chance to learn growing up in the states and um he told me like many times how he wants to go to graduate school you know because he he has degree in physics um MH but he doesn't want to pursue his career in physics and in Korea he was a lot of the a lot of English speakers in Korea um the jobs can they can have is either like teaching English or you know get a job at school uh he was working as an essay tutor so like a College admin Administration helper or teacher instructor so like basically someone who helps kids writing an essay applying applying to American colleges um but he didn't see himself doing that job for many many years that was just always a temporary thing and he wanted to go to graduate school but then there were some huddles like he got very interested in computer programming because we had this chance to like you know let's make an app and let's let's learn like how to you know use this software and then the languages let's you know do it ourselves and he really really loved it and then since then he's like you know I want to do programming but a lot of the American colleges don't wouldn't accept you in master's program if you don't have the same degree in your undergraduates um that was yeah blocker and another blocker is that you have to take gr it's like a test that you have to take if you want to apply to a lot of the Masters program in in the US um and like to study that is also another blocker because it's like you have to really commit like time you know and effort to do that so I because I've already applied to U master's program in the UK years back um I knew that you don't need gr and and a lot of the universities in the UK would still accept you if you have unrelated uh degree in your undergraduate so it was perfect and also he didn't have to take an English test because he American yeah that's true you have to do is just apply you know yeah and and UK is very receptive like I I don't think it's terribly hard for an American to get a US student visa whereas it would it is kind of difficult sometimes for Koreans to get us student visas for example um and especially people from like China India places like that it can be really an Ord deal to get uh a student visa but sounds like the UK was very permissive in giving him a Visa and then how did how did you go over there did you get a did you just come as like the the the spouse of the student yeah so what he got a student visa and because we're married I got the dependent Visa yeah so like I'm not a student but then if you are the dependent if you are on the dependent Visa of someone who has a student visa also he was doing Master's course not undergraduate I think the law changed a little bit now if you are if you have if you are undergraduate student um I don't know if you can still bring your family on dependent Visa or not but if you are doing Masters you can do that um as far as I know and then that for someone who has dependent Visa you can work fulltime oh interesting so you had work permission right off the bat when you arrived yes that's great so so you arrive in the UK uh your husband's going to school and you have all this time that you can spend you know going out and expanding your skills as a developer uh what do you do what what are those first few months like in the UK yeah like to be very honest I was very anxious because from the time we arrived like he had schedules that he knows what he will do there's a set schedule he's going to go to school there are classes he's going to take there is place that he needs to be in like for me I had absolutely nothing and again like because this was I was already in my late 20s I I felt very different from when I was in the early 20s you know I I think I had more fear at the time and more anxiety about like completely different environment in different countries um so I did apply uh for many jobs as a frontend developer because that's I I knew that that's what I wanted to do at the time and I got some interview opportunities but a lot of the companies um wouldn't so easily give like such Junior who don't have any experience as a developer a job you know um so but then Al also like our savings was was kind of like running out quickly um because like no no none of us was working at the time so I just you know applied as a designer because that was much easier I already have experience and I got a job as UI ux designer yeah what what type of work were you doing and like like what kind of industry or what kind of company were you working at yeah it's um it was same like tech industry they had their own soft inhouse built software that was using by a lot of you know clients and my job was to design the software that they were building and so basically the same just different product and different company but my daytoday job was same and this time you know it was a bit different because I could spend a lot of time in More ux Design side rather than UI design so I had a chance to go to the client's site to meet the people so the potential users to do the user interviews and user testings and this kind of thing to iterate to make our product better design better and that was that was a fun thing yeah so this is like great because uh we always say like user testing user testing like uh make sure that you can empathize with your users and like there's an entire category of user experience uh developers and user experience designers that is like basically user testing and uh I guess user research um and and basically empathizing with them so you can understand they sit down they need to get XYZ done you know what are what is going through their mind what do they care about like do they care about the fancy splash screen that you show throw up like saying the best software ever or whatever or do they just like ah get out of my way I need to get this this client work done really quick or or whatever it is right like so so you were able to talk with the actual people that were using the software yeah exactly and who were these people so uh this client I it was an it was an Airbus in in France and they they are like very tacky people as well these are you know not someone who never use computer you know they they use computer they use like very very complicated software all the time but even for these people what's really interesting is that what what we like our team thought this is so natural and this is so easy to do this kind of thing this kind of task is not so easy and it's not so natural to people who never seen this software never seen the design never seen the screen so that's why this kind of user testing actual testing is very very very useful because say you can never guess what people would think you know you can never be right maybe I don't know maybe I shouldn't say never but a lot of the times a lot of the times you're going to find it very different from what you would expect yeah well um what did you learn during that that process work Airbus of course like one of the biggest corporations on Earth making you know one of the two giant you know plane manufacturers um well also that's cool that you you started in France doing fashion design now you're going back to France doing uh essentially uh user experience design right uh what did you learn from that that part of your life oh so like to clar clarify I didn't work for Airbus Airbus was one of the clients yeah they were one of the clients but you you you got to go out to France to work with him to do the user testing yeah yeah and I I mean I make it sound like it's a big deal but like you can just get in like the Chunnel did did you do the Chunnel where you go under the the the canal um to go from London to Paris or the Eurostar the Eurostar yeah no Eurostar goes from London to Paris Airbus was in tulus it's a different city ah so we just took flight from okay did you fly on an Airbus plane I don't know actually yeah that's cool so I want to um we can definitely delve more into uh your your daytoday work but I've got just like a ton of questions for you that I'm just going to fire off like one of the things that uh and ultimately after you work there like how long have you been at your just to just to finish the autobiographical like Arc how long have you been at your current company octopus energy this coming August because right now is April coming August will be my third year anniversary yeah and this is a really cool company like I hadn't heard of them before uh I met you but they're doing like renewable energy right yes yeah 100% green energy yeah and and what what kind of work do you do for them are you like developing like you know dashboards and user experience for end customers or like what what does it look like yeah so what's really interesting about octopus energy is so octopus energy is more like a grp group so when it says octopus energy it sounds like I'm working for Energy company but it's actually a tech company in the like a subcompany that I belong to is called Kraken Technologies and Kraken Technologies build our inhouse software called Kraken which is used by different energy providers around the globe um and we have many different clients here in Europe um and in APAC also yeah Asia Pacific yeah yeah and also in North America um and the work that I do because we have many many different products uh that exist right now I work for a product that's we're basically building like a do you know what cookie cutter is Cookie Cutter like basically you like we some give something to the clients who want to use our Kraken API and when they Rec clone this product in from our repo they can just build the consumer the user facing website out of the box really fast and easily and they can see all of the examples of what you can build using our API that's the project I'm working for at the moment so essentially at the end of the day they have like a white labeled kind of user experience that is really just like them it's it's almost kind of like getting like WordPress you get WordPress and you go in and you customize all the stuff behind the scenes and to your end user wow this is so different and like bespoke looking but you're actually using power tools behind the scene to just very quickly get a lot of stuff done you didn't have to go in and like figure out exactly how you were going to like do absolute positioning in the footer and all this other stuff right like a lot of that stuff was done for you and so it's it's like a power tool for creating maybe some sort of like customer interface that a a user that a utility company might need right yeah yeah okay cool that was that was a great um yeah comparison okay cool I just want to make sure I understand it correctly uh but cookie cutter that's that's a good term because um for anybody who hasn't ever B cookies you get the cookie cutter and you can have them in whatever shape you want and uh it's a lot easier than like using uh you know a knife or something to like shape the cookies yourself so um I'm curious to learn about like now that we know a little bit about your journey what did you use to learn to code because you have a very broad skill set that you've developed mostly just by learning on your own right like uh you you are essentially selftaught even though I like to say when people are selftaught like nobody's truly selftaught unless they independently learn things without reading books and things like that but to use the more I guess generous definition of selftaught you're effectively selftaught right yeah I mean yes and no because when I was working as a UI ux designer in Korea back in Soul I took some classes online classes and free code Camp obviously um like there were so many tools available online um that either free or not very expensive that I can take so that's how how I was learning programming at the time and coming to the UK so I worked worked as a product designer so uiux designer and I left the company because it was more and more clear in my mind that this is not what I want to do I want to do programming so I left the company and then um I joined the coding Booth Camp uh like an intensive course and then I was able to join because they had like a scholarship for people who's coming from um like a minor minority background I say under representative um yeah uh so joined the booth camp and then did the 16 weeks um course uh here in the UK and then after that I got a fullstack developer position yeah Junior uh fullstack Dev in a in a start up yeah yeah so just uh one of the things you've said like in the past uh when when I've talked to you is that you felt like working in design you were really just kind of like doing the same few things over and over like there's only so many ways that like a landing page needs to look or a footer needs to look or like some sort of like navigational window and like you can't get too far from that or else it's not familiar enough and users get frustrated with like where did this go like why is this user experience so confusing so to some extent would you say you were applying a much more limited range of different um Concepts as a designer than you are now doing as a as a developer yeah that's what I learned you know working as a uiux designer is that my work is kind of repetitive and then like I'm not in no way representing the whole like UI uiux designer task because everyone could be very different and depends on what their product is and what their company is but the job that I was working because I was working for startups and then they had either their product or the software they were building my job dayto day was very repetitive and there wasn't much room to be very creative like you said like people are people want something that they're familiar with you know and we have to design something that's easy and that makes sense to people and then when you want to do that like there is not much room for you to be very creative it's very different from like print design or graphic design you have to design something that people that's that makes sense to people you know that already exist so people already know what it is yeah and that's when I felt like oh you know I I feel I feel like I'm just doing same thing over and over again yeah yeah well when you talk about graphic design and print design did you do did you ever do print design and graphic design yeah yeah a little bit when when I was in the states uh before I um learned how to use WordPress I also did the graphic design yeah a lot of lot of people listening to this probably studied graphic design like it's one of the most popular majors in the United States I think maybe it's not one of the most popular but I have tons of friends who study graphic design and it's still like uh a field that a lot of people go into but that's almost kind of like for magazines newspapers and like print uh you know uh printed like annual reports from companies like there's a lot of creativity that goes into those because it's just like a static page and people can just like read and flip the page and stuff but with web design like that's an interesting Point like people need to know how to navigate around it and and as a result it's it's used it's not merely consumed like print is and therefore that really does constrain how creative you can be to an extent right yeah yeah and to be fair like there are many like really really interesting web designs out there like website like Awards you know with like 3ws and you know there there are many many websites that has complet different design but you know with good reasons you know it could be like a you know marketing specific website or for this campaign or there is a reason why this has to be very different but our like a lot of the websites that we see they to day web application or mobile application um they it's not great if they are like two different from rest of Cs because then you know it's confusing to people yeah I mean a lot of people say like free camp your landing page looks kind of bland like uh and I'm like yeah but it's one of the most accessible accessible landing pages around like uh there was a this uh gentleman who does he cares a great deal about accessibility and he goes through and he like ranks accessibility of different charities around the world and uh of the 100 plus Charities that he looked at we were like number three or number four I think uh and that's because we care about accessibility we care about performance we care about you know just having a nice simple landing page that shows people like very like what you see is what you get type uh experience as opposed to being fancy and having a lot of stuff but um but you you could definitely be more creative I'm not saying that freeo camps like landing pages like perfect and solved and everything like that but but that is like there are so many considerations and so we often get people like oh you should Jazz it up you should do like you know carousels I don't know like random things that people tell tell me I should do to The Landing page um but at the end of the day like what's more important form or function well they're both important but at the end of the day like for a website in my humble opinion function is the most important thing and being able to get things done uh there are some amazing like if you look at Gary Simon he uh designc course.com I interviewed him uh and that podcast episode may already be out by the time this comes out if not look for it really inspiring web designer he's got like this artistic guy he's been doing this for like 20 years and he's got amazing designs that are just like I never would have thought of those things but at the same time uh he also asked to consider accessibility he has to consider how is this going to look on a small device right how is this going to load you know all these additional considerations so I can I can definitely see like you wanting to continue to expand your skill set so for graphic designers out there and web designers who want to get more technical who want to become full stack Developers like you are and have the ability to uh you know use tools like react and maybe also use tools like no JS um what would you recommend they do if they wanted to do what you did and transition from like like become even more technical I think even if you are designer and you continue you know you think you're contined to be designer so like you don't have to make a career transition but still like understanding even just a little bit about how your design comes to life how it's built is very Priceless because at the end of the day the people that you work with are Engineers are developers and it's really it makes it so much you know easier for you to communicate with them if you understand what they are talking about and then also like when you design because you understand how things work how things are built um um you maybe will give a second thought when you like want to put this here and then that there you know if you understand how it's built you know you're going to understand the constraints better and what developers would say um it's going to make everything easier for everyone so uh I think it's really good skill to learn even if you're a designer but yeah for for people who actually want to make career transition like myself um and if you are already designer I think that's really great because you are already industry and you probably already you know have a lot of experience working with other engineers and developer and you can kind of see what they do dayto day so maybe you know like ask yourself is this like is what they are doing is something I'm going to enjoy I think that's really important for you know reason why I changed my career from design to development is because I knew that I was enjoying programming more than design work um so it is true that there are a lot of jobs out there there like a lot of companies looking for developers engineers and then like how you can progress over time like the career aspect is great too but don't just change your career because of that just make sure that you are going to like it you you're going to enjoy it that I think that's really really important yeah one thing that you did uh that you posted a lot about back in the day was you did 100 days of code um was was that a helpful tool a helpful Community for you to uh improve your developer skills each day yeah absolutely 100 days of code it's it's been great I um I post it on my Twitter now X every day because it it gives you the motivation to code every day it's kind of a self commitment but also there's a community like if you have that # 100 days of code like this big Community out there will like support you by like commenting and then liking your post and then you do the same for others and then because you are a part of it you know you feel like I I don't want to skip the day I want to do it like want or do 100 days and it is it is a big commitment it's not easy but you know if you are selflearning you know like I once did it's it's really great Community to be in yeah one of the thing that you've told me a little bit about you your work daytoday at octopus energy which sounds like a fabulous place to work you all are really big on pair programming can you talk about what PA programming is and what a typical PA programming session might look like absolutely so par we do a lot of par programming in my company right now um and Par program in is basically like two developers or more is fine too but usually there's um like one person who's actually coding and then I think there was a they call it Navigator and driver or something like that maybe yeah yeah is it yeah so one person who's actually like typing the code and then one person like watching and this is very helpful because you're going to find yourself a lot of the times that you're kind of stuck and then it seems like you're not made making any progress this happens we are all humans and our brain gets tired and then a lot of the issues that you have now maybe it will be solved next morning after a good night sleep uh par programming you basically you get another fresh set of um eyes and brain they're with you and then you can also you know like rubber ducking um yeah explain rubber ducking yeah and you by you like trying to make this other person understand you can kind of organize your thought that way and then as you're doing that maybe you're going to find solution you know who knows like yeah so rubber ducking it like is where you have like the rubber duck just sitting on your like on top of your monitor or wherever and you're trying to explain things to the rubber duck which is absurd why the rubber duck is an inanimate object it cannot understand what you're saying but just the process of trying to explain what's going on and articulating that out loud can it's almost like the rubber duck is a sounding board and it helps you arrive at your own conclusion oh that's why because I didn't do XYZ right like so um and pair programming is almost like having a rubber duck that can actually talk back and say oh but did you do this oh no I didn't do that that's the answer you know so you get unstuck a lot faster par programming has often been criticized because people are like but two developers working independently could create more code but but creating code is not the goal right the goal is to solve the problem is to is to to implement some sort of solution right just just going in creating a bunch of code you know a whole bunch of chimpanzees can like bash on keyboards all day and they won't necessarily produce something useful but the moment that you have like a more deliberative process you know it can ultimately yield a lot of time even though technically you're using twice as much time because you're using two people's time uh things can get done faster I think my suspicion as to why people don't like pair programming is because a lot of people just are more introverted and don't want to like and also it's embarrassing sometimes like somebody's watching as you code and like you make some embarrassing remark you're just like oh no I look like a fool in front of my my esteemed colleague uh so it's one of those things where you have to be kind of Brave to be able to pair program what what was it like had you ever pair program before this like did you do this um online before you joined octopus inter I did in my previous company so my first job um as a as a junior fullstack developer um yeah what was it like the first time you pair programed what did it feel awkward I was I was very because I also did the coding Booth camp and we did a lot of PA programming there so it was something that's just very natural to me cuz it's I mean if you are focused this is what I like about programming by the way you are focused to solve this problem you know it's not about someone judge you how smart you are or judge Your solution if it's good or bad like you and the other developers like all of our goal is the same to solve this problem and you know like if we talk together there is a better chance that we will get better solution you know that's what it is and in my first job I was very lucky that the uh CTO there it was a small startup and there weren't that many people the CTO who hired me he was very very committed to Mentor me at the time so every time I face an issue or have a question like he would be there like sitting next to me on my desk to like for me to like talk to him and then like explain what the problem is and then kind of you know guide me how I can solve this issues so yeah I've already done a lot of par programming and very used to the concept and how it works and things like that and I think I think I think you made a very good point like some people don't feel comfortable about PA programming I think what's also important is the culture and the environment that you're in are you in the environment where they encourage you to par program because my current company does you know and maybe if you are in an environment where like nobody wants to pair program or they like your employer might think that this is a waste of time why two people looking at one monitor you know if you're in that kind of environment then naturally you're not going to feel so comfortable about PA programming right yeah but but if it's it's kind of like culture comes from the Top If the CTO or the head of engineering if they value pair programming they believe in it that's going to propagate down and people are going to par program more and they're going to feel comfortable par programming without being judged like oh I'm you know I'm wasting company Time by doing this when I should just be fixing it myself you know so yeah I I and that's that's really cool that you because you joined a small startup where the CTO could have the bandwidth to have a personal relationship with you and actually Mentor you to an extent like that's yet another endorsement for working at small companies rather than going straight out of school and and going or or going straight out of another company if you're transitioning into Tech uh trying to work at small companies I again I uh as I've written about in my book how to learn the code and get a developer job freely available if you just Google learn a code book it should be the top res hopefully click on it and read it h it's it's free and I talk a lot about my own personal Journey which was basically working at a small local startup and uh talking to the CTO directly I interviewed directly with the CTO and the head of engineering and like it was only like it was a very small team but I as a result I got all kinds of personal kind of like mentorship that I wouldn't have gotten if IID just gone straight to a big company where I was software engineer one and then there were like software engineer 2 software engineer 3 and like you know um staff engineer like the giant hierarchy of of titles right like and you can absolutely go to those places first but I strongly encourage people to try to join small companies first and it sounds like you got to wear a lot of hats too you were probably doing all kinds of different work and working in all the different kinds parts of the code base as a result um I want to talk to you a little bit about tools uh so you um you work with d Jango which is a python uh backend development framework a little bit right and and because that's that's my understanding is that octopus energy uses Jango instead of just using like no. JS right uh Kraken does our soft but the project that I'm working for right now doesn't use Jango what I use daytoday is react typescript and nextjs okay nextjs yeah very powerful library that we have some excellent nextjs courses on the free cocap YouTube channel by the way sorry if I'm like chilling for free C too much it's like my literally my job I'm wearing a free shirt right but I I I I I want to remind people that we have these resources um and some of which are being translated into Korean thanks to you um we'll get to that in a moment but uh so you're primarily working with like full stack JavaScript but in the past you've worked with PHP right that was my first job yeah how you compare the PHP like developer ecosystems because there's like laravel there so many different types of Frameworks and stuff how would you compare that to working with fullstack JavaScript um to be honest like it's years back and I don't have much memory working in PHP we use LEL at the time LEL and react frontend right now in octopus energy I don't do full stack I I'm primarily frontend engineer I do have a do the backend mentorship I have a backend Mentor who can like teach me the python and stuff but uh only when I have I can do it when I have spare time to put some time in the backend tickets but my daytoday work is primarily front end and to compare um to compare frontend to PHP is that your question yeah just in general like like um working with these different tools that you've worked with over the years like how is working with PHP different from working with like nextjs for example solving problem that's always the thing whichever language whichever tool that you use you know that's what you do as a programmer like it doesn't matter so much about what language which language you use which platform are you like mobile developer are you web developer it doesn't matter too much you are solving problems so that's the same just that it's a language right so if you think about different languages English Korean or Spanish like you know you learn the language there different vocabularies there there are different grammars and things like that same for same goes to programming languages you have to learn the language you have to learn how the language works you know um so basically it's a different tool to do the same job if that makes sense yeah yeah absolutely so so it's just an implementation detail essentially you're so if somebody worked in PHP uh like let's say they were doing like WordPress development and they were using PHP or or they had a larl project or if they were doing something completely different like they were they were doing a Ruby on Rails project in your view it's mostly just about like okay these tools do comparable things at the end of the day the work is more defined by what you need to get done than it is how you get it done exactly okay cool yeah I mean that's how a lot of the guests on the show feel I just figured I'd ask you too because because you've got like a pretty broad you you've gotten a lot of experience uh in in your relatively short time as a developer uh compared to a lot like I have people on that like have been doing software development like 20 25 years right I like to get perspective uh from uh from people who are relatively new to the field as well um and one of the things that like really uh intrigued me is that um you have talked a little bit about um you know impostor syndrome in the past and how uh for example at a lot of the teams that you've been a part on there haven't been that many women uh can you talk about like how you I guess were able to accomplish things despite the fact that you know there may not be a lot of women in the team and and you might have felt some imposter syndrome yeah um so I mean it is a known fact that you know there are less female than males in tech industry overall but the impos Imposter syndrome that I experien isn't necessarily coming from like me being female and you know a minority yeah it's just and I I think I had it a lot more frequently when I was more Junior I just felt like I'm not qualified or I'm not smart enough and you know I don't I don't know if I can be here I don't know if I can do this like these selfdoubt full questions right and this still happens Quincy like I was I was talking a few weeks back and I I I brought it out like I don't know you know if I can be in this podcast but um yeah it happens and I'm sure like other software Engineers out there who's watching this I'm sure you can relate to this I know that I'm not the only one who feels this it Happ like the problems that we have to solve you know it will be great if there are only easy problems that we can just fix right away and then just get pushed you're dropped on but that's not the reality some problems are hard it's more difficult and sometimes you might spend a whole week or more than a week to try to solve this one problem that you cannot solve it happens you know naturally you feel doubtful about your ability you know your intelligence and and that's that's why pa programming is important like don't get stuck in your box alone like bring another person or two to talk you know discuss because if this problem is difficult for you there's a chance that it's difficult problem for other people and it's better when you have more brains together yeah like what advice would you send back to yourself I mean I I commend you for coming on the free cocam podcast this is your second podcast ever right like um and uh I was so impressed with your performance on like the previous podcast I had which I'll link to if people want to listen to uh some more interview with you Alison but um I mean that I I feel really glad that you came on because I think people should hear from you because you're like a really cool interesting person has this interesting background and I'm just excited to share that with our audience um what advice though would you send back to somebody who's feeling imposter syndrome trying to get into Tech uh who who may not be a native English speaker right uh or who may not have ever worked in the UK before for like you're you're like having the the multipronged effect of like you're relatively early in your career and you transitioned into gradually more technical roles from you know fashion design and graphic design to software like to kind of like uiux designed to front end development right and and even doing some backend development so so doing gradually learning the full sack like what advice would you have for somebody who is also taking on such ambitious undertakings as you have taken on that's a great question um you know when I was learning programming using free code camp or taking online courses like I I just I try to find in every way how I can learn programming because I really wanted to do but then like in the back of my mind I had this doubt that but I'm not even good at math can I do programming you know I always had this question like am I do I have programming brain no cuz I I know that I don't have math brain like to be very honest with you I my math I was really bad at math in school like that's the only thing I was studying then it was still the worst thing you know uh I was at so yeah I I wasn't sure it was fun for me but then I wasn't sure if I could do it but then I kind of shifted my perspective from like you know what I'm not good at math but I'm good at language and maybe programming I can consider like language is computer's language and I'm learning computer's language so maybe put aside that math fear uh and then just learn it like I would do about language and then let's do it that way and that's how I you know uh decided to think and I'm sure that there are a lot of people out there who ask this question to themselves like I did you know coming from completely unrelated backgrounds or you know you are already working in very different industry or you feel like you don't have qualification because you don't have computer science degree um if you know that you enjoy programming like I mean go to free code Camp there are so there are so many great resources available and courses that you can do in your own time you know and it's completely free um try it see if you like it and if you like it if you enjoy it I would say there are it's like 99% that you can make it that's that's what I can say okay so if you enjoy it you can make it yeah awesome that like so inspiring I think for a lot of people to hear who enjoy programming but they're like wait a second like I'm having fun here but am I good enough to do it if you enjoy it you're going to keep doing it and eventually with enough practice you're going to be good enough right practice makes perfect that that is my you know you hear that a million times a day probably from people but I genuinely believe it's true my son is getting quite good at piano just by practicing every single day like he goes in there and he practices and uh you know it's just like 20 30 minutes a day but it it is gradually accumulating and he's getting better at it right and my daughter's doing the same thing like the Chinese they're getting better Chinese because they practice Chinese a whole lot they they watch Magic School Bus in in Chinese and stuff like that you yourself have just done you know more than an hour worth of interviewing with a native English speaker in English which is a language that is you know probably in University your classes were in Korean right like uh like you grew up up until your 20s primarily using Korean all day probably right and yet here you are talking at Great length in English like what tips would you have for people who want to improve their English this okay this is more difficult question because um I I started learning English since I was very young um about like first grade in elementary and that's because I liked it I I like I had this interest in learning other langu I like to like listen to you know like when I was young there was a cassette tape you know like before City and there was a cassette I I like to like listen to this English you know cassette tape like from like English fairy tales and children's book that was written in English even if I didn't understand anything I just like the sound of it and that's something yeah I guess something I was born I am in I even to this state you know I like to learn different languages um so because I had the interest I was like um it was easier for me cuz it didn't it was never stressful for me to learn and study and then try to kind of repeat after what native speaker would say it was always it wasn't it was never like study study it was more like oh it's fun like I I want to speak like you I want to understand what you're saying um so but I know that not everyone feels this way yeah I I think um was there like a like a big unlock like something you discovered like wow this is makes all the difference like I I I'm learning so much more effectively were there any Revelations like that yeah I think I think a great way to study English is because at the end of the day by learning English what do you want to achieve maybe you have to take English test maybe you have to you know I don't know maybe for a school test maybe to get like take tofl or I El like this kind of English test but learning English you have to know that you are learning it so that you can communicate with others so I think what's important is for you to understand and then can speak what you want to speak so I found it very helpful just by watching fun movies or dramas that are in English and you can't turn on the subtitle that's in English as well maybe you're not going to understand everything but there maybe one word that you understand maybe one full sentence that you understand you know when you have something like that just speak it just you know speak it over and over again until you're tongue remembers you can just it just comes out naturally when when you do with that with one sentence try another sentence try another expression you know uh and even try like how the actor is saying it like their intonation their gestures and everything um just do it over and just repeat until it feels natural to you I I I found that very helpful for me yeah awesome so watching English dramas with English subtitles uh and just doing your best to try to grab as much as you can and understand as much as you can that's like I do the same thing with like with Chinese uh for example like I always watch with the Chinese character subtitles uh and it's a lot easier to understand if you have that kind of like visual reference in addition to the auditory um so yeah that that's great advice um let's talk about the Korean localization effort who all is involved in translating some of these um articles that we' published on our publication into Korea Korean and you know what does that process look like yeah we have a team of volunteers who um there is a form that you can fill it if you want to contribute to to this localization effort um we have team of contributors uh who are volunteers who would spend their free time you know really really thankful to them um who would translate the articles in Korean and the book that you just mentioned Quincy your book that's also available in Korean thanks to all of our contributors who translated you know together the entire book and right now we are translating The Core Curriculum in free code Camp um so yes soon you're going to see Korean in the free Cod Camp main page and some of the curriculums are going to be available in Korean but yeah it's 100% volunteering yeah awesome well anybody who's interested in helping out if if you are a Korean speaker and you want to get involved in the localization effort reach out to Allison uh I'm going to include links if that's cool with you like uh to your Twitter um and a few other things in the show notes below uh I also want to say that like it's not just Korean that we're doing this for we're doing this for Spanish Japanese Swahili Ukrainian uh Portuguese a lot of Major World languages uh we have a big volunteer translation effort underway to make these learning resources even more accessible and yes we could just throw everything into Google translate and have like a mediocre translation but having native speakers who understand the culture who understand the language who understand a little bit about the subject matter of learning to code maybe they're using free code Camp as well like that makes a huge difference to have an actual developer like Allison translating it instead of just having somebody who doesn't have the domain expertise so uh it's a lot slower it's a lot more labor intensive but our hope is that this makes it way easier for people to learn programming because they can learn it in their own native language yes I believe that everybody should learn English if they can it's kind of like the the lingua franka of of tech uh of uh science and to an extent of business but at the same time it's an added layer of difficulty when people want to learn things if they have to like learn in their nonnative language we're all about making technology education more accessible and one of the ways we can do that is to make it available in people's native language and uh so I I definitely want to applaud you Allison for all your work toward that and to all of our contributors yes thanks to all the many contributors uh I'm hoping to meet some of you in person in Korea uh I'll be in Korea in summer you and I can hang out again and uh potentially Chris another free Camp staff uh Chris kuishi gawa based in deu he's lived in in Korea for like the past seven years even though he's an American National um yeah we're going to get together and hopefully have a nice uh traditional Korean meal uh and just chill um and yeah we're like really excited about the future of helping more people in Korea get into Tech and we're really excited about helping people in all different places uh not only learn programming But ultimately potentially create technology companies in their countries because Tech is so California Focus like almost all the big tech companies are based in like California or to an extent like Texas and in like Seattle area but there are smart developers everywhere and they just need an opportunity and I I think it's really cool that you and your husband were able to move to the UK that you're working at this really cool place doing meaningful work doing interesting work and I want other people to be able to realize their dreams of doing that as well so we will not rest until everybody who wants to work in Tech is able to work in Tech we're going to keep working hard toward this ideal and I really want to thank you again for your time Alison and everything you're doing thank you so much for having me it was really great to talking to you yeah well until next week everybody happy coding happy coding
