hey everybody it's Jesse and uh coming to you a little bit later than normal today so I had a meeting scheduled for 2 p.m. which is my normal time and then that meeting ended up getting cancelled right before so ended up not really uh needing to uh postpone it but at that point I had already had it on on Twitter for hours and on YouTube that I was going to do this at 300 p.m. Eastern instead uh so I decided to just stay with that so um I'm going to catch you up from what we did yesterday and then uh we'll decide what to do today I'm going to leave it up to you all uh what we work on CU there's a few different there's probably at least three different paths that I'm thinking we could we could go down today and um actually let me know if the stream is all right I'm getting a message that the stream was not so good uh in terms of quality so it did say it's good now um oh no now it's it's not so good so just let me know uh it it looks like I'm uploading at I'm like over 5,000 kilobits for second right now which should be fine uh but let me know not sure if there's much I could do to fix it since we already started um okay now it's getting a little faster it should be good all right awesome uh it looks like in the live chat all right we have 1080p okay um so basically Ally since yesterday uh we had some pool requests uh so I had some pool requests from Kevin and from Gavin so there's now a GitHub uh Pages uh page for this so I'm not I'm not 100% sure about this but I'm pretty sure that the form will not work on GitHub pages but the rest of the site should work so it'll be a good way to check things out even when I don't have enro running uh so if you go to I I'll just I need to put a link to it now in the uh read me file I think that would probably be the best way to go uh but I think it's like it's normally what is it GitHub uh and I can't even remember how the URLs are formatted I haven't had anything on GitHub Pages for a couple of months so um off have to find it let me go into settings and uh show you okay here we go all right so here's what it looks like when you first go there so it's fusen marc. github.io okay that's what I thought and then slash Resource Center so resource hyphen Center uh when you go there it says page not found obviously because that's we haven't set that up uh in react router as a route so if you just click uh on the side have there you can go to the different pages so they work like I said I'm pretty sure the form won't work uh but that's that's not really a big deal you'll be able to see the rest of the site and let's see I'm going to paste that uh in the live chat and I guess I'll probably end up putting a link if there's not already a link to it because potentially I might I'm G to have to check usually repos will have it like right up at the top they can get a link to it so um I'll try to do that uh you know you know what I'm talking about like right up here I'm try to get a link to it right up here so it's really obvious uh so I'll do that later on that's not really important for uh for right now um let's see okay so basically uh so that was thanks to Gavin's full request so thank you Gavin uh that was that was all him in terms of uh getting that working uh forget Hub pages which was for this project a little bit more involved than you would normally need uh normally do to get your project on so check out that pool request uh if you want to see the details he included some links to uh some more indepth instructions for doing uh GitHub Pages page with create react app also had a pull request I think we had two from um from Kevin uh one was refactoring so the the major one was re factoring what we did yesterday uh so if if you take a look at this I mean it's going to be hard to see it as I'm scrolling around but if you check out the repo uh everything should be up to date on the master Branch now so that's if you want to check that out that that would be the best uh to look at but if you check out the server.js things are looking a little bit better uh more organized and uh Sebastian also explained his his reasoning for refactoring in the way that he did on that pull request so that's like maybe pull request 34 something like that 35 somewhere around there uh also um we had an update to our example file for the environment variables to take into account the new variables that we were using all right so now now you're all caught up actually no there's still one more thing so I now have the actual uh content of the form going in the emails and going to the right projects so before we just had in the emails just some some string some demo string that came with the uh example from uh the srid uh API for node uh so we got rid of that so we're actually sending basically just um I'll show you how I did it because it's right here on the screen so all I did was uh here where we're already making uh an object with all the um all the fields uh so key value pairs with the field uh names and then the uh value that we put in so I decided since we're already looping over all that here why not make a string that basically has the same the same thing so I'm just grabbing the name of that input and then whatever the value is and then for now I've just included a break and uh I needed to change the type let me find out where this is at some point there was a type uh that I needed to send in with the um through the send grid API and now I can't find where it is it should have below least I thought it was oh okay uh so text/html is the the type so before we had text slpl all right so since we're including HTML now we had to change it to be HTML all right otherwise it will just it will actually show uh uh the the BR um tags uh so that's all we had to do to get it working uh for the email and then we just take that same uh Fields string and we use it we pass it here as well when we make the folder so now I'm this is an an additional uh so we weren't passing this before and we also now we're we're actually passing uh the the email address that gets entered into the form uh and that's going to be the title instead before we just had test that we were passing in uh so now if we go up to our make uh our Reich make folder function so you can see we have the name and then the content um so for title we have name and now for description we have content okay so that's all the fold that I've gotten right now I probably want to clean it up a little bit uh so I want to send two emails right now I'm only sending one email uh so I'll have to see what the best way to send those emails are um I don't know if there's some builtin way I'll have to read through the documentation to see like is there some builtin way that I can just uh you know put in pass in something else uh a say like all right we want to send the same email uh but I'm not sure we might do like an entire entirely new email new template send a different one I may want the user to see something different than the project manager sees uh not sure it I mean probably could just simplify it and make the email for the user it's enough that the project manager will just see that something came in and then that way uh they'll get an extra notification uh so that things don't don't slip through and yeah and that's so so basically for the server uh part of this we're we're nearly finished you know it's just a little bit of kind of cleaning up the way the email looks okay which is not really it's it's a bit tedious because you have to change things and then send an email and then check to see how it looks uh probably not a bad idea to check it in different email clients but it's going to be a really basic email this is uh it it doesn't need to you know it's an internal email and just kind of a courtesy thing to say hey we got we got your data um we got your submission uh and it also gives the user a chance to review what we got because they may have accidentally uh you know typed something in wrong or forgot to put something in and they get one last chance to review even after they've submitted and correct anything uh so we could do that we could work on this uh we could even try to look up some security things to do for our uploads or we could move on and start working on some of like the UI things like just some CSS with the layout which we have SAS set up now uh thanks to Patrick uh we haven't really done anything with SAS yet so maybe we could work on that uh the other thing that we could work on that would be be a little bit more involved we haven't done yet is doing the um resource uh section for Logos so I'm going to show it to you all I I know I've showed this before but uh most likely have some people watching that did not see it uh previously so I'm going to pull this onto the screen logos okay so here's how the logos look now uh so you can see it's you know they just automatically uh rearrange themselves and then we also have you know some filtering going on so this is actually not it's not going to be too difficult because is uh if you remember from our last project uh you you all remember Fabian uh from uh from Paris who did a bunch of pool requests for the last project I haven't seen him for a while in the uh in the live chat so maybe uh he's busy with work or something uh but he had some uh pool requests for our resource section the original version of it before we had to change it and we had a masonry out similar to what we had for the logos but it worked with react okay so this is all you know jQuery it's using isotope uh so we can't just copy this over and and have it work uh so we could probably look back at that pool request of fabians see what he did and then apply it here so we won't have to start from scratch but I think that'll probably be the best way uh to do things and instead of you know the isotope filtering we probably could just do our own filtering with do filter um and that should work that should work well it should accomplish the same thing the only thing that'll be different is there's you know you see there's like a slight animation we won't have that animation I'm sure it's possible with react but I've not really worked with uh you know animations in react like on on a state change so we'll see if you know when we get there so anyway those are the three options I'm going to repeat them really quick because I there was a lot of explanation between them so the first option is try to you know really polish that uh server.js file um with possibly some security and um proper uh email templat temp plates second option is do some UI work uh using some SAS uh and just clean things up a bit make it look nice third option is try to do a masonry layout in react for all these uh images for all these logos I'm going to give everybody just a minute uh I guess uh to to vote in the live chat and while that's going on I'm actually going to check out the live chat here uh cuz I haven't checked it at all yet and I'll say hi to everyone also I have had a few people join in on Instagram already but if you're not aware if you'd like to see what my office looks like and what I look like while I'm coding you can check me out on Instagram the Link's in the description if you're joining on Instagram and you don't know what's going on I am coding and if you want to see the code check out free codee Camp's uh YouTube channel for a live stream of my screens all right cool so uh Victor says hi great to be part of this project I'm beginning to like coding more with each step thanks free code Camp awesome you're welcome thanks for watching uh Hey everybody I see a lot of people are saying hello I'm not going to go through one by one I'm just going to say say hi Google user RVA asks is is this just Java um it's it's JavaScript so uh little bit different different programming language than Java but yeah it's it's basically I don't want to say it like this because there's this huge thing on Twitter a couple weeks ago about this but it's just JavaScript in regard to react I don't know if any of you saw that but there were like some people were freaking out about how everyone always says react is just JavaScript and they were saying like everything's just JavaScript like what do you I don't know I don't know what the big deal is I mean I think it's at least I've always understood that it's more nuanced than like obviously it's not exactly JavaScript right but anyway um don't want to go off on that tangent um let's see ish Isme uh says can someone tell me what this project is all about uh not sure if someone answered doesn't look like it so um brief description we're using react specifically we bootstrap the project with create react app which is just the way to get started building react uh really quickly without having to worry about configuring webpack or anything like that uh so we built it with that we're using uh material design for uh for our UI so specifically we're using a framework called material UI and we're blending that with another material design framework called materialize uh but the project itself the whole purpose of it is just to provide some resources like logos uh to people where I work at the University that I work at and then also allow them to request uh services from my department I work in marketing through an online form and so that online form sends emails after you submitted and it also sends data into a project management system uh through the through the API uh it's Reich is the project management system so that's basically what it does and so we're just working our way through that that project uh limle says hey it's a shame I started watching these streams only now now I'm watching only day two and trying to catch up with these well yeah it's good that you're watching now at least sorry sorry you didn't get in uh sooner but um some people have said that they're able to watch the streams on four times speed and it still makes sense so maybe you can try that I haven't tried it yet myself but uh who is I think Bill watches it yeah Bill's in here uh hey Bill I think bill has said he's been able to watch it at four times speed so so uh might help you to catch up a little bit more quickly okay Gavin good I'm glad you uh you sent a message about this so uh right before I started the stream like literally two minutes until I was going to start the stream I noticed that Gavin had sent me a message on Instagram I read it quickly and then realized I'm not even I don't even have time to respond to this right now uh so anyway the messages that he sent was about starting a slack channel so that we can keep the discussion going even outside of the live stream so that's a good idea there have actually been some attempts to do this before so we we had an and I I think we still have an IRC Channel which I haven't checked into in a while and I'm sorry about that if you've been in the IRC Channel but I just I just completely forgot about it um so we have the RC Channel uh although I admittedly IRC is a little bit harder uh to figure out if you haven't used it before than something like slack somebody did try to make a slack Channel but then nobody we couldn't get in it we needed like usernames and passwords for it and so that didn't work out so I'm definitely open to a slack Channel I think that would be nice um I if if anyone would like to set that up I'm cool with that uh and just let us know how we can join uh I think that would be cool if we do a slack Channel though I mean let's try to keep it the same as it is in here uh definitely very friendly for new people uh any questions are are welcome uh about code try to get along and not uh not get angry and argue with each other uh so just basically I like to have a really kind of nice laidback environment where anybody can feel free to ask questions without getting ridiculed for being a noob or anything like that uh if you want to have battles about which editor is the best I'm fine with that but no battles about like really really serious things because I don't want people to get there are other places where that kind of discussion is appropriate but not not on the free code Camp YouTube channel or slack Channel um Okay cool so anyway Gavin that's a thank you for that that's a really good thought so uh definitely think that would be cool um if if someone could get it going all right so chish uh says LOL LOL what's going on who's this learn get first yo uh yeah I I agree um gets gets awesome so this is Jesse and I'm building a react app Live on YouTube and uh yeah so I'm not going to teach you uh teach git but uh we will learn some Git along the way because I'll explain what I'm doing with it okay so I assume everyone's had a chance to let me know what you'd like to see uh all right so I see we have a vote for doing things with SAS logos animations ah Gavin reminded me about the Pomodoro clock I just always forget thanks all right I'm starting the pomor clock now which means I'm about to start coding um R masonry component how do I see the inst stream Dylan asked how to see the inst stream um my Instagram name is in the description uh for this video so check you can get the name there and then go into Instagram and um I guess you can search actually I've never really tried to see obviously to see my own stream uh so I guess you'll be able to search for me uh do like a people search and then it'll it'll show that I'm I'm streaming live okay it looks like it looks like I had a few people that are talking about the um the masonry layout and maybe one vote for doing things with uh with SAS so I think we're going to do the masonry layout today and we may end up actually doing some things with SAS to make that layout look nice so we'll probably get a little bit of both so if you if you voted for SAS uh you're not going to be uh disappointed completely uh so that's good I I figured you may have been getting tired of working in server.js anyway because we've been doing that for at least like three days maybe four days okay uh one more all right one more comment and then we'll start uh Damien says I'm heading back to day nine may I make a suggestion when a new module is used can you show how it's done on day four I was struggling and was able to add uh Babel to uh Dev dependencies uh then Googling worked okay yeah I'll um I'll have to do a better job of uh of updating on that so uh I'll try to remember to let you all know when things are added into package Json uh you know just to make sure that you know when that happens you got to run npm or yarn and install the packages otherwise stuff probably won't work right uh okay cool uh Gavin has created a channel so uh Gavin if you replace the uh periods in the link with an asterisk then uh you should be able to paste it in there and then if anybody copies it they can just replace the asterisk with periods so some i' some people have been able to get links in there like that all right so let's go let's first things first let's look up uh the code that we're going to use um so it should be should be in this repo let's see if we have we may have a branch for it all right so don't have a branch I was hoping there'd be a branch and it'd be easy I'll have to look back through let's go to that page if you're not familiar with Git this is one of the great things about git and Version Control in general uh so the final version of this project which is now finished and launched does not have the code that I want uh to use but a previous version of it that we moved on from does have that code so if I hadn't been using git or some type of Version Control that code would be lost to me uh unless maybe like I manually copied the file and saved it somewhere but now I can go back so I can go to the file which should should be resources and I can look at all the previous versions of that file so I can go down here and I can see everything that's changed and even who changed it so let's scroll okay so that's where I did the new UI so anything before that should be what we want so I can go in here and I can see exactly what changed on that particular commit on that that version of the code or I can just view it view the whole file and that's what I want to do uh so it looks like we we are using react uh masonry component which I think had put in the uh in the live chat so that's what we will be using um let's see if we had anything else yeah this we this is really all we need uh to import so we will be pulling in that package okay we're going to be using some of this so in state uh we'll have basically the an active tab right so we're not it's not really going to look like a tab layout so if you see like what we have here I wouldn't necessarily call this tabs it doesn't it at least it just doesn't feel like a normal tab layout uh in terms of like the way it animates and everything but that's essentially what's what it's going to be um so we're going to keep let me make this a bit bigger so we're going to keep uh this I'm I haven't decided yet exactly how I'm going to pull in all these images uh and what what I'm going to use uh to manage those images so uh not sure if we're going to have to make any calls to get that okay uh now this code is going to have some extra things that we definitely won't need we're not going to do this AIT tab stuff so this this was to make some things work that we're using uh jQuery and we're definitely not going to use that uh the actual let's go to the actual markup up all right so we have this masonry component right so we're wrapping everything in the masonry component and then each one of the images will basically be here where where we have our div that's that's a column and then a card inside of that we we'll have the same thing so we'll have our div that's a column and then inside of that we're not going to have a card we're going to have an image and then that in this case that connects in down here and we add actually are are putting in we won't need to do uh so much of of like the categories and things uh in our drop down we're not going to do that we're just going to have essentially tab I was I was thinking for a second I would show you how this looks if you don't remember this project but we can't because we we changed it so uh I can't really show you how it worked out but anyway it might be a little bit hard just to see um with the code I mean if if you had seen some of the shows when we did this uh maybe it's a little easier so let's just get to it and put something on the screen just to get it start to see what this is actually going to look like so the first thing we're going to do is get this package uh so if you're not familiar with how npm works then this will be a nice introduction so in our package Json file you'll see we have this section for dependencies okay now this this file has gotten uh somewhat large um so don't worry if this looks like a lot of stuff uh if you're just starting out on your project it'll be a lot smaller more simple uh and that's as it should be for for a project starting out uh so this project we've been working on this for uh this is day 15 and there's what at least a dozen people working on it right now uh between you know me and and all of you that have submitted pool requests so it's starting to get a bit complicated um but basically what we're going to do is we're going to pull in that uh that package um react Mason Rec component all right and that's going to help us get masonry layout and have basically do a lot of things that we don't really need to do by hand from scratch right because that would be kind of tedious we may as well use that package uh when we do load that package it's going to show up here in our package Json under our dependencies this is going to get synced up to GitHub so that anybody who wants to copy that you know they're going to clone that repository they can then run npm and it'll check this and it'll load all the things all these things that you'll need for the project to run so I know a lot of you probably know that you know but uh for people who are just beginners starting out um that's kind of how how it works um at least for people that are using like npm based uh based things I know other programming languages have similar things I can't remember I can't remember what they're called in in other languages right now but uh so you know if you're familiar with like package managers in other languages then it's similar thing that's going on here uh but it is nice uh that we can all have the same things and the same versions of these packages all running uh so we should in in most cases uh all be able to run it uh and it should work all right so let me pull over my command line on my other screen right now uh I will make this bigger I know it's really small right now so this is my my terminal or command line to tell you the truth I don't really know if there's a difference between saying command line or terminal if they're interchangeable maybe there's a difference I don't really know if if one of you knows uh let me know so uh it's possible that I don't sound very smart because maybe I'm using them wrong um but if you're not familiar with it I mean this is where we can type in commands mine looks a little different than the default because I'm using something called iterm 2 uh this is for a Mac uh if you're on Windows you can there are different things um that you can use as well I can't remember for sure Commander or something I I can't remember what I have on my PC uh but you'll probably want to download something other than your basic uh terminal just to add you know some extra features that'll help speed up your development so in in this let's see looks like my um commit didn't work I didn't even realize it uh W okay cre F let's check this out for a second so we have wow how did I fail this many tests all right so let's check this out this will be a great learning opportunity what to do when things go wrong so I right now we're set up to run some tests every time we commit uh code so we're actually doing several different things so it's checking all the code for error it's formatting all the code in a standard format uh and then it's running some tests to make sure everything's working so we failed some of these tests and it looks like we're failing for navigation error I'm I'm going to try it again just to see what happens I don't know about you but sometimes I'll just try to do the exact same thing again and occasionally I'll get a different get a different result all right so we are getting the same result uh not exactly sure what's happening uh for the sake of just kind of moving on um let's let's skip the test I really hate to do this because I I think it would be good in case you are having these problems but um this is kind of like a big detour from what we were trying to do uh so for now at least I'm going to add no verify actually that's for Husky I don't think this is going to work we'll try I'll try it anyway oh yeah it did work awesome okay all right so I had thought that I um had pushed this up to master and I told you all that at the beginning uh of the stream so obviously that hadn't happened I just didn't look back at my uh my terminal so now we're going to pull down the correct package so I happen to be using yarn uh which instead of normal npm which uh you can you can use that I'm using yarn um we can do YN add and then react rry component and I'm going to double check let's see okay now double check the spelling so I don't know if you all heard but there were some uh some people were taking like common packages and then publishing their own packages that had the same name just misspelled slightly and then those package was were stealing environment variables that's just supposed to be private uh so which is actually crazy because I don't know if anybody was watching the stream so one of the early streams I started to type um a package name and it occurred to me that someone could do a lot of damage if they misspelled it and um I don't know if anybody remembers that but there's video evidence of this uh and um which may not be good for me because someone might say it was my fault but I I doubt that anybody watched my uh my stream and got the idea for that but it actually did happen so at the time when I said it it was just hypothetical like that would be bad if somebody did that uh but people were actually doing that evidently and uh so basically just double check when you put this in that you're actually spelling everything correctly uh otherwise I I don't think it was really widespread there didn't seem to be that many people affected and I think uh npm is they're taking steps to prevent that from happening but just in case uh you may want to you know double check that okay so we have uh react masonry component and you can see now it shows up here right so it says here's the name of the package and then here is the version so uh by default if you don't specify a version uh it should give you the latest stable release which you could certainly specify any version number that that you wanted that's available uh on npm uh let's see okay at this point we can go into our our component for the logo view so logos. JS so you see we we already have some things in here and I actually using this I was using this to test out the um generic card uh that Rohit had made and committed which is going to be really useful uh as we start to build out some of the other pages but for now uh I'm going to remove this because we're we're actually uh going to put the logos in here now so we we don't want this in here right now and we want a row yeah we'll probably want to leave the row and yeah let's pull in our we'll pull in masonry so we're going to import masonry from react masonry component and then that will allow us to use masonry uh in our component and then I'm just going to bring in right now I'm I'm copying a I'm going to be copying a lot of things over from that file that I showed you from our previous project um so we're not going to need all of this we don't need price uh me data we may end up using data later on but we're not right now cator type actually so in comparing the two projects I think type type will be the equivalent to our categories that ran along the top so we're going to keep that uh we all we don't need these categories so uh once we get going we may decide we can change this up but I think this should be all right at least to start with and okay so I don't think we need to do anything like with life cycle methods right now uh so I am going to copy over um that masonry uh constant that we had so we we going to keep filter all right we can get rid of this filter because we don't have price we can get rid of the category filter we can we're going to get rid of the card the resource card yeah we'll get rid of the card and instead we are we're going to end up having an image trying to think if there's a a wrapper so um for now I'm just going to put in an image we're going to use a placeholder image uh I'll have to check in material UI to see if there's some component like wrapper for responsive images or something like that uh we we'll see how it uh how it looks for right now I I think it'll be all right just to use the image uh element and let's see what have we been using for images that was uh for stock images actually I probably could I could use a real image I think uh we have where did I have oh I must have moved to my other screen let's we could maybe use a real logo and uh we'll probably need to add some extra logos as well we've gotten some new logos since uh since I first made this so let's see what the here we go yeah that that should be I was just double checking to see what where that was at uh in the folder structure I think that should be publicly accessible I would normally obviously just just do um uh get the image uh you know URL but since it's wrapped in all these divs I can't actually get to the image the real image itself uh so that's why I'm getting the uh Euro like this so let me put this in and I'll need to Dos I need to put the beginning of that in who okay um my pomodora timer is up so I'm going to do a five minute break from coding uh to check out the live chat and then we'll go back and do another uh Pomodoro session uh so I'm going to scroll up a bit and see what I've missed okay I see Kevin said maybe it's time to split the server into various files I agree I figured we'd have to at some point uh cuz I mean I knew it was going to start to get big with all the and we're still not even doing everything that we need to do uh so it's going to get even bigger uh so we probably should split it up uh yonas uh asks can you show me a lesson use a CSS class to style and element please um we'll probably end up using classes to style and element possibly uh in this this stream so uh if you can stick around and watch uh we'll get to that once we start getting some things on the screen I'm sure we'll have to adjust uh probably I'm thinking at the very least um that top uh row of categories uh that we're going to put on there we'll definitely need some adjustment again unless I could find a material UI component that does exactly what I want uh we'll probably need to adjust it and we will most likely have a class that will uh we'll use let's see uh Jong wo says hello everyone what's your goto editor and terminal well I think I've already said the my terminal I use is iterm too on Mac on Windows um I think it's Commander but it's it's spelled like cmdr or something like that and I guess that's how you pronounce it I've always just assumed that's how you pronounce it but now that I think about it I'm not even sure uh and then my editor is uh Adam but I like Visual Studio code as well Unice asked when did you start coding um like if the very first time I ever started coding uh was when I was in high school so probably I was 16 or 17 years old uh and that's if you really want to consider like HTML and CSS coding uh which I I'm not going to get into that um I've some people do or don't think it's coding so uh after that though like really like starting to code and get paid for coding um it's only been I don't know like four years ago um yeah it's three or four years let's see so I've been a fulltime uh Bas fulltime front and developer for almost two years now uh at this University before that I was freelance uh for about two two three years uh and for most of that time I was doing coding work um when I first started out it was not not so much coding uh just maybe like some CSS stuff here and there uh okaba says please is the entire project going to be made available for download after it's been completed yeah the project is um it's it's already available on GitHub so um you know you can certainly clone it download it whenever you want um and it'll still it'll be left up there whenever it's completed too uh and then of course the videos will all still be available um for as long as free code Camp wants to keep them up uh which I I assume they want to keep them up uh unless I don't know maybe if I I really mess up they'll take them down uh but I think they're happy with what I've been doing so far and it looks like so Gavin has made a slack Channel and uh he shared the link but let's see I'm going to clean up the link and paste it in since uh no one else but me is allowed to put actual links in so my timer is run out I'm going to get back to coding in a second but I I do want to uh join this SL team for free Cod Camp live awesome so this link I just tried the link it should work and I've put that in the live chat uh I'll probably end up putting this link in the video video description as well uh so that everybody can see it we won't have to keep putting it into the live chat all right so 330 I'm making a mental note of where I'm leaving off at in the in the live chat uh and then I'll I'll come come back to it soon wow looks look like cool I do have a couple of viewers on the uh on the live stream on Instagram which is cool um if if you are viewing I'm sure you probably didn't hear the announcement at the beginning of the stream if you want to see the code check out the free code Camp Channel on YouTube and you'll be able to see what's on my screen I know you can you can see the code a little bit uh in the corner of the feed but uh not enough to really know what's going on all right so let's restart our Pomodoro Timer we'll do another 25 minutes of coding so what we left off basically is we've imported uh the masonry uh We've imported masonry from the react masonry component uh npm package and right now we have set up our state uh just our defaults and then we have a constant that's going to be masonry component and uh we're going to put that we're going to insert that down here right now we don't really have a lot we'll probably just have to fill out let's see map post ey we'll just put in some data here just to give it something to Loop over uh but at some point we'll have to decide how we're going to import the data which will basically just be um the image urls Pro probably the name too so we can give it a nice title um attribute uh maybe alt attribute as well okay so sorry for the weirdness going on here my um I have some package for my editor that's autof formatting things as I go along and occasionally it it gets weird uh right now it's getting weird because I never closed out this element there we go now it's yeah there we go that's better okay yeah so let's try to see if we can get something on the screen uh so I'm going to bring over from uh the code that is on my other screen now that I showed you earlier uh from our previous project uh I'll bring over some of the stuff let's see I need to find it it's it's quite a large component all right there are tabs sorry I'm scrolling through this file and I cannot find where it there it is finally actually I'm going to yeah let me umate data all right I'll pull this in this is going to be a bit more than I wanted to start out with uh in terms of complexity but why not we we'll pull it in and get it get everything working here uh so I have I'm going to pull in every so we have a row we're going to have a row for our tabs and we're going to put that above so we're going to have to make a container right so if if you've never worked with react before you can't have two components two sibling components side by side uh within this return um it it has to be wrapped in one so that's why we're wrapping it uh for right now I'm just I'm not going to name it or anything this is going to be where our Tabs go and then let's make another row and that's where we're going to insert all our masonry stuff all right cool and the um Instagram live stream has ended that'll be available for the next 24 hours if anyone wants to watch the recording of it uh so thanks thanks for joining uh if you if you joined in um okay so let me let just briefly let you know what's going on here I think there's one more thing that I'll have to bring over to make this work uh but what we're doing is uh pulling basically adding in all the tabs that we're going to need uh so we are going to have to put something in state uh for this to go uh to go through and uh put each one of these in we're this is using the materialized version of tabs so we we probably are going to have to redo this a bit because I would rather use the material UI version uh if if I can if it works uh for this uh for this use case but for now this is just going to make the tabs this then is going to make rows actually yeah I can't do that so I'm glad I saw this so basically this is going to generate rows so we don't want to put this in its own row uh it's going to generate rows for each tab so every tab will have its own corresponding row so that when you click on a tab that row will will show up will become visible each one of these components these masonry each one of these rows will be populated with the the images the masonry components uh that belong to that particular category okay so hopefully that that made a little bit of sense to you uh but we do need so you can see here like we we have nothing uh in terms of rows do we have type yeah we'll need uh we need to add some things in for this to work let's see okay so we need our actually I I put this in the wrong place so we had originally uh we had these things inside our render so let me get rid of this there we go okay that looks better makes more sense did I leave off yeah I left this off okay so now wow this this formatting will be fixed when we go to commit so it's it's a little bit terrible right now um so here's where we're going to where we have our tabs so right now uh these are the tab names for our other project so we will change those but you can see we're getting the active tab name from this state okay so right now it's all and that's that's what we want to keep it so that's that doesn't need to change uh and then where we have the tabs so just key value pairs uh for all of our tabs so we'll leave it like this for now uh we'll put in the proper names uh in a little bit all right so our masonry component is filtering based on the active tab uh value and okay then once it's filtered then it goes over everything uh we're getting that right now from data so what we need to do then let's provide some data yeah let's provide some data just to to get this working so all we're going to need right now at least uh let's see some OB objects um with with the type ACF type let's remove this ACF because that was unique to um the WordPress API uh with the the particular way we had it set up so let's do Post type okay so we'll just have type and we're going to have this objects Shing think how the data came through in WordPress that we had it set up um it would have just been an array of objects okay uh so let's do typ and audio didn't copy at all okay okay so this should at least give us one at least one in each category uh so something for it to Loop over um do we need type we may not even need this I'm not going to take it out right now uh but I don't think we need it okay so this image I'm just going to double check that this image is actually going to work on my other screen yes it will okay greats okay so we have tabs great Tab Key okay so one thing that's not going to work uh for now is uh obviously we're not initiating this um and we haven't pulled in any of the Styles or JavaScript to make this work so let's see how it looks I don't really expect it to look great but something should come on uh to the screen and we are going to have a default by default it should show everything okay yeah let's save it we'll see what happens let's see now where did I put it I guess I I can't find where I moved everything to sorry about that give me a minute oh well I'll just go to Local Host and let's use that 9,000 all right now let's check out logos and see not 100% sure we're it's going to look good here actually out Loos what did we do actually not seeing anything at all that's not good uh probably just syntax error yeah it's a syntax unexpected token it's a syntax error but it does it's not actually telling me very much h it's OD yeah for some reason that's really odd um for some reason my server is just not responding and it doesn't really say that anything happened so let's let's try to start the server again what did I do all right so Patrick says I should run yarn run lint all right well now at least we'll get we'll get some messages uh about what could be the problem card title was used CL on is use logos oh I'm not using these so that's something and what else did we have the react jsx space before closing Ru is depreciated all right I'm not really sure what this is all about but at least I can verify that I fixed the other problems which I mean I know I did but okay so I'm getting this thing uh I'm going to paste this uh in on my other screen just do a search all right so the first two links are not giving me great uh information or solution to that um let's see at least we have some nice formatting now so as you can see we the auto formatting worked uh like it was supposed to all right well let's at least uh give this a shot okay let's see all right I'm going to go to the live chat and see what you all think all right I'll try Port 3000 as well yeah nothing uh Port 3000 is not giving me anything either Dion says um I thought I saw a masonry spelled with two s's in your file yeah it is filled with two s's um so that was yeah that was from the the original pool request and I just never changed it yeah so it doesn't it doesn't really bother me I know what it's I know what's going on um if it bothers anybody that that's uh misspelled I will accept your pull request if you really want to change it um otherwise it works I'm fine with it well it did work it's not working right now H this is odd for Okay cool so uh I got it started here so not sure what the issue was I supposed to have an ALT prop okay so we're getting a warning here about having an ALT prop which we were going to put in an ALT prop anyway uh on that image element so uh not a big deal I'm not exactly sure what so in in case Cas you haven't been watching the last uh few days uh we actually had like two different servers running uh and to test out our form and the uploads we're running things on Local Host 9,000 uh but then originally with create react app uh we had things running on 3,000 so we basically the 3,000 seems to be working uh the 9,000 wasn't can double check yeah for some reason it's not uh but we can try to figure that out later for now hey look at this we got logos Okay cool so the images aren't working I wonder what they're giving us is it a um fail to load resource the it's really odd not exactly sure why that resource failed to load but uh so you can see um we have so our Tabs are populating and then we had four elements like four objects in our array for our data and we see four here uh now I don't expect these actually did it work cool okay so this actually does work uh basically because we were doing this kind of thing right with uh with State uh in our component uh but you can see the Styles don't work uh which was expected uh but we should have like audio should have two text and video should have one element okay great so all that's working uh so let's see if we can make it look a little bit nicer first thing I want to do is check out material UI and see what they have in terms of tabs uh if they have something that's awesome then I'm willing to switch otherwise uh it might not be that big of a deal to just take what we have now add a few styles to it uh and I think it could work the only thing I'm worried about is uh we have quite a few options so I'd like I'm considering changing how this this works uh because that's it's a lot of options to just have right across the top of the screen so let me try to find where I had the example of the live site now uh just to show you in case um in case you don't remember whoops it looks like it logged me out so I'm going log back in uh hey good news about this so I'm you know a lot of you expressed your opinions as to um how terrible this currently looks I I hope that soon we'll be hiring a new web developer uh in the IT department and they handle this site uh so basically the first task of this person will be to uh start redesigning this according to basically the styles that that I tell them to try to match up with what else we're doing so hopefully that'll be looking better sometime within the next few months so haven't hired anybody yet but I did uh we had a phone interview with another candidate earlier today so hopefully we get it logos okay yeah so one two three four five six so like 12 plus we'll probably want to add an all so I have like 12 or 13 across the top which is we use used a really small font to basically to make it work I don't like doing that CU it's hard to read okay I couldn't remember how I got did this before so we do actually use a drop down at some point all right that's not bad actually let me know what you think uh my pomodora timer just went off so I'm going to go to the live chat in a second uh but let me know what you think do you like that it's it's spread out across the top like that in a row and then it goes you know to this or do you think it should stay as a drop down all the time uh you know is this just too much and is the font too small so I'm not sure um it's nice to be able to see all the categories I guess all at once so anyway I'm undecided uh let me know what you all think let me turn on turn on the timer for five minutes and check the time 422 what time do we start this yeah we'll probably do I probably won't do a complete Pomodoro cycle I think what'll went up doing is just do a little bit of styling uh to make it look a bit better um and I I kind of just really want to uh use a little bit of the um use some sass because it's been a long time since I used it so uh but otherwise it's starting to get um about time for me to leave work so uh probably maybe do 10 more minutes of coating after this I would say maybe give or take a few minutes all right so David asks uh how do you get night mode on GitHub um what's the package H why do I always forget this it is called GitHub dark so uh just search for GitHub dark and then check out the uh options for um installing it I am using it with tamper monkey uh so I'm running the scripts uh as soon as the site loads with tamper monkey to set all this up uh Gavin says why I have nodon as a dependency I'm thinking it should be more of a Dev dependency uh if it needs to be in there um yeah actually I think you might I think you might be right Gavin and yeah now that I think about it am am I missing something is there some uh is there some reason why node Manon should be a dependency in not a Dev dependency uh maybe I'm missing something here but it I'm thinking it could be a a Dev dependency all right so David's asking about electron so if you notice uh electron is is here under depend encies and um let's see electron is for sorry I'm looking through because I think this question just got answered uh are we using electron for test I'm G to see when did we add that I have to go back through because we've had quite a few pull request so um I'll have to check and see where we we actually added that in so it looks like electron didn't get added until actually that was Gavin's pool request anyways so uh I'm not sure if Gavin's still watching or if he's back but it looks like that last pull request that that you added was uh electron so maybe you would be uh better equipped to uh to answer that okay it looks like uh show the categories we can so it looks like the way we're doing it currently live with the uh categories across the top and then when we get to a smaller screen it shifts to uh um a drop down uh it looks like that's what we're going to go with uh that's what seems like everybody has agreed on that oh okay all right thanks Gavin uh for answering so uh basically uh so Gavin added in electron um in the pool request because there are errors on the test saying that uh electron needed to be installed so we um that's actually that's interesting we are going to have to sort out there have been some some errors happening um with some different people so we're going to have to sort out what's going on with that I haven't well with the exception of today I've never really had any errors with the test uh so I haven't really been able to uh replicate anything but might have to sort that out okay so my 5 minutes are up let's do I'm not going to do a full actually I'm going to set this for 10 minutes uh and just we'll do a bit of styling uh let's check out material UI uh I always type in I can't spell there we go all right this is what I wanted let's see TS see what the tabs look like all right not really sure I'm not really sure if these Tabs are really are what we want uh just usually you don't we have a lot of items uh I've don't think I've ever seen that many items uh in tabs for material design so I don't I just don't think that's going to look great so maybe we should try to just style these a bit uh on our own and see uh see how it looks so let's take our let's make a um a SAS file for this Styles let Styles um Okay so we've made through the command line we've made this file so we did the touch command and then specified the directory and then the file name uh so now we can see our file here logos okay so within this now we can uh edit this let me see what our class names we're using so for right now the tabs are what I want to focus on um okay so we have and just allies in there okay so let's check out Dev tools um this is probably common but uh I I find it helpful to when I'm not exactly sure what I want to do uh to use Dev tools to change some of the Styles just so I can immediately see what's happening uh and then once I figure out about what I want to do then I go back to the actual file uh and start making some changes uh but for now I mean we're already getting some of the behavior we want so uh it's it's already displaying in a row uh which is good we do want to let's see list style actually what is this type that's what we want none okay Okay so we've done list style type none that got rid of our little uh our little dots there our little discs so we definitely want to do that where's this UL tabs uh so we can go back here and let's just say um tabs so I did have somebody earlier say how do we uh style an element with a class not sure if you're still around but uh this is how you do it so we have the class name of tabs on this UL so now we're going to say tabs and list style type none right and now we have just uh styled that and you can see um we actually it's automatically created the CSS file so that SAS is compiling now so if we go here we can see now it's CSS we haven't really done anything that's SAS specific so it's pretty much exactly the same um just have this s on line uh but if we had done something that was kind of a SAS only thing it would have compiled a valid CSS uh immediately okay so we have our tabs unstyled uh let's see I do want these to be so let's check out our Lis uh so right now we have some column some column classes being applied to the Allies so let's remove those and see what we're left with I don't want to have to fight the column classes uh I'd rather start with less and then build up okay that's so that's what was happening oops I didn't import the uh uh CSS file so we need to do that uh let me go to another page just so I can copy it uh where we have no I don't want it from index I want it from there we go okay so we do need to import that file that CSS file okay and doing it like this uh what it it helps keep every uh kind of you have really small easy to read files uh if you name them uh in a decent way then you should be able to immediately know what they're for so in this case uh our files are named um for the most part uh after what they're what they're doing like either what um element or component or even view that they go with so it's pretty straightforward um it looks a little bit nicer than having one giant uh CSS file uh it's easier to find things in okay so you see now it's applied that we don't have those little um little discs and we've also gotten rid of those styles for the column and so we have our list and it's now in a row we don't want it in a row let's see display block this is such a common thing that I I have to do and I can never remember there we go I always can never remember how to get it to work um um class tab let's do something SAS specific So within tabs we're going to put Tab and put float left okay so obviously you can't do this in regular CSS so it compiles to this which is proper CSS I shouldn't say compiles that's not really the right term right okay so now you can see we have the Styles here uh let's give a bit of padding so let's give it eight pixels all around and actually what do I want tab I'm going to give it eight pixels all around and I do I do want a margin as well so the the reason being so the padding will actually uh be like clickable area uh but the space that's margin will not um well we should probably put it on here yeah let's get rid of that um let's put our padding here because that's really what we wanted I want to maintain that that clickability here so you see that the target will be larger so if somebody doesn't exactly get on there it'll still work okay uh and then on the LI we'll add a margin uh and I don't want any top or bottom margin so I'm going to give it zero there and then let's go another eight pixels on the sides so you see it it looks now uh let me zoom in it's easier to see all right so you can see we have on each one eight pixels of padding all around and then uh eight pixels of margin on the left and the right so that should give enough of a Target so that remember this is only going to be desktop now so we don't have to worry about a tap Target otherwise we would want to be bigger like more like 40 48 pixels um but since this is going to be for a mouse we can get away with smaller uh but that should be enough it should be very uh easy to click uh and then also because we have that padding in between so there'll be a 16 pixel Gap in between each one uh where uh so that people won't accidentally click or at least it'll be a little bit more difficult to accidentally click uh one that you didn't mean to click all right um the last thing call all right let's let's just uh put this in so under the tab we want a margin 0 8 and then within the tab we're going to have that a tag and we want that to have padding of eight pixels we going to save that I also want to see what will happen if I I put what do I want to Center I want to see what happens if I try to Center I don't know if I brought I'm not sure I brought this class over from materialized we'll see in a second um Center I didn't so let's go with um so here's another way to style react components you can actually just put a style tag and then drop down into JavaScript by putting the brackets in there and then make an object uh and then that object will then be your CSS uh so in this case I want to do text align and that needs to be camel cased and Center and let's see okay and that has that done anything no it hasn't so what I'll need to do what I want to accomplish is to have this stuff centered uh so I need to do something with this trying to think I did this uh somewhat recently I had the same issue I'm trying to remember what I ended up doing all right my time's probably about up let me double check before I oh yeah it is a I must not have heard the uh the beeping so anyway just to let you know what the next step uh that I wanted to do is uh have this be centered uh so probably going to do some type of um some type of centering like Z Auto maybe uh but then I'll need to give it a w so I need to do like with um I don't know 15% so I could do something like that I don't really want to do that though yeah it's not now I remember the issue that I had before was that if you try to do the float uh then you can't get s so like right now it's obviously centered but I was doing the float um to get it to to all line up so what I can't remember how I how I fix that anyway uh use display Flex in the line Center oh okay so drron says use display flex and then align Center or Center content items okay cool off to try that display in line oh yeah excuse display in line there we go Sebastian awesome that's what it is okay so that's that's what I was looking for that's how I um I'm pretty sure that's how I solved it previously okay so um display in line probably the flex thing would have worked as well um but but if we add display inline and I don't think we need to do do we need to keep that we don't need that do we need this yep okay so we need textaline Center uh on this div uh or can we put it on the UL okay we can get away with putting it on the UL so let's do that um and that's nicer uh to put it lower down anyway and then we don't have to add another element uh and then on the tabs itself we'll go uh display inline we'll save that and let's get rid of this this Center uh we don't need that and then also this which I mean that was good for demonstration to put that in if you need to uh but since we have that separate CSS file I'd rather have everything in there um so here we go what did I miss text line Center the float we got to get rid of the float there we go okay so we have everything centered lined up I like the amount of spacing uh and padding uh the tech size I kind of really would like to go bigger on the tech size uh so we'll see about that um possibly also different on we we'll have to see uh some more styling about how we want to do that but not bad definitely looks better than it was uh so that's a good start yeah good start um probably not going to commit this right now because I was getting all those errors before so well why not let's let's see if we can commit and um not get the errors we didn't really do anything to fix them so uh probably will'll get him again but we'll see so let's do a get status and when we do get status it'll show us everything that we've changed uh and everything we've we've added so test upload txt how did I do a text test upload txt H I'm not sure how the test upload got in there all right so definitely don't want to commit that okay um so we definitely did change these so that's what um it's good idea um I always do it and usually it's not I really necessary but I do like to do a get status before I commit uh especially if I've been working for a while um in case I've forgotten that I changed something or if I inadvertently changed something and didn't realize it so now all these files look good I um I have actually worked on each one of these actually service request actually I'm not really sure what I did in service requests uh where's it at so let's check it out huh that's OD usually usually it will show me on the side a different color for the lines that have changed and it looks like nothing's changed uh so you can do a get diff to see what's changed so uh this is logos which it's fine we know a lot of stuff Chang in logos service request it looks like just formatting so probably probably when we ran that uh that command just to do some formatting it probably just reformatted something in there so yeah so nothing actually changed it just got rearranged a bit okay that's cool I'm fine with that all right so I'm going to do a get add and then I'm going to put a period there and that's going to add everything so if we do our status again everything's green that means it's ready to go ready to be committed so we'll do a get commit uh M so we can put a message in line and we'll just say um add did we masonry two of those that's that's pretty much sums up what we've done so currently I have no standards on Commit messages for this project uh I'm thinking about making some sort of standard or or adopting some standard for commit messages from uh from somewhere else so uh might end up having some better messages here at some point uh but for now I just haven't decided on it uh currently in my course all right see we passed all the tests not really sure what was going on with that before um maybe it had something to do with the server so if you remember uh I had to restart the server so if I had to guess I'd say maybe it was something with that but we can see we passed all the tests uh let's push this up so now all that code is available in the repo on GitHub I'm going to go over to the live chat and uh answer any questions that you'll have in there uh so if you do have any questions please put them in the live chat now um I also take questions on any other uh social media platforms or even email uh if you have some question questions for me uh later on uh if you aren't interested in the question answer session you're just interested in the code the code portion is over so thank you so much for watching uh you can you can safely leave now uh most likely won't be doing any more coding um otherwise uh let's get to some questions all right so it looks like I've covered a decent amount of the chat already I've done a done a good job of sticking to the schedule of the Pomodoro sessions today okay it looks like there was some discussion about using uh the grid uh CSS grid layout so uh I'm probably not going to do that for this project since you know I've already have the uh masonry stuff set up uh so I know that works I like how that works so I'm open to using the grid uh elswhere if NE if we need it uh Patrick says that it's it's only at about 70% browser adoption right now so um maybe not uh at least for this unfort unfortunately there are a lot of computers on campus where people are using some really outdated browsers so I don't attempt to support the really outdated browsers uh and in fact I I think there's value in not supporting them to try to force up you to force them to update um uh especially for security issues of using browsers that old but uh I think I still would like to have uh have things look decent even on slightly older browsers uh but John Hansen does say if you use CSS fallbacks within the grid layout you can still use it in production so okay cool I mentioned earlier that I I was saying compile when I was talking about SAS and I mentioned I'm I'm pretty sure that's not the correct term so Sebastian says maybe transpile Alberto says transpile yeah I I think transpile is probably I mean I I use transpile when I'm talking about what Babel does with JavaScript um I mean SAS is a CSS preprocessor um yeah I don't know it doesn't really matter you all know what I'm talking about it takes the SAS and it turns it into CSS whatever you want to call that process uh that's what it does Kevin Uh Kevin had to leave the stream and watch it two times to catch up so awesome glad you caught up oh okay so that file that I wasn't sure about um was from a test uh and then Kevin says it gets deleted did when the test pass okay so probably what had happened since before I ran the test and I didn't pass them it was probably just left over from then so okay and I saw I think someone said Sebastian said add that to uh get ignore so yeah I should definitely do that and that'll just that way if it happens again I don't have to worry about it oh okay uh so max says the noise of my fan is annoying so sorry about that uh I didn't realize um is it can you you hear the fan a lot I had it on low I know I've done that before and it seemed to be okay so let me know if it was um uh if the fan was too much and uh I'll turn it off next time so it seems like Max Max said bye so I think Max isn't around anymore to let me know about the the fan noise but uh I'm actually okay with Max leaving because the fan noise is annoying it would have been uh it would have been much worse if they said like your voice is annoying or something because I can't really change that but I could definitely turn the fan off all right so I think I've got yeah I've gotten all the questions uh in the live chat hopefully I didn't miss any uh up near the top if I did I'm sorry um let's see Sebastian still having trouble passing the test all right we're going to have to try to get to the bottom of this and I know it's at least it's hard for me cuz I I can't I can't recreate the issues so it's really hard to try to work on them so um all right well we'll try to we try to figure that out but if anybody else else is having trouble if you clone the repo and try to pass the test if you're having trouble please um go to the issue uh in it's the only issue open right now uh in the repo so check out go to that issue and comment with any uh details you have like screenshots of what what's happening uh what system you're running and things like that uh that might be helpful when trying to figure out what uh what the problems are um so if you are having and you can do that that would that would just be super helpful I really appreciate that uh but I think that's it for today I really appreciate everybody uh watching and um participating in the live chat it's really cool that uh we have that slack Channel now so I'll try to remember to put that in all the descriptions from now on uh so and I'll have to join in there as who uh I should be able to be back uh
