this week was a great lesson how nice to estimate it's Monday today my guests come working from home is great and having a separate office in your home and bigger person who works remotely it's really really awesome for me but when the family comes and you are a bit out of your daily routine it's getting harder I was just doing the fix for our selectable text in my family o'clock and these small changes make make you users not the app they make the users feel that you really care about them let's week somebody wrote under the video about silent game that they don't go to spot a mile to check in the project that they are not a private I think that if you really devote your time to start any project it's better to do it in a one hundred twenty percent because it's still your portfolio study you devote your time and time is the the most precious Cara see soon that you have the journey of the week was like that so who's the time spent with my this is the best motivational tool so whenever you are not in the mood for coding whenever you are not focused enough to start cooking because you are tired or you are thinking about something else they're not in the music that you like and start coding it works the first photo sauce is that it's very organized very modular and very useful and assign natural step after getting to know CSS and using it for a while the coding says seems to be really easier to maintain and easier to add another component easier to come back after time to and great for bigger apps great for working a team great for maintenance of the project and coming back to it later because of its importance because of its variables and the huge plus is also how you write themselves how pin it is that you don't need this Xbox any comments that you don't need this extra rockets that's why I pay with people call sauce well this scss okay they are convertible you can you know change one into honor but see SS is not as a as s I really admire you the guys who whacked on a daily basis and come back after work and start learning to code very often as I wrap people did as a second job they do it at night so I really really admire you and I keep the fingers crossed for your success because it's really hard and I haven't just only get and it's harder to stay on a daily track of learning to code I'm focused on holding the whole thing and majority of the time I spend on coping or learning to code on learning to design but you guys really do it you know partially afterwards and still manage to do it successfully you wrong guys so it's really something awesome and this needs that power inside its first day I just finish writing the first draft of my new multiple or medium seven minutes to read it so it's perfect timing coming back to it tomorrow this week because of the project that I also start soon I was comparing that to typing tools that I've using before but not a long time so I had to revise them once again and I decided on experience design when I do the designs for myself very often I do not use them at all because sketching gets very often enough majority of prototyping tools are really similar so if you know one it's easy to use the other one what's different super the backing to is very often the price and the level of functionality if it's really mad major product or not this week I gathered q brownie points so together I have right now 464 brand new points and and I was active but not as I wanted and but still the for the first four days I was active also Peter helping others so from monday to thursday i gathered few more homes to my 500 round challenge the article is ready right now to be revised by quincy and i want to publish it an integral x application and when we talk about this article I was focusing on how much did it cost me to harm this funding certificate and I focus mostly on data on numbers and later discuss details and man she knew sources so feedback and to think about sharing and came back and also what's next so let's show you the whole story right now I hope you will read it later I will find you the link once it's published the way I'm writing articles and it's always planning it and later writing the first block and coming back to it after one day something's coming to it and after longer break if I have time and polishing it so changing what's needed also expected things happen when it comes to the projects because all of a sudden last week on Friday Freda clients contacted me about the products I go to two calls this week about new projects which you have to connect with extra time needed for that when you connect it with in for having hotel at home and working remotely from the same home and adding these extra hours as a result at the end of the week you think I dinner a lot I didn't learn a lot of new stuff and so your motivation fall down and the problem is that it's not the end like that one week like that that I have to start us on the project and come back to the routine decision taking and replacing what you need to do fast in this situation where your time is shrinking and a lot of unexpected things with gas happen this 13 this week also how to manage my time better how I manage my planning better and so for sure in the last level do my best to use what I've learned this week not to make the same mistakes keep on going and plan wisely and see you next week learning about sex box
