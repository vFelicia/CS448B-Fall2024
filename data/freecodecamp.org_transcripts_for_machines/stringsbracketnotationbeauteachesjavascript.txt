bracket notation is a way to get a character that's at a specific index within a string javascript doesn't start counting at one like humans do it starts at zero this is referred to as zero based indexing here we've assigned the first name variable to the string bo so with this string you can get the value of the first letter of the string by using so if we run that we see b in the console so we have the first name variable and then we use these brackets and inside the brackets we put the index so index zero is b because we start counting at zero but we can also change this to one and then you'll see in the console we have e because e is index one a is index two and u is index three and if you wanna get the last character of a string you can just subtract one from the string's length like this instead of putting one in here i'm gonna paste in dot length minus one so then you just automatically get the last character in the string which is in this case is u you can also get any other character from the end so if you want to get the second to last character you just do minus two and then we're gonna get a you can also get the third to last character the fourth to last character you just do the string.length and then minus how many characters you want to go back from in javascript string values are immutable which means that they cannot be altered once created so if i want to try to set the character in index 0 to q well you can't do that you cannot change individual characters in a string because the strings are immutable but i can set the first name variable to a whole new string so you can see here i've set the first name variable to quincy and i've logged this this new string here but we did not technically alter the string bow up here we just set the variable to an entirely new string well thanks for watching my name is beau carnes don't forget to subscribe and remember use your code for good
