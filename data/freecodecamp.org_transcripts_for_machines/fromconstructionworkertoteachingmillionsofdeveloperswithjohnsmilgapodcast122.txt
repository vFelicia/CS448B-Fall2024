welcome back to the free code camp podcast I'm Quincy lson teacher and founder of freecodecamp.org each week we're bringing you Insight from developers Founders and ambitious people getting into Tech this week we're joined by John smga he's a software engineer and prolific instructor who's published more than a dozen fulllength courses on the free Cod Camp YouTube channel and on his own YouTube channel over the past few years John welcome to the free Cod Camp podcast thank you for having me I'm stoked to be here yeah thank you for invite yeah and thanks for you were telling me before uh the show started that that you've listened to a lot of the episodes uh I feel honored and flattered to know that you're among the freeo camp podcast uhi it starts with people who you invite and then the base just does does the rest I mean you have super accomplished interesting people and then you you always make it special just like free Cod cam just like everything you guys do there's some something like unique and that just sets it apart so yeah awesome well I love playing the bass and uh I was telling you earlier you're like where's the base and I was like oh I don't want to like have to record 10 times right in front of you like when I screw up like my baselines so I just kind of record them separately but yeah let's go all the way back like I always like to start like the the origin story who is John smga how did he come about so you were living in uh ltia and the 1980s of course uh people who aren't as familiar with with uh geography that's like over in kind of like the the eastern part of Europe like there I think there's Lithuania then lvia then Estonia and they're all Baltic states yeah yeah and they're all pressed up against Russia of course yes um yeah they're tiny uh just to give like kind of context especially for people in the United States so essentially you got West Virginia so we're the size of West Virginia and then as far population we are like Nebraska so yeah just just to give context I'm not sure which other country in the world we can compare to but yeah it's it's pretty tiny we are like small it's it's but yeah it's it's it's it's awesome it's an awesome Place yeah maybe you could talk about what it was like being a kid over there cuz like this was uh before you know the Berlin Wall fell you you were born in I think you mentioned 1982 so like just a couple years after I was Bor I was born in 1980 uh what was your early childhood like so it was pretty typical for that time like my both my parents were like working they were like called like middle class at that point my father was an engineer my my mom uh also worked in that field and essentially we we were big family we were like five kids so it was the case where essentially Grandma for the most part like raised this like she's like she just did every like everything starting with the cooking cleaning you know taking to the school back and all that but as far as like the the the early memories I don't I don't remember like let's per se like the a lot of things as much I do remember essentially when we gained the freedom that day I do remember watching it on TV and stuff but like I think most vividly as far as just the difference between like for example as I was growing up and my kids I do see that like for example for us when we were growing up I wouldn't say that we were poor it's just there were no things in a store like essentially there's nothing in the store so I do remember vividly how I first time like for example I got the ham like Mom literally brought back the ham right and now I'm seeing at my kids like who essentially can eat in breakfast you know oh I'm just going to pick from one of these five like cereals and whatever yeah and and I'm not saying this as as if like oh you should have like I'm just like giving you like like the perspective it is always like this thing when my mind I'm like wow like how how far like we have come and everything but yeah yeah it was it was it was a lot of fun I mean I do remember just like playing a lot outside and stuff and and and those those those type of things but yeah there was there was definitely scarcity of things just because again not because of like any kind of uh it's just there was no like like no things in the store and stuff like that so like your choices were super limited you had like one pair of boots that you can have and stuff like that yeah I think like back in the day like uh I'm not a historian so I to speak on matters of history please let me know but I remember like one of the things that like the US like used as kind of like a propaganda Point like uh I think they they would like show on like uh Soviet TV like what's the grocery store like in the United States and it was just like tons of different varieties and stuff like that and you know because uh in the Soviet Union they had a lot of price controls in place and they had kind of centralized planning and just not as much stuff got made and distributed even if you had the money to buy things there weren't things to necessarily buy um and and I remember that uh being like really interesting kind of and I'm I'm really grateful obviously the situation changed and you know Lafia is now a much nicer place I would imagine but maybe you could talk about the situation like uh and and just I want to preface this before we get into anything this is not a politics podcast this is not a current events uh podcast we are merely like talking about like history and kind of reflecting on it from our own personal perspective and and stuff like that you don't you don't have to you're not going to hear any fiery di dbes from me about like you know communism is bad or anything like that uh rather I'm just trying to like kind of put some some color on uh the time that you spent over there before you came to the US no it's it's not like the stuff and everything but there is something about the fact that you can make your own decisions instead of all the time being told you know what you need to think what you need to like what is good what is bad and and that sort of thing and I mean as far as ltia it's definitely as I especially I was as I was growing up it was a pain painful process of moving from one system to another one it's not like yes you get your freedom in one day but you need to understand that like there is a difference when I come to the United States I see people who have been free their entire life they know like what is actually freedom of speech that they can say stuff it doesn't happen overnight yes you do like you have like essentially the the structure in place but it takes a long time for the system to change right it can be the the most basic thing like the way I always look at like whether the how the country has developed like what uh like what is the service industry right every year like as I'm going back to laia I see that you know every time it changes it started with basically when you come in and you need to apologize the fact that you entered the store to the point of like now like it's growing and it's developing and it just takes a long time but it's Yeah the more I live I do see the kind of this point of like that the free markets at the end of the day like they're not ideal situation like again we can get into tons of stuff especially like you know the healthc carees and all that but I I just don't see you know just few people in the government running everything and that being successful I I haven't like seen that so yeah well what was school like uh you you went to high school did you go to university in so like in school like it was one of those things this is just a side note but I went to the musically inclined school because my sister was going my older one and my mom thought that it's a good decision to send me there as well so but unlike my sister I couldn't stand it so I had to sing in a choir like you had like I believe like every day we had like music class you had to play an instrument and I just didn't like it I just didn't like it and and I have to say like in high school I was horrible in the sense that I was just late I wasn't doing homework I was not technically inclined I just I just I'm not like if someone asked me what I was doing I don't even remember but I know that I was like pretty bad at school so I wasn't really interested and at some point like towards the last year I just kind of decided Hey listen you know um I'm going to go somewhere else and in a sense like I could have stayed in laia there was no issues and whatsoever you know it's like it wasn't like I had to leave but I just had this idea in my head so I was like you know what I'm just going to go somewhere in Europe or United States just you know I just want to see see the world essentially right because it was one of those things where half of my class were going for law degree and half of my class were going for economics so at that point it was those like two popular choices I I I I believe I just read that right now it's the the the the the social Communications is the thing like so essentially once the class graduates everybody goes into social Communications and things like that so and I was like listen and I don't want to do either of them and and so it was the case where I think I stayed for one or two years and I believe back then we still had uh we need to go to Army so it was like so I still I had to be in school so I remember I believe I went to like some very like strange degree for like one day essentially I showed up the first day then I got the full year off and and everything and then I did the same the the next year what were you doing during this period like did you did you serve in the L in army or no no no no no so so it was one of those things where I was like super bad in school again I cannot explain why but like one of the benefits for me was that my father is like and my mom of course as well but my my dad is like very like he's big on working so essentially my entire life I I had this example of like how you're supposed to treat work so essentially if you're doing something you're doing it if you're not okay just pick something else but if you commit to something it's like like for him like 40 hours when he hears 40 hours he usually laughs like for him it's kind of like again we can get into different topic where essentially I think that family is super important so I'm and that kind of helped me because when I when I went to England right after that for two years I worked in a hotel and I was a bartender there so that was kind of it really helped me what I did in laia to kind of transfer that to interesting so you kind of got like into managerial and like uh Hospitality management kind of yeah because like I mean we had to experience this whole thing so I I would say that I entered the workforce pretty quickly and the reason why I attended those few classes here and there is simply to back then like this is one of the decisions that I do regret but then I was basically avoiding military because I just now I'm looking at it differently but back then I just well back thenu me yeah so you said you you spent a year in England that's pretty cool how how were you able to get over to England like was uh they they they just opened essentially 2004 laia entered uh the European Union so there were specific countries which were you could go so this was before brexit obviously so you could just freely like go work in other European countries you you can go and work and and you were I mean again it's one of those things where I A lot of times where I have a little bit of push back where people say like that you know essentially what I always say is to people like there was never a work in England or anywhere else that I would have had if if let's say someone who was born there was willing to do it so essentially it's one of those things where yeah I understand that some people sometimes are not happy about the immigration and I clearly understand that there not needs to be controlled like how it happens but at the same time you know again all all the jobs that I was doing essentially if some somebody like who's speaking English and what ever he would have taken that job effectively immediately I would have you know been fired and all that so uh it was an awesome experience yeah you started off it was it was a little bit rough in in England in that hotel simply because like it was like the Ling quarters as well in the same place so imagine like you know three four people like living in that kind of a dorm room right but it's for like adults and everything else so it was interesting in the beginning but it helped me really to learn English this is where I noticed that you can practice the language all you want I believe in laia I was I was already since I knew that I'm going to be leaving to West I was taking like private I was I hired private teacher and I was like spending my own money to learn language and all that but then once you go to England I realize that I actually don't know that much and the only way how to learn that is just to engage and I've kind of taken this approach with pretty much everything after that right whether that's music JiuJitsu I don't know shooting basketball learning code I mean you can learn the you can read about it watch the videos all day long there's nothing like the moment you touch the keyboard that's the like the the real learning it it's like it's it's just far superior to whatever you you you you can read before that or or once you step on a JiuJitsu mat like then you can watch very real very quickly I would imagine very quickly you understand like like what does that mean and that's why I always like try to kind of combined like learning something but then you always need to have a practice for example like speaking with my kids I'm like I A lot of times I'm like I understand that there's a need to learn like some third language but at the same time if you're not going to use it everyone I've talked to who have like been studying language let's say you know in school or whatever but they haven't used it by that time they it's it's no real use so yeah that's yeah well like I'm excited to get into you know kids and how you're how you're teaching a lot of these things that you learned firsthand from your time for example in England uh but but just keeping with the chronology of events So you you're you've learned English reasonably well uh probably not nearly as well as you speak now you basically sound like a native speaker you just have a little bit of an accent um but like what happened from there like you said it was kind of rough working this job that you know so many jobs that are worked by immigrants uh in the United States for example exle are the kind of thankless jobs that most native born Americans would not be willing to do uh strawberry farming is back breaking work and we have a huge influx of immigrants from other countries some legal some illegal who do the Strawberry Picking and basically make the strawberry you know that you get at the grocery store economically viable and make it not cost like 10 bucks instead of cost like three bucks or something I I Haven must Rob in a while so I apologize for like way off but um yeah like that is they had this campaign like take our jobs and they basically said like any American who wants a job picking strawberries can come out here and we'll give you you know the same wages that we give the uh the immigrants from Latin America uh and very few people took them up on that and almost everybody who took them up on it like ultimately like ditched the job because it's backbreaking work and if you look at like the US population sorry I said I wasn't going to talk about politics or current events but but immigration is near and dear to my heart I care a great about uh America and I care about its future and it's future is with immigrants our population would be declining like Japan like Korea like like most European countries if it weren't thanks to new immigrants coming and starting families here like you and your wife have uh you know my wife is a naturalized US citizen which I I I know I mentioned like practically every episode but like we met in grad school uh she moved to the US she worked in tech for many years uh as as an accountant doing other things and you know she has been a productive member of the United States of America and pay taxes and everything like that and this is like the way forward like people who think that we can continue to grow without immigration are dreaming because as countries become prosperous they generally slow down and have fewer kids I've got two kids you've got two kids I don't know you're probably not planning on having five kids like your parents right no I had naive I had this na dream when I was like I don't know 20 or something I thought oh yeah we we were five so that reality hit me quickly I do know people who do that but they don't get a lot of sleep yeah Power to you if you want to have five kids I had two and then I had the uh the surgery so that I can't accidentally have more and I do not regret having the surgery any day I did that surgery I believe it was scheduled right away after my my my second born and then I did I think month after that or something yeah so anyway I just wanted to like get that out there like uh I'm not going to come out in favor of like different policies or anything like that but I will say that I fundamentally believe that having skilled immigrants coming to our country is a profoundly positive thing for everybody for the immigrants for the native born Americans uh for everybody so um yeah so so you're kind of preaching to the choir when you when you when you say that sorry back yeah yeah no no it was because like when I was there I again I wouldn't say there was like I wouldn't say that any anyone was mean to you or anything like that but again the reality of like working somewhere that it's not just you know sunshines and rainbows you that's essentially that's the work you do you go over there and and and and again if if if anyone would show up and take that job then that wouldn't be the case even you know there there's a reason why that company is doing it there's a reason why you're doing it and there's a reason why people who consume that what ever uh product are essentially buying it because it's cheaper essentially at the end of the day right if we really like you know kind of narrow it down to kind of uh the the basics and all that yeah and so I spent two years there I was essentially it was one of those interesting things where I was it's kind of an island in between the England and the the France it's called gery uh it's super interesting it's actually one of the I think one of the only places which were captured by the German and essentially England uh well smartly refus yeah they they they refused to essentially go back and and and kind of fight for it because they effectively they realized that they're just going to be slaughtered over there because it's an island in the middle of the sea in between and and they were like okay you know what we we still need to defend uh the England and the locals they they don't even call themselves that they're like English they say that I'm from gery and uh they say that essentially that they they have never forgotten that that the fact that that that that happened but I think it's one of those things where I think and uh you know like everything closes at like 700 in the evening and stuff like that and it's just like a I'm like 20 something years old I do want to like go and see something yeah not like the greatest place to like spend your 20s I would imagine no no no no no yeah total population 60,000 people um which is you know not yeah it's pretty decent but the funny thing is that uh they they have bunch of like again the same thing like you just mentioned Farms where they grow I believe roses and vegetables and all that and that was that job was even out say even like essentially you need to work longer hours and that sort of thing than the let's say the hotel where I was working and um yeah there was a lot of Lans employed so from the 60,000 there was like 5,000 Lans at the time when I was there so it was interesting where you go it is interesting so like did is the laan overseas gasp or like have they specialized in kind of like that that Services sector type thing like uh because I have lots of friend from India that live in like UAE or live in uh bahin or places like that and it's like a whole lot of Indian engineers and people like that work in these countries or the Philippines for example uh a huge percentage of the world's sailers are from the Philippines and it's kind of like they specialized and nurses yeah my my wife was like when she was working as a nurse there was like tons of you nurses from the Philippines because they have very good programs and essentially that's one of the things how they I mean I don't want to sound like like mean but kind of their export is the PE the fact that people go and work abroad and they send the money back remittances huge portion of their GDP is from uh workers abroad sending money back same thing with like India uh it was definitely like that with China for a long time uh maybe you could talk a little bit about though like you said there were 5,000 LA on this island at that time yeah so so you was it challenging to actually speak English all the time when you had so many other people that were probably like wanting to talk to their countrymen did you have like lvan you know restaurants and stuff like that as far as the the restaurants at that time no but there was like as far as communication yeah between yourself you were always talking latian so it was one of those things where essentially you needed to immerse yourself you need to find the ways how you can just talk to English people for me it was pretty easy because I was working in a bar so all the everyone who was coming there was speaking English so essentially I was just like uh being annoying and trying to come up with any kind of topic talking about sports all day and stuff like that just to get like basically the practice practice in and as far as your question about uh what type of work it was one of those things where back then and it's still the case right now in ltia where essentially like the capital is doing really well that's where I'm from Ria but then everything else is like I mean again better or worse but a lot of people like move from the outskirts from from smaller like places and for them yeah it's mostly initially at least they're they're going for for hospitality jobs and stuff like essentially what you can do without any kind of like specialized education now with the years since they have spent a lot of time especially like for example in Ireland I think we even have a bigger diaspora than the than the England they you know open up their own companies they they do different they you know go to school study something that that's pretty common actually but initially yeah that's one of those things where I don't know many instances where someone let's say like migrated and they right away start working for some giant company it's definitely the case of course but I personally don't know them you always start from some kind of job that you can actually uh perform and where there's a need and and and such a skilled jobs are way more protected so you need to show showcase way more qualifications and and essentially networking and all that yeah so you came to the US did you when did you move to the US was that directly from gury or yeah yeah pretty much I I I kind of decided that listen it's kind of like I saved up some money I was I was working there at two jobs uh eventually and I was able to save up some money which was for 20 year old was like I thought it it's a big success and uh yeah effectively I I just basically got the I thought you know what I'm just going to go and travel us you know and just just see what it's like end up in Chicago uh end up meeting my wife uh pretty early on and effectively just getting together and then that's one of those things where that wasn't my intention at all and then next thing you know I'm I'm I'm in there and W so things just solidified very quickly your wife uh you could talk a little bit about your your wife uh a nurse from Ukraine um maybe you can talk just a little bit about her background and what her life had been like up to the point that you two met in Chicago so she came also like she was like very like very early on she like she's actually the opposite that she in Ukraine she did really well in studies she was actually going for uh she was going for um engineering but then at some point uh she decided that listen I want to spend like a little bit of time in us so I'm just going to go and there's a program called opair where essentially you come here and you are nanny for whatever time and then while she was here she kind of was was researching stuff and she she saw that there's basically there were programs as far as nurses so if you stay here then you get a green card and all that and that effectively she decided to do and uh she started studying to nurse and I already met her when she was uh in there that was kind of our thing and then yeah we're pretty quickly like it was one of those things where I don't want to tell that to my daughters but we pretty quickly we started like we we kind of knew that like this is the right person and everything and I kind of went from there there wasn't much time and and things like so love it first sight or love within you know the first few times of hang that we met and um yeah we realized that we're both sarcastic and yeah like all the time joke and and stuff like that so it was it was it was very quickly oh that so again but it wasn't like the intention my intention essentially like I think I was even talking I was thinking about New Zealand at some point because my idea was like okay I'm going to go travel us and everything but there were more um kind of I had more info on how you effectively can go to New Zealand and work and live there and stuff like and and for some reason I don't ask me why but I thought that New Zealand is the place to be it's a nice place it's a nice place but again if someone is going to ask me why you were thinking like what was the the appeal of New Zealand I'm like I don't know but I just when I was in England I was like I need to go to New Zealand but I'm just going to go to us and like essentially just just just visit the US and see what it's like and yeah yeah well I mean we're we're thrilled that you decided to stay here so yeah it wasn't it it wasn't really like planned and everything and and um yeah and then we met uh we uh she was already in school but I was essentially working um like I mean again I don't want to call them dead end jobs you can essentially make the career out of it but for me it was definitely the case where like as I was working because like in here one of the things when you come and you have no education whatsoever you like most likely you'll work in construction and that's for whether it's an immigrant whether that's like person who's born here it's one of especially for male that's Especial like one of the most popular places to end up is construction because there's always some building going on and you know you can learn the the the the job from from the scratch you just walk in there and you're like say okay listen you know you start from the very bottom and then you you know uh keep going and did you ever work construction yeah yeah I worked for like I want to say after that like for five years because years that's crazy like I just want to stop and say I work construction for one week and then I went back to like Taco Bell or whatever like I just couldn't handle it like it was brutal demolishing buildings and stuff like that like just picking up heavy Jagged things like all day long and your hands just get all calloused up and maybe you could talk about that experience because I I'm not sure how many people listening to this have work construction or appreciate the sheer like it is real work like me sitting at my computer my headphones on cup of tea by my side like it's a very different vibe from like walking around a construction site with a hard hat on it's not going to be just we started we didn't have much like really like we had like small apartment where we were you know just just trying to survive for more or less and we realize that listen you know I need to work otherwise if we both are going to be students then we're going to take in 10,000 in student loans and that's not like it's not going to be sustainable so effectively yeah while she was studying I was all the time working and then effectively we flipped so she started working and then I went to the school uh but construction um it it definitely taught me a lot it's one of those things where it's like you just said uh essentially every time I catch myself that you know if something is hard as a developer I'm like do you remember what it was like you know because uh I used to actually towards the end of it I worked I was working on window as a window installer and that's even more in my opinion like it's a good job in a sense that you can work all year round and everything but it's uh pretty grueling simply because you need to be done with that job in that day because you already have scheduled for next day so for example if I have to install these like six windows I need to finish today it's not the case where I'm like okay I didn't feel like it today or whatever I'm going to show up tomorrow no that's not the case so I remember essentially we were like gathering in the office already 600 in the morning so we need to get up at 500 and if the job takes longer it takes longer so if you're home at 8 you're home at 8 and there's like you're not going to go in and say start complaining the next day that's just the reality of the job so again many benefits as far as you constantly are employed and all that but again there's some drawbacks and that definitely has helped me as far as you know when when when I need to study something or what ever it's much easier to kind of like convince myself that you know listen this is just peanuts compared to what I was doing so you can turn it on and you can push through like procrastination or other psychological blocks that you may encounter because you had to do that all the time as a window installer there was no alternative yeah it's it's one of those things where essentially like I realized that like it's not the case where I can just simply just because I don't like something to quit my job because I do have like my wife is studying so it's not the case where and just be like well today I don't feel like it so I'm just going to quit the the idea was that listen we need to get through this moment we we will do it together and that kind of it has definitely helped me now I'm not saying that I'm some kind of like you know superhero who can listen I still have those days when I'm like I I don't feel like it but I have like worked on on the fact that you trick yourself and worst case scenario you just remind yourself about like like what are potentially what were the options like and the Alternatives yeah and why this is much better so you better like you know get your stuff together amazing yeah well I just keeping with the chronology because there's so many like I'm taking detailed notes as you talk and I've already got like 46 paragraphs of notes which sounds crazy it's actually like 26 because I double space but like I'm going to keep these insights flowing but I also want to get like caught up to like present day so how long were you and your wife together before you decided to to married to to have kids like like what was that span of time like in Chicago before marry that's a good question I would say like I would say like one year something like that so like pretty fast that's about how quickly I married my wife like we were married we were living together literally like you know like a month or two we were we were already like living so yeah and the kid kids were longer because again we had those plans where essentially one is going to finish the school the second is going to finish the school um and then then then we were planning the the family and that effectively that's how it happened actually so mhm yeah so you you planned everything out and everything kind of went according to plan at what point yeah it was oh I'm sorry go ahead no no no no it's actually one of those things that I always laugh about but yeah my my wife is very good at those things and and everything that she planned out actually worked out exactly the same way yeah so yeah sorry a recurring theme on the free Coke Camp podcast people who come on the free C Camp podcast who uh have accomplished enough to like uh I guess weren't coming on here like you they generally have a plan of sorts that and they have the uh the grit I guess the determination to stick to it uh you you talked about how your dad was like a really hard worker and he really prided himself in his work and then you know 5 years working construction and just having to get up and dust yourself off and go do it every day right um yeah so it sounds like hard work and planning are like a big part of your success so far um so where do you go from Chicago like your wife eventually finishes nursing school she she worked as a nurse for quite a while yeah yeah she so effectively the way it worked we um uh so we met uh she was already doing that and and I was just like starting looking at the studies for a few reasons because pretty early on I again I was that was already after that one year and a half in in in England and everything and I realized that listen you know there's going to have to be some changes essentially I need to go back to school it's just it it maybe sounds like a great idea to you know not to go to school and again we can get into the whole college and that and all that but I mean depending on where you live in the world I do still think that it's a good idea to go to school and I realized that and I was like yeah but at the moment I cannot do that simply because my wife is already studying so what I was doing uh essentially I started slowly in Community College I was just taking classes you know so I was usually uh I was taking train to work so train was in the morning and then the evening and while I was in the evening I was usually studying uh whether that was getting some notes from the book or just watching some YouTube videos and stuff about like some specific topic not just not just the Beast videos or anything like that yeah well you're probably watching precursors to like John smga yeah yeah yeah and and and so I decided you know what I'm just going to basically follow the footsteps of my dad and I'm just going to go and study to be an engineer and um so I finished the community college and that was the plan but then once I went to school there was like a big overlap between the electrical engineering and computer science and and I was very hesitant because I in my head I had this idea that you only do computer science if you're totally into game games and and if you're into that Tech and you need to be young you know there's no way you can be like whatever you know 30 years or whatever age and then you can study no there's no way yeah whenever you see a Hollywood movie the the engineer is always like some guy in his like 50s and 60s he's got like gray hair and like a big beard and he's like we got to do this and this and this or else this entire ship is going to blow know and then the the computer guy is always some like you know 19yearold kid who uh has like four social skills that like doesn't have any lived experience but he's really good with computers right those are the stereotypes he was he has been doing that since he was five because no one played with him and yeah all that and this is where free Cod Camp enters because effectively what happened was I had this already inclination because we had some classes and everything and I can see that Cod I really like coding but it was just this mental block in my head where I'm like no you need to do something realistic basically I was telling myself you need to stick with the electrical because you know computer science is not for you you basically you you uh the the ship has sailed and here comes Quincy Larson back then I was watching there's there's still probably YouTube channel called engineering truth and uh and I and I saw you and and you talked as always excitingly about coding about and everything and I'm like I'm watching watching that video and I'm like no I'm I'm I'm doing that and and that was kind of a big flip for me that that I was like ever since I saw you like you have one of those like qualities like the essentially like as Ambassador for you know tech industry is just amazing that you know like instead of this kind of uh what is it called gatekeeping right instead of it's like hey you know come on over and and I I really liked your article which you wrote one time or or you mentioned there that essentially you think of coding as as as as a as for people like when they were learning how to read you know you basically compared and that kind of like like really like made s so much sense to me when I when when when I heard that or or read your quote I'm like yeah that definitely makes sense even if I do end up going let's say to electrical engineering then coding is essentially like reading back in a day you know where you need to understand at least you know the general concepts and all that so yeah yeah definitely the case I'll try to par phrase myself uh essentially I said like you know during the AG Agricultural Revolution it was beneficial to learn how to read because then you could like you know read how to use fertilizer you could read the instructions for like new tractors and other tools and stuff like that and and during the Industrial Revolution as well when cars came out it was beneficial to learn how to drive like that was a huge source of economic value for so many people who were able to work as like truck drivers or taxi drivers or or people that just could live somewhere less expensive and commute using a car right that that became a big thing and when Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel like you know obviously there were like there was vizal and there were word presses before those but when those really got popularized in the 1990s everybody just learned how to use them and they were way more productive for it and I think learning how to use JavaScript is pretty similar learning how to use high level scripting languages right and and now learning how to use llms uh large language models in conjunction with other coding Tools in conjunction with databases things like that like I see them as just new skills that everybody should kind of put in the time to learn and I genuinely do believe that pretty much everybody should learn at least how computers work and if they can write some coding great uh if they can write some code great like I there is no knowledge that is not power right there are no skills that are just useless like you know I'm sure even though you you don't think highly of your musical education Al comes up where you happen to know something that's useful right that's one of those things that no no I even kind of like hold the tone so I I always stay off that's one of I always laugh about that then yeah yeah so so that's like first of all I feel very honored that uh that that interview that I did with I think it's name Mike Mike Tran like uh inuring truth back in the day um yeah you your I think your oldest one was like literally she came into the camera she was like just toddler not a toddler that was like seven years ago probably that was like a long time ago yeah yeah so wow okay so you're like going to Community College you're studying engineering electrical engineering like of course electrical engineering is similar to computer science and in fact it like Berkeley and a lot of other prominent schools that they were like kind of the same joint degree you was studying both can you talk about like what that transition was like like okay I like coding you how did you start coding cing so going a little bit back what I do want to mention like I know that there's I mean let me so essentially sometimes people complain about degrees effectively but one thing I do I can say maybe I'm not using the physics or chemistry or you know calculus or whatever but studying to understand that like reading through those textbooks has definitely help me when I have to go through the docks because it just prepares you where like listen there's a problem you need to solve it and you need to spend hours on just going through stuff and those textbooks can sometimes be even more dry than the docks these days because now everyone does an amazing job on like providing very useful docks and so definitely from my perspective even just for that learning how to learn is just super useful like going to school again we can get into the whole de thing and all that but as far as Community College I don't regret for even one second that you know I was spending those weekends and like evenings or whatever studying and that's that's also one something that it's always funny once you get kids you realize how much actually time you had so if we're talking about like coding as a skill that everyone at least in some kind of shape or form should know it's definitely one of those things where before kids you real you like you don't realize how much time you have on your hands and how much you're just wasting It Away on YouTube videos and whatever and then the moment you get the kids you realize oh okay I actually had all this time where I could have done something right yeah even though it sounds kind of like well yeah everyone should know the code but it's you don't need like to spend that much time in or at least understand the general concepts of how internet works and and and things like that nature yeah and yeah the the the transition was pretty like I it was again happened was kind of out of my control effectively like I made that decision that yeah I'm going to be you know essentially transferring from one degree to another one but at that time already my wife uh got the job offer in California and it was like a nobrainer uh because we we went for a road trip before that for for like month or so we drove all the way from Chicago to San Diego and back through through the through the United States and we were like okay we're moving to California but in order for me to transfer my credits it was essentially I looked at it that I need to start from the scratch in California and I was like well there has to be a better way and here again free C Camp comes into to comes into the picture because I read Bo's article about the WGU how he essentially finished yeah everybody like you probably seen him but you may not know his name is pronounced Bo it's not pronounced bu or it's like a French name it's just pronounced like Bo like a b staff and uh he he's the gentleman that you see doing the intros on all the free C Camp courses including I think most of your courses he does a quick intro so yes please continue I just wanted to provide some context yeah and so I see the Bose's article where he says how he finished the WGU and I'm like okay this is what I'm going to do since we're now in California I don't want to start from the scratch uh I'm just going to finish WGU I I wasn't as fast as B Because at that point um while I was still in Chicago effectively the moment I realized that I will have to do some coding I already started recording some videos because I noticed that and is and that was one of those things where I'm like you know what I'm going to start releasing those videos in the beginning they were like totally horrible I believe I was like I even started without any sound I just because I have a voice condition so I didn't like how my voice sound you talk about your voice condition like for me it's incredibly distinct uh because you you hear people like uh the lady on NPR I'm trying to remember her name uh but she has like a a voice condition but the result is the moment you tune to NPR and you hear her voice you're like I know exactly who that is and I know this is going to be a a dynamite interview it's going to be so good because she's so skilled uh at interviewing so you have some form of like paralysis one of your vocal codes yeah one of my vocal codes is essentially paralyzed I only like started working on that actually like only a few years ago and because I went to the doctors and they're like well technically there's nothing like it's sort of permanent no one knows why it happened and how I always blame the music as I not the the music's cool of course it's not but I'm just joking about that but um that was one of the things where um I do need to get like certain injections because otherwise they're not closing properly and it's it's a lot of times like for example when I'm recording it's kind of like it literally can be sometimes hard for me to speak so it really depends if I get the injection so now I got my last injection like 3 months ago so that's when you sent the invite I'm like okay now it's a perfect time if that would be in like let's say January I literally there was a time when I couldn't like even talk and uh yeah it's one of those things where that's why my voice uh like there is a like sometimes people complain like Hey listen what happened to your previous voice and all that and they either think that it's that I'm sick or something but it's not really the case it's it's literally it can change depending on the injection depending on the surgery it's one of those things where I constantly need to do something otherwise uh especially since I'm recording and using my voice so much it's it's it kind of I mean goes bad pretty quickly yeah kind kind of that way so yeah so what happens when it goes bad like I Diane ree is the name of the lady I was talking about from NPR who recently retired uh epic legendary interviewer host of what was it all things considered I can't remember the name of the uh the show but I think she eventually had like the Dian ream show or something like that but um but she had like a neurological thing uh so it wasn't actually mechanically something with the vocal cord so you you have an actual condition with it's mechanical yeah and essentially for me it comes down to that I can speak for like 2 minutes and then I have to cough it it's kind of like one of those things where so imagine like recording a 10minute video right where not only you mess up when essentially you do some coding mistakes but you also you talk and then it just cracks up the voice and you need to clear the throat and and that kind of is my you know it goes from The Voice is good and then slowly slowly it deteriorates again because again you cannot really fully like make them close because one of them is paralyzed so you can only do it like temporarily like just fix it and then again it goes bad okay so yeah yeah well well that combined with your lvan accent I think explains why you sound so distinctive and why your voice is instantly recognizable to anybody who's like learning the code they've probably heard your voice and I wouldn't be surprised if they were like oh wait I know who that is even though I didn't remember his name I think I've heard his voice before right yeah yeah it's definitely one of those cases yeah and I'm sorry just just to encourage anyone who's like like non English speaking uh effectively if you're thinking about doing videos you should because it's one of those things that I didn't realize where essentially I was always like yeah I'm I'm not a fan that I cannot get rid of the accent it's always going to be there with the at the same time there is a benefit there's many people who are nonenglish speakers maybe my vocabulary is not as you know wide as someone else's yeah and you can use some simple terms and in in some sort of accent and stuff so if you are a nonenglish speaker you definitely should do it you know just because you don't know how many people actually will resonate with your voice with your accent and all that so yeah yeah I'll I'll do give a very quick anecdote personally uh when I lived in China like right after I started graduate school graduate school I moved to China and I lived there like for like five or six years uh basically waiting for my wife to be able to get like uh a green to be able to come to the US um and when I was doing my intensive Mandarin program uh I wasn't talking with a lot of native Chinese speakers there were like the you know the teachers all the classes were in Chinese and everything like that I was the only guo on campus or the only guor in well was like the rude kind of Cantonese way I'm saying it because it sounds like ghost but uh I was the only uh wior in or wo poo the the foreign friend I'm sorry I have to say I always find these the when when someone like like when they have those terms for for white people somewhere else I just find them super funny I don't know why every time like let's say gringo and all it's just I just crack up every like Sor well I mean like I mean frankly white people are not really disadvantaged anywhere like in China people would give me like they they didn't look at me and say oh this guy's going to speak native like native level Chinese I like some of them would talk very slowly to me which is very kind but the way I learned most of my Chinese was not from Chinese speakers it was from Koreans who stayed in the dormatory with me so my roommate was Korean everybody was Korean and they had all come to China to like learn you know international trade and they as part of that they needed to learn Chinese because China Korea huge trading partners just like the US in China but even more so um so uh yeah so having that experience of just constantly talking to Korean people in Chinese because they couldn't speak English and I couldn't speak Korean like Chinese was our lingual franka and we had that restricted vocabulary and we were just better at like I he he's not using the tone correctly but I I kind of understand what he means like it just builds there's this affordance that is built in when you're talking with a nonnative English speaker or in my case a nonnative Chinese speaker and it is dramatically easier so I can I can definitely see the benefit in having people creating tutorials for programming in English that like you yourself are going to probably use a more restricted vocabulary because like I grew up speaking English like I'm going to use all these weird you know Yankee Expressions that that people learn familiar with I'm going to do all these weird American pop culture references and stuff that people that grew up outside the US may not have any idea what that means you know like without thinking right so it it immediately increases the difficulty of comprehending what I'm saying if you're if you've only been studying English for a few years for example so yeah it it is absolutely valuable and I'll just kind of second what you just said John that even if you're not like the best English speaker you should still record tutorials even if you have a voice condition uh record tutorials like it is helpful and and at the very worst you're going to record tutorials that not very many people watch but just the act of teaching something is the best way to solidify your own knowledge and uh teachers often know stuff much better than practitioners it maybe the best combination is of course a teacher practition or somebody who's worked in the field and now teaches it or continues to work in the field and teaches but I digress so John uh so you're in California of course the Golden State did you take Route 66 to get out there uh some parts of it yeah yeah cuz I think it runs from Chicago to Los Angeles yeah I think we deviated in in some places I believe we yeah there we went there twice so one time was for the road trip and second time when we were actually moving we were deviating because we went to um we were in Sacramento at the time so our route was a little bit different and we first time we went through Wyoming we we were not fans of Wyoming simply because was literally one of those things where you drive into Wyoming you have a hail storm and then you drove into Utah and you have Sunny sky and clear and it's it was like just this one of those like like movie moments right so you're literally driving through the hell storm like we got the crack in the windshield and everything and then the moment we drove into Utah the sky is clear and the Sun is like blasting we're like nope no more Wyoming my apology like I hope well I mean he not always like that and you just I hope you didn't get too bad of an impression but Utah has has some amazing natural beauty for sure MH and I I have made the drive to California and back um from Oklahoma City not from uh Chicago so slightly shorter I think but uh yeah like that that's a big Endeavor so you get out to California your wife is now working as a nurse and you are you decided to go to WGU Western Governor's University which is an online degree program it's a it's a good school it's accredited and and they only have a few programs one of them is software development software development yeah yeah and that's what you studied same thing that Bo KS uh from free C Camp that runs the Freo Camp YouTube channel and is you know helping uh me you know with uh this video get this video up on YouTube thanks bo uh same we can make podcast about Bo sorry to interject but the things that like the creative things he has done as far as how he has flipped uh the YouTube space it's just amazing yeah sorry something he's just huge fan of his work yeah he's a huge inspiration for me and it's a joy to work alongside him he's just a chill down to earth family man like you and I right like I I feel like I have so much in common not that I have a lot of his uh characteristics as a teacher like he's just an incredible teacher uh so how was the uh WGU experience because I always tell people like you know I'm a big fan of University and yes I can totally see people saying like oh University's overpriced blah blah blah and I age degree and that's why free Camp of course we're working on eventually having a free uh accredited University degree program that will take another 10 or 15 years to finish preparing sorry it's taking so long but it's a big big project but in the meantime pgu is is a good alternative to that and it's very inexpensive compared to not necessarily compared to Community College especially California Community College programs are very inexpensive and if you happen to live in California absolutely attend Community College it's one of like yeah the best educational experiences you can have in the United States but what was that like that's exactly the the point what I was going to make like listen uh I do agree that that universities are super expensive but you can definitely always start with Community College you will get service if not even better because essentially with in there they have time to work with you right so you just need to spend time on essentially looking for like maybe I I was doing quite a bit of research where essentially I was looking for you know not not the easiest for example chemistry teacher but the one that actually teaches the one that spends time with you instead of just like giving you the textbook and all that so I was definitely doing that and like Community College is an awesome way to actually see whether you that's for you to begin with and second it it just prepares you for the school and I was just really lucky that uh WG accepted all the credits uh but what was happening so that time I was already recording videos and essentially that the second second half year was like I wasn't I was kind of doing it half I would say half half time not like like parttime sorry part time yeah um and I want to talk about the mechanics of your success as a tutorial Creator course creator um you have nearly 200,000 subscribers on coding addict which is the name of your uh YouTube channel which has 786 videos uploaded uh you know they say Quantity has a quality all its own there there's quite a bit quite a bit of quality in that quantity I imagine and then of course many of your courses we've anthologized them and published them on free camps YouTube channel you also of course have udem me uh where you've got a lot of courses listed maybe maybe uh before we get I want to talk about the entrepreneurial aspect of this because you've essentially built a business around helping teach people how to code right so it was one of those things where effectively the moment I started recording videos like I mentioned there was those two benefits right so I can research the topic and then I can always get uh some info back but then also slowly but surely the there was like this bug just in your head where effectively the moment I learn something I just want to make a video and it's not again it's not about whether it's going to get 10,000 views or whatever it's just one of those things like listen I like I just learned it I just figure out like some kind of way some kind of like small app or some kind of small instance where that could be super useful let me make a video about it right so just so and then mentally in my head I'm like okay that's done I can kind of move on to a second thing and it was one of those things where it just like you produce one video second you do more research you do like you start working on your own projects you record more and it just kind of took off took off took off but it's one of those like unfortunate things where essentially it's like it's impossible to survive of the YouTube there's no like if you want to keep doing that then then then there needs to be some kind of Revenue like I mean in a perfect world I would just take everything and upload on YouTube and just call it a day but unfortunately that's not the case so I enjoy really teaching and recording videos but at the same time you do need to have some kind of stream of income so over the years I have kind of come up with the like at least in my my opinion like the best case scenario at least for me at this point where essentially I have like a large like I make a large course and make a large chunk of that for free and then effectively people enjoy the style if they enjoy the content if they you know are willing to support then they can you know pay some extra money uh and then effectively they can buy the entire course right but they they already have the good idea that whether they like it or not so it's not the case where you need to entally spend the money and be like okay I don't really like him I don't like his accent I don't like his style whatever so yeah that kind of has been um the my Approach but to tell honestly I'm not I'm not like Elon Musk you know type of like oh I'm just going to build this amazing business for me it's literally comes down to like I just enjoy uh kind of terminology or there's some type of like function that does something for me I think the biggest bug is to kind of how I can like like make an example out of this that makes sense not just okay everyone can read the docs and say like okay this function is doing such and such but okay what would be the perfect use case right what would be the perfect use case and the one that wouldn't require you like three hours of prepare or something like that so that to me has always been that's what drives me back right so when people say that whether there every job has some downsides and whatever right so for me sometimes it's it's recording right because it's just sometimes it's it's the actual recording process is I'm I'm not you know there's some challenges but as far as preparing the content is just like that's what makes me kind of like get up in the morning like super excited because I know that oh like nextjs came out with this new thing let's see like what we can do what we can build with that like what kind of like in which instances this is going to be super like helpful like let's say better than than the previous one so yeah that was kind of that that that's the idea and again I need to bring in free Cod camp and I was uh essentially this is what I did I produced the HTML and CSS course I put stuff for free on YouTube and I got an email from Bo who's running the free code camp and he's like are you okay with essentially like reposting this and and I was like yeah we we had a meeting and everything I'm like oh yeah sure sure sure everything go everything is awesome and we can do that and all that and yeah next thing we know he posted and that kind of took off the whole like you know making the content and then producing courses um yeah it it just that that one email and then the partnership kind of just just helped really well I just want to observe that like your business model is very transparent uh like hey if you like this multi hour segment of this course you want to buy the entire course how much are most of your courses I try I'm mostly at least 20 hours 20 hours and how much how much do they cost if you want to buy like a full course I I I so UD Deming has the specific policy of prices so it's one of those things where they uh they they run on this kind of sales thing right so everything's always it's it's one of those things where in some cases it's actually let's say it's interesting so let's say one day they can have it for like whatever I don't know $80 right but on the other day when they have the promotion as much as like bad rep you Demi gets at the same time for example they sell those courses for whatever $11 bought in a local currency yeah right so that's even like essentially uh what the students are telling that's even cheaper so it's not just like $10 let's say in in some in some other plac is going to be actually way more because if you transfer but they kind of see what $10 would mean in us and what that like means in some other country and then they make it actually the price very reasonable in my opinion purchasing price power oh God pricing power purchasing parody or something like that I can't remember what stands for but yeah it's one of those terms that like I I read it I understand it but I'm like I don't have enough courage to to pronounce but my my point is these are not like thousand to learn the code Type like you'll see these things you'll see people like my complete coding course it's only $1,000 and I I find people all these time uh on like uh Twitter like hey like uh what what do I do like I paid like I used my entire educational Budget on this one course from this guy who promised that I was going to learn everything I needed to know about coding right and like so a lot of people come to free C Camp we call them like refugees from other course platforms and things like that but I will say if you like I'm am not an absolutist like educa I I say education wants to be free but like I at the same time there are many many thoughtful teachers and creators who have kids to feed who want to you know be able to pay their mortgage and stuff like that you know paying 15 2050 $100 for a course is not a big deal if you have the money uh I I spent that much money on like you know learning how to play bass and stuff like buy a bass course or something like that uh I don't uh I think it's totally fine uh to to spend money on courses um you don't have to of course but if you want to John smga has amazing courses and I will say that he does not underd deliver a lot of people out there overpromise and under deliver and I can say with confidence that you've never done that because like you've already got this huge chunk of the course it's completely free made freely available both through your YouTube channel or through freeco camp.org and it's just like there there's this concept in economics called consumer surplus and what it is is like you create x amount of value and you capture you know y amount of value those are I'm not sure if I'm doing it justice like explaining it correctly but like Wikipedia would be an example of a site that creates a tremendous amount of value and captures a very small amount of it uh you know a software as a service you know sales uh you know database type program might capture something closer to like 50% of the value they ultimately create you're helping the customer increase their sales by 50% but you or by 100% but you're charging them you know 50% of that to use your platform or something like that right uh so like those are the extremes right like Wikipedia down here Craigslist maybe here and then like you know obviously free C Camp would be like way down there with Wikipedia in terms of people are just donating and things like that and most small independent course creator creers like you like coder coder Jessica Chan uh like West boss uh you know all these people like what they are charging for their courses is almost nothing compared to the value that you're going to get out of taking these courses and then going and selling your uh your labor on the open market for software Engineers right uh or or so much from John so uh I I just want to very quickly clarify that like there are a lot of things that keep me up late at night about education and the direction things are heading and things like that but like course creators on YouTube and on udem me and uh you know creating their own platforms and stuff you you got your own website uh which I think is so cool that your your name John smga JS and you happen to teach JS you teach JavaScript uh but it's it's just John smga.com coding addict because you're you're uh you're like Fab icon on john.com is like JS and it kind of you should like make it yellow yeah yellow black like the JS I never thought of that should have done that yeah so like maybe you could talk about what your life has been like since you started creating courses and teaching I mean at this point it's got to be millions of people that have gone through at least part of one your courses on free C Camp I'm sure it's millions of people uh and you probably have like analytics on like how many people according to UD to me I think you have like let's see on udem me it's it was like okay let's take a look students you've got 27,000 reviews those are people that bought the course took the course and took the time to leave a review about it that probably a positive review right that's a that's a pretty big impact that you've had over the past you know seven or eight years how long youve been creating courses I think I want to say well we moved I would like courses I believe 2017 18 something like that so about about like seven years probably and yeah I mean the ground you have covered we were talking about YouTube just a second ago more than 700 videos maybe you can talk about what your life has been like before and after you became a Creator because my understanding is your wife is able to focus on taking care of your kids fulltime and she does she work as a nurse at all anymore is she like parttime or no no no no no no so so luckily at the moment uh we can have a setup where she's a stayathome mom uh we have 5yearold and a 2yearold and uh we decided at least for now again everything is fluid so everything might change but since my oldest one technically she was born in August so it's uh she can actually she doesn't need to start the elementary school right now she can still technically wait a year um but we decided that regardless we're most likely going to go with homeschool that for now seems to be a good option my wife is super good at lot of teaching yeah she's like super into it I mean I mean she just sits and researches the math the reading and what are the options where where are the best books and what we can do and I don't know it just seems like uh it's also better for the girls because she was going for but that was the like um private kindergarten mhm and actually the little sister didn't like that if the older was gone and the bigger one also when she came back she was like she like basically she likes it better at home and then my wife can actually study with both of them so the little one sits there and also is like you know adding two plus two and stuff like that so we were able to do that just to add a little bit on those courses yeah the my kind of I always just naturally not because I like made some big commitment but I always like looked up to to free Cod camp and stuff and I made this decision where I'm not going to be like trying to sell something which is not true like I would never say in my course Hey listen finish this course and you'll get a job because I person know that there's no course in a world that can teach you that like instead you should be going and networking and doing all those things instead of like I would even say at this point kind of I I I don't want to maybe use this term but like coding it's not the hardest part right it's not easy it still takes time but it's actually in order to get a job and to get an industry there's tons of other things you need to do coding at this point there's so many courses that you if you stuck to it if you are not just buying 10,000 courses just for the sake of buying even though it feels great trust me I it feels great to buy a course I have lots of JiuJitsu courses and trust me it hasn't made me better but it's just that feeling when you buy it and and everything is great and actually you wait you learn way more in in the actual class but anyway that's a sign point but there is tons of these resources courses uh free code camp and and YouTube and everything if you like really like dedicate your time you can learn all of that for very small fraction of price but unfortunately since like communication is a kind of a like a strange Topic in a sense because some people are super good at it and for example I'm not right and it's one of those things where you tell somebody like they're asking like Hey listen which course I should take in order to get in industry and it's one of those things where like I say listen there's no course in the world that can do that for you because the first thing you need to do is get into your local community and start talking to the people who actually work there because they will tell you what you need to learn what are the what what is required actually in that part of the world where where you live and us when you say that you just see the people like come on like I was expecting something you know to to get some better answer but that honestly is the truth and that's why I never want to like kind of make something like give some false promises in the sense that uh you know get this and then everything is going to be fine the way I view the content Creation in general is something like listen if somebody spends some time to like like I mentioned before make this into into something use let's say there's there's some kind of feature and they spend their time on on on working on the example on feature or whatever that's something where I'm like yeah you know what I want to spend I want to support that person whether that's watching through the YouTube video or paying some money in order to to help them but at the same time I'll get some valuable info also right so that has always been my case and I kind of made decision that listen if it's not going to be sustainable well then I'll have to you know effectively just just you know do something else in a sense like you know just go just go back to work but I don't want to turn into this like hey you know NeverEnding sales pictures and stuff I it's just not for me I definitely know that and I'm not even going to try that there are so many people coming into the software development space and I always say like currently there are about maybe 30 million soft working professional software developers on Earth and that number is only going to go up like don't believe the hype that like AI is just going to like take care of everything you know uh I I get these questions all the time like software Engineers are still going to be involved you know in making important decisions about software and architecture and you know features design all these different things right like uh it it will be a very long time I don't think it will happen in our lifetime where like we just it's like the Jetson you just press button and then finished production level grade software just rolls out of the assembly line no I don't think that's going to happen I I think what's likely to happen is over the next 20 30 years more and more will be pushed to the software layer individual developers will become more productive maybe wages won't stay at their stratospheric levels that you have like I have developer friends who make $800,000 a year working as software developers they're not even managers right like I don't think that that's necessarily going to be what the future holds in terms of like it being this incredibly highly paid job but I do think it'll be a really good job it's going to be a job where you have like high quality life you're getting to do creative work you're to use you know Cutting Edge tools as they come out um and as a result if we're doubling the number of developers if there are 60 million developers on Earth by the time I die hopefully you know 100 years from now or something um then I think that that's so many people coming into the field that it can support a lot of teachers right and what's the worst thing that happens I mean you said yourself like oh I just got to go get a cushy software engineering job somewhere right with my incredible you know uh collection of skills that I built up teaching for over the past seven years right yeah it was just kind of in my case it was always like listen even the in the worst case scenario the fallback is not like it's it's not something that I would ever complain about my idea is that it's just as I was looking to you and reading like for example your story of how the commitment you made to free Cod Camp I just like knowing how I am in a sense where I'm not I'm like super bad in this like sales pctures and whatever I just made the commitment said listen if you know if everything is going well awesome if not then I'll just have to make you know you know certain choices which again is something that I was working towards anyway it's just you know I I didn't expect that teaching was something that I really enjoy that much uh but it's you know again we this is totally fluid situation and as far as like I wouldn't even say teaching and before teaching like biggest difference for us was the kids like you know it's it's it just changes everything and this is and this is the fact where it definitely the fact that I can still manage my schedule is just super helpful with the fact that I can like you know it's I've been able to be involved in in in my kids life and that just been it's one of those things where people say that and yeah and it sounds cheesy and whatever but it is the case where I have been you know able to teach my daughter how to ride a bike we're like you know I we go swimming together and stuff like that and those things are the ones that actually matter in in the long term right because I again we like it's one of those things i' I've been kind of a little bit obsessed lately that I'm thinking that we like of course we all do important things and but at the end of the day I don't know based on my experience what I'm seeing it's like work is super important but at the end of the day 20 years or 30 years from now like maybe we give it too much of a like kind of importance where essentially it's it's important at the moment in work I'm not saying not to work but there are things that actually like are far more important and that's that's been super awesome that I've been able to do kind re combine everything that's one of the reasons I'm so hyped about helping more people gain these skills is because I do firmly believe like I feel incredibly blessed to be able to basically hang out with my kids all day every day like they're a little older now they're six and eight and uh we we moved to Texas to a district that has like a really good School District that's public uh where I can walk my kids to school and we can live in the BBS and you know it's it's kind of like the the American dream of like the 50s or 60s right like we're here like pretty much everybody in our neighborhood is an immigrant from China or the Middle East or Africa like they all moved here because this is like this there's a good school here there's a high quality of life the level of affordability is great compared to California where I was living previously where you used to live now you're you're over in Florida right yeah we're in s sort yeah yeah so so that's really cool that you were able to move out there your wife doesn't need to work anymore my wife doesn't need to work anymore as an accountant uh again I feel very privileged to be in that circumstance where I can hang out with my kids and I genuinely believe more people can do this especially now that employers are kind of waking up to the fact that like oh you know people can work remotely they still get things done even if you're not standing over them with your arms crossed like making them punch in and you know or installing weird maybe maybe some companies install software to track like whether actually doing keystrokes and stuff but like obviously we don't use any of that stuff at fre Camp is like very uh lazy AFF ER so to speak um but I think this is how humans are supposed to be able to live not like dropping their kids off a daycare and coming home at like 6 p.m. and everybody's stressed out nobody's had enough sleep like I I don't feel like that that window of time was representative of what human experience is supposed to be like I mean if you look at The Agrarian period that basically eded industrialization people spend a ton of time with their kids right yeah it was one of those things that I do still remember from uh I believe even uh when I went into Community College for a history lesson one of the first things that we were we were discussing the ancient like like I think very very beginnings of the human human humans and essentially he asked like how like uh the collectors and gatherers or the hunters and gather hunters and gatherers like how much like how many hours do you think they worked like and everyone is like oh 8 n something they're like no like actual the idea is that they like worked few hours and they pretty much rested the entire day and and again it's not I fully understand that this is a luxury and everything and I and I definitely appreciate that but I'm just saying that for me it was never the case where uh like like putting all the time work at the very top I don't think it's it's it's particularly useful especially like you know 20 30 years from now I I really don't so it's it's always like it's just finding that good balance where I I enjoy my work don't get me wrong like I enjoy getting up and and working on stuff but there has to be a cut off where uh it's not you know it's not the primary thing and and just by improving your skills and improving your productivity through designing processes you know automating things you can get the same amount of work done in less time and that like like I still work you know 40 hours a week but I do so from the convenience of my own home and my office here at my standing desk where I'm recording this podcast interview like uh and I just automate a lot of stuff or I I rethink the process why is this taking so much time each week is there a better way you know and just gradually refining it and then I can move on and do more interesting work that's not solved so to speak solve work by the time it's automated it's essentially solved and other than basic maintenance should need to come back to it you can go do other things right like I didn't have time to do podcast interviews before cuz I was so busy uh working on other aspects of free Cod camp but as I've gradually had more time free up I can do things like this and I'm I'm super grateful for that I'm super grateful for the technology that enables this uh and that I'm super grateful to my past self who put in the time and energy to learn how to use these Technologies so that I could essentially free and I imagined that like I maybe I'll never need to retire maybe I'll just be able to keep finding new problems to work on and the work will remain fresh and interesting yeah I'm I'm very optimistic about that how do you feel feel about the future like you're you're still pretty young you're like slightly younger than me um you've got two young kids uh what is the next 20 years hold for you well that's actually a super good question because we are in the process I mean it's not going to happen tomorrow or whatever but uh we clearly made our mind that in like I would say two years Max simply because we just need to basically complete some things in here but in general we are moving back to to see parents more often because our parents are both getting old and we just decided that it's one of those things where we do want our kids to spend time more time with with with them and that's definitely going to be like very interesting because like we like we just enjoy Europe for some reason I don't know every time visit it's like my wife is just ecstatic about it so it's definitely going to be the case where essentially we're going to be moving yeah after that I don't know so it's it's one of those things where I'm just like looking at that and and and and it's def going to be the case where I I I do want to stick with homeschooling um my kids I just think that it's it's it's it's an awesome way to actually spend more time with my kid I realized that teaching teaching them math and and reading and and it's actually like super fun yeah right so it doesn't have to be this like hey you do this as I say instead you're just engaging with it you're trying to understand like what's the reason why you're not getting it what's the reason why you're looking everywhere else but the book and stuff like that so that that has been super exciting and um yeah just on homeschooling like you know your kids have two well educated parents who are multilingual Multicultural have all this lived experience to impart to them uh and so yeah like I think that's amazing you're able to spend so much time teaching them I taught my kids to read individually like we would just read every night uh before we got in the bath and stuff and uh yeah over the course of like a couple years they got pretty good at reading and it it's just you a little bit of incremental but it was so amazing it's such a an amazing process like if you have young kids I strongly encourage teaching them how to read yourself like you of course they're probably going to if they go to school they'll probably get some exposure to it too but like they can learn to read much faster than like the public school system is going to repair them to read right and it's just such an amazing like miraculous process of watching them sound things out and say all these weird things and like make common you know grammatical mistakes like irregular verbs and stuff like that and just watching it gradually get ironed out over time like I'll never forget the the process of my son being able to finally recognize that th e spelled the because it's such a weird you know word like uh or the or what it depends on where it is in the sentence right um and and just little things like that or or learning how to read the word bright like b r i g HT like how do you you know and watching him struggle with it and then explaining a regular you know you know or silent uh consonants and things like that and like yeah I love teaching and teaching my kids was just like it was an absolute highlight of my life so far um so I I just want to say like I think your kids are really lucky to have you teaching them and your your wife teaching them as well you said that you were planning to go back to Europe of course uh laia is a great place like I have a friend Islam maos who runs codzilla um and his his wife is Lan I believe and and so he's been living there for a long time he moved there actually the what's interesting tching is is booming laia for I'm not I'm not that familiar with the webd but as far as I know because uh my brother works as a well he's a software like he's a [ __ ] manager he's not coding himself but he works for a pretty big Bank in the region and essentially what he all the time keeps saying that there's like super big need for Java developers like like literally they they have like very very Progressive programs of how to get people actually into the tech so you like in United States I haven't seen that that often where essentially they literally can take someone from the street as long as they show interest they will teach them they will try to give them the ership yes it's going to be for very very low money in the beginning but they can get their foot in door and then they slowly move up because there's quite a big quite a few big companies that are actually internationally recognized and also there's quite a quite a few gaming companies so that's one of those interesting things where as far as texing in laa it's again things are fluid but at the moment they're they're actually it's kind of booming and everything so yeah yeah I just don't know about the web that much yeah well that sounds really cool um one country that obviously is not having quite a nice time that your wife is from Ukraine which has been you know illegally and uh you're not going to get any sympathy like I I very much am on a side and that side is Ukraine here in this conflict and of course your wife being from Ukraine uh on your your Twitter profile you you have the Ukrainian flag you say we stand with Ukraine what's the how how is your wife's family doing back there are they okay it's I mean it's one of those things where essentially you I mean how long the war has been going on already right so two two years right and uh it's it's it's like you're more or less like normalizing this but in general it's yeah it's it's it's one of those things where it's even hard to explain her her brother was in the war he was he went to serve he got essentially he was wounded so he he was able to come back home but it's the the things that you see the things that he like you know is told us and everything it's just it's one of those things where you think that we're living in 21st century and this is you know how this is even possible it's it's it's mindboggling and uh it's super super rough in a sense like I mean there's so many aspects of that are s like are just tragic about it when you just walk like I don't know five miles with with all all your belongings and two small kids across the field just to get out and things like that and I'm not even talking about like you know the the horrors of the war and everything or the Rockets flying and all that it's just it's been one of those things where like I really like tick off uh like basically every time like even think about it and all that and it's just it's just sad that there's not enough like kind of help to to just to just kind of get rid of this and um for me I always like I I find it interesting where I do see that people in like a lot of people in Western countries they don't know what it's like to live right next to Russia and that whole like you know mentality there's always these excuses well only if the NATO wouldn't be expanding and all that stuff where essentially the only NATO is the only thing that keeps us safe for now technically in ltia because otherwise every time you're seeing this like those things happen that are not NATO countries so uh this kind of mentality like I was like even mentioned before a little bit where like when we grew up and and we still do in lvia that that let's say the the fact that there any moment the war can break out is real it's not some like that you know you know family history like for example my granddad had to immigrate to United States so during the world war war I essentially the country was split up and he just called in he basically the the German soldiers came to his house and said listen either we kill you right now or you go and he was basically digging the trenches or whatever right as the front was moving back after the war he he was you know obviously he went through the process of like you know check whether he was he was not in the Army and all that stuff he passed all that and but he could never go back to for example ltia so it was one of those things where you know those stories are real it's not just made up so you know everything like how how the world works and yeah for us it it was like in lvia everybody you talked to it they were all like everyone around that like those Soviet countries and whatever we know what it's like we know what it what it means like freed by Russians right that it just means simply genocide that's it you know so it was it's been one of those cases where yeah we're we're like trying to help as much as possible like people back in Ukraine and and the the the families who have migrated over here and and just just looking for options like what we can do and all that but yeah it's it's one of those things where I can just it's hard to kind of explain the in in nutshell like everything that that we're going through what we're thinking and and and like you know how how we feel about it so yeah I my friend Sergey uh who runs crow in which is a localization tool we have a crowding course on Freo camp that we recently published Top by espania uh excellent tool if you want to localize your website into different languages and you want to use human translation instead of just using Google translat or something uh of course they're a Ukrainian company and uh so he's running this entire Tech startup basically out of a war zone uh and I sent I you know when when the war broke out like a couple years ago I sent him a message I was like man are you okay like is everything going right and he just sent me back this Meme and it was like this meme of like the the the headache and it was like like migraine it's like uh tension headache and then like the whole head is red and it said living next to Russia yeah I mean like listen there's there's many Russians who are very like like you know Forward Thinking and whatever but there's many who are stuck in this idea that like essentially like like like it or not they don't think like of us like the smaller countries as basically that we even are allowed to exist either we are like part of their like Stratosphere or we don't exist and that is kind of like like okay but where do we go from here like what what is the solution and and that's why I've been like yeah super like kind of big on that the fact that listen the only way how you can get peace is essentially just expelling them from there because no other like all the time saying that we just need to appease them in some kind of way I don't see how that is happening because when we're when we're looking from that perspective that we just need to give them something you're looking from the perspective of the west where essentially no one would even start that war to begin with where yes there's like logical sense okay let let's let's agree on something right but that's not how you like in that part of the world that's not not how you think that's not how you use things you're you know there's people who are live who are willing to live of nothing as long as they are country is on that Big Shiny hill whatever that Hill is you know and you're not going to change them by just oh like okay let's give them this territory or that territory and it doesn't like work that way unfortunately yeah their world view is just that like you know it's tied up in some weird like uh I've seen kind of the maps that Putin points to when he tries to justify that like these parts were part of historical Russia or whatever ever and it's like the map is constantly it's just like China with their territory disputes like oh at one point this was part of China too and like you know I'm I'm sure like every country to an extent is probably guilty of like trying to grab a little extra property you know from their neighbors and stuff many wars have been fought over just tiny territorial disputes and stuff but but yeah like to the credit of a lot of Russians that write me every week like how can I get out of Russia I don't want to live here anymore like I I talk to people we we've got a refugee from Russia and plenty of refugees from Ukraine living in my neighborhood going to school with my kids right and and it's just like it sounds like it's just a really big catastrophe to be born in that part of the world in this Century like there there just so much additional headache so much additional stress like why is this happening in 2024 between two countries that are you know relatively prosperous certainly compared to Any Nation in like the 19th century or the 18th century or any anything before that right like Ukraine uh it's basically the Bread Basket of Europe and Russia has more like minerals than like and they have like all this land I don't know it's like wild to me why is there this conflict why can't they work it out but then you look at somebody like Putin and you see that he's just craving and he'll never stop well that that why that's why it was so super funny for me where like Tucker Carlson goes over there and he's like he's trying to make this point essentially what he has been singing right so it was all because of a NATO and blah blah blah blah blah and yet in that interview for half an hour or whatever long he was he goes back to whatever 12th century and you're like real so you want to justify this at the end of the day like so you are even giving him the platform to speak pre Colonial period and he keeps going back to to whatever it that right and that's one of those things where it's it's super interesting to me that like for example in United States I never saw that for for like let me give you just an example right so there was an Iraq war first of all many people were against it and now look at the situation here it's actually a topic which is discussed where people say Hey listen we don't want to get involved let's say with our soldiers we don't want to go and spread democracy or whatever so so my point being here there is a like the like people are talking about it they're discussing it and they're saying listen this was wrong we we shouldn't have done that or whatever but we will move on but what people don't like because for some weird reasons a lot of times like Americans compare themselves to like that like they say yeah but look at us we also yeah there there are some clear issues but the difference is in democracy those those things are discussed it's not like right now let's say England is saying Hey listen um United States you like you used to be our Colony right yeah why don't we make that again right there's actually both countries are working together they moved on that's it absolutely like everybody's just kind Germany and France yeah I mean like years later and like or it's not even that long right like people are people are like and uh they've kind of like acknowledged the sins of the father so to speak and and they've they've moved on and uh yeah obviously that needs to happen with the Baltic states right like that that needs to happen over in Eastern Europe too again I apologize I I'm not an expert in any of these things but just intuitively as like I guess a person who has a right to talk and represent America on this very limited podcast I I I think it's ridiculous that any American would support Russia in this very obvious very illegal very flagrant uh you know land grab frankly no well it's just it's just like an easy kind of excuse like listen this is basically to blame NATO for it but like I think a lot of this what's missed out on the conversation that all of those countries for the same reason because they know what it's like to live right next to it they were like we in lvia we like waited for that day we cheered for that it wasn't like we were like arms around our back and we were like okay okay America says that we need to join NATO it it was never the case we made so many changes and like increased our military budget and all that for a simple and even now we're like living there and there's a like clear fear that this might happen that you will need to make that decision as you were growing up you were told that listen at some point maybe one day you will have to make this decision and that when the war started that was definitely the case where you're like okay this is happening in my lifetime which I never thought that that would be the case I mean war is just like one of those things that I hope we're not having Wars in space hundred of years from now uh I've Got Friends in Korea who have to like basically put their entire life on hold for two years and serve in the military just because North Korea just a brutal dictator who doesn't care about anybody but himself just like Putin basically who he has like 50,000 people that are like dedicated to basically keeping him alive keeping him from getting assassinated keeping him from losing power because he's just like this crazy megal manical you know again I'm not a psychologist but he seems like an incredibly greedy selfish person who uh just wants more even if it means taking from people who need it much worse than he does you know um and and same thing with like North Korea and what's the result like the US has to spend this huge amount of money on military to keep people like Putin from you know pulling stunts right uh and those are not the only countries that are like this but those are two very obvious examples of like just the fact that those people exist in the world and that they're so belligerent forces everybody else all the other kind people have to like keep their guard up and they have to you know adapt to life like if you're in South Korea you just have to accept that if you're in Soul there's a small likelihood that today's going to be the day that they fire all the missiles and completely level the city and kill everybody in it because yeah they do have those missiles and they are pointed at Soul yeah that's it's PR scary when when I was listening that essentially that whatever calculations they did as far as like even in the best case scenario there's millions of just like people dying simply when the war broke even without the nuclear and as far as the North Korea and South Korea and that just to me is like mindboggling that the fact that you know that's the case so um yeah yeah we this is one of those topics where it was just definitely like you know it's like there were a few days when it was like super hard even to to to sit down and do anything you know you're just like you were totally like shocked and everything about the whole situation yeah I mean like if you don't want me asking like we could talk about this for a long time and obviously affecting you and your your wife and her her family you you've always kind of it's always just been there and like Americans we take for granted we got this giant Pacific Ocean on one side we got this giant Atlantic Ocean on this side the worst thing that ever happened to us was Pearl Harbor or 911 which are just like dropping the bucket like no disrespect or like I'm not trying to dismiss the all the Vets out there or all the people who suffered but like that that is like such a a small uh loss of life compared to you know what happened in France during World War II or obviously what happened to the entire Jewish diaspora during World War II or what happened to you know like you know Russia uh sent soldiers often without like you know proper gear like they just basically that's how you know that war was won was Russia just sacrific of their citizens their their young men went and died and over kind of brute forced the war right and if you grew up in Russia during that period so so again I don't want you to think I'm like antirussia or anything I'm very much antiputin but I realize that the people who are suffering also include many Russians over there uh and people who live in the former Soviet block uh who are basically been you know under the Spectre so again I I hope nobody in the audience takes issue with me talking about these things uh I'm just like profoundly antiwar but at the same time I realized that you have to have NATO you have to have a defense mechanism everybody has to have nukes because Russia has nukes and China has nukes right the US can't just decommission all their nukes because then we don't like this is just how things work unfortunately and it's sad that's that's well what is the like plan with uh your wife's family cuz you said you want to move back to Europe and be be close to your family what would that look like with the current situation in Ukraine well so we definitely we would be going back to Lava simply because uh we just have everything is more set up there like quite a few friends that we had in Chicago are actually living there so there was uh Chicago is actually one of the biggest laan diasporas in in United States again it's tiny number but compared to like for us it's like a big deal yeah for example like the Polish diaspora and in Chicago is just massive essentially you can go there as a Polish never learn language and you'll do very good actually you know there there's situations where you don't like you can do everything whether that's buying a car apartment finding job or whatever as long as you speak Polish you're good to go Lan's not so much so it's a smaller diaspora but still it's it's pretty huge for United States and essentially quite a few of our friends who we spend time together in Chicago they live in laia right now they live in this awesome city called siga and so so that's one of the things that we have been thinking about like essentially just just moving back there and see where it goes and then her family can can can just basically visit us as much as as they can because coming to United States is is as far as the trip it's it's not something you want to do on like let's say yearly basis in my opinion it's a big trip and also like immigration uh is not trivial I'm not sure it like we would your wife's family be able to come to the US readily or how hard is it for them to visit no I think as far as far as we checked it's super it would be pretty long process yeah so I I think it's easy like if let's say to come here temporarily for like three months or whatever but other than that no it's it's you need to jump through like big amount of Hoops in order to accomplish that and uh um yeah so we're the plan is essentially ltia and uh um to kind of go from there yeah and so one of the great things is that you can work remotely and that you could probably continue to create courses from lva uh so is is that the game plan then over the next 20 years like are you planning to keep a presence in the US like get a house in Florida and then just travel back and forth or what are you planning to do most likely no uh I don't think we're going to be keeping the house over here again things might change this is just you know this is initially where we we we kind of we stand right now but effectively we're I think I mentioned you before that like it's one of those things where me and my wife we have so accustomed to moving from place to place I think in Chicago we moved for like nine places while we were there and then you know coming going to California we moved uh from Sacramento then we were in LA and now we moved to here to Florida and it's one of those things where at this point we're so accustomed to moving that when I said say that yeah we're going to move it doesn't mean that we're going to stay there forever it's going to be most likely one of those things where we're going to go there we'll live there for a little bit and then we're like okay now it's time to go somewhere else it's it's just some one of those things that's like a bug where the moment we get comfortable with the place we're like okay it's time to it's time for a new challenge and and we'll go from there as far as teaching yeah definitely that's something that I'm super stoked about and and really enjoy doing and everything and um yeah just just especially the part of like preparing that code like coming up with those examples and all that so that's that's been I'm super excited about that well John uh I am super grateful that you didn't just stay in construction and uh that you branched out learned new skills went back to school uh that you decided to start recording videos about the things you were learning that you had that teaching bug that bit you so to speak and that you've shared so much wisdom so much insight over the past seven years uh may this just be the very beginning of a long career of teaching for you and I just want to thank you again for sharing so much of your wisdom your developer insights on the fre C Camp Community YouTube channel I want to thank you again for just being a chill human being who makes his courses like very reasonably priced and makes a huge chunk of those courses freely available to the developer community and uh I mean it sounds like your kids are very lucky to have you as a dad and
