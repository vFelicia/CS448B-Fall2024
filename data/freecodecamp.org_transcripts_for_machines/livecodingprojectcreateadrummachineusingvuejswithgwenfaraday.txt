hi everyone welcome to another live stream um if you don't know me my name is gwen and i run another youtube channel called faraday academy where i do programming tutorials and live streams mostly mostly python and vue.js javascript topics so today is a continuation of building the free code camp projects live in vue.js so last week i did the markdown previewer and this week i'm going to go to the drum machine let me just zoom in here so these should be linked in the description below and you can go to my github which is at gwen f and this is called free code camp projects view and then i have each project in its own folder with a readme yeah so for today i'm going to be starting a view app with the vcli using incline which is a view ui framework for styling and design components that kind of thing and this is basically the um mockup for the drum machine now i did find sounds for this already just because i didn't want to be scrounging for sounds here so i came up with these sounds that i edited myself but they're in the wrong format and won't play in the browser for some reason so i ended up getting some random sounds in this clip.js file here so they won't sound exactly like a drum so it's going to be more like a sound machine than a drum machine yeah that's a horse so if anyone has better sounds uh let me know but these were the easiest they're just mp3 files from sound bible which sound bible has all these um free sounds sometimes you have to give attribution and sometimes their public domain so it depends which sound just one second i'm gonna pull up the chat real quick and and okay good let me see who's here if you're here go ahead and say hi and feel free to give me comments or recommendations as i'm going along with the live stream this will be interesting because i generally don't work with sound in the browser when building applications but there's also a couple other applications i want to build with sound in the future like a music app so uh hopefully uh hey tech stats hi sassy uh yeah thanks for joining me feel free to um chime in as i'm programming today all right so yeah there's a couple other sound apps i want to build in the future so this should be a good project to i guess lean on later so first thing let me start here so first thing i need to create a view app so i already have the view cli installed so i'm going to do view create and let's call this drum machine i guess it's in a folder called drum machine so maybe i'll just call this drum app all right and it should give me my options yeah so let's see do i want anything let me just go into manual um do i want progressive web app support that's easy to add later i don't need routing it's just going to be one page this time view x don't think so do i want sass um i think i'll be okay without sass let me put it in just in case and i'm not gonna do testing so i'll use regular dart sass eslint i'm going to do just the basic island seems to go better in live streams when it's not giving me errors all the time lint on save yeah that's good and then i want dedicated config files save the preset no all right so that's installing what's the difference between sass and dart sass they're both implementations of sass i think dart sass is the most popular and i want to say it's the fastest but i'm not sure anymore um i think it's just what most people use like there was i guess ruby sass and a couple other projects sas built in different ways but it's the same implementation the only i guess the only two different types of sas are indented syntax and the scss style and those and you can use either of those styles with any of the implementations um all right should be done in a minute okay it's installing booking generators from the plugins that i installed which is just sas oh i guess i did babble too which is just one of the default ones i just launched to if you're interested in view cli plugins i just created a video on my channel faraday academy where i show how to create plugins and kind of how they work under the hood um it was pretty interesting for me to learn about so maybe you'd enjoy it too all right so now let's see now i have oh wow so drum machine i thought i was inside of drum machine already so drum app i'm going to move drum app inside of the drum machine folder now so let's see because all the other apps are inside of their their folders for that app so move drum machine to no move drum app to drum machine okay so now yeah i only have the three folders one for each project and now if i uh cd into drum machine cool i see drum app so let me open this in the code editor then go in here and then i'll also go ahead and cd into um drum app and then i'm going to start my view server so npm run server all right and that always takes a minute to build and let me put my browser in the middle all right so now that's building and actually first i'm going to install the incline library and probably the best way to do that is through the cli install so i'll just add this real quick so then i'm gonna have to rerun uh uncommitted changes yeah that's fine okay so that should only take a second to install and set it up for me what's nice about using the vue cli plugins is that they set up all the configuration so i can just start using the components without setting anything else up okay so first thing i'm going to do is set up the grid so let me go to the drum machine mockup so it's a pretty simple mockup i just want basically this box to be centered and then i want a panel on top that i guess has some controls like you can turn it off and on there's some volume in the name of the sound that's being played which i just gave them names and objects so that have a name and then each one of these panels or buttons or whatever they're going to be um when you click on it it'll make that sound um okay successfully invoked okay so now incline is installed i don't think i need to install anything else right now so i'm just going to do npm run serve to start the development server and then i'll be able to see my app localhost 8080. okay and in my source directory i want these clips this clips.js file so i'm just going to drag that in here let's see yeah i'll just put it in the root for now um all right let me see and my server's not running let's see module build failed compound selectors may no longer be extended hmm okay so this is an incline problem i already have an error but where is this coming from um it's coming from the actual incline components so in the node modules i don't know if there's anything i can do about it except maybe downgrade my version of incline balsamic so let me see balsamic balsamic mockups is i think it's a super easy tool for developers people who aren't professional designers to just quickly make mockups they have an online version now um but i have the desktop app because i like it a little bit better but they both work i think the online one's a subscription model okay so root style sheet consider extend to yeah so this is a problem inside of the incline library let me go to their github page and look at their issues and see what people are doing i'm sure someone else has had that issue because that's literally the first thing i did when i set up the app i wonder let's see yeah let me copy this component selectors may no longer be extended okay so this is a recent issue yeah it seems like it's the same thing that i'm having this shouldn't be happening on a clean installation which version of node sas okay so what i might do actually is all right so let me see read me saurus public okay um let me see so it's setting up incline importing incline components registering them so what i might do is i could just uninstall incline and then get rid of the plugin and then manually add it because what might be causing the error is let's see let me go back to getting started is that i gave it this customizable flag oh let's see and its dependencies have been added to your package.json node sas and sas loader let me just check the versions of those real quick let's see um sass loader and node sas okay and then yeah i have incline and of course the plugin that installed incline so it's a sas problem okay so i wonder if i restart all of this and i'm going to try this out again later to see if i should open a bug or a new issue with this uh because i literally didn't do anything after i set this app up so it shouldn't be giving me an error already okay so if shaking let me look at the getting started i wonder if i just do this instead if i'm not importing certain components or passing in any options what that's going to do it's rebuilding nope it's still doing it so yeah it's a sass problem so i wonder if i should be using ink line i just used this in the last project and it worked totally fine so all right so i guess i'm going to be using a different framework um let me try um view bootstrap that should work and we can start all over again read this solution in a github issue you mean on incline i think i went i didn't see any of the issues that had to do with mine it was just that one closed issue where there was no solution oh if you tried to post a link i don't think free code camp is letting you post a link so i can't see it um can you just tell give me the issue number and okay and point node sas from the webpack like this conses equals require node sas let me see let me look at the issue customizing not working um okay let me see is issue 170 oh this is a next though getting a compile error module whoops module build failed bug report okay yeah this is what i have okay yeah this is the same issue though so i don't know which one it's which issue unless you give me an issue number i had to remove sas default dart sas to point at node sas um let's see transpiling dependencies i could point it i don't know do i want to do this i kind of want to start just building the drum app i think for this um i can change it later but i think right now i'm just going to use bootstrap view until i figure out what's wrong with incline and i don't believe i believe this is just an npm install let's see yeah so it's it's not recommending me to you are using okay so i have to install bootstrap view and bootstrap okay icons plugin all right so let me just install this real quick and this will just i just need a basic grid system and some styling that's it okay um that's installing so there's no plugin i just have to set it up in my view file in my main view file where i render from so main.js and i'll put it in here okay and then i guess i'll just get rid of these and i could uninstall incline from here and install incline and the plugin okay cool that installed just fine so i'm gonna do an npm uninstall the plugin and uh let's see ink line view is imported twice now i might have done that yeah okay thank you and actually i'm gonna change the order of those imports all right and now okay so import bootstrap view and then just view dot use okay let me do bootstrap view and then if i want icons later i'll do that okay and now i'll do npm run serve and i think so incline's a pretty lightweight um library so i don't think it gave me extra setup like some of the larger ui libraries did yeah i don't see its own folder or anything here so i think i got rid of it yeah it doesn't even change the setup in the app.view file okay icon's plugin is defined but never used yeah all right so um i'll just add it okay so that built okay cool it's working now and i guess i'll just be using the view bootstrap system um okay so components actually i think grid yeah layout and grid system so it's basically all prefixed from b container b row and just by i think this gives me all the components like i don't have to individually import and register components because i just registered the whole library so let me try out i'll just start programming in my main file my main app.view file and then i'm going to break up components as i need them break things up into components let me get rid of all this styling too okay so first thing i'm going to do is a v container to start off my grid system and then uh oh wait it's b i'm getting all these uh libraries confused so for bootstrap it's b and b okay and then it will be b row inside and then b column i think it's just call yeah be call okay and then here is where i can put it in the middle of the page so let me put something in here first just some text okay drum and now from here i can give it the regular classes so or maybe there are props here let me look in columns yeah so i'll pass it in as a prop instead of as a class so i'll do column for so this will just be for all screen sizes so six six columns wide and then how do i do offset okay offset equals so i think i can just do offset equals three all right so that didn't work um so first let me see if there's an error here uh type checked for prop call expected boolean got string with value of six um oh i think it's calls isn't it i think it is calls let me see yeah calls so here calls okay so that didn't give me an error but it's still let me just see if i inspect this let me inspect the text okay so row container class of column six and i wonder why they have examples they don't really have oh they do okay um let's see yeah this one says calls eight so i should be able to do that let's see i have b column so b call b call and then calls of six and then oh my offset is wrong ah yeah thank you that's so strong okay it's still not working um so let's see offset why wouldn't offset be working did i have an example with offset they do have auto so i think that centers it and alignment i guess that's flexbox so you can use flexbox let's see all right so offset let me just try to do um instead of just general calls let me try to do a small and then i can do offset hyphen small see if that works that's weird recall medium offset medium i'm closing the column uh all right so let me put content in here and see if i just if something else is going to change it i guess because that's weird yeah i'm doing it exactly like the examples say let me even copy paste the example and let me do another row so all right oh wait i wanted to put a row in here so b row and then let's see maybe the css is not being loaded correctly yeah that's true because it's not working at all does it say because i didn't think it said i thought um let's see oh it does say to add imports so add import bootstrap view okay so let me put this in the main.js file and that should fix it ah okay all right that was a lot of time spent on that thanks for the help okay let me get rid of that extra row then okay and yeah oh man i guess i've like i'm so used to setting it up um setting up component libraries just by using a plugin so i do view add and then it sets it up for me so i forgot i can't believe i forgot to check for the css um all right so now finally i have the drum machine so this is actually going to be two cards so the top card and the bottom card with the um sound buttons oops with the sound buttons or whatever these are inside so let me look for cards here okay cards so just a basic card and then i guess i can nest inside the cards with text or just put components directly inside all right so let me just start off with the basic card so b card and then close it and then oh yeah second one so now i have two and let's see let me start to put the controls inside so actually i put volume in the mockup here but i have no idea how to do sound volume in the browser so yeah i'll have to figure that out um power should be easy just make it work or not work and then the sound name should be easy so let me uh let's see so let me do what do you call those things switches switch style uh check box um yeah that looks okay i don't know why it's so small oh that goes into other so here are just the switches this okay so i can put a prop large i'm definitely going to put a prop large on that so it's just a prop that denotes it as a switch so it's a regular checkbox and then you pass it a switch prop and it makes it a switch okay so oh cool and then it'll just give me the label so i guess i'll put the label to the right that's fine um i'm not really picky about that so a lot a large switch and i'll call it the power switch so let's see cool so that switches on and off all right um now what was the next one oh a slider for volume so let me try to find a slider do i call it a slider um it's not a carousel i mean it would be in forms somewhere maybe if i scroll does anyone know what that's called which is all right maybe i mean view bootstrap might just not have that so how else would you control volume just up and down i guess we could skip the volume for now and then if we needed it we could add in another library that has a slider on it that wouldn't be a big deal yeah it seems like it doesn't have it unless it's in one of these other um ones rating is stars right yeah it's kind of cool um time picker input group check box bar spinner yeah i don't see one here oh well oh is it called range oh range type input okay oh they do have one cool all right is this the only example they have oh with different step values okay yeah the basic one is is good so basically it's a b form input and then give it a type of range all right okay i'll just put it after the power and see how that looks so id range um i don't even think i'll need an id here um v model i'm gonna have to set up the v models min max that's fine okay so let me see all right that looks okay um i wonder now should i put the volume i guess i could put the volume yeah make it a lot smaller and put it next to sound because you really don't need the whole width for volume unless i put volume at the bottom and put power and the sound title here and then put volume below it um let's see also if i pass in if i pass something into the form input component um that probably won't be a label yeah because it's not like a checkbox so let me try to i'll make that selfclosing and maybe i can pass in a label which is volume okay nope doesn't take label so it doesn't have a list of props here no range inputs return their value as a string you may need to convert the value yeah does not include styling for range inputs inside input groups however bootstrap u includes custom styling to handle these situations until styling is included in bootstrap okay so bootstrap 5 just came out so i'm guessing bootstrap 5 has styling for this i think maybe it's still in alpha i'm not sure anyway uh let me add the box here to show the name first and then i'll figure out what i'm gonna do with the volume where i'm gonna put it i guess i saw a library on github vue bootstrap slider yeah i thought some people called it slider i feel like i've used it as a slider before or maybe it's like the whole dialogue modal thing everyone's starting to call it a dialogue and we seem to be losing the name modal to standardize it um okay b form input uh and then i guess so i guess i'll be putting rows and columns inside of this card so if i do a b row here and close the b row and then let me put a check box or not a check box let me put the name box inside this row and then um let's see also this is this is quite zoomed in if i zoom out a little bit it's more accurate so let me put uh i don't know a div do they have paper i'm not sure if they have um paper so what do i do if i want this with like a just a regular box like an outline box without using another card element so in beautify they have something called paper and i'm not sure i guess i can just style it myself that might be the easiest thing to do okay i'm just gonna style it just make a box a regular div and i'm gonna call it class equals name box search for border so borders are the classes they have right for borders um sidebar styling borders border border yeah these are utility classes for borders so border right border danger those ones okay so i can still make my own div here and might not have to do a custom class because then i can just use their utility classes for spacing too um so what is this let me let me just put a placeholder here sound name and here let's see let me get out of components so where are their utility classes let me search bootstrap for utility classes okay so this shows these are utility classes from for spacing um inside the layout grid system okay so where would the maybe these utility classes yeah border utilities okay it takes me to the actual bootstrap so okay so i guess i just use the these classes from bootstrap um so i can do border and then i don't think i want border danger or anything okay cool it gave me a border and now i can add some margin or padding classes so let me do padding all now let me do padding let's see on the x axis of four boost strap has a funky way of calculating padding and margin that isn't just multiplying so i think four is something like 16 pixels or close to it maybe and then this should be something around six or eight pixels okay i think that looks pretty good for a box but it's not at all aligned here so what i could do is add some i guess css or um what do i call that flexbox classes inside the row um so let me see let me add a class of and actually this row i don't know if the rows default to display flex already let me see let me look inside row yeah it's already defaulting to display flex yeah thanks so i don't need to put display flex in here so i can i think i can just use flex um elements now so i could do um what is it justify um justify content oh it's giving me all of them cool uh justify content space between is the one i want so let me start typing justify content space between and oh it gave me an underscore did he start with underscores why did i do that i don't know if i did that okay so it said the row already has display flex but maybe it doesn't let me try if that makes a difference no so uh let me get rid of that okay um so does anyone know why this isn't pushing let me look in the dev tools and see okay so in the div okay so here display flex flex wrap and it's not justified content so the class isn't correct then so let me go into the bootstrap flex classes oh i guess this would be in the utility classes as well so let me look in regular bootstrap for flex utilities um so where is it justify content there and justify content okay so it's just justify content between so oh i put space between okay sweet okay that works um all right that's pretty good now i do want to add some margin to the row just in general and also to the card because it's pushed up against everything else so i'm going to add some um oh wait i think i have to put it inside a class so margin all or margin top of four let's see okay that's good that pushes the top card down and um let's see i'd also want a margin i guess for each card i'll just add a margin top margin top class equals margin top of four okay that looks pretty good and i don't want these to be so close to the edges so let me add a margin let's see i guess to the row here so i can add a margin more uh margin on the xaxis of two okay that looks much better all right so i have the sound name i have the power bar and then i like volume being below that was too many things squished into one row but i need some kind of a title for it um let me put it in its own row first so it matches the rest of the content so b row b row okay and now i have the input so i guess i will want an id actually if i'm going to give it a label so the id will just be volume i guess oops volume and then label for volume okay and then um yeah just volume inside the label all right and then i wanted to give this the same kind of margin spacing that i gave to the top row so i'll add class equals m x of 2 and then i want some margin top between the top row as well so let me see how that looks actually i want more margin between the top row okay cool i think that looks pretty good what do you think and yeah and now i need the buttons in the bottom card so let me see b row b card okay so in this card i want to do did i get rid of my class here i thought i had a class of margin i guess i got rid of it at some point margin top of four and now i want to have basically square boxes that are displayed i'm going to be looping through them too so i'm going to want some kind of flex wrap so that i can loop through them all so let's see yeah thanks um so it's basically like the first hour trying to get the styling set up in the second hour actually doing the vjs work um okay so let me just i guess just create squares right there's no like actual square class somewhere um eventually it would be cool to have one icon in each button but uh should they be buttons i guess they should be buttons even though they're square not rectangle i think it would make sense so i'm guessing it's b btn maybe let's see where are the buttons it's been a while since i used bootstrap i think it has i don't remember the last time i did oh by the way one thing i found the other day someone sent me i think is boot swatch it was they have all these free themes for bootstrap and there are also components and other things which i thought was pretty cool that you can just use any of these things to make bootstrap look a lot nicer uh yeah maybe if i make this drum app look nice i might use one alright so here's a button okay so it's spelled out b button and then i can give it a variant if i want i'll probably have outlined buttons maybe um so it's b button and then um let me just close it for now and then i'll put sound or x or i don't know let's see let's see how that looks okay okay that's actually square so we're kind of square anyway now let me make that bigger maybe if i just add enough padding that will come out to be a big square button so class equals although if i had a div i would just set the size of it instead of the padding so padding all four um does it like that did i yeah i gave it the correct padding you know what i don't think button is the is the right thing for this i think i'm going to use a div div and then i'll just put an x inside because that way it's not dependent on what's inside of it for spacing versus just padding a button so let me do class equals padding oh i guess i'm padding this too i'm going to just set the side is the size of these so let's do class um sound sound button i don't know okay so sound button and now in my style tag i can style sound button and padding all okay bootstrap does p4 all right thanks um so i'm gonna do width of 50 pixels height is 50 pixels because i want to set absolute heights and widths on these okay so i can tell it got bigger just by why isn't it yeah that's 50 by 50. so this is actually going to have to be like 200 by 200. um 50 is not very big 200 pixels oh did i get rid of pixels okay so 200 by 200 and then i'm gonna need to make the parent here so um this should already be oh no this is inside a card so what i'm going to do now is do a b row because i want to wrap all the buttons so i can loop through them and then i think b row has not just flex display flex set but i think it has um flex that row wrap so it'll just wrap the containers around all right so inside of the row and now i'll do i'm still gonna want i guess justify content center okay and then let me start looping through something here to display these buttons so let me import clips into this file so let me import because i'm exporting this array of objects from clips so it's not json or anything so i can just import that array so clips from clips and then let's see clips let me put it on data here so let's make a data function turn the object and do the clips array so now there should be nine clips in that file if i counted correctly so now i can inside this sound button i can let me put it on a few rows i can do v4 equals clip in clips and then the key i'm just going to use clip dot name which all of them are unique so because i already know that cool so it's a little bit off but it's displaying nine of them let me make these uh a little bit smaller so let me try 160 160. okay i think that's okay if i center them and spread them out a little bit and now let me add a border so i can actually see where they are so class i'm going to add a border here cool i think that's actually pretty good uh i don't like that i can't scroll down past this let me just uh instead of margin uh just top i'm gonna replace that with the yaxis so now i can scroll down a little bit past the bottom okay so um let's see what do i want to do these should be a little bit spaced and the x needs to be centered vertically and horizontally which i can do with flexbox and let me space these out just a little bit so on the cards i can do margin of 1. okay all right that looks good and now for the border actually let me do border of oh can i do any color fuchsia does that work no i think it has to be one of those standard colors like warning or something yeah now the border changed okay i'm gonna leave it like that um i think it looks pretty good um oh yeah one more thing is that the border uh that these cards have a border radius but the things that i built do not so let me see what the border radius on these are border um hmm am i on the right one let's see computed yeah it should be here border left border yeah here it is four pixels okay so border top left radius 4 pixels so they just set them individually okay so i want these cards to have 4 pixel radius because it seems like everything else does and i'll put it here too so i think they have a utility class for um border radiuses let's see here we go um rounded okay add border classes so i guess rounded would be i don't i feel like these sizes should be standard and they don't say what the sizes are anywhere let me see what this actually means so if i look at oh that's an svg will that show me oh that's 3.2 pixels and what's this one okay so oh well i mean it's close enough i'll get a little bit of a round so let me do rounded large um okay that's fine rounded large it's close enough to four for me anyway and let me put that class here too oh let me put it next to the other border class all right okay i think that looks good it seems to match up enough anyway um okay so now i have all the buttons let me just do one more styling thing which is move this x to center it here and how do i do that let's see um i already have so many classes here it's just so many classes so i'm just gonna put them inside of here then uh let me put um so display flex oh wait i can't do that down here display flex uh align let me do justify first so justify con content center align can i do a line item center let's see okay cool awesome and now i have everything centered so even if i type text in there like instead of the x i could do um let's say clip oh wait let me put this in the double curly braces so clip dot name i could put the name of the clip in there oh cool i think that's actually better for right now because there's no icon associated with the clip so to have the name of it um you can tell these aren't drums or anything um although i do have a drum set at my house i was thinking about recording myself do it but i'd have to move my whole audio setup into another room to record each sound and i just said okay well i'm just going to use these free mp3 files oh one more thing one more thing i do want to style um so on hover oops hover i do want to style let's see um was it oh the mouse pointer so uh cursor is it pointer cursor cursor pointer i think it's cursor pointer yeah and now i have it looks like it's clickable cool so it's not perfect styling but it's okay i think okay thanks yeah i can't i can't remember i've uh css is is just a memorization language kind of so it's like if you're not in it every day it's like you forget the exact terms you have to use i guess so what do i want to do next so i have i have all the clips um let's try to play sounds right so let's let's make a function a method here so methods oh no i hope you can hear the sounds uh oh wait i think i have system audio muted but maybe i can uh make it so you can hear well let me get the sounds playing first and see if you can hear them so let's see a play clip so this function it's gonna have to take in the name of the sound that url so i'm gonna have to pass in the exact clip and then this is where i'm planning on using the what is it javascript the audio constructor so audio not the html5 audio tag but the uh well this this should come up somewhere new audio yeah this is it um not a lot of details here all right yeah so basically i can create new audio element and play sounds in the browser um that's yeah that's as much as i can say about that i thought it would show like oh yeah here so once you create that audio element you can do dot play and yeah there are other things called like pause dot pause i should really contribute to that documentation um with some examples all right so that's that's what i'm gonna be using and i think that i can pass these in dynamically which i hope is going to work so let's do let's let s equal new audio so use the javascript constructor and then i'll pass in the clip which actually let me call it clip url so there's no confusion about what i'm passing in not the whole object just passing in the url and then s is now this audio object so now i should be able to do s dot play all right so no pause feature or anything yet um but that's okay so i guess to do pause i'd have to put it on data and do some other things i don't know to capture which clip is playing so i could pause it so okay so now when i click on this button i need to have some kind of i guess i'll just put in an act click to capture the click event directly on that div for my square buttons so um at click is oh yeah the method i just made play clip and then pass in the clip url so let's see pass in the clip dot what did i call that an eclipse oh i called it clip so it's clip.clip i'm gonna change this real quick sorry one second so clip replace it with url okay that is much better now it's just url okay so now i can do clip dot url pass that into play clip and i'm gonna make sure my volume is on yeah yes can you hear that it says that system audio is playing through my stream so i do like the puppy sounds though okay thanks thanks for confirming that um all right so this plays the clip that feels good oh yeah the sound name i need to be capturing which sound is playing so i can update the sound name cool hi bruce how are you um let's see i guess yeah i'll just have like current sound current clip since i'm using the clip terminology uh so let's say empty string at first um and then our latest clip because it's not current clip if it doesn't change after the clip ends so our last played last played i don't know that's fine um so let me do so i'll do this dot last played equals okay and then in this case i can't just pass in the clip url i'm going to have to pass in the whole clip so i'll have to pass in the name and the url and then here i'll update this to url and then last played will be set to the name okay so now i have to update that here so oops um oh wait wait uh here i'll just pass in the whole clip and then i'm pulling url and name off of that and what's the other thing oh yeah the sound name so i'm gonna have to put last played here oh that kind of stinks because when it's empty it turns into the shriveled thing i'm gonna have to put a default sound okay yeah i'm gonna have to put some a default there no sound or something so it doesn't just fold um with no text inside okay cool all right so let me hook up the power switch then and see so what should i do for the power switch um i guess i the easiest thing to do would be to put something on data like a boolean on or off and then have an if statement inside play clip um but what i should actually do is make these disabled so you can't click on them or show that they're disabled like gray them out somehow so i could do a class okay let me first let me v model the check box here so put this on two lines so the pat that power switch let me remodel that so i can capture the value equals um power should i do is power no because power can mean different things so is on oh no in javascript i should do a camel case so is on so in data now i'll do is on oh let me start off with true and then you can turn it off if you want okay cool so it's definitely mapping now because it starts off as true and then it goes off all right so now i have to disable these buttons which i'm going to do through an if statement unless someone else has a better idea so and then i can add a class to the buttons to kind of show the user that they're disabled since they're not actual buttons they're divs so i'll just change the class or something oh yeah instead of sound button maybe i'll have disabled button or something i don't know okay so if um this dot is on then i can do all that stuff all right but now it's off it doesn't do anything sweet um but now i don't want these classes so i want to gray them out somehow so i don't know should what should i do an overlay um or something let me make a new class here so let's call this um button disabled and say uh now let's change the border color i guess border now will be gray so okay so now if it's off oh i'm not actually applying the clasp oh man okay so button disabled now i have to conditionally toggle the class so let's see um how do i want to do this so because there's a bunch of classes here so let me see so i can do object syntax or array syntax and if i want to toggle um so i think let me look this up so vue.js dynamic classes and yeah i think if i do object syntax i can put the rest of the classes after the object right and then i don't have to um put them all inside the object so i could just have no i don't think i can do that so i think maybe i need an array here then so maybe i need an object inside of an array uh let's see and then this would be inside of a string and then inside the object it would be um so i'd be checking is is on and then if it is on then i want my class button disabled so i'm going to have to put that in quotes so button disabled so it doesn't like this so i think i need a comma here maybe oh yeah it seems to do okay with that that's good so if is on oh if not is ons meaning if it's not on then the button is disabled okay let me try that doesn't like it okay let me see what's going on with the buttons so okay now okay so it is adding the clasp properly because it's it's changing and now it's adding button disabled to all the buttons but my problem is now in my um css so do i do border color but border let's see now i think because it's putting that class first um that's why so i would have to put this class at the end basically let me do this on two lines um so i would have to put this class at the end so actually i'm gonna get this out and paste it after oh yeah and then put that back okay so now it should work no it doesn't work it doesn't like that um let's see why isn't changing the border color though so i have button disabled here and it's called button disabled here that's good it might still be putting the class at the beginning okay so border bottom color border left color i mean for this small app i could just do an important statement because it's not overwriting it so i'm wondering if that's what bootstrap has let me look at the rules yeah that's what they're doing they're doing border color importance so to overwrite they're important i'm going to have to use another important statement because that's how important to work everything is more important all right so that's fine whatever it's not okay that's good and now if it's on it goes orange and if it's off it goes yeah that's what i have right now um i don't know maybe you said that a long time ago though about the sound button i don't know how how long the leg is right now hopefully it's not too long but sometimes on youtube it can get a bit long yeah this is the same thing i had maybe it wasn't when you said that comment though oh i guess it's not because it's not is on but yeah the important did it because bootstrap is using important statements but i want to look at i want to make it look like more disabled than it is you know because this looks like it still could be a button oh also the pointer the pointer needs to go away i should do an either or class really um except i want some of these things like actually i want all of these things except the hover so um oh you know what i could do though is border warning what if i put this inside here too so that way i don't need the border gray right let me see let me take out the border gray and see because that way if it's not on oh now it's opposite oh right um okay well never mind because i forgot i'm doing it if it's not on display these classes okay so that was a bad idea let me go back i could do another um so i could i guess i could do a ternary here like is on and i don't know would that be inside a nested like look let me see if i can do a ternary here um and do so here i would have to do i would have to do is on yeah i could do two objects um that would definitely work i'm going to try to do this so let me get rid of that and then i can do so if it's on oh no no i don't want the button to be disabled let's see i want border warning oh wait and then if it's not on i want the other one i think this is going to work and that way i don't have to do two objects inside i can just check is on once it's not giving me an error so um i think it will work yeah that works cool awesome so let me now change um i don't know should i add an overlay i could add a background just to make it look more disabled like background color of light gray and let me turn it off uh i don't know and then get rid of the um mouse actually you know there's one pointer there's one mouse pointer that has like an x let me look that up because cursor mouse pointers css help wait cross hair cursor cross hair or cursor not allowed um let me see let me see which one which one would look better so now let me go to hover so and hover and then cursor um which which one should i try across here across here oh no that's not what i want i thought this was something different that's not at all that looks like i can drag and select what about not allowed yeah not allowed this one i don't know if you can see it it has the little circle with the line through it in it okay so i'm gonna do not allowed not allowed okay cool now it really looks disabled like you can't do anything and now if i put the power back on you can click on okay uh that all works now so what should i do i guess i should do volume i actually have no idea how to do this i don't think i've ever done volume in the browser let's see um so javascript audio what the audio constructor volume hmm audio context i wonder if it's audio context okay this probably doesn't say anything yeah so that doesn't say anything let me look in audio context real quick interface represents an audio processing graph built from audio uh no i don't think that's what i want create gain create is that what i want uh i really have no idea i could just look straight up like how to set volume in javascript let's see if this is what they're doing okay this person is trying to play and mix multiple sounds play the same sounds interrupt playback let me see if they have volume okay so this was in 2012. the web audio api is now supported although there are a lot of issues no common volume controls let me see the link that it provides oh it goes to the github page okay web audio api editors draft so this is the absolute latest from 2020. um an audio param interface for controlling an individual aspect of an audio node's functioning such as volume i said document dot my audio oh i can change it audio.volume so i could do it here then right so let's see i could do s dot volume equals um 2 or 0.2 0.2 and close this then all right yeah that does work cool thanks um yeah so i guess yeah let me do it uh to equal this dot range and then i'm gonna have to give it a default here so um let's say actually min max so range has a min max where is range here it is so min 0 max 5 and v model of value let me change the value to range or no no let me change it to volume okay so volume and then i'll put it here so this will be volume and let me start it off at two so in the middle and then here it will be volume cool thank you thanks for that nope oh wait i think this does this have to be a zero to one number i think it might have to be let me look at whatever you w3 schools yeah that's what i thought thanks zero to one okay so the leg can't be too bad because that seemed to your comment seemed to come up pretty quick dom audio volume property yeah so this is the same thing dot volume all right let's see so i guess i'll divide it by if it's zero to five man um i can't even think right now so let me divide it by five oh wait right list of volume divided by five and it should be zero to one so by 10 oh cool that works that works really well thanks i divided it by five because my max here is five so it's one to five zero is off anyway because you're going to have 0 divided by 5 so it's 0 so it won't play any sound okay cool i didn't even know how to do volume before today so that's off this on yeah it's not a huge difference but there's a difference thank you thanks for all your help so is there anything else i should do let's see it's been an hour and 37 minutes so it's like 20 more minutes left um what else could you do with a drum machine i guess get actual drum sounds but this was one thing that i didn't realize because i guess i thought i'd have to use the audio tag but it's cool that i can just pass in a url dynamically to the audio constructor and it just plays that's pretty cool i think this is a nice api um oh what if what if we try to set up the pause i think that's going to be a lot harder so pause i think this should actually be stop stop right not pause because i'm not really pausing i'm stopping so um let's see so i'd need i would need this um instance of audio i think i need this stored on data so that i can run stop on it basically because then i could do this dot current clip no no no um like this dot audio current audi current audio maybe because that's the audio object and then i could do dot stop run dot stop or is it dot pause is it there should be a dot stop right but the only one i know for sure is dot pause so let's let me see if this works so i would do current audio which at first would just be an empty object and um what else so oh yeah so i need to actually do that here so then this would be uh this dot current audio and then i would do yeah basically here oh no i would set this after so let me do uh i don't like using s then i guess i could change it to a and then this dot current audio equals a and then i could stop it here basically oh but if i'm just pausing it's going to pause in the middle of the clip then i need to reset it right reset it back to the beginning of the clip let me just see let me see how this works a is not defined um oh oh right so actually i'm not redefining it here so let me do const okay oh yeah i need a stop button how do i stop um should i just do a pause button in the middle here uh i could change it into a pause button until it's done playing and then change it back into the name i think that would be pretty cool let me add a pause button here just so i can test this out real quick up at the top so in between power and last play let me add b button and i guess the variant is it called variant could be i don't know info so it's a different color and then uh what do i want to say oh yeah pause or stop stop okay stop cool and now i can add an ad click to this so at click click equals um oh yeah stop it's just stop that's my method name so let me try this oh it's not fast enough because all these clips are like one second long it's i think it i think it did stop yeah it did okay so stop works and i it didn't sound like i had to reset it do i have to reset it back to zero let me try to stop the van door yeah it does stop and then it does start over again so i guess pause just started the clip over i don't know if that's the intended behavior but that's what it seems to be doing okay so that seems to work um now my cat's meowing for attention um let me actually because everything else is outlined let me outline that button it looks like a eyesore in the middle of everything or i wonder if i should just put stop no because then i would have to know i would have to time when the clip stopped and then change it back to the name i don't have time for all that because i don't think i have time to figure out how to do that but that would be an interesting thing if i could do that let me just fix the button for right now let me fix oh i can just do outline dash so let me do outline dash then info so outline dash info okay that looks a bit better yeah and this looks clickable this looks like it's not clickable so that's good there should be a resume if you want to resume but i'm not sure if it's saving the current like is it saving the current state so when i stop is it saving that because i guess play starts over at zero thanks way funnier i could actually make music like this there should be a repeat like i should be able to toggle these on repeat so you can actually make a song um i wonder how to do that so let's see also right now stop if i'm doing multiple things it just stops the last one not like every single sound what do you mean no no you don't like the random sounds or no it's not music or i don't know what no means or you don't want repeat i guess that's not really a drum machine or yeah drum machine you would have repeat oh don't mix these sounds oh don't don't mix them because if i have repeat then i'll have the horse sound over and over again with poker chips and everything yeah they're not the best sounds to put together um okay well so some ideas were that i could do resume on the sound um but the sound starts over so i i guess also i'm when i play it again i'm setting this to a new current audio so yeah i wonder if if there's a way to know like when a clip finished how would i know when a clip finishes because then i could check to see if a clip finishes and i could actually have a current audio array and i could be watching the array check when a clip finishes and then take it out of the array i think that would be the more advanced way to do this let me actually see i know i'm stuck on the repeat but let me see if there's javascript sound no audio audio repeat oh you can do loop i have to try this i have stop so i'll be able to stop it uh let me do loop here so do i do it instead of play is that what i do let me try a dot loop let me do something not too bad no it doesn't play so i think i need to do before play okay so i think i need to uh okay let's try this here didn't work a dot loop is not a function so oh element.lube is true okay all right so it's a property so let's do dot true and try this okay let me refresh shoot turn it all the way up shoot error cool um so i guess i could have a toggle that says loop or not loop but the problem is okay so what i'm gonna do now is actually stop the currently playing sound if there's a current sound i'm gonna call stop first before i set a new audio and do all this stuff because otherwise i'm not going to be able to stop old sounds right now so i'm going to do that real quick so i'm going to run this dot stop first oh wait that's a method so i'll run this dot stop to make sure all other audio stopped because otherwise multiple things might be looping and then i can have a loop toggle so let me do loop and i'll set that to false and i can do a dot loop here as this dot loop and then i'll have a toggle up at the top and i think this will be the last thing that i can do in the stream so the power so okay um let me put this loop maybe i'll just put it around the in the second row with the volume and let me say loop loop oh loop and let me say loop okay so oh that's kind of messy um something's wrong here this dot current audio dot pause is not a function oh because if if the current audio is stopped already i guess it removes itself or it's no longer a callable method so i'm going to have to say uh hmm what should i do so if this dot no wait if this dot um where is it current current audio wait let me just do a try catch here that's probably the quickest thing to do try and then catch so i'll just log out the error not as an error but just says that oh yeah i need to close the catch all right so yeah i'm logged out here okay that's looping properly so let me stop didn't throw an error because it was still playing that time so let me turn loop off so looping does work this is messy let me fix the mess in the top real quick um i wonder if that should be below like i could do another b row maybe if there are more options and then i can add oops i can add looping there of course in these other b rows there are more styling options so maybe i want to add those too hey i didn't get the space in there okay okay that's better it's not really good looking but at least it's not on top of each other okay cool um yeah so i guess that's it for the drum machine let me push my code what i have from today so let me i'm inside the drum app right now let me just see the up one directory in case i've changes from there and let's see get status oh yeah because i moved clips.js so good i'll catch all those changes too so let me do git add um wait let me make sure i did my get ignore properly first so i have a git ignore yeah i just wanted to make sure i had added my git ignore first okay so that should handle all that so i can do get status that will add the view app and the drum machine so do git add just add everything git commit dash m uh code oh drum machine code from live stream on july 3rd cool which is a holiday weekend here in the us thank you sashi it was nice having you thanks for all the help so let me refresh this here cool i think it was more fun after i got the styling worked out at the first 20 30 minutes but yeah i'm gonna try to figure out why incline wouldn't work after the stream all right so here's all of the app um the drum machine so markdown previewer and quote machine let's see and then next week so next friday i'll be doing the next app which i actually don't know what it is yet so let's see here's the drum machine oh if i go into learn i can see all the front end projects front and libraries yeah so drum machine oh okay calculator oh i actually built a calculator too uh five years ago i built the calculator actually for this project so i'm going to have to find my old code i definitely did it in react and i think i've done one in jquery too so yeah we'll see i'll probably be shocked at what my code looked like back then all right yeah uh javascript calculator and then a pomodoro clock i remember my pomodoro clock that was like it looks kind of like a time machine really weird ufo style so those two are coming in the future and then after that i want to build kind of a bigger project more of the style that i do on my regular channel yeah thanks tech stats thanks for joining me in the chat it was nice getting to chat with everyone this week um yeah if you are interested in vjs like view content i publish view videos and live streams on my faraday academy channel if you want to check it out thanks bruce thanks for watching yeah i hope you learned something from today and feel free to leave me a comment below or come over to my channel and you can see how to contact me from there so have a great day everybody take care
