learn how to use figma variants to design a scalable mobile app from amit who is a very experienced ux designer variants can streamline your frontend design process by allowing you to group and organize similar components into a single container hey guys and welcome to a brand new tutorial now in this tutorial what i'm going to share with you is actually how to build a scalable mobile application step by step on figma now this course is actually done in a two separate stages in the first stage what you are going to learn is basically going to be an overview we are going to learn some of the figma's best tools such as how to use frames how to use the auto layout how to use components so that you can build scalable apps on your own but all these three concepts will tie into my favorite components which is variance you will learn how to use figma variants so that you can create scalable applications that are also flexible that have a different variations for your elements so that your designs will not look just like a standard app now what also matters in this course is that i also have added a homework a practice file if you wish that i am actually going to add to the description of this video below so that you can take it and practice the concepts you'll learn to solidify and master it on your own the homework has suggested solutions attached already so don't worry we have everything covered here and then after we gave you the overview and maybe you practiced the homework then you can do the tutorial where we will build a mobile app from scratch it's actually a great long tutorial and i know you will enjoy it and before we go any further if you are new here my name is ahmed and i'm a ui ux designer currently living in canada waterloo and i will be your host today and i will see you on the tutorial but before we begin the tutorial and give you an overview of what you are going to learn what i want to do first is that i want to show you how to use the two figma files i will add to the description to this video below so that you can follow along the tutorial but also get your homework so that you can actually practice what you learned so that you can master the concepts easier now once you go to the description and click one of those links you will have either the tutorial initial screens file or you will have the homework file and doesn't matter which file you are on what i want you to do to actually have the ability to edit these files is you want to click on the drop down here and you want to press duplicate your drafts and let's go to the homework file and let's do that let's say drop down duplicate your drafts and now that is actually saved and i want to press open so now this project is actually copied to my own account and now i actually can edit it if you don't follow this step you won't be able to edit the file because i will not give you an added access for the master file you have to copy it on your own so that you can actually edit it on your own account so once you are here one more thing about the homework file before we go on each homework file actually has an exercise so each homework file has a suggested solution and it and in the main homework frame what you have is that you have your instructions and then you have four different exercises each exercise actually has a solution where if you click on the component here and press ctrl shift h you can view it and then if you press ctrl shift h again you can hide it that is for windows for mac if i'm not wrong it should be command shift h to hide and show and that is how you can compare and contrast your solutions and again if you have any questions whatsoever just comment on this video and i will actually do my best to help you and let's go all right so let's get cracking now what you see right now in my window is the end result of what we are going to design today in this tutorial and what you see is roughly 10 to 12 screens of a activity app that is a mobile app where you get to choose which city you are visiting then you get to pick your activity and you schedule it and then you pay for it at the end so that is going to be the main workflow and the goal for us though isn't just to design this high fidelity mobile app the goal is also to create it and design it with various thing metals and the most important being variants so that it is much more easy to make it scale later and that is what we are going to do today and it's going to be amazing so make sure you stick around till the end of this video and let's get started now if you like this tutorial and you want to get better at ui ux design specifically i have my own personal channel with my name ahmed aferoglu where i post twice a week videos on uiux design on how to get better at figma how to get better at communications how to get better at ui ux design whether that is soft or hard skills so you can actually become a better uix designer you can also go to the free code cam channel for this tutorial where they actually post all kinds of videos from development to security to ui ux design so that if you want to learn holistically all these new technologies free code cam is actually one of the best channels that i know please make sure you subscribe to this channel as well it's been amazing for me to actually learn frontend development and backend development and i'm really glad this channel exists so before we actually began the process of designing the high fidelity mobile app and make sure that we are using variants we have to cover our bases now because i do not know what your base level of skill is on figma whether that is using its tools or features i have to make sure we are going to cover the basics of what we will use so that you will be able to use the variants that will help your app be much more scalable and to do that i have to actually show you how to use frame auto layout component and variance on figma and if you are new to this don't worry i'm just going to show you in a second but also if you want to solidify what you learn if you feel uncomfortable still after this quick tutorial if you want to solidify what you learn in the description of this video there is a homework link that you can go it has suggested solutions already where you can practice what you learned here and that would solidify your knowledge before you actually go on to do this whole design process from beginning to end so let's get started with framing and also before i start if you look at the bottom left corner i have the shortcuts coming in i'm gonna actually move my yep i'm gonna move my picture to the right so on the left side you can actually see here that i have the key caster tool so that you can actually see what i'm pressing when i'm doing certain shortcuts and i would like to apologize in advance the shift key is buggy so it doesn't show make sure you also hear listen to my voice for the shortcut so anytime i actually want to understand how a certain feature of tool works i basically try to use it in the most simplest ui element possible so i do not focus on what i'm designing but how i will use the tool and the simplest ui design element that i know and you guys know is a button so what i will do is now i will design a button with a frame so i will pick the f short key and i'm gonna move my profile again there you go so i'm gonna press on f as my short key here and i'm gonna drag a frame and i'm gonna set this twist to 128 pixels for width and 48 pixels for height and right now it does not have any fill color so if i click on fill here now it does and i'm going to pick a grayish color and now we have something like a background and i'm gonna add to this frame a text so i'm gonna click on the frame press t for the shortcut for text and i'm gonna say login now i'm gonna pick the auto wet so the text doesn't stretch horizontally and now what i want to do is i wanna center it and having a frame basically allows me to group elements that are have to be in the same group visually so for a button that would be your background and that would also be your label text for let's say an input field input text field you might want to frame your label you might want to frame your placeholder and you might want to frame your background all in just one single frame and it also gives you certain powers such as basically making the content very easy to actually align so i can actually center a line horizontally i'm vertically in the right side here and that works right now pretty good now another power that the frames give you on figma is they are a gateway to actually creating more scalable ui designs and the one way to actually make your design much more scalable is to use it with auto layout if you add the auto layout portion to a frame and to do that you have to click on plus and i'm going to do that but i'm just going to copy and paste this so we have an example so on the left side i will have a normal frame and on the right side i will have a frame with an auto layout and boom so what this frame right now has is this auto layout basically lets us dynamically stretch our button no matter what the input that is one of the powers it can give you and i'm gonna show you what i mean so look at the left side the left side is the button again with the no auto layout functionality and i'm just gonna write n n n n nnn and this happens all the time you might have a button with the label login but it might also become submit or download and you might want to use the same design and you don't want to recreate it all the time and for that reason auto layout kicks in very well so if i do and and and n right now you can see this button scales on its own and it so what figma does is it lets you pick the margins the paddings around the element and you can specify here let's say center let's do 24 24 and no matter the text size this button will scale horizontally even if you increase the text size while keeping the right left top button padding the same now is this the only power of the auto layout feature does it only let us design buttons of course not another good way for you to use it is instead of just scaling horizontally also vertically what you can do is you can also use it to add spacing between elements so you can actually use this for more complex stuff for example let's create a new card by pressing f to create our card frame let's fill it with white let's add a drop shadow with effects here and that's a very rough drop shadow but that will do for now and let's add a title and let's get this to be 18 pixels let's fold it out with ctrl b and let's just copy and paste it again here and let's say loram epsom basically let's have our text here let's make this 16 and unbolt it okay so we have a title we have a body and we are inside this frame and one thing you usually do is you really want to make sure that there is a certain spacing around your card but also there's a certain spacing between elements so what you can do is if you add the auto layout to your frame here and instead of horizontal direction which we chose for buttons here you can choose the vertical one and you can also specify the spacing between items meaning what's the space gonna be between our title and body text and let's pick that to be 12 pixels and also we can add the margins of 16 pixel 16 pixel 16 pixel and you want to be around here so what now happened is we have a left margin of 16 top margin of 16 a margin of 16 and right margin of 16 but the spacing between our elements is 12 pixels and this is very useful because what this will lecture is it will make it very easy to make your designs consistent you won't have to check the distance between each element vertically almost ever again if you know how to master the auto layout feature now let's move on to components so you have your frames and you have your auto layouts and let me zoom out a bit with shift zero so what is the value of components and what is it and that's a very good question and to do that i am gonna first create another screen and let's make that a iphone 13 mini and let's what we are going to do is we are going to copy this button again and paste it just below here so you having a frame an auto layout makes it scalable but you still have a problem let's say we decide to use this button i'm gonna control c to copy and ctrl v to paste on this iphone 13 screen which is a very empty screen i know i'm like ah i always forget to place this profile in the right but okay so we have this very boring screen what can we do really what can we do to basically show us the problem that we might have what i will now do is that i want to basically have the second screen of mobile screen and that is also normal you usually will have 30 to 50 and i want this to be actually let's say login as well but during the design i realized that i actually want this to be blue color and let's make this blue oh yep let's make this blue so i designed this color i designed the color of this button again but you can realize even though i copied and pasted from this color this button its color did not change and now picture this let's say you have 50 mobile screens and you realize your color for your button is wrong and you actually wanted blue instead of brown and you have to go now so 50 other screens and change the color each time and that is a hassle and that takes so much time what components do is they actually solve this problem specifically what components do is they let you create a master element and to do that we have to first make this button a component first and the way to do that is control alt k on windows now this is a component and what you can do is i'm going to delete these buttons now what you can do is to actually use a component in the actual app screens you have you go to assets each component shows on the assets panel here and it basically lets you organize your files and this becomes very handy it's a drop down here so it becomes very handy once you have multiple let's say types of components and to fetch it you basically drag the component you picked and it's here and you can also copy and paste like a normal button and it's here and now we realize that we actually want the color of the button to be blue how do we change it we go to the master element click and we basically i'm going to move my profile here a bit and we change its color to blue and then you realize all the other buttons that actually were the children of this master element also change so this makes it very easy for you to make changes yet it has a problem and variants came to rescue for this problem the problem is what if you want to use the blue color and the brown color so in 25 screens of your apps you are using the color blue in 30 of them you are using the color brown how do you make that work in a rigid format of a component where you only have one master element and that's where the variants come into play and what you do is you click on your component and to use variance you have to have a component simple frame won't work and you click on this plus sign for variance now what a variant is basically it's a variation of the same element so we are still designing a button but depending on the properties we have we can actually make it look different and for our case the property will be color because it we are trying to basically change the color from brown to blue so the property of the variants is color now the first button i wanted to be color blue so i'm going to give it the value for the color property blue and the second one i'm going to give it brown and i'm gonna make it go brown here let's go a bit maybe maybe red yeah i like the red better actually let's do red who cares about brown red okay so now we actually have a button with two different variations it can have the color blue it can have the color red and let's just before we go on i'm gonna show you an error type where what would happen if we also name this the same value blue now then pigment gives you a problem because if you have the same values for the two different variations figma doesn't know which one to show it to to you when you are actually fetching it so you want to make sure that each combination of properties and values mapped to a single variant maybe a single variation of that element so this has to be red it can't be the same and what you do to actually get it is you go to the assets panel again and you fetch it just like you fetch a component but now on the right side here you can pick it and if you pick red it's red and let's copy and paste it here and if you pick it blue it's blue look at that and that is the basics of what we are going to use today we are going to use throughout this whole tutorial frames auto layers components and variants and if you are just new to this make sure you go to the homework practice file in the description just like i said in the previous video and that might help you solidify your knowledge but if you feel bold or you're already comfortable with what i just talked about let's actually begin designing and in this video i'm going to show you how to create type system basically we are using throughout this let me actually go to a screen here let me zoom in let me go shift to zoom in yep so throughout this app we are actually using a single font called sf pro text now if you are using if you have a macbook you can use sf pro if you're on windows you can use sf pro text and again i will add in the description how to download this font if you are in windows if you are a mac user it should already be preinstalled when you bought your computer or your laptop so while we are using only one font we are using it for different sizes and one thing you want to do if you are going to create a scalable application is you want to create and determine your type system early on so in order to do that i'm gonna press on frame to create a new frame and i'm gonna name this type system and i'm gonna move my profile again to here i always forget this guys so in here what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna have i'm gonna press on t for this is a text basically i am gonna this is gonna be my mainframe and i'm gonna come back to check which kind of a type can i use but then once we add all the different versions of the type we are going to use i am actually gonna create a half i'm gonna show you how to create a type system on figma so you never have to visit this frame ever again so let's begin what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna copy this and i'm gonna copy this as again and i'm gonna copy this again and you're gonna have basically in this app two different versions we are gonna have 12 pixel 15 pixel 17 pixel and 34 pixel and we will have this for regular and bold that's all the type versions that we are using so i'm gonna have this as my h1 meaning title text this is gonna be my title text and this is gonna be my second header so each one text sorry h2 text my bad so sub header i think subheader would be a better text and this is going to be 17 pixels and 15 pixels is going to be my body text so this is going to be the body text and i'm going to also automate this as well and it then 12 pixel will be my smallest text so span text i'm gonna call the span text and in mobile 12 pixels is usually the smallest you want to go for like icon labelization in ios you can go 10 pixel but i wouldn't recommend going below 12 pixel it's very hard to read so this is the bolded version so you can see each element here is bold so now what i'm gonna do is i am also gonna select all of these and copy and paste to the right side here and these all of these will be the regular version so they will be the regular version oh yeah sorry my bad i was trying to change the type this will be the regular version here boom okay so now that we actually have our types every type we are going to use is here we can actually add them to figma as a type system so to do that i am going to go over each type here right corner style so i can add them as a style and i can click click on this and i'm gonna be here header slash regular uh my bad this one is the bold one right yes this this one is the bold one i have to edit ah ah matt you are making mistakes ah and that happens guys we all make mistakes so this is the bold one and i'm gonna add this to be header regular and i'm gonna add this one as a sub header bold and i'm gonna add the yep another bold and as you guessed it sub header and this one will be body bold and this one will be body regular now if you are asking why am i adding a slash and the reason for that is i have to move my profile here i'm going to move myself here once you use a slash figma understands that you are actually basically nesting certain elements so once i do header slash figma creates a basically a title named header and puts everything inside that i had like a bold regular so this is much more easier to read for our eyes so the body is done next will be the span so i'm gonna do the same here so span as you guessed it slash bold and i'm gonna do the same for this one click on the plus span regular perfect and i'm just gonna give it a check here and now that we have this this is what we can then i'm gonna show you how we can use this a bit so if we were to have a text here let's say i am a text we can actually and let's move this to somewhere else like our iphone screen here and these screens will be deleted shortly but this is just to prove the point of why this is useful i can change its styles here without ever going to copy paste from here this is almost like how we learned how to use variants almost like a variance for type but figma made it very easy for the type system to do to actually have this very neat in the sidebar here it's actually very neat and now that we are done with the type we are going to move to do this how to create the style design system for the color palette all right so let's create our color system so to do this i'm going to go the same thing i'm going to create a frame by actually click tapping the keyboard shortcut f so i'm going to draw this out and i'm going to name this color system and what i'm going to do is basically i am going to what this will have is basically every variation of colors we will have in this app from this blue and you can see that we have different shades of blue right so i'm just going to zoom in here a bit but this is blue this is blue we have white i believe around if you have a good eye you can tell this is also some sort of a blue color it looks black but it is also blue and we have let's say a gray color here and the background of the screens for this app that i designed aren't actually completely white they are like 98 white so that will be added and those are the colors we are gonna add so one thing we don't want to do again is that we are trying to minimize as much as how much copying and pasting we will do for two reasons first of all copying and pasting is very very hard and time consuming especially if your app scales and becomes instead of a 12 screen app which is here into 100 screen app the second is it is error prone you might have copied and pasted the wrong variation of an element you might have copied and pasted wrong color but if you have a system that you can follow step by step you will also make less mistakes and it will save you time so let's go so i'm going to create what i'm going to do here is i'm going to press o to actually draw circles and i'm going to make this like 120 pixels 120 pixels and these are going to hold my colors and i'm gonna copy and paste this around i'm gonna copy and paste it around yep four times now i'm gonna pick all of these i'm gonna copy and paste this complete set of row and that is pretty good okay so now what we i'm going to do is i am going to begin by the color blue and the i'm going to go from 100 to 400 100 signals that it's actually a very light color and for as the number goes up it means that the color is getting darker and darker so for this blue what we will have is i'm gonna pick the colorful tool and to do that the window shortcut is i and i'm gonna do this i'm gonna go to the second color and i think the second one here is 200 is this one this blue inside the stepper so i think that one so clicking on that one is a bit difficult but i think i can do this guys ready i am so happy for that magnifier tool and i think my just bugged out yep that's your 200 and the 300 is the profile color here so the icon color when it's not selected that has to be zoomed out a bit more i think i'm i think i'm just gonna copy the color here the tool is it's very small so i would make a mistake so i'm just going to copy and paste here and the 400 is actually the text color that i use i'm going to copy and paste this as well now basically each row will serve as one type of a color so the blue is gone what else can we have the blue is gone we will have variations of white so two variations of white so i'm gonna move this and i think we will have a gray somewhere so i think we will have one gray so for variations of white let's tank this through first variation is the input one so input color there is so i'm gonna do is i'm gonna click on my element and i want to have the color fill i'm gonna press i and i'm gonna go here press again that's the oh that is just white okay and then i'm gonna press i and then i'm gonna go copy the background and that's the second one so and for the gray we only have the gray here for the disabled buttons and that is your gray i don't think it copied let's see yes now it copied and white is pretty hard to see so what i'm going to do is i'm going to give this frame a whole dark background because we can't see the white colors i i realize that so i'm going to give it a black color here now we can see all the colors and now that we have this what we can do is i'm gonna go through the same process now at this point i could use a plugin to actually generate these styles for me but i'm assuming some of you have never done this kind of work and it's beneficial for you to see me on how to do this step by step so i'm going to take the long route and i'm actually going to do the same as what we did in the when we were trying to systematize the type settings so i'm going to click on this and i'm going to click on this style icon there and i'm going to click on the add and i'm going to write blue and as you guessed it slash and i'm going to say 100 and i'm going to do this for almost all of them and then 200 and this is the part of when you really are happy that you have plugins available to you that will automatically do this for you but it's good to sometimes do it by yourself so we again did the slash so we can actually see them roll by row and this is gonna be your one so this is gonna be the white hundreds right hundred and this is gonna be the y200 and 200 and let's see this is gonna be the gray 100 okay and let's see how it works right now i'm gonna go on to the screen again i'm gonna draw my rectangle on this iphone and i'm gonna see if i can change its styles and boom i'm gonna move my profile here and yeah just like our type system our color system works it's easily scannable it's very easy to skim and i'm pretty happy with it all right so now that we have actually done the color styles now we are going to move to the icons we are going to create the icon set that we will use for this project in the next video all right so let's actually begin fetching our icon set now we are not going to be creating all these icons from scratch so what i did is actually i created a frame called icon set and i wrote down all the icons we need and you can see the tenth one is bolded and there's a reason why it's pulled just wait for a bait give me a minute i will explain now what i want to do now is i am going to actually use a plugin to fetch most of these icons and i'm actually going to use two plugins the first line i'm going to actually use the plugin called feather icons and the second one the last one the store the visa icon i'm gonna use the plugin called iconify now this is very important and i'm gonna show you how to actually install both of these plugins so in the future you can also have a starting icon set that you can use on your own to save you time for your designs and also it's a good practice to learn how to create your work setup where you actually can have the plugins that you need to fasten your work so let's install the plugins to install i want you to go to click on the main menu plugins and i want you to go to bottom here and say bros plugins in community once you see the screen i want you to type feather icons this is the first plugin we will download and i want you to filter with the plugins here and i want you to click on install for this plugin once that is installed i want you to write here iconify and i want you to install this one as well now if both of these are installed now you can actually download these icons and i am not going to go over the process of actually using the plugin what i will do is basically i'm gonna go to the feather icons the first plugin we installed and i'm gonna basically install all these nine icons by fetching it here it's gonna be a bit boring so i'm gonna actually speed things up in the video level so that's why all these texts are there and you can also do this on your time and let's go and for the last icon i'm gonna for the visa i'm gonna go plugins and instead of going through feather icons i'm gonna go for iconify and i'm gonna look for visa and i'm gonna pick this one yeah i'm gonna put this here and you can see all of these icons are actually i'm gonna select all again and i'm gonna basically create a i'm gonna select all it should show me i think figma is backing up because it should show me a spacing option as a shortcut yep there you are and i'm gonna have this as maybe 24 that's better and they're all spaced well right now and one thing i'm making sure is the bounding box that each icon has is 24 to 24. the inside icon size doesn't matter as long as it doesn't go out of bonds but for your styling knees it's very important that each icon has the same width and height of a surrounding box now you will see in the design some of the content meaning the actual vectors might have different sizes than the other icons but that's okay as long as the bounding box is the same we will make it work so now that the icon set is actually created let's move on to the actually creating your first variations for our first login and sign up screens so before we actually move on to the looking at the up and login screens i forgot to do one thing in our icon set so vial and i'm going to zoom with the shift 2 here while you actually might have get got the icons from the plugins we use fedora icons and iconify one thing i forgot was to actually make each icon a component so we would actually be eligible to use them from the asset spat assets panel and the main benefit for that is is you do not want to be coming back to the screen to copy and paste icons all the time that takes a lot of time it's much easier to use the assets panel and just drag and drop so let's do that so i'm going to go to layers and i'm going to go on the left side i am just gonna go through the i'm inside the icon set frame i am with shift i am mass selecting each icon and then what i'm gonna do is i am going to make these a component and let's see ah yeah thingama did not have that shortcut did it so that just created the combo mess so we have to go through the old way i'm just gonna do the ctrl alt k for each of these and that is boring i don't know if this has a shortcut or not i thought it would it didn't and it's crushed my dreams but it happens so let's do that so now each icon is actually a component and we can actually reach them from here and that is very handy so let's move now into the sign up screen login screen let's create our first variant so i want you to take a look at this two screen and i want you to basically ask yourself two questions what elements to visual look alike and of these elements are they also logically alike what do i mean by this so when i am actually looking at the screen what i want to do is i want to systematize patternize almost everything so i do not do unnecessary work because in a production level design like i said previously you are not going to be working with 12 screens we are going to be working with 100 and if it's a web app that is actually responsive it might be 300. so you really want to minimize your work and to do that we are looking to actually create the variance well how do we know which elements belong together by answering those two questions i said which elements do visually look alike and for me right now all these rectangles look alike including the button but then i ask myself which of these elements are logically alike and i can justify saying the input text field is logically alike with the email text input and the password is also because they are all input text they are basically all input fields but a button is a button it has a different logical functionality it is used to actually have an action accomplished it doesn't take an input so we are going to create s variants for the input field and it will have three variants the name the email and the password and that's how we decide things we answer those two questions i'm gonna press on f to create a frame and i really want this to have a different background color because i'm going to use a lot of light colors i wanted to have a dark color like the color palette and let's press on f to create our frame and i think the width of that is 325 what's the margin there 24 26 okay so ahmed made a mistake to pass me it should probably be 327 so it would have 24 pixels left and right on a iphone device so 327 pixels 48 pixels for height and i'm gonna fill this i'm gonna move my profile image here i'm gonna fill this with the our color style which are now here based on our previous video i'm gonna pick the 100 i'm going to add this a border radius because if you look this input all of these inputs have a border radius of 8 so i'm gonna add eight here and i'm gonna give it a drop shadow of four or sixteen and probably ten pixels and you probably cannot tell how the drop shadow works there because the background is what would you say black but if it was white this is how the drop shadow would work and let's go to the previous i wanna under the change boom so our frame is good i'm gonna go back to there our frame is good i'm going to rename this as input and i'm going to rename the parent as inputs so it needs now a text for the placeholder text i'm going to write json mamoa i'm doing the text input field and i'm gonna also because we have the type system i'm gonna go and say this can be a regular auto regular body and that's pretty good and i'm gonna make this out of it and i want to basically align this like 12 pixels maybe yeah that looks pretty good and so aligning text vertically is always hard because even if you use autofit there is always bottom and top spacing so in this one you have a three three and a half pixel on top of the j and four pixel on the bottom so your center when you are centering if those two distances are farther apart you're not actually centering the text because the spacing is correct so this should be maybe a bit low but it shouldn't be complete 15 it should have maybe 14 yeah that's how it goes that's a bit better and the color of it should probably not be black but the gray that's perfect so now now that we have our input frame we have to make it a component so that we can actually have eligibility for the variance functionality so to make a component the shortcut on windows is ctrl alt k and now i have a component and i'm going to make this a variant by clicking on this plus button boom and my second variant will probably be the email one so it would be jason at hotmail maybe x jason hotmail.com you know if we have to make this look production level and now i have two examples two variants of the input field now what should my property name be and to answer this to write this to answer this very simply you should ask yourself what is the attribute that i am actually judging the difference of the variance meaning what separates the variant here what separates an input field from another and in our case it's type if the input type is password it will look a certain way if input type is email it will look a certain way so for this one the type and it will be text for this one it will be email and we should add a third one and this is the most complex one it should be the password one and i'm gonna write this password and it has actually an icon at the end and it doesn't have a it has the eye icon so you can actually hide and show the password so i'm going to delete the text it doesn't have a text what it does have is the hidden password right now so i'm going to press o to create those hidden passwords and maybe eight awesome so those are my that's my circle and i want the circle to be like yeah dark blue and i'm clicking on alt to actually drag to duplicate and then i am gonna do one more time that's good and i'm gonna take a look out to see if this works and i think two works and i'm gonna select all of these to basically copy and paste so let's see that i'm gonna select all of them to basically determine their spacing if i zoom in a bit does things let me nope but i think they are equal space so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna group these circles group selection i'm gonna say password text and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to add i'm going to make sure this is aligned well is it by 12 oh what am i clicking it's 12 so it matches the alignment of the email field and now i am going to add the eye icon i'm going to my assets icon set and i am going to drop the okay i think we didn't i haven't got the eye icon let's see if i didn't yeah oh i'm okay guys i think i skipped it okay so i forgot to make the component so let me go back so now i'm gonna select my frame i'm gonna drop my eye right there go to my layers my eye is there perfect and i want it to be as away as possible as 12 pixels maybe one two and what's it's yeah i think that looks pretty good i think that looks pretty good one thing i want to make sure is this one two pixels i want it to be one pixel i want the circle to be one pixel as well and i want the whole eyes color to be dark blue we don't use black okay and that one works pretty good one looks pretty good i think also so this one is the visible i think we got the wrong eye icon so in this one what we have is that the password is invisible so that's the wrong eye icon so i have to go back now and okay these mistakes happen they will not deter us so we have to install let me quickly install the other eye icon here right there yep let me put it in the icon set let me put it here let me make it a component and let me oh that's too much let me zoom it zoom out and i'm going back to my inputs come on third time is the charm delete that eye icon click on the password input go to assets get the eye that is actually invisible select its color to be dark blue and we want it to have a stroke of one pixel and also we want to let's see if we what's the distance yeah we wanna give it what is it now 15 12 and then we want this to be 12 also and boom yeah now it works all right so now that so how this is gonna be used again is now that we can go to assets and we can have an inputs variant here like you can see and if i were to drop one here i can pick its version if we pick password this test if you pick email it's this so now that the inputs is done now we can i zoomed out too much now we can focus on the sign all right so now that we are done with the inputs let's begin creating the variants for the large buttons which are the sign up login buttons for our signing and login screens but if you look at the other parts of the app as well we can see we are using the same button for booking and we also have a different state of the button which is the same width and height but it's great so it's disabled and one thing one more thing i want to take your attention is the label in each of these meaning label on each of these large buttons is some of them is login sign up book knob go to checkout the bit of the actual element doesn't change but the size of the label is changing so that means we actually have to use auto layout to accomplish this functionality so let's get cracking so to create a frame again you know this now i'm gonna press f and i'm gonna name this as buttons and the reason i'm doing these all in different frames is because as you can see i actually the more type the more i separate each component apart i will have easier access in assets panel because they will be much more organized so in the buttons what i want to do is it also i'm going to create click on f again tap on f again and i'm going to set this with the 327.48 i'm gonna change the color of the buttons frame to match the dark one here and i'm gonna add a fill of white there but my white is actually specified with 100 same as what we went through for the input fields it's gonna have eight pixel of radius and it will also have a drop shadow of four four 16 pixels blur and 10 pixel for the actual drop shadows color up for its opacity so now that we have this as the starting point i am going up and one thing i realized it is different for the button is it's actually the blue color so i'm going to change it to here the initial blue boom it also has a label just like the input field but the label is centered and that's important so it will be like login so the label is centered and it is also bolded so in here in the input field the labels were left aligned but also regular but for the buttons it is centered with bolded so they are also bold not regular so i'm gonna pick my text of basically bold 15 which is pretty good and to actually accomplish the centering i am actually going to use auto layout and one thing i want to do is i don't want it to hug content i want it to fixed width and height and there's a reason for this so fixed center fixed center the reason is so i'm gonna show you two ways of this okay so i'm gonna actually drag another one so so let's say how contact hunt content so in this situation if i were to actually add new text you can see the the content of the background also scales but that is not what we have throughout the application because despite the changes of the label size horizontally width and height of the background of the button stays the same buttons width and height stay the same and that means it has a fixed return height but the text is free to grow as slight as it can so that's why we are using fixed instead of hug so now that we are here i i can show you now i can make this grow and the the what would you say rectangle itself will not resize and that is the key here so now i have this what i will actually do is that i am gonna make this a component so that i can make then i have a variant so i'm gonna click on ctrl alt k to make it a component and i'm gonna name it large button and i am going to give it a variant and what should the variant be based off is again the same question and again what attribute are we trying to differentiate we know the key attribute we have right now is that if the button is primary it's going to have the blue background color and if it's a secondary or would you say if the button is active it will have a blue color if it's not active it will have a gray color meaning it will be disabled you won't be able to tap it but we can also have another property here that is important such as we can have and in this application for large buttons like this we don't have it but we can also have a secondary button or a tertiary button meaning that what would happen if we were to show a button here like this look at the cancel button here for the small buttons unlike the primary button here where the button is filled and it gets your attention a secondary button is created with the fill removed but only added in the strokes so i think i will have that in the large button just in case in the future we might need it so i'm gonna have two properties the first property and again is active is it active or not and to add the second property i'm clicking on the more options icon i click on add new property and then the moment a bit of buggy here and the second property will be priority and i'm gonna zoom in so what i'm going to now do is i'm going to the first button and i'm going to say active yes priority primary the second button is also going to be primary but it won't be active and when it's not active we want its background color to be grayed and we want the color of here to be blue and i don't want this to have a complete white that's my mistake we have to use our color system wherever we can and so now we have two primary buttons one is active one is not active and i want a third one just in case that's too much zooming in i want a third one just in case here gonna zoom out third one to be secondary button but active so what that means is it is active but it is secondary and finger is giving me an error because it cannot have the same values as the first one so now what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna click on shift x to switch stroke and fill properties and i am also going to give this the color blue there we go and that looks pretty good so those are our three versions of our colors and yeah so those are our buttons that we can now play with right just before we go on board looking at sign up screen began designing them i haven't mentioned here so in the previous video we did the button variations and one thing that your test of adding new text here might fail so here right now it is not centering the text even though we set it as fixed width and height because you actually have to click here to actually select where do you want the position of the content p and if you select center no matter what you add should actually be recentered alone and that is how it works and what i'm going to do now is i'm going to do this for each of the variants i'm going to check if it's done here it's done if that here it's not done so i'm going to do that here all right so now all of them is done now we can actually move to the login and sign up screens all right so let's go so and this is my tea that tastes great okay so i i know you've been waiting for this part so let's begin so i wanted to show for our frame we actually have iphone 13 mini and when i'm going to do what i'm going to do is i'm going to just press f and i'm going to pick iphone 13 mini as well and i'm going to pick it around here and i want you to take a look at how to go on and design this so when i'm looking at this what i'm seeing is a basically a background image with some kind of an overlay on it we have the company logo we have the message if it's a signup it's welcome if it's a login space if i'll come back and we have some form to fill and at the end of the form we have the option for the user if they have an account already they can go to login if they don't they can come back it's a very simplistic sign in signup that doesn't have social media account signing options etc so let's go so one thing i'm gonna do is i'm gonna need the sign ups sign up screen copy and what i'm gonna do is i am gonna right click and i'm gonna go for the my plugin called on splash to actually find the background image and if you haven't already please install the plugin on splash here and what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna look for travel and let's see what we have let's see i'm looking for this particular image but i might not be able to find it but oh i did i'm lucky so i actually got the image um you know sign up screen and i think i did a mistake here where i think the image is added to the whole frame that's not what i want i want the image to be i want the image to be on top of a rectangle here i think that's what is happening so i think i have to get this overlay here yep i got this rectangle and this rectangle is what i'm going to fill the image as so plugins unsplash the same process maybe travel here go down go down go down here why is it okay now that is correct so sign up screen copy okay so this is correct now i'm going to add an overlay to the image and i'm probably going to add the overlay of blue meaning even in the overlay i'm going to use our primary colors and i am going to go back here get rid of that one i'm gonna add an overlay and i want the overlay to be basically our blue color which is basically i can do i'm gonna press i for its color and i'm gonna pick that and probably 20 px 20 that's too little maybe 50 that's too much 40 that's too blue so my blue guess was wrong maybe maybe it needs to be a darker color so maybe what we need to do is actually we might need to go and pick our dark blue color here and copy that remove that from our frame go to our image go to its overlay and paste it there that's how is eight i'm trying to find the maximum okay that's so i know eight is too high i know 20 is too low maybe 30 no 50. and what you can do is you can play with as you are holding shift you can go by 10 and probably around 55 or 45 is the answer i will go with 45 for now and that's how you find the background overlay color and you basically find the up maximum and minimum bounce and just play around till your eye actually finds that okay this is the value that makes sense so now i am looking at i'm going to design the logo and i'm going to have a rectangle here and i am going to make this maybe 128 pixels and what i want is to have it for it to have the initial blue color we have and one thing that is different for this one is that if you look at it it's a rectangle but only two of its corners are actually having a radius so that's exactly what i'm gonna do for this one and it's probably height is 40 pixels as well yeah maybe 60 but let's first add these edges let's write 16. do i edit to the right edge i think so yeah so maybe 64. yeah that works and 148 and to see if my height matches now and i could go the easy way here i think for i think 48 would work maybe 64. i'm not sure let me check i think this has to be bigger a so for me to actually know i can just go and copy the values but i want to train my eye even though i designed the whole app previously by myself this is not a community project app what i will do is it's still difficult to redesign something what i will do is i will click on shift r which lets me access the ruler tool and i'm dragging a vertical straight line here okay so for the width i got it right so it is 188 pixels and his height looks all right now but i think the radius is for this one a lot more so maybe 32 and 32 that is correct i think that works and then i will add a text here and it will be activista and i want it to be autobit and i think this is the only text because it serves as a logo that we will not systematize with our type and what i want this to be is basically 36 pixels maybe 20 pixels and i want the second part of it to not be bold so i will have the second part selected i'm going to make it a regular and that works pretty good and now i'm going to align this let's see and i'm gonna check how far away it is and i think i want it to be 24 and at 24 that is 42 so at 24 i want the right part to be also 24 so it's centered so i'm gonna get this to be maybe around here so maybe this can be 172. and and yeah i think that works pretty good maybe 17 and again aligning vertically is difficult because you can see top is six pixels but the bottom is eight so you you cannot trust the figma tool here should probably be 16 to 15 and that should work okay so let's move on and we can circle back to the logo again later so now what i'm gonna do is i am gonna have my text welcome and this will basically be my header so i'm gonna tweet it as a header and i'm gonna automate it and i'm gonna add the exclamation point there and then what i'm gonna do is i am basically going to think about all this big form assay frame and inside this frame i will have three groups name group email group password group and then button four groups maybe and the input groups will have a text label like your name and then the input and only the button will not have a text label above it so it's going to be like this so i'm going to go to my assets and i am going to go and fetch an input here all right and before going further i want to add a layout grid here so i can see things better and if you don't know what a layout grid is it basically allows you to 4 16 it basically allows you to use vertical and if you want vertical horizontal layout of how your content should be placed at all screens it works very well so i'm gonna do that so i can no okay that's at 24 pixels go above and this is the name field so what i need now is the text label i'm gonna uh undo i'm gonna do zero gonna go here text i'm gonna say your name and this probably should not be but irregular but body bold so your name probably two dots here and i will have this auto bit as well and i'm gonna check how far away it is from the text input it's 22 pixels that's a lot so our left margin is 24 pixels so the spacing i'm going to do here is also important and how i'm going to base it is basically i know our left and right margins will be 24 pixels so i'm going to use the power of two for each margin we will have between different elements and when an element is actually related to a group of element meaning when you are thinking of a text input you cannot think of it without the label of your name so they actually should be closer to each other than they are closer to welcome so what i'm going to do is i am actually going to reduce this distance to 12 and that should give me now 12. yep that's pretty good and i'm going to go to layers and i'm going to basically frame these two things and i'm going to write this as text input and then what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna copy this one and i'm gonna pick this one to be email and i'm gonna change this to your email very simple and i'm gonna do it the same manner where i'm gonna write this as email input and then i'm gonna drag this again and this will be as you guessed at probably your password and i'm gonna go here to my component and pick its variant to be password all right so now what i'm going to do is i am going to add my button which is our button is missing right now so i'm going to go to our assets i'm going to the button section i'm going to drag it here and i'm gonna go and make it go 24 and it should probably be 327 what's happening and that distance is too much maybe around 30 and we can worry about the margins later but right now what i want to do is i want to group all these four things and that would let me use our auto layout function and how i'm i'm going to show you in a second how we are going to use it so i'm going to frame these four elements as well and i'm going to write them as the form sign up form and then i'm gonna add an auto layout and what auto layout does is it's gonna give me between each element so our name frame email frame password frame and our button i want us to have roughly 24 pixels and that's great and i'm gonna basically i really want to hide this yeah i don't want to see the red colors anymore i want to hide our layout so i'm going to click on alt shift 4 to actually hide it that's good and now let's see how far away our welcome text to our form that's 43 pixels so i'm gonna get it to be maybe 24 and let's see how far i made that is 32 i think 32 pixel there works well so from the logo to top that's 32 pixels from here that's 24 pixels and i'm gonna check with my ruler how everything is aligned to the left that is pretty good yeah i think this works so this is your sign up screen guys and the only thing missing right now is this text at the bottom and this should be my bad and this should also be sign up and let's add our text our basically gateway to the login screen that says tab here if you already have an account and i want this text to be autofit and i don't want it to be bold i want it's partially to be bold but and i wanted to start at the same left alignment which is 24 pixel for the x coordinates and i wanted to have because it's so related to the sign up button i want it to be like 12 pixels up most so maybe 12 pixel that's pretty good and then i'm gonna make the tab here but uh tap here mode to be bolded and i want it to be again bolded and it's color to be blue and that works pretty good i like what i'm seeing i like what i'm seeing compared to there now what i want to do is i'm going to design the login screen and we are missing the status bar for these two screens so it doesn't matter but later on the status bar will kick in and let's go and design the login screen so what i'm going to do is i am going to basically drag a copy of the sign up screen and i'm going to rename it as login screen copy and the first i'm going to look at the differences the first difference is the welcome back message which is makes sense and then you can see the alignments here of what is the same but how where the text began is the same so what we will do is to keep the same alignment i'm going to just remove your name field here and then it goes up and i'm going to add the welcome back we probably want it to be uppercase i i like it uppercase more now and i'm just gonna drag this but if i press shift you can also go 10 pixel up instead of normal one and i'm gonna check the distance that's 12 perfect and the text also has to change it should be if you don't don't don't already i have an account and that works yeah i'm looking at the login screen now and that looks pretty good i don't think it has any issues i think i can ship this one yeah let's move on to the next screen i think the signup and login process is done and let's move to the next things we have to do and i think we have to do a bit more variance before we can all right so let's think about the discover screen and let's find out what we have to design before we move on to the screen what are the elements we have to add as variants so that we can actually make it easy for ourselves when we go to part two and we will copy and paste so that you know we cut our workload again so the a couple of things that we don't have right now is we do not have this top status bar that i believe is present in every other screen and it looks like it has two modes in the first mode it's in the dark blue color you know of our color palette and the second part when it's behind an image is actually white and then i look further and i realize we have a new input type and i think it's the search bar input and that's a new input type and then we have a new element filter elements here one moment filter elements here and it looks like each filter element has two states one is when they are unpicked and one is when they are picked so in the london case here we have a filter element that is picked and then we have a filter element that is unpicked and then we have some cards and it looks like we have a few different options for them we have cities one moment we have cities we have activities and it looks like each city has a three different image and each active is a three different image so i can see just the cycling right biking biking biking they are just changing its position okay so then let's begin by actually finishing the status bar so i'm gonna create a variant for the status bar first so i am gonna do the same process gonna press f and i'm gonna name this frame status bar and then what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna to pick its color i'm gonna tap i and then i copied the color from the inputs and now what i'm gonna do is i am gonna copy this element and i'm gonna paste it and the reason i copied this element is the designing from myself is i it was an element i actually fetched from an ios kit so usually you have to download the apple's resources to actually get the top status bar their design is very intricate it's much better to fetch them yourself and then change their colors for yourself then it just designed from scratch and i am gonna get this one's color to be blue uh for this one maybe we might need to go for white background and this will be a bit difficult because we have a dark color here and maybe a bit of a lighter color because we will also have a white variation then because the background is white we won't be able to see the white variation so let's pick a background maybe somewhere in the bluish here yeah that might work and so right now i'm gonna detach it it was a component before i'm gonna make it this bar like status bar element i'm gonna make the copy for our sake so i'm gonna now make it a component and uh to do that i am gonna press the shortcut ctrl alt k for windows and then i'm gonna add a variant to it and i know now that we know that the the only difference will be its color so what i'm gonna do is i'm just gonna basically say uh the the properties value the property will be color and we will just pick its color so for color this is dark blue and for this one we will pick white and let's just do that let's just make this white and boom and that works pretty good so that's your status bar all right so for the filter element i'm gonna do the same thing i'm gonna create my frame with the shortcut f and let's put my frame here and i'm gonna name this frame filter filters and then what i'm going to do is basically i am going to create a frame let's say maybe 32 and i'm gonna basically let it have a stroke and i'm gonna give this a 16 pixels for border radius and i want border radius or i want its border color to be blue and then what i want to do is i want to add a text here for its label and let's say london and i want this to be a basically a regular text so i want this to be regular body so let's go to our regular body and let's make this auto wet and i want also this to be have a auto layout so that things always stay at center so i wanted to have an auto layout and i don't want it to hug its content i want it to be maybe i i do want us to hug its content for the wit for its height i'm okay with fixed center so let's think and i want the color of the text to be also the blue and let's see how it works now yep so when so it can it horizontally moves it horizontally increases its bit dynamically but for the height we have a fixed height so that's the i think that looks pretty good to me i'm gonna just check i think this has to be at the center yeah i think maybe eight pixel 8 pixel and e24 yeah i think that looks pretty good i think i like that much much more so now that i actually created a design that i like i want it to actually be a component so i can actually make this element a variant so to give it the superpower of a variant i'm gonna go through the same process of doing the shortcut ctrl alt k to make it a component first and i'm going to rename this filter and then i'm going to add a variant to it and the variant property we are going to use is basically uh picked meaning is the filter element picked or not because that's the only change that's the only attribute that determines the change if the filter element is not picked so this is a no it will look like this if it is picked so we have to swap the fill value so i press shift x and i'm gonna get the blue here and i'm gonna make it white and i think i might also make this bold this time yeah so that looks different and this one has to be yes and yeah that is the filters and now they should also show up so now both of our filters and inputs and status bar show up in the assets which is great for us to actually actually use them on the left side instead of going to their original place now let's move on to let's move on to what else do we need bottom navigation and let's get that going and in this design the button navigation we don't have the other screens for the user profile or settings but in the future if we had wanted to grow the application we will definitely need them and for that reason it's probably a good idea to have a three variants for the bottom navigation to have basically selected different icons all right so let's move on forward with the button navigation and i'm going to create the frame with the f shortcut this should be very familiar together guys now we have done this like 10 times i'm going to name this button navigation and i'm going to take a look at the button navigation and okay so it takes the full width of the screen and i think it's between 48 to 60 pixels and it has three icons inside so what i'm going to do is i'm going to go here and i'm going to press f to create the base and it's going to have 375 pixels for width as that is the vet for the iphone 13 mini and i'm gonna have it a fill color and i'm gonna have it the color blue and now i think it's left top and right top sides have a border radius so i'm gonna definitely do that of maybe 12 so i'm gonna do eight oh 12 no 16 and here 16 nope that wasn't the right one uh 16 no the middle one yes i always forget which one is which maybe not even 16 is enough 32 maybe no i think 16 is the right one eh let's look at back yeah i think 16 is the right one so after this what i'm going to do is and is the 48 right i think it's a bit bigger than 48 i know this this button is 48 and i'm gonna catch with my eye now i think it's i think it's between 48 to 60 probably let's say 54. maybe 56 that's the 56. when in doubt go multiples of four and i don't remember what i designed it to be but it should be somewhere around 56 54 52 maybe but so then what i'm going to do is i'm going to add the icons and to do that i am going to go to our assets and then what i'm going to do is i am actually going to click on the icon set and i'm going to have the compass and i'm done going to have the user profile and then i'm going to have for the third one settings now now that i actually got the content here there is some stuff to do so what i want to do is basically have the left margin of this bottom navigation and the right margin of the bottom navigation to be 24 pixels my mistake that's just a very large zoom out basically if you guys remember how do we show this so i'll shoot four so if you remember our left and right margins is 24 pixels mostly so let's get this to be here so it should be 24 pixels for the left and right and we can show this by in our buttons here actually that's the wrong margin but left is 24 right is 24 and we want to keep that for our bottom navigation as well but we also want these elements between each icon to have equal spacing and to do that we have to actually use auto layout so what i'm going to do is i am going to pick these three icons actually i'm going to pick the frame and i'm going to add an auto layout to it and it's going to basically have the horizontal that is correct if we go vertical it's going to be look like this we want horizontal and we want each content to be centered and then what we want is basically we want this to be maybe we'll just say the left margin to be 24 the right margin to be 24 and it is 46 pixels right now i think we can increase the this to maybe 16 and this to be 16 as well and that's pretty good and maybe 15 14 14 might look better yeah and 14 and then what we can do is now the left and right margin my mistake now the left and right margin is 24 pixels and distance is equal that looks pretty good now what we have to do is make this icon compass selected and that would be the white and i don't want the black color for either of these icons so i would actually make them go dark blue and that's our bottom navigation now that's just write bottom nav and actually to create the variations of this we have to make this a component again ctrl alt k and then i'm going to add two variations for this two more so maybe one more here okay and we should ask ourselves again well what will the property be and property will be the chosen icon so i will write chosen so in the first one the chosen is pretty simple it is the discover in the second one chosen will be profile and the third one it will be settings now the reason i don't write chosen screen is prop like it would just be three dots and it may be it's too large of a text for it to show so chosen still makes sense and now i'm going to adjust the second button navigation element because in this one what's chosen is the user profile and in this one it will be the settings so and yeah i think that works i think the only stuff that we have to change is i think each of these are now two pixels and i really don't want our icons to have two pixels so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go back to the icon set and i'm gonna make these have one pixel width now that we are done with the bottom navigation we can actually go and move on for the image cards all right so let's move on creating the variants for these small image card so if you look at the discover screen here we have kind of two different types of image cards the first one is basically an image that actually showing you the cities like berlin prague amsterdam and in the other cars you actually see the activities so the discovery part one you are picking the city with the cards and discover part two you are picking the activity you are gonna do in that city so that's already two types of variants we can we pick the variant based on its type of whether it's a city or whether it's an activity and that is the way we are going to do but what is also important is if a variant is a city it looks like it has three different types of cities it can be prague it can be berlin and it can be amsterdam and the image looks different depending on what kind of a city it is the same goes for an activity the activity can be eating the activity can be hiking the activity also can be biking so depending not only the type of the cart which is city or activity we also have specific items that we have to account for what's which city is it which activity is it so that's what we are gonna do so let's begin creating the variation now you must be very familiar with this move i'm gonna press f for a frame shortcut and i'm gonna draw this and i'm gonna say image cards and what i'm going to do now is once i named my frame i'm gonna i'm gonna tap the f keyboard keystroke again to draw my card and i'm gonna give this like 156 108 and i'm gonna fill this first with like white background but our white and the background of this whole frame i'm gonna darken it because it's very hard to see right now so i'm gonna press i on windows boom all right so i'm going to add a border radius of 8 pixels and let's see if i missed anything i think there is a bit wider i'm just going to get the sizing from here for this element that is 150 608 oh i got it right huh my eye was correct i'm glad okay so then what i'm gonna do is i'm actually gonna put in the i'm gonna go click it on my right click and i'm gonna use the plugin called on splash so if you haven't installed this plugin you can just go to your home screen and then you can go here in your community again or you can also do menu plugins and then you say browse plugins in community and search for unsplash now this is a very useful plugin as it lets you import images without leaving figma it's a very good idea to have it installed because as designers we have to actually use these kinds of images all the time and you really do not wanna leave your work setting because it actually disrupts your workflow so you can click on this i also it's installed already for me so you will install this and then you come back and you press right click to use it plugins you find it and you click on on splash and then what we can do is we can look for city and then you can pick basically whatever you want i think we had berlin so we can pick berlin here and that looks pretty good what we can also do is we can just zoom out and see what else is there so i am realizing that a card is not just an image but it is also an image with a text on top of it now for us to have that white text i believe we need to add some sort of an overlay to certain images because if the image is too let's say white saturated too light the white font will not be visible so let's see so i'm going to press t for text and i'm going to write berlin and that is a bit difficult to see so what i want is i really want this part of the thing and i want this to be actually so the problem we are having right now is if i add a draw if i because the image is added to the frame if i add an overlay to it will it work actually that looks pretty okay yeah no it does work huh i thought it would also overlay the font but it did not i can still see the font clearly this might be a bug but hey it works so now that it works i am just gonna undo the change and i'm gonna go to where i am i want to be at 12 by 12 probably so 12 by 12 that looks pretty good and i want my font to be here uh basically body font but bold that first and i wanted to have auto bits and i want to check my surroundings and again it's the auto aligning for the aligning for vertical space is a bit harder so you can see the font actually has a one pixel on its left so this actually is 13 pixels in total so i'm gonna move 11 and i'm going to look down and i'm gonna have to move it up two pixels because it has a four pixels bottom oh my bad sorry yes so this and this is actually the 12 pixel look okay now that i actually got my card what i'm going to do is i'm gonna to give it the superpower of variance i have to make the component first i'm going to press my shortcut ctrl alt k to make it a component and i'm going to rename this as image card maybe a large image card image card and i am gonna click on the variance plus button there and boom so ahmet how many variants will we have for this and that is a good question so we already know we will have two different types this is a city or an activity and for each city or an activity we will have three different looks so three plus three is six so that's how much we are gonna have and then i'm also gonna go here and i'm gonna go to this variant i'm gonna remove its image it's overlay and probably it's filled and i am gonna go right click plugins on splash and i'm gonna fetch here prog and if you haven't been to prague you are missing out it's one of my favorite cities i'm just giving it prague is a fantastic city so we have berlin prague what was the third city uh my memory fails me come on come on i'm at the amsterdam okay i've never been to amsterdam i mean i've been to the airport airport is nice i don't know the city but let's go here let's delete this and let's right click plugins unsplash and let's pick amsterdam let's see probably this one i think it's that one i might be wrong but yeah it's that one okay our images look intact that's good so the city picks are done now i am now going to add the activities and i'm gonna add till six here oops my bad all right so i have now my six cards now here okay so the fourth one will be the first activity and let's delete the image delete the overlay and let's make this basically the activity of eating because that's my favorite thing to do i mean what are what else are you gonna do you are gonna walk the city and you are gonna probably eat but there are some people among us who probably like hiking as well well to each to its own so i'm gonna just remove the white as well i'm gonna do plugins and we are gonna pick where is the unsplash here i'm gonna pick hiking all right and that's pretty good and for the last one we are gonna pick biking but to do that we have to remove the image and right click this is getting pretty repetitive right now and i am going to ride biking and i am looking for this dude right here yes all right so let's fix with our fonts first so this is berlin this is prague and this is amsterdam and so if you notice now while we can read berlin pretty easily it's very hard to read prague and one thing we really want to do is we want all of these images to have the same overlay because if this design actually went to production if a frontend developer were to take this project they would probably tell you yeah i will not go through each image and put a different kind of an overlay this has to be general and so you don't want to give them too much work so what you want to do is you want to find your worst case scenario meaning the image that is lightest i believe for cities is amsterdam and for the active it's the berlin one sorry it's the fourth activity it's the biking one and we are gonna try to give these guys to overlay first so that's what i'm gonna do 20 maybe 25 i think 25 will work i think 25 will do the job let's look at amsterdam our second worst case scenario all right yeah 25 works so that's what i'm gonna do five pixel 25 25 overlay for eating as well 25 and that is pretty good so now i'm gonna actually rename these berlin prague amsterdam this is eating this is hiking and this is biking all right so now that we are actually done with the content of the variant what we want to do is we actually want to specify our properties now our properties were twofold meaning the type of the card is a city card or an activity card and the second is its name is it berlin prague amsterdam these are all the names so what i'm gonna do is i'm going to make my property the first property to be type and i'm going to go to the more option here add a new property and i'm going to specify this as name and i'm going to go to my first one and i'm going to specify type to be city because it's a city and the city's name is berlin i'm going to go the second one city name prague and figma will give you sometimes errors if you ever make a mistake so it's now saying it doesn't have it has an invalid name which is what we want to avoid so we gotta give it amsterdam and you wanna now i'm on to the activities so this one won't be city but an activity and it will be the activity of eating oh i'm getting hungry but let's plug along this is hiking and this one is going to be activity biking and i'm going to do a quick overview activity hiking that's correct always double check your work city amsterdam city prague see the world that actually looks pretty good and though that is your variance and just for the final check you can go to your assets and now you can actually see let's open this a bit you can see the image cards right here as an asset that's fantastic all right guys so this part of the tutorial is done oh now we are going to update our input fields to add the search field as well and let's begin by analyzing how it looks like on the discover screen so what i'm going to do is i'm going to click my screen i'm going to press shift 0 to zoom 100 percent and off the bat what i'm realizing is this if i'm comparing this with the login input field such as the email and password i realize that the height of the element and the width of the total element is the same as 48 pixels 48 pixels 327 327 pixels now search field also has a placeholder just like the email and the name fields here and the difference it has is it has a button that is right aligned inside at the search button and that's the one difference that it has and it also can have the actual value in our design such as when a user actually does an input or picks a filter element the placeholder is replaced by the actual text label what does this mean so right now in our input variants we only have the placeholder version for the my bad sorry guys we only have the placeholder version right for the name or the email we do not have an actual value version where how the user would see this input field if they had already put in a value so that's also something we are going to add and we are going to add this to almost every element except password because in terms of user experience standpoint it is not a good idea to add a placeholder to the past password field because it is not that recognizable you probably want to put it just a line to your label like probably around around here if we were to put it to say 6 or 12 characters like give some constraints on how the password should actually contain but it's not a good idea for consistency to just do a bad user experience so we are not going to have the password field have a placeholder but let's begin by adding our search field and i am going to make this basically search city or activity and what i'm going to then do is i'm going to press r for shortcut i'm going to do this drag it it's 40 pixels height probably and 64 pixels width and i'm going to give it the standard 8 pixel border radius that we have and i'm gonna change its color to our blue and that already looks good i'm gonna make it go align for shift and maybe not that much but i'm gonna zoom in to see how am i doing four four maybe four four four that looks pretty good and then i'm gonna click on this element and what i'm going to do is i'm gonna right click go to plugins because i want to add my search wait why am i doing that i already have in my assets field my icon set so i can just drop this bad boy in i can bring the search here boom and that looks pretty good i'm gonna give it the color of white and i'm gonna center these two okay that's pretty good and i might even group these things and i don't need them to be framed like search button and that's pretty good and then i'm going to look and zoom out a bit that looks pretty good so what's this going to be is this is going to be search but now as we said before only type property will not be enough because we also want to differentiate if an input has a placeholder or an actual text so i'm going to have to add another property so i'm going to my variants and i'm going to go to the more options and i'm going to click i'm going to click on the add new property and i'm going to say placeholder and if it's a yes and for this one it will also be a yes and let's actually show some versions of how these things would look like so i'm going to have new one for the text and one more for the email so and i'm gonna move this up and this is the hassle with the variants i wish they had a drag drag and drop right it would just resize recenter itself vertically but it doesn't so i'm gonna drop these yep and this one will be the no placeholder and this time it is actually going to be like jason mamoa and it is actually going to have dark yes that's how it's going to look like this is where a user has actually put in their name and right now we have the email and i'm going to move this as well this is going to be the email input field with an actual value not a placeholder and aligning these things is a bit difficult but we will do a polish soon so this is no and email yes place i don't know and what we want here is this is email and what we want this to be also is basically jason hot mail.com and i want this to be dark blue boom and that looks pretty good then what i want to do is i will not give the second type for password in an actual production we would actually have password show and not show but in this application we are not using that variant so i'm not gonna add it no need to go over perfectionistic here but i'm gonna add the second version of the search so in this search we have a search and the placeholder is yes and in the second one which i'm gonna delete because i'm gonna pick this and if i press but like plus it will duplicate it which is pretty good for figma and it will be london and that will be dark blue and that looks pretty good i kind of like it and that's now basically align these things basically space them pretty good maybe distribute them vertical spacing yep and get them left aligned that looks better okay so we are done with the adding the search input field and we added the other options for our name and email field such as adding the option type a placeholder or not now i think we are ready to actually design the discover screen and let's do that in the next video guys oh now the long waited moment of actually designing the new screen and let's zoom in let's do shift 2 to zoom in and this is our screen and we have a status bar which we already created the variants for we have a text big title text asking where does the user want to go and then we have a search field we have the filters and then we have the favorite cities as the city is the first thing a user will pick before an activity oops my bad and so let's do that so what i'm going to do is i'm going to press on f and i'm going to pick iphone mini and i'm going to drag the one that is created to here i know our design actually document is getting crowded we have to actually move things around a bit but i just want to do this screen first before we do that maybe finish the discovery part too as well so now what we will do is basically we will go to our assets and because we already did the heavy lifting i'm just gonna pick stuff i'm gonna go to my i'm gonna click on the status bar i'm gonna drag one here and i'm gonna basically zero for x 0 for y and that looks actually pretty good then what i want to do is i want to press t for creating a text field shortcut and i want to write jason where do you want to go and i know already that the type for this will be bold header so that looks pretty good and i do not want this to be out of it because it would what could happen is it would actually go over the whole screen because it's too wide so what i can do is i can give this an auto height and i want this to be left aligned obviously and let's zoom in here a bit and i want this to have the color of dark blue and that looks pretty good and around here is pretty good and where do you want to go and that looks pretty good so far so then what i want to do is i want to add the search field so for that i wanna okay so for this and again the what's happening is all right the it's the media recording software i'm using is bugging the figma because it's basically overlaying it in front of it and that is pissing me off but hey we did it so this one will actually be a search and look at that look and then we will have our filters and i am going insane with my recording tools guys i never thought this would be a problem but hey if you are using a recording to irish there was an option to pull it to the maybe top side that would be fantastic but it's it happens it's not that perfect for only so i have my filter element now and what i'm looking at this design screen is we basically have a horizontal scrolling view option means basically the user understands they can actually tap with their thumb and move to swipe to right or left to move left or right and that is only shown as a signal when the some half part of this filter element is actually hidden so the user understands visually okay for me to see the remaining part i need to swipe so that part is very important so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna have four i'm gonna double duplicate this two three and maybe four times but first let's make this istanbul so istanbul and what other cities do we have we have vienna and new york okay so let's make this vienna and let's make the last one new york and that one can be new york here i'm double okay fingma is bugging a bit new york and that's good and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to select all of these and i'm going to frame them and then i'm going to maybe make 24 pixel and i'm going to move the x here okay that's too much maybe 12 i think 12 is the right i think 12 looks pretty good there maybe yeah 12 looks pretty good i'm gonna check the distance between the top elements and i want the search field to be at the 24 pixel i want the text to be at the 24 pixel and maybe around here and that's pretty good and then what i want to do is i want to actually group all these guys into a frame and that is with ctrl alt g and i will rename this as filters and that's pretty good so now i'm gonna go maybe one pixel up because it's 24 pixel it's consistency with the left and right margin that is pretty neat so i'm gonna go what else am i missing i think we are missing the i think the half of the screen is done we might have some spacing issues we might polish later on but let's just add the new text now so i'm going to press t for the text shortcut and i'm going to write favorite cities and what i'm going to do is i am going to pick for this color dark blue and for the text size i think i'm going to go with the sub header bold and i can make this out of it because it's not that big enough to actually go overflow of the screen and once we have our sydney text i can now add the cards which we already created the variants of so that's handy so i'm gonna put myself here for you guys to see and oh i'm gonna pick this one here all right so we put our cards here and now just like the filter element our cards are also horizontally scrollable and we do the same basically signaling saying because half of the card is actually not seen on the screen the user understands i have to swipe and that's exactly what we are gonna do as well so this is gonna be here and i'm gonna do this and i'm gonna do this and now what we want to do is we want to grab these three and make them a frame so we can actually add some auto layout so i'm gonna go layers and i'm gonna name this as favorite cities i think i think thing might put it outside of our iphone frame i'm going to put it in i think that bug kinda tried to ping my sometimes bugs a bit so what we want to do now is we want to add an auto layout here of maybe 24 pixels that's that's too much maybe 16 maybe 12. i think 12 does the job and we want to center these and we probably want them to be centered here and now what i want to check for is our alignment for the text so i'm gonna press shift r and i'm gonna get it here and we are almost there but i think i think for the text we are good i think for the text inside the status bar we can do a bit more left but it doesn't matter too much because it's something outside of our control we don't design these these are given by the apple so i i don't have a problem with that part okay so now our alignment looks pretty okay for the vertical now then what we can do is we can actually pick the cities so the first is amsterdam berlin and prague so this one is amsterdam berlin and proc and that's pretty good so i'm gonna check its distance to the top that should probably be closer than 24 pixels maybe 16 would work pretty good here and i'm gonna get even closer maybe so what i'm trying to see is what's the bottom spacing here it's i think four pixels so if i get it to 12 it will actually be 16 pixel difference so that looks pretty good i'm gonna click on it i zoomed out too much shift two okay so this looks pretty good i'm gonna add the favorites to these text and so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna so cities this is favorite cities cards so if i were to put this text here you wouldn't see the text because it would actually try to auto layout the text as well so that's not what you want to do what you want to do is actually we have to go back what you want to do is you want to close this cities frame and you want to frame these two as well and that will be favorite cities that's pretty good so now we can actually duplicate it by pressing alt and drag and we are gonna do that with shift so it doesn't change and that looks pretty good so let's see so one thing i want to make sure we have is our bottom navigation as well and you can you see how easy it is to add these things once you have created the variants already and oh i think our bottom navigation width is wrong so it might be a good idea to go back and check it so it should be the whole screen so that should be 375 pixels so i'm gonna look at here and i'm like okay so mod would be 126. okay that's too much so for here what we want to do is i think for the vet we want it to be fixed and that should be 375 pixel and for each of these also the bits should be fixed it should be 375 pixels so let's do that and these mistakes happens guys design is an ongoing process nobody does it perfectly one thing i learned from my once i turned this into a fulltime career and i'm a fulltime aux designer we always make mistakes and you making a mistake is actually your opportunity to learn something and develop so do not judge yourself as harshly when you make mistakes we all do it's not an if but when and your reaction to your mistakes will actually determine your outcome you can choose to learn from them so i now learned how to that i should double check my bit when it's for variants so i'm going to go back to the to my nav screen i'm going to rename it to be discovery discover part one and for the second part we have top picks for cities so this should be top picks and the third one should be let's see under eyes okay so then what we can do is so i'm gonna check the distance between these two that should be 24 pixels maybe well it's also related so maybe 16 as well so then this one is also 16 and that looks okay maybe we can go so in here i did 24 okay i understand because they are each separate so maybe 10 so what i'm doing is if i press shift it just does double so it just actually does 10x so it moves 10 pixels down or up so i'm trying to get to 24. so my math is failing me and so in this one the in the second one the images so while we are using the same cities we are changing their uh location so this one will be berlin this case and in this one this will be berlin and then what is the middle so amsterdam is the middle so amsterdam here is the middle part and this one will be prague yeah and that looks pretty good to me i'm gonna do shift i'm gonna just move zoom out a bit and that looks pretty good i'm gonna check my spacing so all of these can go one pixel up for 24 pixel yep that's pretty good that is pretty good and yeah all these can go one pixel up because it's a 25 pixel there and yeah maybe maybe one more so maybe everything in here can go one more pixel up and that looks pretty good i'm just gonna check the high so 68 therefore y 68 here yeah that is perfect so that is our discovery part 1 screen and we can also do the second part very easily what we will do is we will duplicate this screen and we will rename this discover part 2 and what we can do is we can actually pick a city here and the top i picked london but i want to pick istanbul my hometown so i am gonna actually go here i will swa i will toggle it one thing figma does very well on variances if you actually created the variant property and gave it the value yes or no it actually understands that it shows it as a toggle so yes no it's istanbul and then what i want to do here is we have a placeholder now and this should be not text but search and so one thing it doesn't have oh so i think we made a mistake here i think we didn't create the search field well so let me see here so what is this field search yes okay so in some part here we actually made the type search and placeholder yes have two different uh mappings meaning there's some another element that also has the same values here so let's quickly search search yes okay so this is okay this is yes search this is search placeholder now okay so now the mistake should be resolved actually so if we go here we say search placeholder now and we can type this to be istanbul that is pretty good and that is our second pick guys it is our second discover screen that looks pretty good to me and yes i will see on the next video so let's move on to the actual detail screen i'm going to zoom into it by pressing shift 2 and this is after we picked a city and we picked activity this is the screen we see and i'm looking at the screen and we already have the status bar we already have the icon for this we have the background image which where we know we can use unsplash to actually get it and we have the text here but one thing we do not have is we do not have these avatars and this is meaning these profile pictures with the labels below them that tells the user who who are attending and what are their names who will you meet and we also don't have the the small link here so if you look at this link like this cmore and call is a bit different cmore is basic it's going to extend but sealed is probably going to create a popup co is almost like a button here and it's something we call a tetriary button where it's not even a secondary button with the stroke around and with the background like in our large button let me show you so it's not even this but it's almost like it doesn't have a background it's just a text with the underline on it but it still functions as a button then we have these cards which we don't have so it looks like we have three four things here we need to do the avatars variants so that we can actually have multiple versions of this you probably need a small button variations right now we only have large button variations but we know in the next screens especially here we will need smaller versions of those buttons and that's an entirely new category itself so they will have to be a new variant group and then we will need these cards these benefit cards i believe like this activity is cost friendly or this activity can make you friends or something else so let's begin with the avatar variation so what i'm going to do is i am going to zoom out a bit and i'm gonna play press f for short key for frame and i am going to title this frame as avatar images and then i'm going to do shift 2 to zoom in and i'm going to press all for a shortcut for a circle shape and i'm going to make this basically 48 by 48 and i just want to check if it is 48 let me check it looks like 60. is it 60 i want to see it is 60. okay not wrong because 48 look just a bit small to my eyes so let's do 60. and one thing i want to do is i want this circle to first not actually have a fill and i want to right click and use my plugin user profile which will actually give us random profiles now ah to actually install the user profile plugin i want you to click on top menu go to plugins we did this before now actually installing a plugin and and then what you can write here is user profile and once you're done i want you to filter by plugin not files and then i want you to install the first one here and then come back so once you install you can actually use the plugin now so right click go to plugins and go to your user profile and you have a few options now i want male female i don't care and i want to insert a random photo and then what i want is i want to press and i want to write here what does this guy look like he looks like an anton i do not know why but he does so i'm gonna make this a body regular and then i'm going to center these guys and i'm going to press both of them and i am actually going to frame these two together so i can create them a component and then make them a variant so this is my frame of uh maybe large avatar because i know in the later screens we will have a small avatar so large avatar and then now the next thing i want to do is i want to actually make this a component so i'm going to press ctrl alt k for shortcut and now it's a component and i'm going to add a new variant what is the attribute we are doing basically depending on the name of the person their looks is going to change now of course two people can have the same name and their face will not be the same but not for our avatars if the name is different they are probably going to have a different image okay so real life exceptions don't count so i'm going to right click by selecting the circle i'm going to go to user profile and i'm going to insert another random photo awesome and that looks like to me mary i'm literally judging stock photos here but that happens that's life so i'm gonna click right i'm gonna go plugins again user profile the same okay george and one thing you can do here is actually is you can do an auto layout for vertical and then you can center and this is a very good idea for each of them because like we see here if the name gets too long we stopped being centered and you have to then spend time centering things and that is not an ideal use of our time so i'm gonna do auto layout and i'm gonna center each of these maybe two pixels yeah 2 pixels might do the trick actually and add the auto layout center and 2 pixels there we go okay so george is good let's add a new one and i'm just gonna add a new one so five is good enough so let me replace these as well okay all right i'm gonna name this guy luke and i'm gonna name him matthew alright so this looks pretty good so we have the avatars now and now one thing we don't have is well we have the content we haven't specified the property or the values so right now if we were to actually create like fetch an instance here we would not we would just have variant two variant three those are not name those are not values that we could actually remember six months later when we are going to use this variant and say what is variant for but the name is much more memorable so that's what we are gonna do now the property is going to be name obviously so name and then i'm gonna go through each and i'm gonna give them the name anton mary and this process might actually be boring but it really pays off guys because this is the only repetition we will do anything else we will do is when we are going to use this on design is just drag and drop all right i think i'm pretty good with my avatar images and i think they look pretty good all right so let's move on to create the next set of variance and i want to do the small button versions basically i want this this is our one of the tertiary version of our button and on here we have the secondary and the primary so i'm going to zoom out here and i believe we do not have for the small buttons a disabled version i think we might actually add it a disabled version might actually work well so what i'm going to do i'm going to actually buttons here and i am going to add this variant to the buttons but what i'm going to do is i am actually going to inside here i'm going to click on the frame and i'm going to press f to create create the surrounding box for my small button and this is probably gonna be 32 pixels maybe 96 starting i mean it will have a auto layout but let's say 32 pixels and 8 pixels border radius okay so what we will now do is we can fill it with let's say white but probably blue all right so let's get this and let's put the text on it let's say done oops sorry guys my typing skills are not that good today and done and bodybuild that is pretty good i want this to be out of it and i'm gonna have it here and i'm gonna click on my frame here and i'm gonna rename it as i'm gonna rename it as small button perfect and then i'm going to add an auto layout on it and i probably want to make its vet for now fixed and centered like maybe it can grow but i just want this to be like yeah that looks pretty good to me actually it's in version that looks pretty good i just want to make sure i want to double check if i got the height right and it looks like i did get the height right maybe it can be a bit wider right this is a bit wider so maybe we can do that make this a bit wider and the other label we can use cancel that is actually a bit longer so what we can do here is we can center it and maybe do 32 32 and maybe not make it fixed and that might be pretty working and let's see if we add text it will actually dynamically resize it well so that's good because we want the cancel to actually have the same padding as well but let's make the height of it fixed and let's make that center okay because i will make this a compound by pressing ctrl alt k and now it's a component i can make this a variant boom so this is our primary button and how we are going to do this is basically we are going to have just like our large button we are going to have an active state or a priority state and because in the future if we don't know if our small buttons can also be disabled so for now we can just add them and in the future they might actually come useful so let's add the property active and then i'm going to click on this more options button to add a new property and the second property will be priority all right so okay so i'm going to go to the first one now and this is active that is yes and priority primary and i want this to be our secondary button so i'm gonna click on the button and i'm gonna press shift x to actually switch the fill value with the stroke value and i'm gonna click on that label and i'm gonna pick blue and i think we have to make this our white here yes so this works pretty good and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to press to create another variant but before that i am going to say yes for active but priority is secondary and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to create third theory and for that what i will do is i will actually i will get probably i might get rid of the surrounding uh i might get rid of the surrounding button here so what i will do is i'm just gonna come here i don't want a stroke value there and i want to resize it to the i want to resize the surrounding frame to the width and height of the text so i'm gonna hold alt and i'm just gonna yep maybe a bit larger so just a bit larger so that it doesn't cut off the labels and that is our third here button so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna click here and okay and let's go up here and say active yes and priority tertiary which is a very hard word and let's check if this one also goes out of bounds okay so one problem we have here is this if we actually increase the width of the element it doesn't increase with the element itself meaning the auto layout doesn't resize so let's check if we have the auto layout so let's look at here yep probably want to hug its content it's just maybe we can reduce the padding it has yeah so this might work better actually yes this works better so how about we do it this way and one thing we want to do one more thing is we want to underline this so i'm going to go to its label and i'm gonna go where is it so that is correct where do we underline this i am searching on figma all right this style alignment now maybe control you now okay so let's go here text underline hmm i think for some reason this did not work why would that be okay for some reason the underline doesn't work i do not know why it doesn't work so far but we can figure this out later i will figure this out on my own this is the this is the small buttons we have so i'm going to rename these as small button that's correct and this one is large button and we should be able to see it in the assets and let's close the editor images button navigations and if we scroll down and move on the bottoms we have now the large button and the small button and that's perfect i will see you in the next video all right so we are going to design the benefits cards in the details screen but i want to tell you that i found a problem with underline here so if i'm clicking the text and i look at the more options i can see that it is actually selected as underlined so the problem is we do not have enough margins at the bottom to show the underline and to actually do that we have to go back to the frame of the label and if you look at here our vertical spacing is fixed so first we have to actually make it a hug content and the moment we did our height stretched a bit to the surrounding margins that we had specified and now what we can do is we can reduce these to the minimum amount that will still be enough to show the what would you say to show the elements underline an element itself and that looks pretty good and then what we can do is we can actually make the now we can actually make the height fixed and that is yep that works that works that's the one so we have our underline there now so we can move on so now i will move to the details screen here and our so our secondary button our small button is done as a variant our avatar is done now if you can see here these are our cards our button overflows them actually because our booking now button actually has a primary importance but actually in the background you can see these cards listen like what is special what is the benefit of this let's say activity why are all these people going and so for that what we have visually is a basically a white rectangle white background we have a text at the center of it that is vertical and then we have a icon on the right side in a circle that is enclosed with a circle so that is what we are going to design so i'm going to go and press f we are going to make this a variant as well as you know because we might have different variations and i'm going to name this benefit card and i actually am also going to get its color to be with eye to this one because it has it is going to be a white rectangle it's hard to see on a white background as well so i'm gonna press f and i know the vitalfit with the circle is 327. so if you pay attention here you zoom out a bit let me go back so you can see that the button which is a 327 pixel width has the same width as the card but for the card you have the rectangle and the circle at the right top side so it is the rectangle plus the circle size that ends up having the same bit as the large button we have so we gotta calculate the size of the circle as well it's probably 24 pixels but it's at the middle part so the calculation is a bit tricky so that's why what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna fill it with white immediately and i'm gonna give it a stroke here the same stroke we use 4 to 16 10 pixels and i'm gonna make this also have eight whoa all right and we probably want this to be like 48 as well that is too much what's happening so maybe 256. yeah that kind of looks okay but maybe we can get this to be a bit longer and i am literally just exploring sizes here maybe this can be 32 32 and i know its color is actually the blue that we use so if i were to add this here if i were to look at both of these frames okay how do they look like right now so this is going to be the card background and this one will have a text inside of it that will say let's just copy and paste the text there so let's just ctrl c come back here yep okay wait where is that circle okay that circle is there i think the text disappeared i'm gonna recreate it and i'm gonna paste this okay then i can actually make this out of it that's good and i'm gonna make this text to actually have the style of a normal body it is regular perfect and let's look at it so it's 15 15 i want it to be 12 and centered and again centering is usually difficult with vertically as we talked about let's look at the spacing here three and a half four in the bottom so we are much more biased uh for the bottom so we want a bit more on the top so that looks pretty okay yes so that looks a bit more centered and now what i want is i want this button to actually have an icon as well so i'm going to go here nope i already have my icons in the assets panel and i am going to pick the money and that kind of looks a bit too big what i will do now is i will actually head over to our icon set and i'm going to resize some of the icons because as we talked about so here where we made the icons components so as we talked about while the surrounding box of the icons are the same the sizing can actually change and we might want to have different sizes so this one is actually like let's see so let's see the inside elements for the dollar sign i'm gonna go layers and that's 12 14 that's 22. so i want this actually to be resized and i wanted to have i want to use my icon resizer frame how you can install this you can go to plugins and then you go again browse plugins in the community and then you can type here icon resizer and then you will go on plugins filter and then you can install it and once you install it come back to here click on plugins and go to icon resizer and this lets you specify an icon box site which is 24 pixels which we want and maybe the maximum height to be 16 and that's pretty good and i'm going to do that for most of my icons here so i'm going to do icon resizer probably 16 and i'm gonna probably do it for this one as well plugins icon resizer 16 okay and that looks pretty okay so far i won't do it for my bottom navigation or these i think those two or three will be enough yeah i think those two or three is enough so let's go back and actually add our actually delete actually now that you can see it actually shrunk a bit which is good we are going to pick its color right and that kind of works so now i am going to actually group the ellipse with the dollar sign okay so what i'm going to do is i'm going to rename this as the benefit icon and now what i'm going to do is i am going to frame i'm gonna get the card background frame and the group and i'm gonna frame these as well so i'm gonna press ctrl alt g for frame and this is gonna be my benefit card and then i'm actually going to make this a component and i'm going to add a variant perfect and my second variant is going to be let's look and before adding the second variant i think we forgot to check the size okay so our size is still pretty small so what we can do is so i know this circle actually will be half the it's with inclusion it to add its width we are only adding the half of its bit to the total because it is at the inside of the card a bit and that is like 16 pixels 327 pixels is the total width v1 so this should actually become 311. so and then this circle should move so let's make this move 10 pixels okay and let's let's also increase this sure okay so this is getting a bit buggy okay so right now it's not centered yet correctly i think okay so this is 32 i think that is pretty correct so far okay so let me see the total with here 326. so maybe we are missing in okay i think this can be now correct okay 327 64 pixels i think that is right i want to see if the height of this element was 48 pixels it might be 32 in the actual design let's see let's go back and let's zoom in and let's see inside that was 50 actually okay so that's actually pretty long element i will keep it at 50 i will keep it at 48. and that is our element so now we can just add the second variant and i'm gonna get it to be a bit closer and this one is actually going to have an attribute of benefit and this one is going to be budget friendly and this one is basically going to be maybe exercise and i'm going to get the text for the second one as well from our screens so yep so i'm gonna just ah just yes okay let's say this active helps you burn calories figma is breaking out a bit so i'm just gonna say this activity helps you burn calories 30 and that is a very weird saying activity helps you burn calories and that looks pretty good i'm gonna replace this icon inside as well so i'm gonna add the icon of the exercise here and i'm gonna change its color to white and that is perfect so that is pretty good i think that does look pretty good but let's see i don't think that's putting the same so i'm going to just get this to be here and yeah that is our benefit cards guys let's see if we forgot anything i don't think we have that looks pretty good only thing we have to do is make this exercise that's good i think we can now actually begin designing the detail screen all right now that we have actually designed the variants we need for the details screen we can actually begin and design the details copy screen so what i'm going to do is i'm going to press f for shortcut frame and i'm going to click on iphone 13 mini and i'm gonna rename this as details copy and what i'm gonna do is so basically first i need a status bar so i'm going to my assets and i'm going to close my icon set inputs and just going to grab a status bar here and i'm going to put it to zero 0 and so one of the things i'm realizing is we need a basically a rectangle element for the background image so i'm going to make this 375 pixels maybe it's like 192. might be a bit bigger than that one but i'm gonna make this go zero zero and i will go to layers and i'm gonna rename this background and then what i'm going to do is i am actually going to go plugins and i'm going to add an image here from the unsplash and it is the same image we had for biking and yeah so that's the image i'm going to add and maybe 256 instead of yes that looks better and i know that this needs an overlay so i'm going to add an overlay percent actually looks good maybe 25 and that looks bigger and now i'm gonna zoom in with shift two and i'm gonna compare here so what i need right now is so i'm going to move the status element above the image so it will actually show and i want the status bar to be basically white and that looks pretty good and then what i need is the back chevron icon so that the user can actually go back so i'm gonna go to my assets to my icon set and i'm gonna get the chevron left icon here i'm gonna put it around there and i'm gonna basically select its color to be white and that's pretty good so far then i will add my text for biking and then i will add my load um some text so i'm gonna copy this and i'm gonna t and i'm gonna just copy and paste here and this is probably gonna be just a regular and then what i'm going to do is i need for the location my location icon and for the pricing i need my dollars icon so for that i am gonna bring my dollars icon here and for the location i'm gonna pick my map icon and that looks pretty good so i'm gonna look up and i'm literally just adding the stuff we need like the bottom navigation so i will just move my profile here so i'm like bottom navigation and you can go in any order you want for these i just know let's see if this is complete bottom yes i think this is it for it yep i think that is vertically and horizontally centered let's just zoom in a bit to see if we are actually centered at well maybe we went overboard a yes that is the correct coordinates and then we have a basically a long paragraph with about but let's finish the basic card design with the activity background there so i'm gonna get another t for london ontario location and i'm gonna make this autobit and i'm gonna make sure this is regular and then i'm gonna make sure it is actually white here and i'm gonna make sure that the location icon is also white perfect and then i am gonna make sure biking is actually a regular header 34 bold and i'm gonna make it out of it as well and we are getting there i believe we are getting there pretty good now in the original design there are some mistakes that i'm not repeating here like this sharing icon to match the other icons actually should be is 2 pixel but in the new design we decided that we want each stroke to be one pixel so that's okay and i'm looking i think i'm also missing this 38 dollar person yes and so let's begin arranging some stuff and i'm gonna basically put this at 24 and what i want to do is i actually want to see the layout so i'm going to do alt shift 4 oh that didn't happen so ctrl shift 4 sorry yes ctrl shift 4 to see the layout columns we have and in this one so what i want is i want a layout grid i want to do columns 5 margin 24 that's also 24 maybe 16. yeah that works so based on this i now know how to actually align my items and so it should be around here and this one because like we said a horizontal alignment is also sometimes difficult because you see the fonts which is starting from here the actual font is for the biking b starts here so there's like three pixels of empty space and when you are aligning things those three pixels matter so that is how the proper alignment would work and this is around there so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to get london ontario and location icon and basically move all of them just a bit yes so that mattress maybe get the london ontario a bit closer and i'm gonna make these centered that's pretty good and now what i'm looking for is what's the distance i think it should be around 12 to 16 pixels there so i'm gonna group these i'm gonna actually frame these so this is the location location info and this one so for this one where did our i think we had a dollar icon but it disappeared oh it's there i just didn't change its color so let's get it to white and let's frame this with ctrl g and let's just go to layers and let's say price info for them i'm like okay and let's move this here and let's make our stream smaller and what i want to do is i actually want to do an auto layout to our frames and this i'm going to center them and that's pretty good and i'm going to basically press ctrl or i think no i think it looks pretty good right yeah i think what's the distance between these two that's one pixel i think it can be so if you zoom in the surrounding so the icon inside the locations is like four five six pixels away so maybe two pixels would make it eight so i'm gonna make this two and i'm gonna add an auto layout here too i'm gonna center it and i'm gonna make this two as well and then i'm going to get these to be aligned and i'm gonna zoom in again and these have to be moving to left a bit so that we have a left alignment with the biking this one needs to be moving here yes and then i am gonna get this a bit closer not that close but somewhere around here yeah somewhere around here would work what's the distance here so that's eight pixels ten and i wanna look at here two four six seven that's 18 pixels so maybe one two back and that should be around 16 and that looks pretty good so now what i'm going to check is the distance between here that is let me zoom out a bit that is four pixels eight pixels plus 11 here and that's 1922 23 that is too far away so what i'm gonna do now is that i am actually gonna go up and compare and contrast so you can see how our bottom here is 24 left is 25 that's something we want to do as well so i'm gonna decrease the height here a bit and i'm going to check its contrast that's too much so this should actually be from 24 in the left to 24 at the bottom so and now that we align the height of it to the actually baseline in the second line this is actually pretty accurate 28 pixels is a pretty accurate tire so i'm gonna maybe 24 perfect and i'm gonna get both of these to be down as well maybe here 15 and 19 so maybe one two three that's pretty good and i'm gonna get this down as well and that is three eight and up three eight two that's fifteen to sixteen maybe one more up and at sixteen and that's pretty good so what i will do now is i'm gonna actually look out and decide if the position if the positioning of the arrow icon is pretty good and i think it is like we can always get this time to the left like we have it above here but that is actually in the production not in our control like these are things that you get custom from the apple ios kit so you actually don't have much control there all right so onward to the second part i'm gonna press shift two to zoom in and what i'm gonna do is i am gonna press t for text shortcuts and i'm gonna write about and i'm gonna actually go and copy all this paragraph till here actually all of them actually yes here copy all of them and i'm going to basically press t again draw one and then paste all that text all that websome text and i'm gonna make this basically go regular 15 left aligned it and now one thing that actually we might need to do here is we might need the 15 pixels here it's let's just finish the let's do the header first because i think our spacing is a bit different so you can see here we are a bit spacious and we are at 17 pixels so maybe not the body regular but maybe regular here that looks a bit better yeah so i think this height is a bit better and what i'm going to do is i am going to pick this as bold sub header and i'm going to make this go out of it and i'm gonna make sure that our color here is dark blue and then i'm gonna go up and i'm gonna do the attendees as well so i'm gonna drag this header with the alt press and i'm gonna basically write here a 10 these 34. i'm going to make a left line here and i'm gonna also make this go out of it and maybe here it's a pretty good idea then what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna add our avatars you didn't think we would use them did you so i'm gonna go here move my profile and i'm gonna go avatar and i'm gonna add them here so this is anton and let's see how many we have there we are roughly five four six and because we can see a beginning of my next hours are just at the edge of the screen so that signals to the user that you can actually swipe that's exactly what we are gonna do we are gonna then have six avatars so let's do two three four five six and let's select all of them and make them a frame ctrl alt g and then we will write this as avatar frame and we want the auto layout so we can add spacing around tanks maybe 16 pixels and we definitely want to center things and we yes we definitely want to center things and now we we probably want them to be around here something let's actually how do we center this thing so let's let's see i think this is the center for us that's not quite right so let's think this through maybe 12 pixels because i remember how it looked and okay so is it true that we got six of them yes so maybe 24 okay so our spacing is too small so maybe 24. let's see so yeah i think 24 is the spacing we used 24 is a bit too much and it's you know i'm not respecting the horizontal distance here so because in here it was 12 i think 12 will work better so i would much rather ask to have 12 around here so i'm just gonna do okay so that's 25 to 20. so maybe let's check now that's true okay i went the wrong way to three that's 21 2 okay so let's see maybe minus 22.5 and that's perfect and now let's pick everything to be different so let's pick this to be mary let's pick this to be george let's pick this to be look or matthew and lo no let's pick that matthew and let's anton again and that's fine so and the distance between the avatar and the attendees should be roughly 24 pixels but we will get there so next i think what we need before we space things up is actually get everything we need so we need a small territory button here so i'm gonna select the details go to assets again and we will go to buttons now and we will get a small button and we will make sure that it is active but territory and that will be like see all all and let's see okay so here's a mistake so so we needed to be hugging its contents but then why is it not hugging the content of c all so what did we do here maybe we gave it a second okay it's because we made it not have auto of it but no it should have auto of it so okay so that looks pretty good see all here is that right okay so maybe like the initial s is capitalized which is fine all right and maybe this one's too okay so that's a bit better let's enter this a bit up all right and let's check it here we need the cards for the benefits and so i'm gonna open here and i'm gonna definitely get my benefit card right here all right so my benefit card is there and i'm gonna get rid of the the columns there ctrl shift four okay that looks a bit better and so one thing that i want to check is what is the color of this details copy and it should match our white here that's good okay so this should be 24. yep and so i'm gonna get this up as well i'm gonna check so this should so there is a bottom margin here of four pixels so this should be like twenty one two three four okay that looks pretty good and then what i'm going to do is i am actually gonna get this up as well so i'm gonna check 24 and it's this for this paragraph i don't need to go and check because it's line height matches where the frame where its actual height is so 24 pixels per tag 24 pixel there is actually 24 pixels so then what i'm going to do is i am gonna press ctrl shift 4 just to see where i should have ended here and i'm going to zoom in a bit so this should be a bit to the right yes i think that is correct and maybe down yes that works i'm to move my profile here and then i'm going to check the distance between there that is also 4 pixels so that should be also 20 because 4 plus 20 equals 24 which is the distance we are looking for that's good and then i'm gonna make this to be 24 but i'm gonna get this height to be nope my bad set i'm gonna check maybe 24 here and then i'm gonna copy and paste it here like that so it's like so i can drag it here and i'm gonna go layers the problem right now we have is that the benefit card is above the bottom navigation which is not what we want so i'm gonna pick the bottom nav here oh my bad guys i'm gonna pick the bottom nav here and actually move it up so it is actually above the benefit cards it's around here and i want this to be exercise and i want the distance between these two yep i want the distance between these two to be i think i think around here let me just move things here yeah so i think we can give it this height i think we need a bit more height here so i'm gonna make things smaller so now i can actually move these two up and i'm gonna check that's 24 i think for this we need 20 that's 20 and for these we will get them up two that's 24 and for this i want 16 as they are the same elements and that's pretty good then what i can do is i am gonna get my so i'm gonna check how far away am i and i think i'm missing a bit so okay so with avatar in the previous app i actually had just 16 pixels and with this i just had okay so i just had 16 pixels there so maybe because attendees is related to the avatar that makes sense to maybe move them up a bit so one two three four five six seven eight and that should give me 16 pixels there and but these for these i am gonna move up yep and that is pretty good okay so now i'm gonna add my main button logan i'm gonna add here and this should be 24 pixel to the navigation so it should be one two three four five six and that should be the book now okay that's good and again the main difference we are having here is i'm going to press shift 2 and press shift 2 so i am looking here and i'm gonna change its color to be one moment i made a mistake i'm gonna change the text color to be here dark blue that is fine it is blue that is blue and yeah i think those are pretty good i think i'm gonna get rid of the columns now and let me check that looks pretty good compared to our original sample i think our coloring still hasn't updated but let's do maybe white 100 yeah that looks pretty good yeah i think for some reason we are not getting this color i don't know why like this is the white color isn't updating well i will figure that out later but for now this works i like it i think it's a bit more spacious than what we have here but i still like it and one thing that it has here is this yeah overall it looks pretty good i would say so i think it all looks pretty good yeah i'm proud that looks pretty good all right so that is the details copy guys i'm gonna check here that looks pretty good i think these two need to be centered yep that looks better i think that's the only part but yeah i think this looks pretty good i'm very proud and in the next one we will go on to the variant so we can actually begin the scheduling screens and i will see on the next video guys right so the first variant we are actually going to design is this drop down so to show you what this is i'm going to press shift 2 and basically we want this to have two options one is when the drop down is closed and then the other is when drop down is open and it shows date picker so basically we will have one state where the property is open or meaning is the drop down open and it's a yes or no value so let's do that that's basically go here press f and do and right drop down and then i'm gonna press f and before that maybe change the color of background to be this and i'm gonna then go to the draw go zoom in shift to and then i'm going to close the benefit card and i'm going to find the drop downs and i'm going to add a fill to the white and i'm going to make this 8 and i'm going to make sure we have white 100 and i'm gonna get its height to be 40 pixels as that is the standard height we have for the most elements and then i'm gonna make its overshadow to be 16 pixels on blur and 10 percent here perfect and i'm gonna probably get its split to be 327. just in case it takes the whole bit of the available content area on the iphone 13 mini and then i know it has a text label so it should be like pick a day and let's think this true and i'm going to zoom out a bit because i'm realizing maybe there is more than two values so i think there is two more than two values because or maybe there's two but when it's closed you have to select a day but when it's open you actually you actually have to have here an actual date okay so there is a mistake here in this design where so can you see even if the person picked the 30th it should actually write 30 june 2022 but the design here is wrong so so the drop down can have multiple values in the first i think that there are okay there's two different properties the first one is this is the drop down open or closed but the second one is does the drop down already have a date or not if it doesn't you should write select the dates but the dropdown also might have a date that was picked but we wanted to change so we will have open we will have s properties open and we will also have date packed or not yeah so that would give us roughly four versions so i'm gonna go here i'm gonna zoom in here and i'm gonna add the in the assets the chevron we have from the icon set let's begin with the share run down and let's pick its color to be dark blue let's pick this color to be dark blue as well and then let's check the distance here that is 12 and 15 15 and let's give this the 15 auto and that's pretty good and we want this to be 12 as well so this will require a bit zooming in here to find out all right so in here we have 11 and there is five pixels so we really want to go maybe seven yeah i think that's right so and then we want to go 12 here i think that should give us this that should give us 12 by 12 left and right that's pretty good so pick a day i don't need the auto layout here because the date will never be that long so i think i will just make this a frame now with the ctrl alt g and i'm going to write this drop down and then i'm going to make this a component with ctrl alt k and then what i'm going to do is i actually will give this a variant here and i will give the property the first property to be open oops open and i will go to the more menu add new property and that is has date or let's say picked date okay so let's do this so so let's say select the day here is better select okay so for this one what we have is is it open no is a date picked no and the second one what we can do is we can actually pick a date where we can say 20 22 june 20 22 and what this means is we are are we open no have we picked the date yes and then what we can do is we need two more of these and so we will have four variations and in this one we are also are we open yes and when we are open we do not and let's say let's pick the date no when we are open the share run down icon actually has to turn into the share run up icon so we need to get rid of the share run down we go to our assets and we get a share run up icon and yes that is the way and i'm gonna remove this so that's the share run down and i'm gonna just basically give this to be the same x coordinate 296. and i'm going to check if it's equal it is equal and then what i'm going to do is i'm gonna press and now i want this to be picked yes and i'm gonna give this 20 20 to june 2022 and that's all of our options guys good morning everybody so let's actually move on with the looking at the scheduling sessions i'm gonna show you here so before we actually get to design these screens there's one more variant we need to actually finish and that is the date picker you can see this element i'm gonna zoom in by pressing shift two and you can see the state picker and basically what happens if any user decides to pick a day for their activity they click on the apple drop down and this opens up and they get to pick the month the date etc now the hard part with this element is actually the content of the days because you actually have two ways to visually create this content you might actually do it column by column like this horizontally or you might do a draw by row by row and to keep each spacing equal you have to use auto layout otherwise you have like 60 margins that you have to align yourself between each date like between 1 2 and 1 8 and 8 9 and 8 15 and this just cascades and for me i found it much easier to do auto layout with the row by row solution so that's what we are going to do now before we design again we have to think what are the states of the speaker in terms of variance and there is two states as far as i can see the first is basically a date picker that doesn't have a picked date yet which is this side and the second one is a date picker that has a picked date which is this one where we have the blue color so that's what we are actually going to do and i'm looking at what we need and one of the things we need right now is this right chevron but if you look at here we don't have a right share run on our icon set so we actually have to go back that was a mistake by me so we actually will go scroll here go to our icon set and let's look at here so let's see this one here and i think what we need is we actually got the same one so what we need is a right share run so i'm going to right click go to plugins and we will go to fedora accounts which was the plugin we used to actually fetch our icon set and we are going to write chevron and i want the right chair run here and i got it that's pretty good i'm going to my layers now and the hard part really is that with figma sometimes it's difficult to actually put things like plugin icons into the what would you say into the frames because they don't you they don't put it usually often so like it put it outside of our icon set frame even though we put we actually fetched it inside so sometimes you have to do this manually like this go and put it there and once we got it we have a few things to change again our color is never black we want dark blue and then what we also want is that we want the stroke width to be one pixel so i'm gonna go inside and i'm gonna pick fun and now that that's done we will actually make this a component by ctrl alt k so now again ctrl alt k so now our chevron write is a component and it should show up in our assets you know panel and let's look and it's there all right so we are ready and done with our icons so now what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna actually create the frame that will hold the variant so for it i'm going to press f for frame shortcut and i'm going to write here date picker and that's all good and swell so then what i want to do is i want you to take a very good look at this visual because what we have here is basically seven lines i seem like monday tuesday wednesday thursday fridays saturday and sunday and we have at most six rows so we have seven columns six rows and how we are going to do the design is basically row by row by row so it will be like row here row here row here okay i think i made a mistake i think i should have done it fit the column i think i'm mixing what i call them in a row is and i apologize for that guys but let's look at my solution okay so i think i did it by column by column right yes this is a column this is a column this is a column okay column by column is a solution and i named them wrong these are all columns so that's what i will do column by column by i apologize guys it's been a long tutorial all right so let's go all right so i'm gonna go here and i'm gonna first change the background color to this match this one and then i'm gonna get i'm gonna zoom in with shift two and i'm gonna press f to create my frame parent frame and this is gonna be 200 327 pixels we know this because it stretches to the left and right sides of the margin of the screen and for the height we are going to give it right now 256 pixels now i don't know if that is good enough we might increase it if we need to but let's go so i'm going to fill it with our white color and i'm going to actually add a border radius of 8 pixels it already started looking nice i'm adding a drop shadow 4 16 10 percent which is our general drop shadow and now what we can do here is this we can press t to add the text let's say june 2022 and i'm gonna make this a basically a regular sub header and i can have it here and i'm gonna make this autobit that's pretty good and then what i can do is i can actually fetch my icons that will let the user pick the amount they want to pick on the right side here they might select on the right side so i'm going to get my share on left and i'm gonna get my chevron right okay so chevron right was a bit harder but we got it and i'm gonna actually maybe get these guys a bit more closer now maybe a bit above all right so then what i want to do is i want to do my first column so that would be with t and what i'm gonna do here is basically i'm gonna do m and i'm gonna make each of these take the autobit and it won't be a subheader it will actually be a regular body text and i'm going to zoom in now so what we need here is so this is m for monday and what we need here is first 8 15 22 and 29th of the month so then i'm going to like have to drag this basically and this is going to be one and this is gonna be eight and ahmet are these dates accurate for june 2022 i don't know i didn't check the calendar maybe they are maybe they aren't but i don't think it matters much this is a prototype after all but it is 29 and that's the first column so what we want is that we actually want to make this a group here so we want to do this we want to frame this and we want to make this the first column all right so first column works and then we wanna basically duplicate this but first let's give it a bits of spacing so between each element we might want 12 and we probably want them to be right aligned yeah i think i like to write a line better maybe center might also work and we will figure out what kind of an alignment we want but we can check our solution again if i did center or light so let's check it okay i think we did center in the solution which is fine sometimes you can also do write a line if it suits you it really is your call but one thing i want to do is i want to make the first m which is the date to actually be body bold and i also want each of the text color to be dark blue not black yes i want this to be dark blue as well okay so that looks actually not bad so i'm going to actually drag this to duplicate and i'm going to drag this okay i'm holding shift so that my horizontal alignment doesn't change four five six and don't worry about the horizontal spacing between each column we will actually accomplish that when we frame each of these columns into a parent frame and that will let us put horizontal spacing distribution the way we wanted so this is actually so i'm gonna go tuesday and this is 2 9 16 23 30 and this one will be 3 10 17 24 and 31st so any element after this actually we made a mistake will not have the last row because 31st is the most you can go so what we will do is we will remove this and we will actually drag this one and this one and this one yes so that's monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday saturday and sunday yeah i think that looks pretty good so excuse me let me just drink this tea it's very early in the morning so i need my energy okay so 2 9 3 10 17 24 31st this should be 4 11. if i make any mistakes guys please don't tell me i'm kidding you can't tell me we all make mistakes it's okay especially this early in the morning this is 12 this is 19 and this is 26. i definitely made the typo summer 6 13 20 and 27 and then here is 7 14 7 14 21 28 okay that looks pretty good all right so now what i want to do is i wanna select all these columns that we did and i want to frame these by with the shortcut ctrl alt g and this is the dates frame and i will what i will do is i'm going to check the spacing between each element here which is 12 pixel and they are centered and what i will now do is that i am going to add an auto layout to this parent frame and i'm going to make this 12 as well now ahmet is 12 enough probably not because if you think about a person is going to use this app on their mobile phone and you probably want a much more margin between each number because you want this to be very easy to tap between thumbs so let's try 16 for the columns as well so let's try 16 here so i'm gonna just go through all columns here and yes i'm gonna go through all columns here so 16. so what i'm going to do is i might speed up this portion of the video i'm just going to go through each column and make these 16 and i will see when the actual design of the dates are done yeah i think that looks pretty good so now another thing we need is our cancel button but also before that we should realize that 256 wasn't enough so i'm gonna actually add 32 pixels there to 888 that might be better and even this might not be enough but let's see so another thing that our actual element needs is the small secondary buttons so i'm gonna show shift to so look at here we need the cancel and the done button and then we will also add these circles that the basically if a circle is not filled it signals what day it is right now unlike the time you are using the app and the blue circle that is filled means that that's the data you actually pick the activity to do so here is a good question that the previous design here didn't answer if you are on 29th june 2022 should you be eligible to pick the dates beforehand you already cannot go back in time so that is actually a design mistake you already cannot go back in time how can you be on 29 june and have the option to select previous days whoa that's a past mistake for me all right yes let's let's correct that shall we let's let's do better yes that's the motto let's do better so first we are what i'm going to do is i am actually going to add our buttons first i'm going to get our small buttons and i'm gonna make this active yes this is gonna be a secondary button and this is gonna be cancel yep and cancel looks pretty good and then i'm gonna duplicate this by dragging and this is gonna be a primary button saying done okay so far so good 288 is definitely not enough maybe three or four okay so now what i'm gonna do is i am going to pick a date here and i am basically going to let's say we are on the date 16th okay so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna press all and i'm gonna put it oops my bad i'm going to press o and i'm going to put it around here and this is going to be 24 to 24 maybe 32 32 and it's gonna have no insights and it's gonna have a blue around now i'm not gonna put it inside our date frame because the moment i do it will try to arrange it to like a date and our alignments here will get messed up so one simple trick you can do on ping maze i'm just gonna use the coordinates to pick a date so i'm gonna go to left so i'm going to literally i'm holding shift so i can move 10 pixels at a time and i'm gonna go up here and i'm not gonna align it like this maybe here and that looks pretty good and i think this one is also supposed to be like blue here that's the date you are on and any date before 16 means that it's not eligible for you so i am actually gonna almost make each of these dates to be like the gray yes so i'm gonna make these gray which is a disabled color that we have so that is 3 4 10 and i'm sharing these mistakes with you guys instead of redesigning everything because i think it is good to see other designers i actually am a fulltime designer and i make mistakes all the time man i make mistakes all the time and i think it is a very good thing for beginner or even mid levels to see that other people are making mistakes while still having a career and that's fine that's how we learn i think it's a very important thing so now the first day from the first to 15 is actually disabled we are on 16th and that's the first version of the let's say design that we have now we can actually worry about the small things like spacing so what i'm checking now is i'm checking the distance between everything i want this to be probably 16 or maybe even 12 nothing is 60 i'm gonna check our card design to see how what was the difference there like what was the margin left and right because we want to repeat that for consistency so i'm checking here and it was 12 by 12. okay so let's do 12. i'm going to go here shift 2 zoom in a bit more and let's go here 12 by 12. so i'm gonna do 12 here 12 there and i want to make sure that that is roughly 12 but that should probably be eight for the text what's happening oh like eight yes and both of these guys can actually go here and i'm gonna check the distance here and that should probably be a bit closer because of the surrounding box and i'm gonna check here okay so that's roughly 9 12 that is correct and with these icons you usually eyeball it if you are very very detailed you can just zoom in and count all of the rectangles which is what i usually do but let's get this to be and let's see if it looks like it is so let's select both of these elements okay so it's almost like it is hitting the baseline there which is the where the most weight of this font like it's not the baseline but where is the most weight of this font of this type street that which is in the like around here right it's like it is not here because most of the focus of this font because we are using a lowercase for most of the letters is here and that makes it look pretty centered because that's where the middle part of this meets and i'm going to check the distance maybe get it here maybe i think this separation is pretty good so that the elements actually maybe they can be a bit closer yeah i think that's a bit better yeah i think that is better and another thing that we can do now is we can also check our spacing here so we probably want to go to 12 as well that is not good so that is yeah that's pretty okay now we might not be able to do 12 because now the problem is that while we are consistent with our card design spacing the hard part is that our outer spacing is much more than the inner spacing we have between each state right the the the marginal difference between 16 and 17 is 16 pixels while the whole parent frame at most has 12 pixel difference which is why it makes it look like we are very squished so you want to really have parent margins to be bigger so probably we will go with 24 and break the consistency so that should be like 20 here and 24 here and that should be like here and we should take it also here yes that looks a bit better and let's make this go 24 maybe for alignment 22 yes and let's get you guys to here and let's look at your bottom and let's move you guys up a bit as well and that is so the distance between these two elements is 12 pixels 8 plus 4 that is 12. that is a pretty good distance so what we can do is we can actually check again 12 so like it's almost good and you can see this element actually isn't doing the like it's not fully scratched i think it looks pretty good right now in terms of spacing i'm eyeballing it a bit but it looks pretty good the problem here is that the circle our circle around the 16 is not centered now and it is bugging me so it should be maybe around here nope around here yes no around here yes i think this now looks better and what i'm going to do is basically i'm going to write this as i think we did it is the date picker right yes picker and what i'm going to do is i'm going to make this a component now oops sorry i'm going to make this a component with the ctrl alt k i don't want to frame a frame i want to make the frame a component and that let's substitute the variance so remember from the beginning of the video we know that they will only have two state states the first one is that the date hasn't picked it is not in pick has not been packed the second state is that the date is picked so for that we need the property of date picked so date picked and for this one it's a no and for this one it should be a yes and we should change stuff so what we should do is let's say the user also let's click let's drag this okay that won't work so let's make a copy of it and let's just basically drag it here let's just say they did 18 and i'm gonna press shift x to swap the value that didn't work why is that okay so for some reason figma doesn't let me swap values i can do it the old way i can do it like this and the hard part here is that my circle has to be below my dates which is what i'm gonna do so that the date is visible and i'm gonna press for this one i'm gonna make this white and i think i'm gonna make this bold as well yes that looks a bit better and i think that looks like a selected circle yes that looks like a selected date i think that looks pretty good i think i like what i'm seeing what is the horizontal margin between these two maybe it should be 12. i really don't want it to be not multiples of 4 12 and that looks pretty good actually so that is our date picker all right so let's get started with our first two screens for the scheduling ones so what i'm gonna do is like always i'm gonna create my initial frame so i'm gonna press f and i'm gonna pick iphone 13 mini and i'm gonna fetch it here and i can do this as schedule part one now here are the elements that we already designed for our variants to actually for the screen is we have the status bar done we have our button is done i think we might not have the disabled version i will check but our large button is mostly done we have the bottom navigation and we have the date drop down now what we are missing is the stepper functionality for the adults and children here now i do not think these will actually need to be variants or the stepper function needs to be actually variant because now we are not using it as any other parts of the application you might actually make this in the future for a variant but for this tutorial's sake and to maybe not prolong it any further i'm not going to actually make the data variant i'm just going to design it here but as a homework if you want to bonus points from me and show me later and email your work to me you can make the variant on your own so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna just add our stuff that we have to use so like the i'm gonna move my profile here and i'm going to add the status bar let's say here i am going to where is my button i'm going to add the drop down here where is my bottom navigation show me where is it oh it's here okay so i'm gonna add this okay so the bottom navigations coordinates is 760. and that looks pretty good and this one should be zero zero yep and that looks pretty good and then what i can do is i can actually get the from my icon set i'm gonna get the left share run which actually lets us go back one step so what i'm gonna do is i am gonna go find our icon set and i'm gonna drag the chevron left right here and i'm gonna go to my layers and that worked subliminally pretty well and i'm gonna get this to be like 16 or let's see let's see from here what was the coordinates so 16 yes i was right so then we can get it here this would be 24 and so far so good i am now gonna check our i'm gonna check our large buttons to see if we have a disabled version if not meaning disabled variant if not we will need to design some stuff and we do okay i'm proud of us so we actually have that one so now i can also then that means i can also shift to i can drop our large button as well and i can disable this it's not active no so let's look again and this is the go to checkout part to check out all right and it's centered perfect so the only thing that remains now is to design the things that are not variants so for the text the main text schedule active i'm going to press t and i'm going to write schedule activity and i'm going to left align this and i'm gonna basically make to say i'm gonna move myself here and i'm gonna make this a top header bold and i'm gonna get you here yes and i'm gonna make this autobit and i am gonna definitely change this color from black to dark blue so it matches with our color palette and then what i'm going to do is i am gonna design this frame so it looks like it will have 327 pixels because it stretches horizontally and i'm going to fill it and i'm going to flip it to our white color and i'm definitely going to add the drop shadow because it's hard to see the white it's 4 to 16 pixels 10 percent and yes i definitely need border radius of 8 pixels which is what we usually have for the rectangle elements and that looks pretty good i think it will be taller so maybe 128 pixels yeah that is that might be too tall maybe 1008 and we will figure it out but the first things i want to do is i want to add the adult texture so this is basically the user selecting how many adults how many children how many people they will bring for the activity is it just you and your partner or is it just you or do you have a kid with you so i'm gonna make this also dark blue and i'm gonna make it out of it as well and what i'm trying to gauge here is let's zoom into the screen and that looks actually pretty okay i think we might need a double like no maybe not maybe yes all right so what we can do now is we can press r for rectangle and this is probably is the hardest part of this of this video because we are creating an element from scratch this probably has 48 pixels for height maybe not 48 but 40. yeah 48 might be a stretch i'm looking and 48 looks big maybe we thought with the border radius it might look smaller but now 48 is definitely back maybe 44 no maybe 40 is it 44 or 40 it's 40 yes because 48 was big so 40 pixels and even with that one we probably want the background to be blue ish and okay so then we want our stepper functionality minus m plus i'm gonna press r again and we might want these to be 32 by 32 and i probably want this to be eight oops i probably want the border radius to be eight as well whoa eight is too much maybe four yeah four is better and i want this blue to be a bit darker maybe even 300 nope 300 is too much maybe 200 yes i need 200 is pretty good and i'm gonna drag this and i'm gonna basically take this one pixel down so it's four four four and take this one pixel to right so it's four four four and at the center of it will be our text so yes to t and let's write this zero and i'm gonna have this to be bolded actually i'm going to have this to be bolded i'm going to have the centered and i'm going to have this autobit and i'm going to check the distance it has and maybe here it's seven to six so it's 259.5 and that is centered now i'm going to check the vertical spacing here and i'm going to zoom in to see that's three that's four so it should actually have one more pixel in the up so it should probably be here for centered no sorry my bad it should be around here okay so that let's check our work so far okay we need to get the icon i get that okay so maybe let's check it okay so we need our icons so i'm gonna go to our icons on our assets panel and i realize we actually do not have the minus four plus icon so let's go to our icon set very quickly and fetch those so i'm going to icon set shift 2 to shift shift 2 to zoom in oh what did i do okay so we are here shift two so i'm gonna right click plugins and i'm gonna basically check for feather icons i'm gonna check for plus and i'm checking for minus okay so i think i got both of these icons so one of them is in right now i don't think the plus is in the icon set but i think we can just by going down here so i have to drag the plus one okay so they are both in so both of their colors should be dark blue and i'm gonna make you guys go here and i'm gonna select both of them and make them a component oops make them a component and that's pretty good and oh they just okay my mistake i have to make them okay figma doesn't make you do a component for each so ctrl alt k for this one ctrl alt k for this one okay now it works now we are good so let's go back to our screen click on the screen shift tool to zoom in and let's just add from our assets panel our newly minted icons this is the minus and this is the plus okay those look pretty good let's make these all white and let's basically also make these guys have one pixel so i'm gonna have to go back because we didn't change their stroke yet so i'm actually going back to the icon set i know guys this is frustrating this is my mistake yes so that's one pixel ah they are both going to be one pixel and this is one pixel as well okay now we are good i know we are good enough again click on the screen shift to zoom in okay that looks better so let's look at this is this centered here i'm gonna basically grab this and make these two things an element so ctrl g to group and what i'm gonna do now is i'm gonna basically center both of these elements i'm gonna also do this for the plus side and then i'm gonna click both of them and center them yes that looks pretty good and then what i want to do is i want to name this sd yeah that part isn't useful i think we duplicated something that was necessary i'm going to name this background and that looks to me pretty good let's look at our example here i think our steppers can be a bit smaller but so here is the thing if we make it smaller they will also be harder to tap so this is really your decision if we get them smaller now they will aesthetically look better but then being big enough also might give the person a confidence to actually try to tap because they are bigger now 32 pixels i think in the design there are 24 there in the way i did it but there is also benefits to having it at the size so i think i will just keep it at size for the usability and then what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna design this by 12 pixel and definitely like eight or nine so i'm gonna zoom in here yeah definitely 89 here okay maybe 16 will be the way to go but then you might realize for you to solve this is a actually a good dilemma so so for you to actually center design these elements which is like the stepper elements oh we haven't grouped those yet okay my bad that's not the element okay so let's first make this a group shall we with the background and this is our stepper functionality so we will make this a frame and this is stepper and let's check if everything moves with it when we move it yes okay so we want to center design these two elements the adult and the stepper functionality and let's copy them and i'm going to show you a visual problem now what is and we have to grow this size it's 128. so what is the visual problem here now while the figma is telling you the distance is equal between the each row the problem your eye is having is the vertical space between adult to let's say children here is a lot more than the stepper functionality two and stepper functionality one so it's 8 pixels this is probably 30. and your eye is confused because your eye is usually looking for consistent spacing it's looking for one type of spacing if it's 8 pixels vertically it wants it to be 8 pixel on the right vertically as well whereas on the left we have a 30 pixel on the right we have an 8 pixel well how do we solve this what apple does is very smart in their design is they add a horizontal line so the moment you add a horizontal line your eye fixes on the lines and it just checks the distance between line and the top here and i'm going to show you so this would be like maybe 268 yeah maybe 2 72 and this would be a gray line and both of these elements would be down and so maybe even a bit longer maybe 282 okay tonight so let's check the distance here so yes maybe so that's 327 pixels so that's 20 okay so that's maybe 18 or 24 24 so let's group these and make this first row so that will actually make you understand better so let's group and this is first row and let's group this let's frame this and this is the second row and now i'm going to show you so now what we can actually discuss is this okay so what's the distance between these two elements gonna be and one thing we can do is we can even use auto layout to actually picking guests let's say one thing we can do is we can actually do auto layout to actually determine the distance now so you are going to see what i'm doing so what's the margins in the left right and other men other parts let's make them 16 here 16 here 16 here and 16 here and we want these to be left aligned that's for sure and one thing we can do here is this we can actually pick the distance between each item and what we can pick is let's say 12 and what i want to do now is to pick here so it's actually if we pick it 16 if we match it to the outer spacing that might even work better so if we were to do this so now your top spacing and your element spacing matches so that looks much more unified the only thing this has to do is we have that auto layout here too so we can match them so i'm going to add auto layout for this sub children like the roles so that we can actually horizontally center the elements as well instead of being the child being top alan i want them to be middle aligned and now that looks pretty good i'm pretty and takes the horizontal line our eye actually calculates the vertical distance from this line to top from this line to bottom and the only thing we might have is no i think that looks pretty good i think we might be a bit we might have a bit more height here but i think it looks pretty good i think this is a bit more squishy yeah that's 136 pixels maybe we could have gotten everything to be 12 pixels on the left right and other parts but i think this part works so i think we might keep it 144. i think i like it and let's get this to be all right guys this is already getting to be a long video in the next video i'm gonna actually finish this screen the second one and see in the next video alright so let's finish the screen so what else are we lacking i think we are lacking alignment for and we like are lacking spacing so one thing i'm going to do is i am going to actually start with the checkout with 24 pixels which is r and i want to add i can actually do worship four and i'm going to add the layout grid as well to this one so we can actually check with check which items are aligned our margins left and right to be 24 pixels and 16 here and so let's begin with our header here and i'm gonna zoom in a bit farther okay that looks pretty good now maybe one more pixel yes 22 does it does the job and i wanna now i want to get i think this element is already aligned at 24 pixels so that's good i want to get the drop down to be aligned as well yes and then what i want to do is it doesn't need to be that down now the distance to be 24 pixel and i want this to be 24 pixel as well yes i want this to be 24 pixel as well one pixel more down and i'm going to hide the layout knob ctrl shift 4 okay so i think that is our first version now one thing we might do is i think in our drop down we haven't added the calendar icon that i have maybe it might make sense to actually edit because it helps so what i'm going to do is i am actually going to our icon set to fetch it and then i will add i will update the r variant later so i'm gonna go to right click plugins and feather icons and i can check calendar here and boom and i'm going to add this to our icon set so it's gonna be picked from left side here all the thing to here all right so now it's in our icon set and i'm going to basically make its color to be dark blue and i am going to change its stroke width to be one pixel and then i am actually gonna make this a component and before i make it a component this is actually a bit big so i can i might want to resize it so i'm gonna go icon resizer that is at most 16 pixel and yes that is better now i'm going to make this a component and i'm going to zoom out and i'm actually going to go to the drop down here okay so we might actually wanna have it here i'm gonna add it to all four variations so i'm gonna go to assets and i'm going to fetch it from here and i'm gonna move this a bit and i'm gonna get it here and one thing you wanna do is you want the emphasis to be less on the icon and more on the text and one way to do that while still keep consistencies while you make the two elements have the same color you can actually decrease the opacity of the let's say the icon in our case so what you can do here is you can make this eight percent and boom that already makes it better so what i'm checking here is what's the left margin there that's four so this should actually be eight eight plus four is twelve and these actually can maybe difference is four pixels here and yes that looks pretty good yes i think i really like the look here so i will just copy and i will move everything basically so this is 36 so i'm gonna move this to be 36 as well i'm gonna copy the calendar and paste it here and i'm gonna do the same for the other so 36 i'm gonna do here 236 and i'm gonna paste it here and i'm gonna paste it for this one as well and that looks perfect okay so let's go and one thing we can do is we can already realize because our variants are components once we make a change to the master element it auto updates itself and it looks perfect so i think this screen is done maybe change this color to dark blue so what we can now do is we can work on the second screen and that is basically us actually picking a value so that is actually picking the number of guests so this would be part two copy and scheduling part one copy and what we can do here is we can actually but the only change we will do between these two screens is make this two and voila we are showing the interaction now and that looks pretty good now at the end of this tutorial we might actually go back to change some of our drop shadows in certain elements to give them more emphasis but right now i want to make things consistent this looks pretty good so let's do the screens third and fourth so these are the screens where we will actually design so i'm gonna do is i'm gonna duplicate the schedule part two and i'm gonna duplicate the schedule part no i'm not gonna duplicate this one i'm gonna make this go to part three and all i'm gonna do is probably just add the date picker drop down and that looks pretty good so well one thing we are actually realizing here is this where we are actually going overboard here so so let's actually get this well the coordinates for this one is not correct so it should actually be 10 pixels lower maybe 11. yes so that is the coordinates and this should be also lower around here and this should be roughly 16 so 412 because this part of this element so it should not be just 24 pixels maybe even 12 would work yes so now now so this is how it looks like and right now it is not packed and one thing you might think of it is is there a problem with it opening over the checkout button i do not think so because our checkout is already disabled so that is pretty okay one thing we might do is we might actually move everything a bit up or we can also let's see how many so it should end around here if you really want to but that is probably not needed so i really like if it overlays i don't think there's a problem with overlaps i don't think there's a problem what i'm trying to think is what would happen once you picked it and you can actually go to checkout and then if you are trying to press the checkout button but you press here and it's all a mess okay so we need to decrease the height of this and we need to decrease our spacing around a bit so one thing we can do is let's go back here and this was 24 pixels as well what is the distance between each element here is 24 so so far we have 24 pixels so let's tank maybe we can get this to be up a bit so this is like 44 this is 66 so we can actually yeah i think that is the mistake so everything here has to go up so one two three yes so now yes so if you trick check here now our back button matches and i'm gonna do the same for this screen i'm gonna hold shift one two one two then i'm gonna so what i'm doing is the moment i hold the shift it actually shifts 10 pixels instead of one and for 22 pixels i have to do that twice then take my hand off and go twice again for 22 pixels and i'm gonna do this for here as well i'm gonna actually not do it i'm gonna copy again and i'm gonna add in my assets here and that should be pretty good yes that is a lot better and these should also be going down so yes so that is a bit better so another place that we can actually change is we can decrease the margins here and decrease the spacing around here so what would happen if we did 12 and with this 12 as well that still looks okay and yeah that still looks okay so we can actually get this up one two three four that should be 24 yes okay so you are seeing a lot of copying here because one mistake like we have made is our spacing well i made this our my spacing didn't work so we are trying just a bit of stuff here and i'm gonna delete this again drag this and now it should work probably let's see yes now it works yeah okay yeah and that is okay that looks pretty good to me and then what we can do is we are gonna rename this this is part three copy and we are gonna drag a new version of this oh wait i think so this should be two because we copied stuff we forgot to change these says two because they already made the choice of the adult at the point two in three they are gonna they open the date and then the four which we are gonna create right now they have selected the date so this will be selected the moment they press done then we are okay to go yes and this is the part four all right let's do the fifth screen so i'm gonna drag this one and i'm gonna write this as five copy and the thing the difference once we make a choice in here and we say done while we picked the date the user has picked the date they have not picked the time of the day that they are actually gonna do the activity in so we have to give them the option that they will also have to pick the time so what we can do is we can go back in our screens and basically copy this horizontal filter process which we have and we can actually paste it here and what we will do is we will just change the we will just first we will make everything to be unpicked and what we will do is we will just change the time so it's it will be like zero eight zero zero am and this would be zero nine zero zero am and then we might jump to let's say eleven eleven zero zero am because we are just showing the available times and then this would be thirteen 000 pm and so i'm gonna go to layers and one thing we might do is we might add an auto layout for this one and we might get this to be 12. yeah i think that actually looks better and we probably want to center this right for this one so i'm going to zoom out a bit i'm going to look here and i think i am going to get this to be off nope the other way 5151 that works and this should be 4 pixel above for 12 pixels and yes that looks better and then now that part of the screen is done then what we can do is we are gonna design the sixth screen so i'm gonna drag this one which is the last screen for our schedule and then we will have one option picked let's pick this one and then what we will have is this disabled button has to be also active and boom that looks pretty good actually i'm gonna vertically align these and yes those that was our scheduling feature and in the next video we will do the last two variants so that we can actually design design the last screen the review screen for the checkout so we only have one screen left to design and to actually do that screen we need two more variants the first one is what i would like to call medium cards varian which is this one where it is a bit different it's the activity one so only four activities and what it is is that it doesn't have a label for like that we had so i have to like zoom out a bit here maybe maybe pick one here i think around this and zoom in here so if you look at the activities here each of these activities have this label that signals what it is but for the medium cards that we use in the checkout they don't so we will have to create a new variant for this one and the second variant we will do for this screen is the small avatar images here these very small ones unlike our large avatar images which we use for the attendees these won't have a name attached to them like as in writing let's get those going so i'm gonna actually zoom out here and i'm gonna go to our image cards here what i'm gonna do is i am going to create a new frame i'm gonna name it small image maybe medium image card medium image card it's not that small so and i'm going to give this let's say a bit of 156 pixels i'm going to give it a fill and i'm going to give it eight pixels now what i'm going to do is i'm going to actually add the images and i know these medium cards will only be used for the activities like eating hiking or biking it won't be for the cities because you can never check out the city so what i will do is i will actually remove the fill color right click plugins and i am actually gonna go to unsplash and i'm gonna type eating and i'm gonna pick the same activities there and i'm gonna add the same overlay which is 25 percent if i recall let's quickly check and let's quickly check and it is 75 and i will check the height and bit of it actually so i am checking the height and width and its width is 212 to 148 so it's actually bigger than ours so maybe these are the medium ones i misnamed them card and this is going to be a large image card so so this is 2 12 to 148 pixels i'm actually going to make this a component by pressing ctrl alt k shortcut and then i'm going to add variance and first i'm going to set the property and the property will be basically activity and the first one is going to be eating and for the second one we are going to change its image we will look for biking here and pick it and let's name it biking and let's add one more and let's actually go for the hiking all right i'm gonna search for hiking and this one is weather yes so those are the same hiking and boom so now that we have it what we can do is that we will actually zoom out and we are gonna go to the avatars so let's zoom out a bit more and i am looking for where my avatar cards are maybe even if it's more and i'm checking trick and checking and so in the okay there you guys are okay there at the bottom i did not see these okay these are our normal so let me just grab this here and avatar images so if you have a large avatar you want to create a small avatar so to do that i am gonna press f and i'm gonna zoom in here i'm gonna do shift two to zoom in and i am basically going to make this maybe 36 to 36 and i will give it a border radius of 18 pixels to make it a circle and i'm going to give it a bottom line there and for the sake of this discussion i think i will change the background of it i to this so we can see things better okay so what i'm going to now do is that i will actually get images for this one as well so this will be named small avatar and this is maybe even like we can be a bit smaller maybe 32 pixels yeah maybe 32 and i'm gonna actually find an image for this so plugins and i'm going to use the plugin user profile that will let me generate a random one and that is not good let's do another one let's do one that actually looks like a profile shot okay that is doable so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to make this a component ctrl alt k and i'm going to add a variant and our property will be name just like our large avatar and this one let's say is lucy and for this one i am gonna do the same i'm gonna do user profile insert random photo and this one is let's say helen and i'm gonna go plus here and what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go random again and i'm gonna do this three to five times right oops wrong plugin my bad i'm gonna right click plugins user profile and let's see and that is let's say jane and then i'm gonna click again and this is the last one let's get a man here and that can be matte okay all right so let's begin designing our last screen to begin i'm gonna press f so i'm gonna press f i'm gonna pick my iphone 13 mini and i'm gonna make write this as review copy and the first thing we are going to do is we are gonna get our variants that we already designed so we are going to begin with the bottom navigation and we know the coordinate is 760 and x is zero and then what i'm going to do is i'm looking for the status bar so i'm going to move myself to the right i'm going to get the status bar here i'm going to make this 0. i'm going to make the y 0 as well and its colors over the dark blue maybe i should be around here yes then what i'm going to do is i am actually going to get our t for the elements and for the text and i'm going to write checkout i'm going to auto with the element and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to make this bold 34 pixels and i'm going to get this dark blue and then i'm going to get my maybe image cards and in here i want the large image card definitely and i want this to begin at 24 for x and then what i will do i will press t again and i probably want this to be biking then i'm going to zoom in a bit and i'm going to press t for the activity name right biking i'm gonna basically move myself back i'm gonna make this out of it and i'm gonna make this sub header so that is pretty good and then what i want to do is i want to get my location icon so i'm looking for my location icon right here yep that's my location icon i'm gonna get text for the place london ontario and i want this to be dark blue as well this one to be dark blue as well and i want this to be body regular and i want this to be autobit yes and definitely regular here and one thing you can realize is it is not enough this has to be a bit smaller so what we can do is maybe we can go maybe span element here that would work better yes that does work better and i'm gonna align those later then i want my small avatar images so for that i am gonna go amateur images and i'm gonna get a small one and what i'm going to do is what i'm going to do is i'm going to zoom in with shift 2. 0 and i am gonna duplicate this by dragging it and duplicate another one and another one and i'm going to make sure that all of these small avatar ones are centered and now what we want is basically them being on top of each other so the one that is most on top of each other in the logically meaning in the design also usually should be the most on top so that's the goal so this one would be let's say lucy and this one let's say make this helen at helen is definitely so lucy is going to be the first one helen is going to be the second one and let's say jane is the third one and yep jane is the third one and this one can be met okay so this is the most top this is going to be here this one is going to be the third yes so now then what i will do is i will just take all of these holding shifts so they would come 10 pixels back maybe around there so let's check the distance between those two elements that's 13 to 13 so maybe one more and 12 yes so we are looking for 12 here i'm going shift with my down key here i'm gonna check again yes that is correct again just 10 pixels at a time oh i'm holding i'm holding caps guys you didn't tell me how dare you okay i was making me say you should hold ship not caps okay i'm i was wondering why this is taking too long man so i'm gonna print these as avatars small avatars yes so that is correct and i'm gonna then move to here i want the color of this to be dark blue and i want you guys to be centered here and maybe let's fix the text and maybe move the text to withholding shift a bit to the there and i'm gonna count the distance so that is like five pixels here so maybe six seven so six uh i'm doing x okay so i know five pixel is here one pixel is there that's six we are looking for two here so it will make to eight for our icons i think that's pretty good we are to center it again and we are going to frame these as location that is pretty good and then the initial part is done then we will do the activity details so let's press t your activity details and these are going to be sub headers right so i'm going to my type system subheader and i'm going to delete left alignment and i'm going to do it out of it perfect okay then i know i will get pricing but let's first finish the your activity details and to do this with the right alignment we probably want to have a layout grid with columns and again it's 24 pixels left and right 16 in the distance and that's pretty good so we already understand that we might need to come back a bit but yes then we will add date so i'm gonna just press here this is gonna be date and then guests yes okay so date and guests and all of both of these will not be a sub header now but will actually be bodybutt bold and then we are going to add the small tertiary buttons of edit so let's add those two from our variants let's find our buttons and then get the small buttons here and we definitely want the tertiary option and yes so let's put these guys around here and let's name these edits perfect and let's look at here yes that looks pretty good so what i'm gonna look for now so edit option is there we are missing two body texts so t here is for the date june 22 and first i think it's june 22 june 22 june 18 22. let's check the date that we selected this 18 june 22 okay yes so this is correct and i'm going to make this body regular and i'm going to make this this way yes and then i'm going to go for guests here and that is going to be two adults zero children that's okay yeah so to align things better what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna zoom in a bit yes and i'm on a windows machine so my magic pad is very very like very sensitive so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to make this a line better yes so that's the 24 pixel that looks pretty good and i'm gonna edit this to the end so they would match that's perfect and these colors should be dark blue and everything literally should be dark blue never black so yes okay so then this is gonna go here and what i'm really trying to do here is i'm gonna check the spacing it should probably be 24 up oh 20 okay that's not bad so maybe 24 24 for us so i'm gonna do listen like this should be roughly 14 so i'm gonna zoom in i'm looking for 16 pixel total so four pixel there seven pixel maybe nine yes so that is the distance and this should be roughly 12 total that's four five yes that is correct that should be the distance and i am actually gonna get this up and the distance between drew 9 guests should be roughly 16 because they actually belong to a different group so the distance between data and activity should be the same as the guests and date which should be 16 so i'm zooming in there's three pixels here that's four seven so that should be roughly nine so two three four yes and it will be a bit to the left there we go and this one is also just a bit maybe not and this one is as well i just wanted to touch there yes and that's pretty good so far okay so now what i want is i want to patch this one as well and i want this to be five based on just like here literally i'm just copying my distances and that looks pretty good let's look at it from here and that looks pretty good now this has to be aligned so i'm checking here where it goes maybe a bit up no and i wanted to see how it's basically how it looks from here i'm gonna turn off the yes i'm gonna turn off there and i'm gonna press shift r to actually have a ruler present to see the middle point and maybe one pixel up so maybe around here yes i think that's the way to go and then what i'm going to do is i am going to duplicate this and i am basically gonna go down a bit and i am gonna have it around here and i'm gonna do my ruler again to check if it's aligned centerwise on the baseline no it's not so maybe one two three four five okay baseline again which is the middle of e and that looks pretty good yes i'm okay with that i'm gonna press shift ctrl shift ctrl 4 the right alignment is correct so we can actually frame these now so i like our spacing so i'm going to select every element so i can make them all a gigantic frame ctrl alt g and i'm gonna name this activity details so i can do the spacing of the whole element easier because i want this whole group to be 24 pixel here and this one is probably just going to be 24 here so that should be like should be four five yep four eight so that should be like 16 so maybe one yes roughly here is 24 for it and i am gonna get this to up as well yep and i really don't watch 18 pixels maybe 16 horizontally and each of these elements can have 16 pixels here so that's 10 so maybe one two three four five six and i'm checking for the vertical alignment with my shift r ruler tool and so this should be a bit to the right that's good and this should the smaller beta images should definitely come up and let's see their distance so that's ten so six plus four here that's ten so maybe six down two three four five six and that looks pretty good the only part is it looks too spaced out so maybe it should all be 12 pixels so maybe one two three four and let's do one two three four yeah that actually might look better that looks to my eye better that's roughly 16 pixels yes so let's check 4 7 that's 16 maybe even more right three four and i'm gonna do the same maybe this should be 164 and that looks better yes that's much less spacing and i'm going to frame these as well so gonna frame these three elements ctrl alt g and activity t basically review and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to do the pricing so what i'm going to do is i'm going to press t and i am gonna write this as pricing we are almost there it's looking good i'm gonna make this dark blue and you have done this before this is gonna be our sub header so i'm gonna make this go out of it as well and then what i'm going to do is i am just going to copy the contents of this text my bad so i'm going to go here ctrl c i need new text and i'm going to control v and i'm going to make this a normal regular and i'm going to also give this a auto width and make its color to be dark blue there we go and i'm just going to duplicate it for the taxes so i'm going to press alt with shift so that the alignment keeps not getting disturbed and i'm going to write 450 for texas so i'm gonna go here and write 450 for taxes shift 2 to go back to zoom mode and that's 77 okay so then we will have a total there okay so then what we will have is we will press alt shift and this is going to be our total and this one is actually bold and i'm going to create another text here i'm going to duplicate this and i'm going to write as 77 77 and yep that's already out of it i am gonna shift this to the right edge and i am gonna duplicate this one again holding shift with alt and i'm gonna write 4.5 and i'm gonna get it to the right alignment so what i'm looking for what am i missing is the final total number here then i will have to frame everything and my total is missing total cad so c8d here so i'm holding my shift and i'm pressing down and there we go and that is if my mat is correct 81 50 and i'm gonna yeah shift it here and that's pretty good so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to group all these elements i'm going to frame them ctrl g and this is your pricing and one thing i can do is and this could be a cool spacing i'm gonna frame these as well this is the fee and this is going to be taxes and this one will be total what this will let me now do is that now if i ever add an auto layout for the vertical i want this to be left and i want this to be maybe 12 pixel or let's go maybe yeah 12 works pretty good actually 12 pixel works here and i want this to be bold as well right here yes so that works and i'm gonna get rid of the layout grid now and i'm gonna make the color of this to be white these white as well yes i think we have to go back and recolor these because these are pure white it's a detail i just called let's go here i'm gonna come back just a moment guys okay this is why you should check your colors beforehand okay that should be good so but final thing we need is actually the paved frame with the edit option for the card and we have a preselected card and we also need a large button at the below so let's do that first let's get this one it is disabled so it's an active it's primary and it is basically pay yes so make a payment this would be the best one payments and i think this should be primer i don't know why this is disabled actually this should not be disabled at all so let's make this active and that should be 24 yes that's better and then we can add the card so i'm gonna press this has to go up a bit yeah maybe even more up here roughly yes 24 pixels and then i'm going to press t for writing pay with so pay vet and this is going to be a sub header and it's gonna be autobit and it's not gonna be black yes everything nothing is black yes okay so then we are going to create our card our card is 327 pixels press r i'm gonna get it turned 327 and 64 is probably gonna have at least eight pixels on the side it might have even more but eight pixels blue but it's gonna have our dark blue color and it's gonna have our name the user's name the expiry date the type of card it is and then it will have the last four digits of the card and so for that we are gonna have t jason malta and i think for this one we are okay to do it with regular span element that's okay and then we will need the the expiry date so i'm gonna just drag it here zero seven twenty five i'm gonna make this out of it and then i'm gonna get our visa icon from our assets from our icon set my profile here and let's get this visa icon and let's give it a color of maybe this blue now maybe it's 200 100 might work yes that looks pretty good and then i want these circles so i think they are roughly three or four pixels so i'm just gonna go in and do them so roughly 12 circles for the whole credit card so i'm gonna press all and i'm gonna make this four maybe five is even better yeah i'm okay with five so i'm gonna then drag here and then i can do is i'm gonna hold shift to drag with the same distance and that looks pretty good so i'm gonna now hold these first four i'm gonna hold the choose these first four make them have the white color and then i'm gonna drag this whole group and i'm gonna do it again and not again my bad last one we don't need it and then i think they are not spaced equally yet so what i'm going to do is i'm just going to say distribute vertically that's awesome and then i'm going to have the text last four digits which can be 3406 and it really should be a span element because this should be very small and yeah that looks pretty good i'm gonna zoom out a bit yes that looks pretty good to me this has to be at the edge so i'm holding shift when i'm moving it to the right and what i'm going to do now is i'm going to align the this one so i want 12 pixels up and left so i'm zooming in that's one pixel so this should be roughly 11. and it is two pixels so this one should be the y should be roughly here so 10 plus 2 is 12. that looks pretty good now i'm going to align it my bad now i'm going to pick the visa and i'm gonna go to x i'm gonna align it here i want these two elements to be aligned to the right well so maybe one more pixel there we go and i'm gonna check here that's 9 12 yes that works that works and i'm gonna then pick all the ellipses the number and we'll group these control g card number and i'm gonna click on the text here maybe one pixel up to be centered yes there and that's pretty good actually i am pretty pleased let's check the vertical and horizontal spacing here and what i'm going to do is i'm just going to copy the y from here so this is 6 21. so so this is like 621 and to look at its left alignment of 12 pixels i'm just gonna press alt that's 16. so that's 12. yes that looks pretty good because is no left spacing in the phone so it is correct so we are going to align these as well yes and let's get these guys to the bottom as well so that's nine maybe around here because we are gorging with the text here yes that should be pretty good so i'm taking a look and i'm gonna group all of i'm gonna make a frame out of all of these ctrl g this is credit card and let's see if we can move everything here after the background didn't come in so let's move this here background has to be at the bottom that's good and let's see oh yeah i don't think we took every element there so yeah the card number didn't come in so let's move the card number in this well okay so let's enlarge in but our frame is a bit off and right now my shortcut doesn't work so i'm just going to check the distance here and that can be between these two elements that is 12 we probably wanted to be in total 16 that's four that is good that is excellent actually we want here 18 24 that actually works so it actually works i'm pretty happy with it so there you go guys that is your screen at the end and yeah that is the whole tutorial i think it looks pretty
