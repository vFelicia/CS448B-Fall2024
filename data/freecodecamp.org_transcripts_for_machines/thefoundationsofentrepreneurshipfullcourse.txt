that it's based off of chris is a bestselling course creator author business school professor and mba graduate from columbia university business schools do a pretty good job of providing students with theoretical frameworks which can sometimes be applied to real world problems however quite often they overlook the most crucial and practical business lessons like how to network how to find customers or how to get a job if you want to learn how to get a meeting with almost anyone or take your career to the next level then this course is for you i've worked at goldman sachs i've met with top business people including bill gates warren buffett and the founders of the biggest technology companies and at the end of all my meetings with these visionaries i've always asked them for advice on what made them so successful and a lot of what they taught me is not taught in business school so i put together a list of every lesson and i've included it in this book and in this course these lessons will help you take your career to the next level it's exciting to reinvent yourself in ways that you never thought were possible until you realize it is possible anything is possible as many of my students that have taken this course i've realized i put all of my business knowledge and passion into this course and i'm humbled to say that business insider wrote an article stating that my book 101 crucial lessons they don't teach you in business school was voted as the number one business book of the year also forbes magazine stated that this book is one of six books that every entrepreneur needs to read right now so let me teach you about these crucial business lessons let's step out of business school and into the real world as we take your career to the next level in november of 2015 uh one of my clients when i worked fulltime in venture capital had an extra ticket to go to the tony robbins uh event called upw meaning unleash the power within uh down in los angeles uh and so i i i graciously accepted and i went down and in la i think it was at the staples center or a very large convention center there's ten thousand people in the audience it was crazy it was awesome and it was a fourday event and we went through a lot of exercises goal setting workshops etc and then including walking across hot fire coals on the saturday night and tony conditioned us tony robbins and i actually ended up meeting him another time for business really reasons really nice guy but and when i shook his hand his hand like wrapped around my hand he's a big dude big dude but a really nice guy as well but what he did was on the saturday night of that fourday event back in 2015 he had us walk across boiling hot coals like it looked like lava and he conditioned us to believe in our mind that we're not going to feel any pain at all he conditioned us to do that and so i walked across the coals and i didn't feel any pain at all it was exhilarating and of course i had lots of fire hoses there just in case whatever i didn't feel any pain it was amazing uh and and i went back to my hotel it was actually an airbnb that night uh in in la and i um i i couldn't sleep because i was excited but also because there's blisters in my feet and i had to take a bunch of advil my feet were fine though but that that event kind of changed me it really changed me and on the sunday of that four day event uh what tony robbins did was he said that write down your goals and he then said i want you to think of one particular goal that you've been kind of putting off for a while in your life and what i want you to do is i want you to write down that goal and i also want you to write down a deadline date okay most most people don't set deadline dates for goals and so what i did was i was writing this book for a couple of years you know uh and it's this book back here of course 101 crucial lessons i don't teach in business school and i every time i met with somebody very very successful i'd ask for advice and i documented and then what happened was um i wrote down a deadline date that sunday before i flew back home the fourth day of the conference and i wrote i'll finish this book in two or three weeks and i flew home and it was a sunday night then on a monday morning i went into work and there's three general partners of ours in the firm myself included and i i just wasn't into it my heart wasn't into work that day and so around noon that day on that monday i said i'm i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna go home guys i'll i'll see ya i'm just not feeling it and they were cool they're like all right chris we'll see you tomorrow or whenever right so um and and i could do that because there was there's three of us owned the fund so i went home and i started writing a little bit on that monday and then i couldn't stop it was like that jerry maguire movie um and when tom cruise was writing that business plan and i wrote for three days straight basically and by wednesday i published the book i publish the book and you all know how to publish a book it's easy to do you can always go to haroonventures.com right book all lowercase but i published it by that wednesday and you know what wonderful things started to happen to me in my life um i felt exhilarated uh and i i ended up not really going back to work i kind of did for a while but i wasn't into it but it that that changed me that event and that led me to want to just live my life my own terms and embrace my passion which is teaching and up to that point i had been teaching during the evenings at a couple san francisco bay area business schools mba and undergrad which i love doing and i would always teach during the evenings and i was never exhausted i felt like i just woke up i felt alive i felt alive it was amazing uh and so what i want to do is um i actually want to go through this book and i created a bunch of exercises for you so welcome to e12 that's entrepreneurship semester one class number two and as always please make sure you have the appropriate workbook open today it's really important that you download the book today or have it open in google docs but it works for you you can use google docs word or or or pdf because it's over 50 pages today and within the book you'll see on the cover page that there's eight numbers and so what we're going to do today is we're going to go through uh the first eight sections of the book and again there's going to be plenty of exercises here as well and as always i'll tell you exactly when to go to the book uh and and when to do the exercises let me just rearrange my screen here and touch uh there's a quote here um from this kind of ugly guy who has awful doubt humor um but he's a bit humble sometimes the quote is the best entrepreneurs don't think that the glass is half empty or half full they believe that the glass is overflowing and i really do believe that you know i always see the positives in life always always always you know what we think we perceive you know thoughts your thoughts become reality um so um yeah we're 28 through other way through uh this this course right now uh and so as i mentioned before um we're going to go through this book this book uh in a lot a lot of detail a lot of detail and uh i published this um not only on um on on kindle but also amazon the print version uh and many of my students uh i'm so happy to hear uh have started to publish your own books as well and i've got copies in here uh and i also published it on on on audible.com i went to acx.com and did it there and that's the cover of the book from audible and i have the cover of the book made by some dude um i can't remember where he is actually no it was a woman actually actually her name is ultra contu on fiverr.com and she's based in bangladesh and she's great so she made this cover yeah yeah um and then uh what happened was i'm humbled to say that uh per this this video here um it was forbes wrote an article saying this is one of six books every entrepreneur should read right now along with lean startup zero to one by peter thiel uh the selfmade um billionaire effect start with why by simon sinek and the seven habits of highly effective people by stephen covey i actually went to business school at columbia with stephen covey covey's kit yeah so this this kind of changed my life uh this this book uh and i i was very transparent in this book and i find that it's easier for me uh to read social media posts or books or articles if they're very very short when i was a kid i loved reading books by roald dahl he made james and the giant peach and charlie in the chocolate factory and that influenced me because roald dahl that his chapters were very very short it was just easy for me to to go through it and that's what i did with this book here as well i kept the chapters very very short uh and i'm humbled to say that it was also the number three bestseller i think the kindle version for a while on on on amazon it's still it's since trailed off a bunch troll off a bunch yeah but i had a lot of fun put this together so there's 17 sections in the book and we're going to talk about the book in two different parts and so as i mentioned before the first half of the book is today's is in today's workbook we're gonna do sections one through eight uh and then next class um we're gonna do the second half of the book and discuss sections nine through seventeen okay so let me show you what that means so if you go here to to the workbook um you'll see here that this is more than 50 pages and it might be the page link might be a little bit different depending on how many notes you take in this workbook as well as if you're using it on a different form factor or pdf version or the the word version microsoft word version but the contents are the same and so what i'll do is i will ask you to click on these numbers every now and then to start doing exercises and i'll make it very very intuitive to know exactly how to do this and when as well and so you click here and then you click down here now if you can't see a hyperlink here after you click this then go up here and just click section one two three etc and what i did also was i put here the table of contents for the first half of the book and if you're using the microsoft word version of this document or the google docs version you can click on any of these to jump right to these chapters in in the book um it doesn't work i don't think on the pdf version so just scroll to where you should be so i included actually all of um all the content of the book the first half at least today and i'll include the next half of the book in next class's workbook so if you go here to section one i i talk about here high level what we cover in section one i had a lot of fun with 3d images today too and then if you want you can type your notes here for lesson number one and below each lesson title is the actual text from the book and don't read this during class read it during during homework or on the side if you want to it's optional completely so you can take notes here on on lesson number one if you want to and what you've learned and what you can also do is if you go to the next lesson here number two you can take notes here again and again there's a text here from that chapter they're very short and you have to read the entire thing you can skim it or read another day all right so let me go back here to the top just we're on the same page does that work oh yeah good there we go good all right so um as i talk about all 101 lessons in today's class and next class as well um you can take down notes as i just showed you in in the uh in the workbook you downloaded today so let's start now with with topic number one so uh section number one uh is called relationships are more important than product knowledge um and uh i have a little catch phrase for all all the sections in the book so the first cache phrase for section one is crucial networking tips to make you more successful now we've covered a bunch of this before so i'm just going to go over what we've already covered very quickly so i can focus much more attention on the new stuff but it's always important to reemphasize what i've taught you before because repetition is the mother of all skill okay so the very first lesson is steve jobs winning strategy uh how to get anything you want um and and if you're watching the replay i mean the nonlive version of this lecture uh what you can do if you want uh is you can actually go to um go to chapter one here or i should say uh the uh lesson number one by going here and what you can do is just click on this video here to watch a short video of steve jobs uh and if you don't want to click on this you can just search for three words uh in uh in youtube which are steve jobs ask um and you will never get anything you want in life now if you don't ask and when we were younger growing up um we were kids we asked our parents all the time for stuff you know like my youngest one drives me crazy i love them though he says dad can i have some candy i'll say no literally a minute later he'll say can i ask him kenny now no and then he'll ask again like five he's relentless relentless uh and then what happens is you stop asking once you've been conditioned to stop doing that for whatever reason um and and you can be tactful when you ask and not overdo it and upset people obviously but what happens is once we're done with high school for a lot of us when we go to a university or or start our first job whatever it is we don't really ask for anything because we learn that if we keep our heads down and we get good grades then everyone's proud of us and life works better but then what happens is many years into your career you wake up one day and you look around and you think to yourself my goodness why are all these other people around me getting uh getting promoted and not me why are all these other less capable people around me getting raises and not me and you realize and it might be too late or it's never too late but sometimes it it takes you to your 40s till you realize this that if you want a raise or promotion you have to ask nobody's ever made ceo or ever raised a lot of money as an entrepreneur without asking over and over and over and over again and do you ever see somebody that is is kind of average looking and uh their significant other is unbelievably attractive and you wonder what's going on why how did that happen and it's not always about money okay um it's it's because the the person that's less attractive and and we we refer to this usually as the matching principle in psychology you know people that are they're both very good looking usually end up dating but there's always an exception and many exceptions and it's not just about money it's about the person who is maybe average looking or whatever just thinking themselves i've got nothing to lose and everything to gain i'm going to keep asking people out over and over and over again because i know that the pain from being rejected a bunch of times is nothing compared to the pleasure which is massive of being of this person saying yes to a date so to speak you got to be relentless and a lot of entrepreneurs are like that as well they're they're relentless they they they just don't stop they're aggressive they're aggressive and and they just don't they really don't care what people think of them either and that's why they're very very successful they don't give a damn what people think yeah so you got to be the same way as well sorry my stomach's grambling trembling here i got this new ninja bullet thing and i'm it's my new diet here kale blueberries etc gives me energy so you got to ask if you want anything in life you got to ask over and over and over and over and over and over again kind of like michael jordan i feel over and over and over again and that's why i succeed don't forget that please don't forget that you got to ask ask often be a pain in the neck and don't give a damn if you get rejected who gives a damn you know jk rowling she you know she she got rejected by like 29 or 30 publishers she didn't give a damn that people thought she was a failure who cares on the 30th they said yes and she's a billionaire now all right let's move on now to number two um how to get a job and why sending in a resume can be a waste of time there is a better way but even if you have an amazing resume and an amazing linkedin profile it's not enough you're gonna have to network like crazy you're gonna have to do a ton of informational meetings that's how you get jobs in this new digital reality that's just how it works because if you apply online you're one of a thousand people applying for a job and the dude that gets the job is usually the one that knows somebody at the company so and we've covered this a lot before so i'm gonna skip over this one here uh but your your your network is your net your your net worth yeah all right next up is uh business is about people and not about what you know um you know a big rookie mistake is going to any business meeting and just talking about business right away that doesn't matter dude it doesn't matter most jobs in the world are sales and most ceo roles you're a salesperson and if you're a partner in a law firm don't be a part of a law firm but if you're a partner in a law firm uh or or in a venture capital firm you're a sales person as well so how do they do it well they do it by bonding and we've talked a lot about this before bond before business so business is about people and and not what you know it's important to reinforce that now what you have to do also is uh in in i knew a guy who is the head of government sales at ibm in dc and i had um i had dinner with him one night with him and with uh mohit aaron uh who's the founder of a great company called cohisti when i was on mohit's board and uh it was a great it was a great dinner we we had dinner in palo alto and because this dude was at ibm and in a very senior role i asked him you know i said how did you get to where you got and he talked about how he learned a lot from working actually in politics and i said oh what do you mean by that he said well in in the early 90s i worked for george bush senior in the white house and uh i was like oh my gosh this is amazing i got to ask you questions um and so i asked him i said can you please give me the most important lesson you learned from work in the white house for bush senior why was he successful and this guy told me he said it's because uh bush senior would treat people like celebrities and celebrities like people so if if you ever meet a celebrity or somebody very senior in your company just treat like a dream like a normal person they'll feel uncomfortable if you treat me differently and if you meet somebody who's not so important whatever on how you classify what not so important means treat them like a celebrity as well you know ask a lot of questions ask them a lot of questions you know where'd you grow up and that sort of thing and just just learn from them just bond and don't forget to say people's names at least once or twice during during a longer conversation it's more personable that way and after you meet with anybody um connect with them immediately on linkedin as well and just remember their name and while you're going off script here but while you're talking to them what you got to do is you got to visualize and think about how you're going to remember their name and so uh when i was 19 i actually did the dale carnegie public speaking program and there's this woman named uh cynthia mustachio and i met her once there back when i was 19 like ages ago last century and her name was cynthia mustachio but i remember thinking to myself every time i see her i'm going to think she has a big mustache and so that's how i remember cynthia mustachio and you got to do the same thing as well what you can do is you when you when you meet people because it's really embarrassing man like if you go to a a party or something and you forget somebody's name it's embarrassing to just say hey you which is what i do sometimes to be intellectually honest but what i what i do it's awful for me it's the worst for me because my wife's name is the same name as me her name is christine i'm chris so everybody remembers chris and christine and so we go to parties and and i i do this actually this i probably shouldn't tell you this trick i'm going there anywhere i don't care fully transparent as always so if christine is beside me at a party and there's somebody beside me and i have no idea what their name is i forget i go like this i scratch my neck and then christine jumps in and introduces herself and at the end of the night i've lost like eight layers of skin just kidding on my neck yeah but it works but you got to remember people's names and do name association as well if you can and so when you meet somebody if their first name uh is uh similar to a rock star's name or the same as a rock star's name uh then just think of it that way like if you meet somebody named bob um just just think of bob dylan you know singing a song or in an interview saying hey you know you can't really understand it but it's it's silly visualization i get it but you'll never forget it yeah yeah all right all right uh next and and also um not not just rock stars but think of i think of actors as well when you meet somebody or something really really silly really silly like like cynthia mustachio okay moving on all right next up um i want you to meet people have fun and learn and there's no reason why i threw in baby yoda here other than the fact that i think that baby yoda is adorable um no but in all seriousness um when i went down to wall street to work at goldman i was so nervous man i i was nervous because i i thought and i remember that time really well i had nirvana's song in my head dumb nirvana had it one of the early albums it was great there's a song called dumb and it goes i think i'm dumb i think i'm dumb and i remember when i was at goldman i remember thinking to myself if i don't say anything ever to anybody they might think i'm dumb but if i actually open my mouth and start talking they'll know i'm dumb and then the kirk cobain track would go on and on and on in my head perception becomes reality you got to get that out of your mind and so i told myself three things which assuaged my concerns you know when i went down and in hindsight i would have told myself fourth and the fourth thing would have been god already knows what's gonna happen so just don't worry just enjoy it don't question your faith but the three things i told myself at the time when i went down to goldman um was and i and i loved the power of three as you know uh in all my presentations and in everything um you know what i would say was uh i all i want to do is i want to meet people have fun and learn that's it those are my goals that's it and it was great because i met a ton of people my network is amazing partially because of that i enjoyed it i had fun i never saw it as works i conditioned myself to enjoy it i learned a ton and once you stop learning you got to move on to another job so if you're you're ever nervous about a new job don't worry because when you start a brand new job i don't care how old or young you are they're not going to give you like mission critical stuff right away especially when you're younger you know you're not going to show up first day and they're going to say write me a proposal on on if ibm should buy red hat which they already did but you know what i mean um don't worry when you show up you go through a training program or you'll you'll get mentors whatever or you'll photocopy like i did uh which i did with pleasure because i read all the stuff when i was photocopying when i worked at accenture i learned meet people have fun and learn all right next up we've got the importance of sincere gratitude and so this is a a great book here by the dalai lama called the art of happiness which i i read on my honeymoon actually um and i read this actually we were in um we were in bali and i bought the book and i read it there such a beautiful place to read that book too i loved it and the indonesian people were so nice oh my god they're incredible but read this book if you get a chance because it will really help you understand the importance of of of gratitude you know be grateful for something different every day and with my kids um when i put them into bed and we say prayers and my oldest one andrew he's too cool for school whatever i don't i don't do president anymore he's but he's old or whatever but my other two kids i do uh and um during prayers i i asked them to thank god every night for something new uh and so the we've knew it for years it's i mean it's getting crazy now they're like thank you god for blue smarties but you know what i mean if you're grateful for something different see if we're still recording okay good if you're grateful for something different every single day uh it'll get you into peak mental states and so i practice gratitude every day before i get up you know i say prayer and i thank god for ten things in this order always andrew matthew dylan christine mom dad jamie k elizabeth and my students you you so anyway that that's what i do and andrew matthew dylan are my kids matthew andrew dylan mad or dylan andrew matthew dam yeah matter damn yeah yeah now you'll never forget the initials of my kids mad or damn there we go so practice gratitude please a lot a lot uh focus on on on the beautiful things you have in your life not the material things but friends loved ones you know your parents are gonna love you no matter what happens no matter what happens they're gonna love you forever yeah and so your kids your spouse whatever your buddies that sort of thing be grateful for what you have and don't buy things by experiences okay next up your alma maters okay where you went to school the network matters a lot and so keep in contact it's a wonderful thing because a lot of times you'll learn more from your fellow classmates than you will from your teacher it's true it's true so one of the best networks you can have is a school network and you don't have to go to harvard business school for that any network really any network so your alma maters just remember that okay uh next up is a crucial post meeting networking best practice so it's really simple after every single meeting you have in business for the rest of your life that day i want you to connect with that person or the people you met that day using linkedin please do it please do it um because your your net worth is your your network so to speak uh and when people size you up uh and they look at at who you are and which contacts you have in common if you have a lot of secondary connections with somebody meaning uh contacts in common or whatever it is um then they're they're more likely gonna take you a little bit more seriously yeah it costs you nothing too it costs you nothing all right um and then um i think that's it yeah we're done now with uh with section number one which is relationships are more important than product knowledge and so what i want you to do now please is i want you to go to your workbook and i want you to click on number one meaning section one okay on the front page so i'll do that i'll come right back here so if i'm the first page now i'm going to click here on number one and if you can't click on this for some reason then what you can do is just click up here on section one it's the same thing okay so and that will take us right here to section one relationships are more important than product knowledge okay now what i want you to do is i want you to spend three minutes please right now writing down notes on how you can apply the lessons that we just talked about in section one to enhance your career and i wrote here chris will show you how to do this during class okay i guess i'll show you how to do this during class and i wrote that myself so all you do is you just go here and you just write notes it's that simple um and if you're using the pdf version um i actually set up this field here so that if you type a lot of notes uh it'll a vertical scroll bar will appear here so you can keep writing notes forever um so yeah take three minutes and what i want you to do is i want you to think about how you applying the lessons in section one can enhance or improve your career or your life make you happier so what you'll do is this is pretty easy you'll write something here if you want to okay it's it's optional and then and you can read the

one of the boxes just leave it or you can even do it for homework so you got three minutes to do this go so so so section two be longterm greedy use these crucial longterm strategies and watch your net worth soar so this here is mars in a cyber truck elon musk cyber truck it's tough to see i i screwed up the the graphic there let me go back here but i included it for for a reason in the 3d model and i did it because uh elon musk is so longterm focused um that he ignored all the naysayers when it comes to you know creating battery operated cars um he he ignored the naysayers that that tell him that he shouldn't try to get into the industrial car market as well meaning trucks he ignores the naysayers by thinking about colonizing mars out there i know but he's very longterm focused and that's one of the many reasons why he's extraordinarily successful all right let's talk about the first lesson here the longer the view the wiser the intention and that's a wonderful street there that graphic of uh lombard street which is here in san francisco now it's a very long and winding road yeah so um you got to be very very longterm focused and warren buffett said the longer the view the wisely intention i completely believe in it you know you got to be very very longterm focused you know don't just chase trends here and there you know what's a hot market now with the hot market tomorrow went up think longer term write your 10 year goals out and figure out how are you going to make that those 10year goals become a reality be longterm focused fill the gap just be longterm focused and the best entrepreneurs i know are the ones that are very very longterm focused um so just just write down your goals often and think longer term okay next up uh we've got uh learn earn return watch this video here i'm on the board of this charity watch this we've always been told we're not smart enough they say we lack the talent to get to the next level that we don't care enough about our community together we breathe different the air is different where we're from it's a place where greatness is organic and homegrown where the journey to greatness is watered and nourished with the sweat and tears of hard work humbly rooting the deep soils of discipline and sacrifice this place is not meant for everyone we're a family and we set the bar high we push further than anyone else we sacrifice anything at any time and we live every moment chasing greatness life skills performance is our game changer we don't eat until everyone is eating it's not about us anymore it's about our family our community academic performance is our ultimate weapon knowledge is power and it cannot be taken away from us sports performance is our secret we don't train just to train we train to be the best mediocrity is not acceptable suck pain is temporary quitting is forever in our family we're hungry for greatness hard work is all we know we understand the difference between good and great and that's why we prepare so that no one can take away what is ours greatness inspires greatness at the limo farm so i'm very proud and humbled to say that i'm on the board of directors of of the the limo foundation it's an amazing organization um and the founder there david um who has given the speech he's so inspirational he's amazing and i believe that everybody deserves a second chance and he always says that you need to learn earn and then return and i completely believe it and let me tell you a little bit more about david because i think we all do deserve a second chance um so david's brother is is on death row for um for yeah i'm not gonna go there but you can probably guess why and so uh david um he grew up um in east palo alto and east palo alto in america like in america you get really rich area and then kind of a scary neighborhood pretty quickly it's just it's just it's a land of extremes sometimes as much as i love this country but in east palo alto the high school graduation rate is only 40 percent and there's there's a lot of deadbeat fathers i don't think there's such thing as a debbie mother uh and so um david actually got a scholarship uh to go to a great school called juniperocera it's a private allboys school and i was gonna send my kids there as well um and i went to an event there a charity event and he gave a great speech that inspired me and changed my life in in that school there's a lot of athletes there too like greg jeffrey's great baseball player went there so did barry bonds and the best quarterback in history i can't remember his name right now but you guys all know his name um yeah he's dating gisele i think anyway tom brady i think yeah but um when i saw david give a speech there and by the way i decided not to send my kids to that school um i they all go to public school which is the it's i think it's better than prep i won't go there if you won't ask why i'll i'm happy to go there too but but in that that that uh that event uh david was keynote speech speaker um and he said something it changed my life um and he grew up in in east palo alto and got a scholarship to go to that school but he said don't expect to accomplish your dreams in life unless you help others accomplish theirs first let me say that again don't expect to accomplish your dreams in life unless you help others accomplish theirs first i believe in that i really do and and david has turned his life around as well he actually spent time in jail as well for robbing a safeway uh grocery store here when he was a he was a kid everybody deserves a second chance and so what we do in the limo foundation and i've donated a lot of money for scholarships there etc i'll continue to do so is um what we do is the people that work at limo they'll they'll pick up these these kids from really poor areas uh in the morning they'll give them full scholarships to the best private schools the best private schools they'll drive them to school then after school is done so they don't get into trouble doing bad stuff or whatever it is after school is done they'll bring them back to limo headquarters which is close to east palo alto and um they have a sports facility as you saw in that video and a lot of computers as well and then what they'll do is they'll help the students with their homework if they need help then they'll drive them back home by seven or eight o'clock at night and they do this every day every weekday and it's a wonderful thing because you're giving a chance to to all these underprivileged kids from tough backgrounds and i love them to death you know i i love them so much more because they come from a tough background and there's potential everybody i got to show you going off script again but whatever so i want to show you um these kids they're amazing and the reason i i created my course an entire mba one course was because of lima so so what i did was if i go to my home page if i scroll down the bottom here charity yeah it's here i think yeah so yeah these are the cherries i'm ball with so here's limo foundation and this is this is them they're amazing they're incredible but there's also pictures here i want to show you as well so right here this here is a it'll scroll through in a second here so this here is a picture of one of the amazing limo students uh and this is me in january of 2016 a day that changed my life um and and what happened was i i told david i said david why don't we why don't you let me teach all the limo students on a saturday and and i'll call it um an entire nba one one day and i hand made all these degrees for them and that was at the end of that one day and i gave my book as well now these these kids are great uh and i want to show you this actually this is this is what i want to show you the kids that were there that day they ranged from the ages of of um of nine uh to 17. and we spent 12 hours there and this was actually in longitude capitals venture capital headquarters in menlo park it was uh patrick one of one of the guys on the board let us use his office good dude uh and actually lilika right here um she graduated she she's i think she was at the san francisco art institute after she finished high school and she's on my board as well i'm proud to say and this dude here is nine and the oldest here was 17 at the time and the whole day when i was teaching them and the course is only eight hours on udemy but the version here i made it 12 hours a bit longer and the whole day when i was teaching them this every one of these kids including this dude here who's nine their eyes were wide open all day like they weren't blinking they were just oh my god like somebody's paying attention to me this is awesome their questions were brilliant and what fires me up is getting people that have been given a crappy set of cards in life and helping them achieve their dreams that fires me up that makes me more happy than me accomplishing my own dreams and there's potential in everybody which is why i do what i do and all these kids have gone on to do wonderful things wonderful things so far and you know again this was back in 2016 in january and i created these degrees for all of them um yeah i went to an art shop and i bought stickers it was fun and then what happened was this that was on a saturday then on i think it was a sunday i put my course online on on udemy my mba course and i think it might have been by a monday or so that business insider wrote an article that got shared hundreds of thousands of times and it took off it took off uh and it changed my life and everything i do like like teaching all of you the genesis is that day which changed my life right there don't expect to accomplish your dreams until you help others accomplish theirs first i really believe in that and so david said learn earn return just remember that make that the cornerstone of your life as well and your philosophy learn earn return it's simplistic and throughout your life like don't wait until you're worth a fortune to return you know give give time as well and i went to a columbia business school and i remember it was a henry kravis henry kravis is the number one private equity dude in history and um i'll show you i'll show you what it looks like here so he actually uh henry kravis uh there's more pictures of the students there so henry kravis kind of created the private equity market we kind of talked about him a bit when we were doing that that that case study with all the hats with disney a while back uh but um henry kravis he went to columbia and he was a straight c student grades don't matter that's right uh and what he did was he actually um he came to school and i was really excited because i thought that henry kravis was going to talk about deals and i read a great book when i was a kid called barbarians at the gate which talks about how henry kravis and others bought uh nabisco which stands for the national biscuit company took it private made a fortune and so he showed up at columbia one day to lecture and and instead of warren buffett one day too which is cool that he's also an alum there and i couldn't wait to learn about deals and he talked for an hour and a half all he talked about was just not giving money but giving your time of course he donates money too but giving your time uh and and i gained a tremendous amount of respect for him and he's totally right he's totally right you gotta you got to donate your time and do charity work throughout your entire career okay you really really do um and if you give you will get it's prophetic it's true it's been true since being a time you know give and you will receive so just remember that learn earn return and to quote david for the limo foundation before we move on to lesson 11. don't expect to accomplish your goals or dreams in life until you help others accomplish theirs first all right next up is number 11 the harder you work the luckier you get all right and that's of course a fourleaf clover it's true though like you will get a break you will get a break um you know if you're working your ass off and nothing is working out for you in your life nothing just keep at it keep at it you will get a break eventually you know like michael jordan said i failed over and over and over again and that's why i succeed you will get your lucky break i promise you you will one day and you look back and you'll be grateful to god that you had these potential failures or career setbacks early on because it actually guided you down a different path in life you might not understand that now but i promise you will one day i promise you you know years ago i was down and out i did everything right i worked for somebody i made him a fortune um he took all the credits and people loved me on the team and i was probably too good at my job and so yeah you know what he did to me and i remember calling my dad i said dad i don't get it like i work so hard you know and and i try to be a good person i try to give back and mentor and do what i can do and i made the company so much money and this shark you know this this awful person who i'll never name it's just i'll turn the other cheek i guess but i i told my dad about it and he's like chris you won't understand this one day but you'll look back years from now and and you'll be grateful uh that it happened because somehow it set you down a different path i said dad that doesn't make any sense um and i said it respectfully obviously i'm very respectful of my parents and then my dad he said chris what i want you to do is go to the old testament the old testament is kind of the basis for many great religions whatever and he said i want you to read the book of job which is prophetic because jay would be his job it's about this guy that lost everything and he didn't lose his faith and then much much later years later everything worked out for him and he kind of understood why things were the way they were so the harder you work the luckier you get you will get that lucky break okay just remember to keep failing over and over and over again and not giving a damn what anybody thinks and i promise you i promise you i guarantee it you will get your lucky break the harder you work the luckier you get all right next up is the most important investment you will ever make the most important investment you'll ever make is investment in you don't ever be cheap when it comes to education so if if there's a book you want to download or read and you're like i don't know man it's like it's like 10 bucks i don't know if i should don't be cheap just do it you know subscribe to audible.com it's like 10 or 15 bucks a month you can listen to two books every month from i don't know whoever your whoever your inspirations are listen to biographies or autobiographies on successful people they share their blueprint with you they give give give give gift you know they put they let their cards be seen by everybody because they've already made it and a lot of people that are very very successful the reason they were successful or became successful is because they gave remember in the first couple classes we talked about that book give and take and how the richest 1 people in the world you know are our givers the middle 98 percenter takers and the poorest one percent of my favorite uh the mother teresa's of the world that were never concerned about making money whatever yeah it's so funny though because it's coming full circle now but mother teresa there's this guy that went to that school sarah that david from the limo foundation went to and so the first year i went to that that charity event at limo or a party at sarah and i saw dave give that speech where he said don't expect to accomplish your goals or dreams until you help others accomplish theirs first the second year i went back as well as another charity event and i donated again i didn't send my kids to private school because i think public school is better better but the second year when i was there the guy that gave the keynotes and it was a tough act to follow because david's amazing the guy that gave the keynote was a guy that went to sarah as well who was um who was mother teresa's photographer so um and and he showed us some wonderful pictures i got to show you something give me i'm going off script i i don't give a damn um i'm gonna stand up here in my my lululemon sweats uh and walk around and find something to show you i almost fell down there but i'm okay all right um here it is see if it's in the picture i think it is um mother teresa said peace begins with a smile i love that it's so true it's so true peace does begin with a smile i i love her to death lover did that somebody's got to make a great movie about her she's probably my probably one of my favorite people that ever ever walked this great earth i'm so humbled to say i walked this earth at the same time she did i never got to meet her yeah but but she's wonderful she's wonderful and i'll put this up here actually yeah actually i'll put it right here so you can see both quotes okay all right and this here by the way if you're curious is how um we can tell if the the color is correct when we go into post edit so i have it face every single camera just to make sure that the color matches because when i change the colors behind me it messes up the pigment of my skin sometimes yeah yeah yeah all right because in some videos i look like ernie or bert all right all right next next up is um yeah oh oh yes so in terms of the most important investment you'll ever make it's an investment in you um education always always always don't ever be cheap when it comes to education if your dream was to go to i don't know yale medical school um and you know yeah you're worried about the money don't be just get in first and then figure it out you'll figure it out i actually there's this one guy i was friends with growing up and his mom used to always brag about him yeah and and his name was uh was was rick uh and he got into yale and his mom was bragging saying uh you know you know my son he got into jail so if your goal is to go to jail or or yale uh then um but but the money's an issue just get in first and you you get a scholarship you'll figure it out if you want something bad enough in life you'll always figure it out always figure it out but when it comes to smaller things in life like you know buying a book for education if you're on the fence just buy it dude just do it just do it don't be cheap when it comes to investing in yourself it's the best investment you'll ever make in yourself all right next up we've got uh learn what not to do um and i had so much fun creating these graphics here uh and and i was that guy that didn't watch game of thrones for years because i tried and then my kids were around so i'd have to turn it off and i try again later and there's eight million different characters and i just couldn't keep up there's too many characters man it's complicated eh uh and so uh i included that the bad dude there um something walker ice walker or something yeah bad guy and i show him because i i worked for people that should not be managing people they're they're awful awful people to work for and i did learn from them because i learned what not to do and so my attitude could have been negative forever but i told myself you know what two things number one i'm learning how not to treat people and number two this guy's such a jerk that he's actually helping me because he's motivating me to you know work hard on getting a better job and improve myself so i'm never complacent so when you work for other people learn what not to do as much as possible as much as possible all right i think i'm going to take that down because i'm not sure about the glare i think it's fine but it might mess things up here but just remember peace begins with it with a smile yeah and i've got this great quote here which which i used to use in a lot of my keynotes um and it's from a great poet american poet um a real renaissance man actually um and he lived here in san francisco for a while his name is mark twain uh and a lot of people don't realize that san francisco although it's california is not warm you know it's cold especially in the summer the warm season's the fall and so mark twain once said the coldest winter i ever spent was a summer in san francisco but mark twain also said the two most important days in your life are number one the day you're born and number two the day you find out why and hopefully through the soulsearching process of this entire mba degree including today's class next class on 101 crucial lessons my book hopefully that will help you to find your why okay all right so learn not what not to do when you work for schmucks there is light at the end of the tunnel and it is not an oncoming train all right so we are now done uh with uh with section two so what i want you to do now is another exercise so just go here click on section two or go up here and click on section two and then what you're going to do is um just take a couple minutes to write down here your thoughts on how thinking long term can help your career do the same for learn earn return if you want to as well as the hard work you'd like you get all the ones here in number two up until you see section three here okay great so you've got three minutes to do this go so section three avoiding burnouts i wrote here at the top avoid these crucial landmines and save your career and your life and it's killing me that there's no end of quote there or the end of bracket at the end there but that's good enough i'm going to leave it here because i want to prove a point that you'll never accomplish anything in life if you try to be a perfectionist okay if if you want to don't be a perfectionist if you want to vlog or blog or create some sort of youtube video and what's holding you back is you don't publish it because it's not perfect and you care what people are going to think screw it just do it as sir richard branson says screw it let's do it so i'm going to leave that that parenthesis oh my god i talk a lot i'm going to leave that parenthesis or close bracket out of it there so avoid burnout is section 3. and it is getting hot in here speaking of matches all right so uh lesson 14 is what to do the second you return from vacation and i worked when i was at goldman years ago one of my clients uh rhonda chang just a brilliant woman that worked at manulife which is a big insurance company that's canadian most people don't realize that and i was kind of stressed out and she said chris let me give you some advice and of course i didn't take her advice but i listened to it her advice was this the second you come back from vacation what i want you to do is i want you to open up your calendar and book your next vacation six months out that's the first thing you should do when you come back from vacation open your calendar and book your next vacation six months out otherwise you will burn out you will burn out yeah so it's um and it's i i gotta keep remembering this too so the second you return from vacation i want you to book your next vacation all right next up is uh stress will kill you don't be the gazelle i was watching national geographic years ago and it was this poor gazelle being chased uh by by by a a i think it was a cheetah or a tiger i can't remember and the gazelle was not caught thank goodness but national geographic put sensors on the gazelle to monitor the gazelles heart rates and other bodily functions and what happened was this the gazelle was running for their for the for its life and so obviously the heart was pumping really fast you know pumping quickly getting as much blood as possible you know circling around the body and what happened was the heart and the mind focused entirely on survival and as a result the heart and the mind i guess somehow shut down the immune system while the the gazelle was running running for its life and the heart and the mind also shut down the reproductive system and the gazelle aged a bit when it was being chased as well so the reproduction of functions shut down it aged faster and also it could get sick quicker because all the heart and mind was focused on was pumping more blood and surviving that's stress stress can kill you and so the only reason we're supposed to feel stressed like that in our lives is if you know going back to caveman times or whatever you're being chased by a dinosaur or whatever it is somebody that wants to take your life that's when you feel stress not all the time at work a lot of times stress is up here you know i i i feel stressed probably because i'm making myself stressed so don't be the gazelle just chill out man and what happens is conceiving having a baby is not it's not as easy as most people think um that that haven't had kids before you know we're we're very blessed that you know christine and i got pregnant pretty quickly with with all three three boys we wanted to have a daughter as well and usually people that have two kids have a girl and a boy and they're done um but anyway i love all three of my boys the same um but if we had a daughter be it'd be it'd be awesome too it'd be awesome too wholly off topic but a lot of people when they're trying to conceive trying to have a child it's so stressful and i remember for christine and i too the first time we want to have a kid there was a pregnancy test she bought it and the second i we found out she wasn't i was like damn it it was stressful you know because it's why are we here you know it says it's kids that's one of the reasons the why right but and then eventually obviously things worked out great for us but we have friends that have tried everything in vitro spending a gazillion dollars whatever trying to have kids and it's so stressful in their marriage and then they they conclude that maybe we just can't get pregnant and they do something wonderful they adopt adoption's a beautiful thing and then what happens is after they adopt this happens a lot a couple months later they get pregnant naturally because they weren't feeling stress don't be the gazelle please don't be the gazelle just just chill out it's all up here a lot of the stress you're doing it to yourself you're doing it to yourself it's all up here perception becomes reality so just condition yourself not to be stressed and maybe what you do every day is let me go back here every day on on your daily sheet here you do what i do which is when i wake up in the morning the first thing i do is um well i say prayer but i also thank god for 10 different things maybe what you do is part of your your daily sheet here you you can change this if you want to and at the end of today's lecture i'm going to remind you where to go get this and how to change this in powerpoint or other programs but you can change it so that this is your gratitude section here so you write down what your gratitude about or get rid of that section and have a gratitude section whatever it is along with writing your goals and your schedule for the next day as well okay don't be the gazelle please all right avoid burnout avoid burnout yeah all right next up we have got um when to take a day off when you are not sick this is important dude so are you ever kind of in a bad mooc because you're kind of i don't know you're kind of stressed at work and you didn't get enough sleep whatever and things aren't going that great at home temporarily and so you're not feeling great mentally physically you're fine but you go to work and you go to work and you might not be as nice as always put it mildly or you might be a little bit cold to somebody at work or you might be you're supposed to give a presentation and a lot of important people are around and you just stressed out man you should never have shown up to work that day to begin with and so i think it's important to take at least one or two days off a year when physically you're not sick but mentally you're not all there it's important and you can tell people you're sick because you are you know you're mentally kind of just feeling burned out it's a great investment to make yourself and i made this red the bottle here red on purpose uh supposed to be pills um it looks like it's clothing red on the outside i put the wrong thing on it whatever but but it on purpose to make a point just it's a sense of urgency when you're mentally drained do not whatever you do do not go to work that day whatever you do is going to hurt you more than help you all rights lord oh this is the ten commandments these laws unto thy people hear me oh hear me all pay heed the lord the lord jehovah has given unto you these fifteen like ten ten commandments for all to obey i love that that was one of the first movies i ever saw uh when i was a kid it was called history of the world part one uh by mel brooks and my dad took me the movie i don't think he realized it was gonna be some parts weren't supposed to be supposed to be shown to kids but that was before uh indiana jones in the temple of doom came out in 82 or 83 because that movie indiana jones off script whatever indiana jones in the temple of doom that was the that was the first movie that was um uh that that that should not have been pg it should have been a a which they got rid of and so because of temple of doom they created something called pg13 which is another category of of of raiding movies but that was uh that was uh mel brooks obviously very very funny man um and so i i i bring up the ten commandments it's not a religious thing here but um you know those ten rules are the basis for a lot of laws in in many wonderful countries and the basis for a lot of religions too but when those 10 rules were made thousands of years ago one they they knew our four mothers and forefathers that we need to take time off or we'll burn out it's human nature which hasn't changed in thousands of years and you know the rule is to rest on the sunday or saturday or whatever it is just one day a week one day a week you got to take off that one day a week at least and spend time with your family uh and you know just get just just focus on getting yourself centered so to speak get outside your body and kind of take a look uh see the forest from the trees um where are you in your life and what are you here for anyway and you know what what what's your why what's your longterm goals are you happy at work in your relationships whatever um are you bonding enough with your kids because by the time your kids are 13 years old you've already are 12 years old you've already spent 90 of the time you'll ever spend with them so just that's precious man like screw work if you can every now and then you know just skip work to go to mommy or daddy daddy child breakfast day at school because i missed andrews years ago and i don't know why i must have had an important meeting that was so important i can't remember it today but i do remember missing andrew daddy day at breakfast at school um so anyway you can't get that time back and take as many pictures as you can too before your kids get old just savor every second because they go fast man and my third son dylan my youngest son he said dad why is it there's not as many pictures of me as there are from my older brothers andrew matthew and i said of course there's enough it's the same and he counted them too right smart kid so i went to bed that night and i woke up and i looked at my night table and there are actually a couple pictures of him and me put in frames he went and he found them and they're still there now and this was years ago years ago yeah you you can't get that time back uh so just remember that uh you will burn out if you don't take time off uh it doesn't matter what what religion you are and who cares it's you gotta take one day off a week at least or you will burn out and they say that god rested on the seventh day and dude even there's this there's this uh amazing company uh that's uh it's it's in new york city and it's where i buy a lot of my uh my photo equipment from and it's called uh b h uh and i bought actually uh this camera here from from b h and a lot of my audio equipment as well this dude as well i buy from amazon too uh b h is in new york city and it was founded in 1973 and it's it's amazing great customer service great prices uh they always have stuff in stock if they can't they'll get it for you immediately like these the lights i'm using up above here they couldn't find them anywhere they're out of stock everywhere and i called them and they walked through walls for me there they're the best but you cannot buy anything from them when the sun goes down on fridays so let's go there right now actually it's 2 21 in new york or san francisco time which means it's 5 21 new york time um i don't know if they're they're probably they're probably still let's see you can you can put stuff in your basket but you can't buy it b h and i want to show this to you because i want to impress upon you just how they're so awesome and they still take off a day a week and they're still amazing so um let me see here is it sundown yet not yet not yet but i'm just going to put something in a basket for fun okay let's go here to microphones okay and let's go to i've actually got that one running right here as well on this camera yeah and this one too scary all right so watch this add to cart let's see what happens okay view cart okay it's still open now but if i were to do it you could try this yourself in an hour from now it would not work it wouldn't work so anyway a little on top there okay great so we are now done uh with uh with section number three uh and so the exercise is go to your workbook and click here on number three okay uh and oh there's a mistake there that's my mistake you won't see this in your version but i have to change the hyperlink so the way you do that is this so you go here let me just delete the hyperlink you go here and you and it's similar in word as well you go to link and the way you link it is it looks at the table of contents like heading ones and heading twos so what i want to do is i want to put in section three give me a second section three there good a plea reply click here good yeah cool so go here uh and take three minutes to to complete uh all the lesson boxes here if you want to again it's optional um so you got three minutes to do this go so let's move on to topic number four so topic number four is called create off the charts confidence wear that superman cape uh and at the top there it says crucial confidence lessons to help your career take off i love this section i love this section because confidence is entirely up here it's a light switch just flick it on just flick it on okay all right so the first lesson that we're going to talk about here in section number four is that there are no limits there are no limits and that's a ford mustang down there because henry ford said um whether or not you think you can do it you are right let me say that again whether or not you think you can do it you are right it's all up here i know it sounds so simplistic so simplistic but confidence is merely a light switch so just remember the past does not equal the future so if something brings you down confidence wise it never happened erase it from your mind or at least don't think about it at all whether or not you think you can do it you're right it's all up here there are no limits except the limits that we set for ourselves okay number 19 is the glass is always full always full and for those you're not familiar with that term there's a saying that if somebody sees a glass that's that has water up to the halfway mark negative people will say the glasses have empty and positive people will say no the glass is half full so perception becomes reality you know it's like the rodan sculpture i think therefore i am and so this glass here um is not half full it's it's overflowing in my mind and people think that i'm naively positive but i think the most positive people in the world are the only ones that can change the world okay i think all of you if you're very positive you can put your dent in the universe and change the world as well so i got to be careful because this thing is really overflowing whoa all right the glass is not half half full it's overflowing my cup overfloweth with optimism all right next up we have got um a balanced life means a more it means you're more productive in business um and we talked about this before so i don't go into much too much detail on that but you know there's there are many people in life that are incredibly wellrounded you know they they're in great shape they have a great family life um you know they've got a great social life they do well at work uh they're happy because they're balanced because they're balanced um and so if you're balanced and if you take your breaks as well i mean take that one day off per week uh then you'll be much more successful as well let me go i want to go back and i'm really curious to see if uh b h is open right now and and i have to bring this up because i mean this inspires me dude so b and h again they take that one day off a week let's see here um since 1973 it looks like no there's they're still they're still open but i will come back to this in a little while uh let's go begin checkout i'm not going to buy this obviously okay it doesn't say anything yet okay but once we're sundown uh in in new york that's when this will this will uh go to they'll shut it down okay sundown in new york i know it's crazy um but it's 701 p.m okay so three okay so an hour and 15 minutes i'll i'll try again later but if you're balanced in life you'll be much more productive and don't forget to fill out that daily schedule as well because that will help you be much more balanced all right let's move on number 21 there's luigi that's from luigi's mansion okay um number twenty it's great having kids because you get to be a kid all over again yeah um so number 21 is you're never as nervous uh as you sound um you know although you might not think you're confident and you might think you don't look confident when you're up there on the stage in front of the world when you feel nervous you don't look or sound nervous don't worry about it don't worry about it and who gives a when anybody thinks you anyway i don't care that's what you got to tell yourself okay luigi all right next up uh we've got avoid those people okay and i had to have another video game uh reference here not just nintendo but this here is for i guess ps4 and an xbox uh that's a character who i'm embarrassed to say is canadian in the game his name is trevor he's a bad bad person and he is from grand theft auto 5. and i'm smiling because in one scene he has a canadian accent as he takes on the u.s military it's a little bit funny but he's a bad dude and you got to avoid those people and when i say those people i mean anybody that that hurts your confidence or brings you down you know you're you're you're not a tree you can move move away from these people cut them out of your life that's right that's right get them out of your life you know if you've got a little bird on your shoulder um or a devil or whatever it is saying you're not good enough you're not good enough you're not good enough get rid of that person get it out of your life get that person out of your life so avoid those people and go with your gut your gut is always right you know when you're a lot younger like i was it was you know 10 strikes you're out now it's one strike you're out or maybe two sometimes but just avoid anybody in your life that makes you unhappy get them out of your life you know get them out of your mind they don't own you they can't control you get rid of them that's right change your environment you'll change your life as well somebody brings you down just get rid of them man get rid of them so anyway see you trevor all right all right this number 23 is that person speaks gooder than me and he's supposed to have glasses there i think i cut them off and i was trying to get rid of the transparent background there yeah so don't ever get intimidated by people that you think might have a better vocabulary than you or people that might have a different accent than you don't be intimidated by them because a lot of times the reason why they might be well spoken is because they're very arrogant or maybe they went to a great school because their parents went there and it's legacy that's how they got in just because somebody sounds confident or arrogant don't let the perception be that that fools you that they're right uh or more often right than you are you know confidence does not lead to uh to competence it might lead to perceived competence but not confidence in general so don't don't ever get intimidated by anybody that that speaks gooder than you at all has nothing to do with success in life it just bring you know it might have something to do with they were born with a silver spoon in their mouth and and i'd rather not hire somebody that was born with a silver spoon in their mouth because they're entitled i want somebody that's poor smart and hungry or somebody that's humble that's important to me so don't ever get intimidated by that and my dad actually he uh when he immigrated from from egypt uh to and i didn't know my dad had an accident until i was like 20 or so or 19 or 18 when i moved out um he sounds a bit like james earl jones uh this is cnn or or simba's father or whatever um but but i remember my dad told me when he first moved to canada it was really frustrating because he had to support himself by by he immigrated in 1967 he left egypt and he bribed an army official to get him to fail the eye exam for the crazy army or whatever was some stupid war in the middle east in 67. so my dad came to canada and in order to pay for himself here support himself before he met my mama um he uh he worked in a hospital cleaning test tubes and the nurses would all make fun of him uh because of his accent and he couldn't speak the language that well uh and uh you know he he could have just kind of given up uh or or just kind of accepted it and had it killed his confidence but uh he didn't he channeled that frustration uh and started his own company and so in hindsight i'm sure he's happy uh that uh that that happened yeah yeah so anyway and then he met my mama my mom is actually was a nurse or she isn't yeah she's still alive she she was a nurse and my dad's pickup line was uh jackie do you have a tylenol he asked my mom for tylenol my dad's a doctor yeah so anyway we love you dada so don't get intimidated by anybody with a different accent or someone speaks gooder than you because they're probably entitled dude and you peel back the onion a couple layers and they're nothing compared to you all right um and just remember number 24 is nobody is smarter than you okay and in the book i i think i put a a link to um let's go here to number 24. it's lesson number 24. yeah here it is here yeah i have a link here to a a short video from steve jobs that will change your life it's like a minute or two long um how nobody is smarter than you and once you realize that i'm not telling you to be arrogant but once you realize that you're money you know i i believe you and i believe in you once you believe in yourself you'll never be the same you'll never be the same because you'll be able to accomplish anything you want to in life just remember that nobody is smarter than you okay just remember that confidence is everything dude it's everything everything like i remember when i grew up in canada and um i was kind of reserved a little shy canadian uh humble proud of my roots um and i remember it was it was the 80s and ronald reagan was my hero and i remember though that the the cover of newsweek and time magazine at the time was the downfall of the american student and how the american student is 50th in the world of math and 50th in the world in science it's a downfall of the american student and every couple of years you see the same stupid headlines americans are 25th or 50th in math whatever sciences it doesn't matter and i learned something when i started um when i started teaching here during the evenings years ago in the san francisco bay area and about 50 percent of my students at least were born overseas okay so this is not an american thing what i'm about to say but yeah about 50 percent of my students and about 50 percent of people live here in the bay area and about 50 of the founders in the bay area and about 50 percent of the engineers here in the bay area were born overseas you know people like pierre omidjar the wonderful humanitarian he's uh he's he's person he's from iran and of course he founded ebay you got elon musk who splits his time uh between here actually owns a house not too far away from me now here in hillsborough uh he splits his time between here in southern california but but elon musk who also lived in canada for years but but he's from south africa yeah you got um sergey brin and one of the brilliant cofounders of uh of google was born in russia um so you've got this this beautiful crosscultural diversity here in the bay area but one thing i discovered when i started teaching here is that american students american students whether or not you're born in america doesn't matter but american students are number one in the world in the most important economic category that nobody talks about and that category is confidence you know with confidence comes the ability to sell sell a dream like like like like tucker does and there's the car version over here yeah um with confidence comes the ability to make something boring that's virtual that you can't see feel or touch like cloud software sound exciting think about it think how boring cloud software is dude it's boring you can't see it it's up there somewhere in the cloud it's elusive whatever but you've got these great entrepreneurs out there that sell it and they make a killing because they come across as confidence when they're delivering so confidence leads to at least to competent sometimes too not over being overconfident and of course i know that talking about the american angle some people overseas might think that's arrogance it's it's that's not what i'm getting at it's not like i've got to do a joke now here we go this is awful kids my american students are going to hate me but i'm american now so i'm allowed to do this how does an american screw in a light bulb oh my god i'm going to regret saying this i'm just one dumb comment away from just everybody hating me well here in america me as an american i hold a light bulb and the whole world spins around me okay i'm totally i'm totally kidding oh my god i've alienated my students i'm totally i love all of you okay i'm joking joking okay how does a a a dumb canadian me screwing a light bulb i hold it up there you go okay we're good now we're good but confidence uh it can be borderline arrogant sometimes you got to keep your confidence in check or just remember your humble roots and like steve jobs said you know stay foolish stay humble i i should i have to i should probably edit that out but f and i'm not going to sorry matt matt my editor he's american i love you matt you know i love you right your family familia yeah so um but no i i i do think a lot of american whether or not they were born in this country okay american students um see american students that were born overseas they also think they can hold a light bulb up okay but american students are number one in the world the most important economic category which is confidence which which lets you sell because a great entrepreneur great ceo etc they're great sales people i'm gonna shut the hell up but now about this one but nobody's smart in you remember that all right so we are now done uh with with section number four uh and so now it's time for the exercise so go to your workbook um and then just um and you can even click in the in the footer here go to section four does this work there we go yeah that's someone's gonna double click it yeah uh and and i had a blast making this bit this visual here man that was fun um but but what i want you to do is just go through all the lessons here in um in section four and you can read that text later if you want to and just write down you know spend three minutes and write down how how what can you apply in the lessons here in section four to to enhance your career you've got three minutes now go so do do all right moving on to section number five uh this is all about uh ethics crucial ethics lessons to keep you out of trouble okay so the first one is number 25 which is transparency builds trust i really believe this you can lose your reputation really quickly in business and in life but if you're fully transparent uh then this will this will help your career a lot uh and what i mean by that is you always list the risks with with like remember we look through the uh the s ones for facebook goldman et cetera whatever and and there's a lot of risks you gotta be transparent and list all the risks and whenever you're selling something to somebody else you gotta tell yourself i feel comfortable selling this to my parents because i would tell my parents the risks as well so you gotta disclose all risk and that that is abraham lincoln right there honest abe uh and he was very very transparent as well and apparently a very good man yeah so that's that's honest honest abe uh or as wayne and garth and wayne's world referred him as babraham lincoln i don't know what that means but anyway uh transparency builds trust remember that always disclose risks um and the most important risk within the first within the first couple minutes of pitching any idea uh or or uh product or service or whatever it is or if you're trying to raise money because it'll make you come across as being you know more ethical too and you know what dude it might be a litigation issue if you don't disclose them uh and never sell a financial product or raise money without getting a lawyer to write your documents first because the lawyer will make sure that you're you know the risks are disclosed yeah transparency builds trust all right next up is don't trust this type of person here so what am i talking about here well well this type of person is the type of person that backstabs other people and if at work or at school or whatever somebody is gossiping and we all will enjoy gossip for whatever stupid reason right otherwise don't watch tmz um i'm a lawyer i don't know if you guys watch the show but whatever uh but but don't don't trust anybody that that gossips because and don't take part in yourself uh because like around the water fountain or water cooler at work whatever because those people that are gossiping about others they'll gospel at you as well they will and the worst type of person is the person that cheats on their spouse it's a sacred bond man you know if they cheat on their spouse of course they're gonna cheat you cheat you in business as well you can't trust them it's like somebody that backstabs their spouse to you of course you're going to backstab you about you to somebody else you can't trust these people you can't trust them so just just be careful just be careful there's a shadow yeah all right so just don't trust that type of person and don't get involved in gossip either uh and on wall street you know if if somebody i knew somebody got fired years ago because he told a client what one of his other clients which is fidelity big mutual fund what they own or what they said in the meeting whatever um and so that that client might be grateful at first they heard that information but they don't trust you it's just it's not worth it it's not worth it yeah yeah yeah and sir richard branson and he's he's he's a he's amazing and i've listened to his all his audio books on audible um he just oozes positivity and he sets the corporate culture for the virgin companies which is why um if you fly virgin atlantic or virgin america all the uh the people that work on the airline the pilots et cetera the they're the attendants they're they're all really really positive and upbeat um you know unfortunately alaska airlines bought uh virgin america recently so maybe the culture will get you know diluted whatever but but i i mentioned sir richard branson because his parents if he ever backstabbed anybody when he was a kid they would make him stand up and look in the mirror and they would say look at yourself don't be that person don't be that person that backstabs others and little quick little side note off topic i have a guy i used to work for or work with i should say years ago he's so well spoken and i got and i met his parents at some events uh and and and i asked uh i asked his parents i said you know mike mike is so well spoken he's a gentleman he's confident how did he become that way and in you know how did you raise him and my kids were younger there so i was asking and they said well you know we one thing we did was we would make him stand up and read to us and when he was reading to us we we made sure he projected his voice and he was comfortable you know thinking on his feet and and standing and reading uh because we we got him to do it so we didn't just make him read in his room and my mom made me mom and dad during the summers when i was a kid they make me read for one hour every day every day in the summers which helped me out tremendously and i do with my kids now too except i add a sweetener i say if you read within the first hour of being awake you can read you got to do it for 45 minutes or if it's later on the day it's like an hour so i incentivize them you know yeah readers are leaders yeah yeah and actually also this guy mike the way that he learned how to public speak was i've never tried this but they would make him put a pencil in his mouth and then speak and then that would try to speak clearly that way so yeah all right moving on next up number 27 how to tell if somebody is lying that's pinocchio there right um does that mean i'm a liar because i got a big nose no it's aerodynamic though it is like dude when i'm skiing because of this like like when i tuck like i go fast like try to beat me in a bike race you can't because this is the aerodynamic side of it but i'm not a liar i'm not pinocchio i just have a very very aerodynamic nose okay all right if i can't laugh myself who can i laugh at that reminds me of a sting song an english man in new york which i love off of sting's album the dream of the blue turtles and sting said it takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile be yourself no matter what they say i love it so how do you tell if somebody's lying and i covered this before i think so i'm going to go into this really really quickly so when i worked at a great big hedge fund um and uh it was called citadel uh and uh ken griffin nice guy um he's the the founder billionaire he actually just bought the biggest house or the most expensive house in american history uh and i remember whenever i meet with him i spent an hour and a half with him or an hour actually a half hour with him one day in his office and we talked about video games for for ages and i looked at his bookshelf and whenever i used to go into somebody's office that's really successful more successful than me which is all the time i would look at what books they have and i'd order them immediately and the book that that ken had actually ken griffin was a damadorian book on finance which i bought and i i have now but when i was at citadel upper management uh they sent um they sent 25year fbi and cia veterans uh to train us on how to tell somebody's lying so now i know how to lie now i'm scared but this really helped us a lot because at that time it was like oh five i think there was a lot of there are a lot of scandals on wall street ceos were lying and there was a joke on wall street which is how do you know if a ceo is lying when they move their lips but but they trained us on how to tell somebody's lying and it helped me a lot actually then while i was investing and now today a lot i can tell usually so the four criteria is false and you one data point is mega trend you usually need two three or four of these to be correct or at least two of them right at least two uh and everybody's a little different so there are exceptions so number one if somebody breaks eye contact uh when they're talking about something that means they're they're probably lying however i break eye contact a lot like i look down a lot it's just i've always been like that i look down sometimes right um maybe i come across as not being confident i don't know just what i do um but if somebody breaks eye contact when answering a question then they might be lying yeah and sometimes when people blink a lot they might be lying and dude i see it on tv all the time i see people lying on tv all the time especially athletes when they're asked are they going to come back to the team next year and do they want to come back they break eye contact sometimes they they ramble um but you'll notice it you'll notice it and watch when somebody is being um being interviewed on television just watch how they answer questions you know if if they look away only the only time they look away a lot is when they're answering a question about something they're lying about that might be a lie all right so number one is they they break eye contact number two is if somebody rambles on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on kind of like i am right now to a simple yes or no question you know it's like a kid you ask a kid did you did you did you did you take the last cookie from the cookie jar no i didn't take a last quarter i mean i can't even reach it i mean look how tall it's it's high up there and then i don't know where the ladder is it's over there but you know what i mean with steps tool i can't find it's right there by the way but i yeah so there's that so we talked about um breaking eye contact we talked about rambling uh another one is if if somebody is shaking their foot and you can look down and see it sometimes when they're lying um and and sometimes because they've had too much caffeine which obviously means they get a hall pass but if somebody's shaking their foot a lot whatever when they're answering a question they could be lying and that's what a lie detector test does remember remember ben stiller and robert de niro and meet the parents right so that's anyway that's what they were testing he was cia i think in that movie yeah and there's there's one more oh yeah yeah touching your face touching your face yeah so uh if if if you touch your face a lot especially cover your mouth um and you usually don't do that but you do that when you're answering a question you might be lying so don't don't accept just one of those four criteria as being gospel that somebody's lying but multiple two or more of them could mean somebody is lying and speaking of touching your face and going off script again here of course given the health crisis we've all got these things um but what i do with my uh my kids and myself now is like and i went to my doctor years ago actually and i asked her i said why are you not sick all the time and she says because i wash my hands a lot and i never touch my face and so for me i've been biting my nails dude since i was born i i just i i do it it's it's terrible and my kids do it as well because monkey see monkey do you know whatever so what i did was i bought this stuff here it's called pro bell and um given the virus scare right now i put this on my nails and i put on my kid's nails as well and it tastes awful right it's not doesn't hurt yet but it just tastes awful but anyway a little off topic but interesting nonetheless so that's how you can tell if somebody is lying yeah all right next up is how to destroy your career in 30 seconds or less if you send an email or a text or or a snapchat and those are forever and you didn't think two or three times about it before clicking the send button you're done you're done just just be careful just be careful and i always know that emails are for life and everything i say on the phone is for life as well you know when i worked on wall street they used to say um just understand that all your calls could be recorded by the government the fbi whatever i was like that's fine i'm never going to do anything unethical anyway but that's you got to do that and sometimes they'll say this call is being recorded for for quality assurances or whatever or if you hear a beep in the background you're being recorded and they tell you to and it's totally bogus like when customer service calls you or you call them to get help and they're recording the call really like try it with them yeah can you help me oh by the way i'm recording this call what is that so a little off topic but just be really careful with electronic stuff email voicemail voice every it's all it's all recorded man you know the privacy died a decade or two ago you know once we realized there's a death of distance in privacy because the internet okay next up oh we're done here okay we're now done uh with with with section number five okay so go to uh section five in your book uh and and take three minutes uh to to to go through as we've done before take take three minutes to go through all the uh all these boxes here and just type in comments or notes or whatever it's optional of course on on on stuff you've learned here or stuff you can apply to to enhance your your career so you got three minutes go let's move on to section number six now so section number six is every battle is won before it's been fought it's a famous quote from sun tzu and the art of war and at the top there i wrote crucial battle preparation lessons and i've used that quote before from sun tzu so i'll go through this quickly all right so number one the first thing to talk about in section number six is over prepare for everything if you over prepare for something like really over prepare you actually will enjoy it when you're actually doing what you prepared for so like when you over prepare for a speech which i've i've done many many times before i get to the speech and i'm so ready i just kind of enjoy it man i can't explain it it's like this is out there but you remember when you were younger and you studied really hard for a math test like really really hard and your friends asked you for help and and you gave them help as well and you know when one teaches to learn but you you you studied a lot for it and then when you get into the exam it's so easy that you actually enjoy it you know you're you're comfortable you're confident you double check your work as always of course um but you enjoy it you know the exam is your friend you enjoy it because you over prepared and what i do also is when i give a speech quite often i bring two laptops and what i used to do is i would bring my laptop with powerpoint on whatever years ago and i would be i would bring uh those overhead slide things as well just in case just in case it broke down and when management at goldman sachs saw me do that like oh my gosh that's amazing i have confidence in this kit and when i give a speech at my brother's wedding back in 04 i did the same thing i had backups just in case just in case yeah so over prepare for for everything please and you know whenever when i used to interview other companies i prepare more than anybody like i recorded myself answering over 100 questions i video recorded myself too did i sound too monotone did i sound too arrogant did i pause enough did i use frameworks to tie together my logic when i was lost in terms of moving on to the bottom line is and so if you over prepare for everything then you'll actually enjoy the event when it occurs because quite often life all comes down to a few short moments the crucial speech or a test or whatever it is so over prepare you know like i i i know that i work harder than anybody and i think it's because when i was younger they they thought i had a learning disability and they want to fail me in the sixth grade in the eighth grade and screw them whatever not my my not my parents my teachers uh and so i i kind of grew up insecure and i over prepared for everything and i'm so grateful to god that they kind of misdiagnosed me or whatever it was they tried to destroy my confidence i'm grateful to god it happened because i over prepare for everything now because of it and there's a great book by malcolm globwell called um david and goliath and it's about how people that have been told their whole lives that they're not good enough are the ones that ultimately do stuff that's important so if if people have told you your whole life or when you were younger and if your confidence is lower than it should be just be grateful that whatever happens within reason obviously whatever happened happened because your secret weapon is you're going to work your ass off work harder than anybody else and i've always worked harder than anybody and i keep pushing the goal post out and challenging myself and i think a lot of it stems to you know it's it's it's nurture and nature you know and you look at your kids why are they successful or not or whatever who cares i mean success should be what they think of themselves right you want to raise confidence kids but you you know somebody is reaches their full potential in life because of nurture or nature so for for me part of it is nature it's part of everybody but it's nurture always you know being told when i was younger you can't do it you can't do you can't do it or elon musk poor guy in south africa he got the crap kicked out of him a lot growing up or steven spielberg you know been you know being diagnosed with with um with with uh i think it was a dyslexia i can't remember yeah um and and he didn't get into usc film school he didn't get in which is the best film school so chip on his shoulder which is great just great i'm sure i'm sure there's more to it than that but but sometimes i feel like if i hire people from from harvard business school they're going to be entitled as hell and a lot of times like i'll i'll lecture at a lot of schools and there's one in particular in the bay area that i hate lecturing at now because there is insane entitlement and arrogance from a lot of the students i'm not going to name that school but my favorite school in the bay area is san francisco state i love those kids of death love no death i've hired them i'll continue to hire them they're the best a lot of them are wealthy but a lot are not and a lot are not entitled the worst thing possible is hiring somebody that's entitled you know it's like like they start and they're like i don't have to sweep the floor it's like oh here's a broom let me teach you over prepare for everything all right i love hiring people that are poor smart and hungry number 30 is the ohair test pass it and watch your career take off so the o'hare test is the chicago o'hare airport is a big airport that's one of the biggest ones and quite and i've spent a lot of time there like eight hours waiting in between flights and quite often with somebody else at work you know someone more senior than me whatever and did they enjoy my company and vice versa in that eight hour layover the o hair test it's important relationships are more important than product knowledge let me move on all right oh i got this one from my dad my dad said chichi never take a short that's my nickname growing up chichi never take a shortcut you've never taken before when you're in a hurry i completely believe that and you've all been through that too i know every single one of you have you're late for something you're driving whatever you're like oh i got to cut a corner you know i got let me take a shortcut i've never taken before and you're even later than if you've gone the regular routes there's no shortcuts in life so i think that's important to keep in mind all right so we are now done uh with section number six okay and so as always we're going to do next is we're going to do an exercise go to the cover page here if you want and click on number six or you can do it up here i always love to have multiple ways to access stuff and spend three minutes uh writing down notes here uh in in all the lessons uh for uh for section six on using the stuff you've learned this lesson to help to enhance your career so you got three minutes to do this go do do so moving on to section number seven you can hear me using my transition words here okay so uh goal setting okay follow these crucial steps and achieve your dreams and see if you guys can tell me what trophy that's from trying to be global here okay so the first lesson here that's number 32 is run to your fears whatever you're most scared of in life i want you to run to those fears because i promise you your competition is probably just as scared they just don't say it so whatever you're most fearful of in business or in life in general run towards it if you're scared of accounting condition yourself to enjoy it learn it better in your competition have fun with it too and always question why things are called what they're called like we talked before about understanding math like we we talked about the the banana i ain't falling for no banana the tailpipe we talked about the banana on the denominator we talked about the balance sheet it's got a balance so just understand stuff and condition yourself to understand stuff and enjoy stuff that you're fearful of meaning accounting or whatever it is if it scares you it scares your competition just as much i promise you so understand it and condition yourself to enjoy it maybe i don't know maybe like when you're learning accounting wherever it is get yourself a nice cup of coffee and listen nice classical music in the backgrounds um you know and if you're having uh problems doing that then remember when you're younger and you went to the library you remember the exact table you sat at deep in the stacks downstairs in that corner and you had your your music on and coffee go back there recreate that environment okay so run to your fears brenda your fears and i put a shark tank there on purpose uh and and if you're absolutely terrified of sharks why not try that and i found this picture here i actually got on adobe i i subscribe to a service where i get images so um there's actually it's actually a cage you can do with a bunch of others right so um a little bit scary for me but i want to get the point across and never have you forget it run to your fears if you're scared of public speaking put yourself out there man move to open spaces make yourself do it run to your fears conquer your fear because you'll never reach your full potential in life unless you conquer your fears all right next up is uh make a gap analysis and so i i love this analogy here um of of the mountain so if your goal is to accomplish something so big and we'll just say it's the top of the mountain then i want you to visualize success and just think about what do you need to do to fill that gap between where you are now and the top of the mountain okay so make a very basic gap analysis as part of your goalsetting strategy okay now lesson number 34 is yale university's fascinating goal setting study okay and some people say this is an urban legend or myth i don't care i want to talk about it anyway so in 1950 yale university which is in the northeast of the united states yale university what they did in 1950 was they asked their their graduating class how many of you have written down your goals and three percent said i have written down my goals then 20 years later they went back to the same graduating class in 1970 and they calculated the net worth of everybody that graduated 1950 20 years later and the net worth of the three percent that had written down their goals was greater than the other 97 combined it's pretty amazing pretty amazing so don't forget to write down your goals and i used to carry my goals everywhere with me they're now on my my iphone in my calendar they repeat daily but what i used to do was i would print out i would buy those remember those those business cards you can make yourself you put in your printer and you pop them out and they look awful whatever i would get those and then i would use powerpoint i remember and just kind of write down type my goals on the back in front of 10 cards and carry them around with me everywhere and when i was down and out i'd read through them and i'm humbled to say i've accomplished pretty much every goal um one of the exceptions is uh not getting a black belt in karate but i'm a mean yellow belt yeah all right uh next up is number 35 should you get a graduate degree so you go to university um i i would say that if you network a lot and you still can't get that career change like if you set up literally a hundred networking meetings i found this that's i don't know that's siri talking again sorry put her aside it's a daily event right so uh if you set up a hundred networking meetings and you still can't change careers then consider getting your graduate degree that's what i would say that's what i would say yeah uh and you might say chris 100 is a little extreme well dude getting a graduate degree at university it can cost a hundred grand including lost wages etc 100 grand so that means that a thousand or 100 meetings that's like a thousand dollars each meeting i'm saving you so again do a hundred meetings i know it sounds like a lot and when i say 100 it probably means you'll do 30. and you'll still get what you want because you did 30. like james cameron said set your goals so high that if you fail you still fail above everyone else's expectations it's kind of like we did cryptocurrency stuff i didn't really expect you guys to do all 49 steps but if you do a lot of them that's that's better than just one or two or not right okay and what you can also do is if you try your best to network to make that career change and you can't then um go to linkedin and find people that have done it and look at their blueprints do they have graduate degrees what have they done to get there but i guarantee you i almost guarantee you if you network like crazy you can you get pretty much where you want in life obviously there's exceptions if you want to be a doctor you know you have to go to medical school although i'm on the board of a charity i'm really proud of called doctors without diplomas yeah that's not true yeah okay number number 36 i love this one push the goal post out um once you achieve your goals what you got to do is you got to you gotta you gotta push the goal post out you you gotta set new goals always because sometimes when you achieve your goals you get a little bit depressed i know it's weird like at first you're like hey i did it you're like dude now what got to keep pushing the goal post out keep challenging yourself uh and if you get a chance i want you to please go and do a search on matthew mcconaughey's best oscar speech from things 2014 or maybe a little bit before that i don't remember but he talks about competing with himself and challenging himself and it was amazing oscar speech i love it to death because he was so real he didn't give a damn what people thought about him he was talking to his dad up in heaven and he was saying dad i love you i know you're up there in your underpants probably with lemon pie with a can of miller light and you're dancing he didn't care then he talked about challenging himself so watch that that speech if you get a chance it's pretty powerful that's right from his heart you know and as maya angelou said people might not remember what you said but they'll never forget the way you made them feel i really believe that and when i get my explain you how to give a great speech um which you have to learn thoroughly um if you're gonna write a business plan because when you write a business plan and you present it to potential investors you got to inspire them as well and i'm going to teach you you know how to give a presentation um like uh like matthew mcconaughey did and i think he got the award for dallas buyer's club or some movie back then yet all right so we are now done with section number seven which is which is goal setting so as always i want you to please go to your workbook and then i want you to go to section seven and then spend um it's working sometimes that's double click yeah uh and then just spend uh spend three minutes uh going through um all the lessons here and document how you can apply some of the stuff you've learned to enhance your career and what you can always do of course is is for homework if you want it's all optional is you can read through the chapters here and so i provide you this is half the book today and next class i'll provide you with the other half of the book in next classes uh workbook as well and i thought about giving you the actual book and i said no way man i want it this way so you you at least have the option to write down notes because one little note you take in these boxes can change your life yeah you can have a breakthrough personal breakthrough yeah all right so take uh three minutes to do that now go do moving on to section number eight this is a great one so section number eight is simply called happiness is and i want to spell that happy ness there's a famous movie where they spell happiness with a y what movie was that you should have all seen it by now if not rent it's got my favorite actor in it ever will smith yeah uh and and if you didn't you're probably younger than me i'm an old man but if you didn't watch the fresh prince of belair ever watch it on netflix or online it's great and we'll we'll suppose the best i love that guy he's so inspirational too he's amazing he's amazing so um section number eight i wrote the top there it's crucial that you find an occupation you love and you'll never work a day in your life of course that's of course that's a very famous quote from confucius all right number 37 here is don't have a job instead have a passion and be happy and achieve all your business goals and if you get up in the morning and you tell yourself i'm going to work with all due respect you're doing it wrong you you got to find your your your purpose your passion you know what was the reason that that you were put on this earth so so find your passion and once you do as confucius said you'll never work a day for the rest of your life and it's like having a new baby you know when you have your first baby some of you might know you unlock a level of happiness you never thought you could feel in your life well when you get up every day and do what you love doing it's the same feelings that not as good but a little bit you know a little bit of that uh lightning in a bottle you feel it feel it inside here um that's that's that's pure happiness pure joy pure adrenaline uh pure euphoria when you do what you love doing and it might take you a while you know sometimes it might take to your 60s figure it out took me to my 40s and i'm 73 now so um yeah all right moving on number uh oh guys laugh your failures watch this video dude that i love the internet was made just for that i love that video it's hysterical and whenever you think about your failures i want to condition you to laugh at your failures you'll find humor in it you know to a certain extent um yeah anyway so i i i look at my failures in life and i laugh at them they're fun they're funny i don't know so condition yourself to kind of laugh your failures and you won't take life too seriously you'll live longer you'll be happier and you'll be willing to fail again so you can laugh again all right next up is uh money does not equal uh happiness yeah so i i i had a trip to um mumbai uh business trip years ago i think it was halt international school of business wanted me to give a speech or a couple speeches so i did it there in up in delhi as well and that trip changed me man it changed me because when we drove from the airport to the four seasons in mumbai whatever and mumbai's there's 25 million people tons of rich people there but there's also a large number of people that that live in the slums and we were stuck in traffic thank god because it was right by the slums and i've never seen so many people with nothing so happy they were so happy it's kind of like when um i remember matthew my youngest kid we used to go to the park on sundays and there was always a large group of people from immigrants and they would sit on they had nothing like we had a nice blanket to sit on they had cardboard boxes and they would barbecue and there was tons of them together in a family you know a bond of love and my son matthew he was like four of them he said daddy why why do they always seem so much happier than everybody else they got nothing to lose you know you want to buy experiences not things and then you go to an expensive restaurant look around dude when you go to expensive restaurant look around you see all these arrogant people whatever and i like going at good restaurants whatever but they're not as happy as when you go to a park you know it's sometimes i feel like like david geffen he's a billionaire and no high school degree started in the mail room and he uh he started guffing records he signed guns or roses and other bands whatever um and then he's one third of dreamworks as well along with katzenbergen and spielberg but but david geffen said for those of you that think that money can buy you happiness you don't have money it's it does not buy happiness at all i promise you and and i remember uh when i worked at goldman every christmas you get you got a bonus everyone was so damn depressed every christmas because the cancer of wall street and western society is you always compare yourselves to those that have more you know when you look into the bowl of your neighbor you shouldn't look to see if you have more you you should look to see if if he or she has enough or at least as much as you do yeah so money no matter what you think does not buy happiness of course we need to make a certain amount to live but don't make money your god you know it's it's one of the ten commandments not to do something like that so um yeah so anyway and there's there's a great british airways commercial that that i want to share with you soon um that was filmed in new york in india that really touched my heart and really makes you focus on family and what real happiness is my name is ratnesh i'm originally from mumbai i mean i like to call it bombay because i grew up there what do i remember from bombay well playing in the streets taking the local jasmine gajra's in the flower market and my mother praying in the morning you can move thousands of miles away but these images they are always with you i am alka my full name is i am 61 years old my son is ratnesh he's staying in new york first when he told me he wanted to go to the u.s i felt very excited but when the moment came when he was leaving india that time i was really very nervous and quite heartbroken i must say today british airways has given me a seat on a plane it is for my son's favorite dish okra paratha they will fly to america and surprise him in his apartment i think this will make him come home and visit his mummy i like every mother does i used to experiment with different things putting in his different box most of the time the other vegetables they will return from the school untouched but whenever i am giving okra it is finished i asked him why you like okra the most he said mama my teacher has told the child who eats okra becomes best in his mathematics my son is progressing day by day his dreams are getting fulfilled and his happiness is more than what i ever want for him when he will look at the tiffin box first he will think from where has it come but once he tastes the food he will know it is made by his mummy and i am sure he will start searching for me in his apartment i miss him so much because when he left home he was hardly 17 years old and from that day he did not return home i miss myself my mom had cooked my favorite meal and she was waiting for someone from british areas to pick up the different carrier so they sent me after flying from new york to mumbai there i was walking to her door smelling her cooking it was an incredible feeling sometimes even when you know what's going to happen you cannot even imagine how it's going to be i got the opportunity to see my mother in a way had never seen her before she looked lonely she looked like she sounds over the phone i just wanted to run out and give her a hug mommy i'm here oh it was a great moment it was a family moment even his dad was there we are three of us sad we talked and i didn't ask him when are you leaving i said i will not ask you today let this question be for tomorrow what a great commercial man um just appreciate what you have that's what happiness is not hoping to get something later that will make you happier thingwise but happiness is just appreciating what you have that's what it is and i believe that if you're happy and if this works this will work much much better you'll come full circle okay next up is all your wealth can't buy you health it's so true um and that that's a quote i think from i think i got it from bob dylan yeah all your wealth can't buy your health uh and there's a great book by the the dalai lama that i mentioned before i read it on my honeymoon and when i was in indonesia which is a great setting and read his book if you haven't yet but but he says basically that the problem with western society is we sacrifice our health our entire lives in order to make money then at the end of our lives we sacrifice all of our money to maintain our health and then we look back and we realize we never really lived to begin with so treasure every single day every day smell the roses along the way i used to tell myself years ago when i was in my 20s i was like i don't get married have kids until i make my fortune in my empire dude what's the point start a family now enjoy life today don't live for tomorrow live for today number 42 is when to change careers and i hate to end this on a down note but i have to in order to make a big impact like i mentioned before if you get out of bed in the morning and you're not happy and you feel some sort of depression related to your job channel that frustration and that unhappiness network like crazy channel that frustration and find something you love doing you know don't only focus on money i get it we have to pay bills i get it but enough's enough dude like at some point you got to realize that what am i here for why don't i laugh as much as i used to when i was younger why am i working in a big company i'm not being myself when i was younger i used to laugh so hard until i fell down with my buddies and it hurt in a good way why am i not laughing anymore why am i not being myself why do i get up every day and go to a job i can't stand working for people i don't respect and i don't respect myself as much anymore because i'm not being myself either i'm being political at work i'm not being me i just want to be me so if you're depressed and if you don't see work as something you enjoy don't do it you know don't try to live somebody else's life or or or be a prisoner in someone else's mind and do stuff to make them happy like if people in your life want you to be a lawyer or doctor whatever it is and you're not passionate about wanting to be a lawyer meaning you don't want to be a liar and you're not passionate about being a doctor because you want to be around blood and stuff if that's not i mean it's great to help people and i respect you know all doctors and um civil rights lawyers only but you got to do it what drives you makes you happy because i really do believe that if you if you do something you love doing in life you find the why of your life then you'll not only be good at it but the money will come accidentally you won't i mean i i go to a basketball game or a football game or whatever and all these dudes on the field they don't get up in the morning and say oh god i gotta go play a game today that's not work man that's awesome same thing with rock and roll star you know they don't get up in the morning oh god i gotta play another gig today it's a beautiful thing to be an artist because you get to express yourself which is why also like i think of what i do and what we all do as as being art you know the the palette for us is a powerpoint document or an excel spreadsheet that we can we can jazz up with cool buttons and colors and fun stuff it's artistic and it's fun for me and for you as well but you got to do something you love doing in life and you got to take risks as well and start your own companies on the side and in semesters three and four we'll you'll you'll write a kickass business plan and i'll help you kind of define what it might look like in the future for you but the worst thing can happen to you is you're you wake up one day and you're way older than you are now and you're working for this jerk that pays you this much money to make their dreams become a reality you got to take chance to take risks if you're not happy doing what you're doing either change your line of work by networking a lot or do a ton of side hustles on the side until you find something you're passionate about you know and that's kind of what i did too i i was working venture capital i wasn't happy i loved teaching and my side hustle was was teaching and then also putting stuff online like this um i didn't do it for the money i did it because i wanted to help like i want to help those those kids at the limo foundation that was fun for me helping it gave me a sense of purpose my why as well so if you get up in the morning and you tell yourself you're going to work then you got to find a different career path and start networking a lot to meet with people that work in different industries or just figure out what is the reason you're putting on this earth what makes you happy you want to make video games make video games you want to make movies make movies you want to you want to teach online teach online today you want to be a writer write that book jk rowling got rejected 30

workbook open as you can see on the screen here in either pdf format word format or google docs format very important you have at least one of these open today or one of them because there's going to be a lot of exercises kind of like what we did last class and so we're going to do the second half of the this book here today it's going to be plenty of exercises now you're probably thinking chris what is going on why do you have this thing up here uh well i want to do something a little bit different today before we we jumped right in on it um when i was a kid i remember laughing so hard until it hurt and with my friends you know what i'm talking about like yeah sometimes you're rolling on the ground laughing so hard and then what happens is you i don't know you kind of grow up and you you stop laughing as much and you start working for other people and you're just not yourself anymore and and this really hit home for me because this here is um this is a a chair from uh exhibition stadium uh which is a a great stadium that no longer exists in toronto and it was for the the blue jays actually the toronto blue jays my baseball team i'm so passionate about sports and you can see i've got a big ticket up there as well for the first game in 1977. tickets were really really big back then but now people are environmentally environmentally friendly dad here we know i promise but the one thing that my dad my brother my family and i my sisters my mom and we all have in common is a love of baseball and love of sports uh love of the toronto blue jays uh i'm feeling homesick just thinking about it uh and so i bought this uh it wasn't that expensive it's it's it's old it's rusty as you can tell i bought this on on ebay and get anything on ebay and it reminds me of the great times i had with my dad my my my family going to to games growing up and you know when i was a kid i didn't i didn't realize that baseball was a business or sports was a business and that's why it meant like i still love sports i still love baseball and the blue jays especially but um it meant a lot more to me when i was younger yeah and i just want to cherish these memories and you know sometimes when i um when i'm not in the best of moods or i'm kind of upset or depressed a bit which happens um i i think about when i was younger and when i laughed really hard until it hurt give me one second i want to get something here i got a got a couple these props here um this is a canadian money this is real canadian money what we use there that's i don't know why i picked that up sorry i got a couple baseball cards um and these meant the world to me when i was a kid these are rookie cards for a couple of great troll blue jays players whatever but this here this here means a lot to me and what happened and my kids like they have a love of baseball as well um and i want you all to think about one point in your life when you were so euphoric so happy and i want you to meditate about that really think about it and i want that to be your trigger for if you ever aren't in the best moods you're not if you're not in the peak peak mental state if you're not yourself if you're not happy i want you to remember when you were younger maybe you were family at a game or something bonding with your dad your mom your brother sister whatever your your spouse uh and that should put you back in that peak mental state we all have one or two incidents in our life that we all remember that put us in that peak mental state um and i wasn't even planning on talking about this but i'm gonna wing it this is um well okay so this here um and if you can't see it properly um then matt what i want you to do is match my editor he's awesome get the 2016 tops jose batista card uh number eight and and this here was um a game number of years ago uh and my three boys and i'll show you what my kids look like actually um so these are my my three boys this is um andrew um dylan a little munchkin uh and he's usually not that quiet and matthew and they're so different they're like sons to me i love them to death but i i bring this up because what happened was we were watching a baseball game it was 2015. it was one of the happiest moments of my life after i got married and all that good stuff in case christine's watching yeah but we were watching the game here it was in this house and we're upstairs and we were losing the game to the texas rangers another baseball team and this guy named jose batista and this is a a picture of of what happened he hit the most epic home run and it was a come from behind victory and then he flipped his bat and we all like my three boys and me they have a little brother me we all jumped up and down up and down up and down and we're yelling top of our lungs we were so happy and they were jumping into my arms and all that stuff and i was i was euphoric i was happy and whenever i'm not in the best moods i i think of this situation here and by the way this this baseball that he hits to win that game uh i bid on it in an auction i gotta open it right at the end killed me but whatever it is what is um but this is what i think of this moment right here and so um and maybe this camera has got a better angle i'm not sure with the lighting and stuff uh but but that's yeah this is uh this means the world to me you know my boys obviously my family and christine like my parents everybody and when i'm not in the best of moods uh what i do is um and give me one second put this back here make sure there's no glare i don't think there is whoop okay good glare scott nice when i'm running out of the best of moods i i think of this this event and it gets me back into peak mental state you know um you can snap out of a crappy mood by thinking of a trigger point in your life at one point in your life when you were you were so euphoric so happy um and you know just because you're older now doesn't mean you can't love the same things that you loved when you were a lot younger like you like video games f it play video games you know you love sports just don't think of it like it's a business just remember the times you bonded with family and friends over great sporting events and if you can if you get a chance you know if they tear down your stadium that you used to go to whether it's a i don't know cricket stadium rugby baseball australian rules football or whatever it is see if you can buy that that seat yeah so anyway um think about a trigger point if you can't in your life to get you in that peak mental state if you ever need uh a pickmeup okay what i'll do now is i'll go into highspeed and and i'll get this old rustic uh piece of not junk out of the way all right let's do this let's do this this will be a fun class so again this is uh e13 unjustified criticism is nothing more than a disguised compliment so bring it on doubters and i'm gonna have a bunch of brand new quotes that you're gonna enjoy i hope you enjoy them uh and so if if somebody says something that that dislodges you or gets you out of your peak mental state um and it's so unjustified i want you do one of two things the first thing i want you to do is i want you to tell yourself they're probably very envious for whatever reason you know and that criticism i don't choose to accept it because it's unjustified but you know what and this is me talking to the jerk that criticized me or whoever it might be in the future and you know who i'm talking about this has all happened to all of us you know what i want to thank that jerk because he is so insecure that he gave me a great compliment thank you bring it on bring it on and if you're not getting criticized you're not successful enough it's gonna happen and i want you to embrace it because unjustified criticism is nothing more than a disguised compliment think about that also think about um that trigger point you have in your life for me it's that jose batista baseball home run thing that uh got my kids and i in insanely great mood i gave him shivers just just thinking about it right now so again we're gonna go through uh just part two of of this book today uh and there's gonna be plenty of exercises as well and there's a reason why i have this stuff here and there's a reason why i have that there as well and i've got things that are really personal to me like i'm opening up in this episode like this is my most prized possession um it was jamaica january of uh of 1980 and and my dad and i um we went for a walk on the beach in jamaica and i was uh i was seven at the time and i remember really well and there was a this was this was dark green when i saw it initially there's tons of bamboo uh that was on the ground uh and somebody cut it up and my dad took it and he got a keychain uh and uh while i was swimming in the pool uh my mom was back in the hotel room because katie my little baby sister wasn't feeling all that but my dad actually carved in here and it says chris jamaica uh january 1980 i've used this as a pen holder whatever i spilled yeah years ago i don't remember when but um this means a lot to me so i'm going to open up today um yeah so anyway we're going to do part two now of this book yeah so again there's 17 sections in the book last class we talked talked about uh sections one through eight um and in this class we're gonna discuss sections um nine through seventeen nine through seventeen yeah all right um so just take notes uh in in today's workbook please on how you can apply every single lesson we talk about as many as you can to help to enhance your life make you happier improve your career prospects help you with goal settings et cetera and so what i did was i made 101 places for you to write down uh these uh in in the workbook so today's workbook we're going through lessons 43 43 through 101 uh and in the last workbook uh we did uh 1 through 42. so if you haven't watched the previous lecture please go back and watch it first okay thank you all right let's talk about section number nine which is called legal stuff is important and so lesson number 43 is how to protect your family it's really really important if you ever start a company or if you're part of a partnership and you have equity in a company that if somebody gives you an employment contract that you hire a lawyer to get them to review it the problem with lawyers is it doesn't matter if you really trust the person you're working for if they give you a contract to sign they probably haven't read it their lawyer made it and their lawyer is obviously biased uh and so i really want you to hire a lawyer on the side to review the legal document please do that please please please um and i've done that before when i've been part of partnerships and it saved my ass it really really did what happened was there was a stipulation in the contract that if one of our companies we invested in venture capital companies got acquired or had an exit or there was a harvesting event meaning it went public or whatever that there was no timeline when i would get paid but i would get paid one day which could have meant 50 million years from now whatever so that that really saved my backside uh and i actually ended up selling all my positions whatever um and also when when when i've had other like i in my hedge fund i had 25 of my hedge fund um i actually had a i sold it to a high net worth investor that was one of my my big backers uh and and i hired a lawyer as well and the lawyer put in some language to just to save my backside like all the people in business i've dealt with they've been ethical i trust them but you gotta you gotta watch out uh and the same thing when it comes to if you start your own company once you start generating some revenue please make sure that you talk to a lawyer i'm going to get down my knees now because i want you i want you to remember this forever can i make a fool of myself laugh at me ouch not with me hurts my knees now when i kneel i'm getting older please please please please i'll look at all three cameras actually please you you and you i want you all to get a lawyer to create documents to register your company when you start it okay when you start it once you start figuring out that this is something you want to do for us your life or you're generating revenue that sort of thing it's really important because when you start getting some success people will come after you they'll sue you it's happened to me having me recently actually uh and and somebody went after me because i've done well in one of my companies uh and um i i was gonna out litigate them i was gonna be a pit bull and a pork chop and finally they dropped the lawsuit which was garbage anyway yeah but thank god i was protected just in case nothing happened to god but you gotta prepare for the worst always always always please please please please um so yeah protect your family protect your family always and if it's kind of a if you're not sure how to do it with your your boss if you're given partnership or whatever in the company and if it's a really really big company as long as you don't have power but um a lot of times you do and when you approach your boss to talk about this or whoever it is partner or whatever just say look i have to i have to be mindful of my family in case i get hit by a bus or whatever i want to make sure taken care of and anybody with half a heart or half a brain will understand and sympathize with you as well okay all right uh next up is um always always always ask a lawyer for help if you're not sure if an investment opportunity is legitimate okay so if you don't get an investor uh offering memorandum or an s1 document or whatever it might be if you can't get access to that or if it looks like it's halfassed and i want you to get your lawyer to look at that first okay or at least seek their counsel and never invest in anything without legal documents anyway like an offering memorandum and we've talked a lot about how to read them how to read the s ones for example so make sure you have access that and don't ever do a big investment yourself without getting your lawyer to review the documents anyway just in case just in case okay so just always be careful and that's one of the very few lawyers i love which is um gandhi i think he's a lawyer right i think so yeah okay all right next up staying out of trouble uh in this digital reality we all know this that everything is recorded everything every email is recorded every snapchat that's right be careful that every snapchat every tick tock or whatever video the video does your platform is every single one is recorded every phone call is well everything so obviously not anything unethical but just be careful just be careful things can be taken out of context always always always in every message that i write in everything i say on every phone call i've always been very careful in case somebody takes it out of context always be careful if you feel like you're being trapped with an email don't respond don't respond be careful everything is recorded and when i worked on wall street every now and then i'd hear a beep in the background and that meant that the call is being recorded by law they had to do that and i know for a fact actually i think i know that a lot of my calls were recorded by the fbi and the sec i never got caught for anything i never did anything wrong but just in case be careful and i was told actually at a couple hedge funds i worked at that just pretend every call is recorded just be careful just be careful it's never worth it cutting corners anyway it's never worth it never worth it there's so many celebrities that have gone to jail for years for something as stupid as a buddy calling said hey i got a stock pick for you okay thanks okay i'll buy it whatever they heard something like martha stewart etc just be careful okay assume everything is documented every every single phone call email etc i know it sounds a little silly for me to go on and on and on about this but i care i care yeah and if a lawsuit ever does occur what's going to happen is lawyers will go through email servers um texts whatever and they'll find they can find something like i believe warren buffett said this if you ever investigate somebody enough you'll find something you'll find something so just be careful yeah all right next up is i want you to please go to your workbook uh and similar to what we did last class open today's workbook and i want you to click on the the number nine on the cover um meaning section nine on the front page click on the number nine there yeah and and if the if it doesn't work for some reason at the top it says section nine you can click on the hyperlink there as well um then i want you to spend three minutes please writing down notes on how you can apply the lessons in section nine to enhance your career you have three minutes go so do welcome back section number 10 management best practices the most crucial business revelation is that ideas are commodities execution is not it's all about the management team most people don't realize that most people think if i have a solid business model then everybody will invest and things will work out that's not the way the world works so let's go through these so lesson number 46 is you want to praise in public and criticize in private and this is a great way to manage people and i actually got this this idea here from the former ceo of a great software company called splunk splk is the ticker and godfrey sullivan was the former ceo of the company and i also invested in him when he was the ceo of a great software company called hyperion that oracle bought and before that godfrey worked at apple he has a lot of great experience and so i'm trying to impress upon the importance of looking at a great management team first before investing now godfrey said one day to me um you know i asked why are you so successful and people will do that man it's great and that's the crux of my whole book people will do that if you see somebody successful um get more successful than you are right now right now then i want you to approach them and ask them for you know just advice ask them what give me one reason why you're successful and people love talking about themselves look at me i i i won't stop talking i keep talking about myself it's annoying really uh but i'm not successful uh but so yeah i've met with a ton of people that are way more successful ever be and i always ask them for one piece of advice that's not taught in schools and that's why i do what i do right now i'm trying to teach you real practical based stuff uh and not theoretical crap and so godfrey said he likes to praise in public and only criticize in private you know there's nothing worse than being criticized by your boss in front of many of your i don't know fellow workmates um it destroys morale and it makes you makes you hate your job so nobody wins if you're going to critic criticize somebody uh try to do it in private always always always and there's right ways to criticize tim you know um and there's i hate to do this uh but i think i'll talk about it right now um and i'm gonna tell you about how to hire and fire people later but today but when you let somebody go that what you're supposed to do is this and they usually know it's coming you sit down with them and you start off by and usually do it on a monday if you want to ruin their weekend you you start off by saying something very complimentary but sincere and real like everybody on the team really enjoys your company and you did a great job on the project x or whatever it is however due to this this and this i'm so sorry we have to let you go so you always start with with something positive and that's extreme because i'm talking about letting somebody go and i'll give you more information on how to do that very very soon but when you're criticizing somebody uh that you want to keep um you want to start off and be complimentary at first yeah yeah it's more subtle that way and it'll take it better as well yeah all right um next up is be unemotional in business that's that's the incredible hulk there um so and i've mentioned this before that a lot of the best investors i've worked for a lot of billionaires and i won't say which ones ever but some of them it feels like they were borderline aspergers um and they were unemotional and i think that's one of the reasons why they're very successful but you can train yourself to sort of be like that you got to check your emotions at the door and never get too emotional in business and remember warren buffett said the new york stock exchange is the only store in the world where consumers sell stuff and it goes on sale i want you to be unemotional and i'm a very positive person however when things go incredibly well for you i don't want you to highfive and throw a big party et cetera unless it's a massive milestone whatever in business i want you stay levelheaded and you got to stay levelheaded because if the opposite happens you'll freak out check your emotions at the door be unemotional about business always always always uh and you can condition yourself to do that too like when i come home from work i condition myself so that when i touch the front door and start to turn it i leave all my stress and thoughts about work at work inside my house it's a sacred temple my kids christine my kids and i my family but i conditioned myself that way and you can condition yourself as well to check your emotions at the door when you show up to work even so you're not emotional especially when it comes to finance yeah all right next up is the most important investment characteristic which you can probably guess here has to do with horses the jockey me and the dude on top of the horse the jockey is more important than the horse and what that means is the management team or the founder or founders they're more important than the business model the horse is the business model in this analogy okay always remember that always always always and when you assess a management team um make sure that they get you excited about the vision they paint for you so to speak or the dream they're selling to you because the business model will change if it's an early stage company but i want you to be incredibly passionate because the potential investor that's watching you present they're thinking themselves does this person get me excited deep down in my belly about this business opportunity and i know that that business opportunity that the market will probably change one day but i want to know that this this this person that's trying to sell me the idea will be able to sell me on another idea or be able to adapt and get me excited about another business model or whatever it might be or new product they might be offering a new service if i invest if i invest and as mark cuban said ideas are commodities by execution is not and mark cuban is is the dude that he sold um broadcast.com uh to youtube for or pardon me to yahoo for several billion dollars in the late 90s and that could have been youtube actually but it wasn't they messed up the acquisition but mark cuban also said you only have to be right in business one time so just remember that when you keep trying to write different business plans if you fail a couple times so what you will be successful eventually and i don't have to read you that that quote on the wall uh with michael jordan there yeah you get it okay next up we've got um yeah hire slowly and and fire quickly so when you hire somebody the best way to do it is to really over interview um and so like when i worked at goldman sachs like the smartest people in the world didn't work there i mean they hired me but they they hired people that really got along well and we had to go through a gazillion interviews a ton of them like 40 sometimes 40 or 50. it was nuts but the jerk factor is very very low and they took their time thank god because one stupid or one employee with with a bad attitude i should say can destroy an entire company it's true you've all been doing you've done group projects in school or at work where there's one jerk that just destroys everything it's not worth it it's not worth it so when you interview people i want you to make sure that they are interviewed multiple times in different settings under different amounts of pressure and i say with love my heart so interview them maybe at a breakfast meeting uh do a twoonone lunch meeting uh have them present to five or six people in your company if you have that many people um you know go out maybe for dinner with them and their spouse um and see them in all aspects of their life because they can't act the whole time you know if if they're the salty earth they're good people um you'll know you'll know and usually i know within 30 seconds um whether or not i trust them and go with your gut too because you learn by by you know by through business over over many decades that your gut is often right and we've all gotten burned in our personal lives and professional lives too and we end up telling ourselves you know fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me go with your gut go with your gut because a lot of times you're when you get screwed over in business or personally speaking when you're younger remember when you broke your heart the first time it hurt and it never hurt that bad again right you kind of learn you kind of learn um and and in hindsight after you get screwed over in business or personally you tell yourself damn it i knew i knew go with your gut go with your gut but take a long time to hire people and when you're interviewing people make sure that you feel it in your heart that they're not interviewing for a job they're interviewing for a passion okay and they'll be way more productive that way trust me on this the difference between hiring an average engineer and an incredible engineer is 10 times more in performance and a lot of engineers actually they love what they do you know they just they're they're they're nerds they they love they grew up like like i did you know playing video games i was gonna include this i don't know i guess i didn't but this was uh i guess this is the the first um joystick i had for my um this is the apple predecessor that with the apple 2e actually but a lot of a lot of people that are engineers and nice to be a software engineer too we grew up loving it like these are some of the programs that i i you know i developed for microsoft and other stuff too but i loved it man it was fun you know and that's why a lot of technology companies do well because the people are so passionate about what they're doing they just love it so make sure that whoever you're interviewing is just as passionate as you are they've got to love it they've got to absolutely love it otherwise if it feels like a job then you'll you'll never put your dent in the universe as a company all right oh actually let me let me go back here um yeah so higher slowly and fire quickly um let me talk a little bit more about um about firing i i talked about it briefly and i remember the first time i had to fire somebody it was it was hell and obviously it was way harder for the person that i let go and i didn't know what the hell to do and i was nervous and and it sounds stupid for me saying this because it sucks that i'd let the other person go but you have to do it and so what i did was i called um one of my good friends i went to mcgill with a guy named mike ball he was my fraternity too great guy and and i asked him because his dad was the head of hr uh human resources at att or ncr for years and i asked him how do i do it and and he helped me out with some advice and and i took what he told me and a bunch of other top silicon valley entrepreneurs i ask their feedback i always over prepare for everything and here's the greatest it's what i learned when you let somebody go you do it on a monday like i mentioned before you sit down with them and what you do is this a bit repetitive here i'm sorry but i have to do it you start off by saying something genuinely nice and you do it like this john i just want to let you know that we really appreciate the great job you've done on the x project making that up and you know everybody loves you here and you know times are tough but due to the the fact that and then this is where you mentioned what they did wrong that you missed your i'm gonna make it up you missed your quota three quarters in a row we have to let you go then you pause and you say nothing you pause and dude it feels like freaking eternity just waiting sometimes you say nothing and then they'll they'll say something um a lot of times they'll know like they'll kind of they figure it out it's happening you know like when they're they're called into the meeting on a monday they know they know or at least they have a hunch and they probably know it's coming because they haven't been performing as well it's usually not a massive surprise sometimes it is and then you just wait and they might say something rightly so about you know what about my family and that sort of thing and then you you have a file there and you say well we prepared for you uh these these benefits uh and you wanna be very generous of course and if it's a bigger company you'll have somebody from human resources in the room as well and if you don't know what to do and it's a tiny company it's just you and somebody else or a couple people you can always get a lawyer to help you call them and ask them how do i do this you have to do it the right way and then what happens and most of the time people are cool about it but i've been in situations where a colleague of mine was let go and they had to call security and you can always get a security guard uh you can you can hire one or you can get somebody in a bigger company uh to be standing by just outside the room just in case just in case and if they're a bit abrasive uh or you know the person that you let go um you can always say and you could be firm you know if they're being really pushy you could say do i have to call security like that like that so anyway and then what happens usually is they they look at the paperwork quickly and and then they they shake your hand that's it yeah yeah and you got to be careful too because if you let go and it's happened to everybody happen to me um if you're let go if you're not careful and if if you're abrasive or a jerk well first of all you're gonna make it easier for them to let you go but if you're a jerk about it good luck getting another job because that's your reference whoever lets you go is your former boss that's your reference so be good about it like when i was let go i didn't like my boss he put his hand out uh and i didn't shake it i gave him a hug and i hugged him so hard i broke all his ribs no i'm just kidding i'm just kidding it was bogus um i i made the firm money i have no idea what happened but i was strategic um i think he was threatened by me but it is what it is but i'm so glad it happened because in hindsight many many many many years later i look back i'm like thank you god for guiding me down that path a different path sometimes you won't understand in life why things happen and then years later you look back and you'll say you know what as painful as that was professionally for me it was the best thing that could have happened to me because it forced me down this path here so um but just yeah be careful on your way out and and if any of you have left a company and you didn't live on leave on great terms and somebody asked for a reference you don't have to get your old boss as a reference you can always have a former colleague a buddy of yours who can even write a nice recommendation on linkedin so that's just food for thought yeah uh and when you let people go you gotta you gotta let them go fast it's so hard and after you let them go say you wait six months too long after you let them go you're like damn it they hurt productivity i should let them go way way before way way way way earlier it's so hard though man it's i've got a big heart um but at the same time you got to put business first and if it if it ever if your heart gets in the way of business sometimes just think to yourself this is all things to say but i have to you're hurting your family if you don't do it sooner and you're hurting them as well because they're rotting away at work when they could be doing something else they're more passionate about and i know it doesn't make sense to a lot of us right now but many years later you'll look back and you might be glad that you were let go yeah all right okay next up um we've got touch hand only once um i didn't know what icon to use here what graphics so i found like an old file cabinet thing because i got this one from my dad and this is old school device it's great though he said if you ever if you ever write a letter and you're a little bit negative in the letter or mean by accident or whatever it is and if you're emotional don't mail that letter yet take that letter my dad he's he's arabic from egypt he'd say take the letter put it in the drawer and then i can't do his accent well i'm sorry but open it the next day the drawer next morning after you sleep on it and if you still feel the same way after you read it then send it and that's great advice it's great advice because in this digital reality now um you could send an email when you're in a crap mood and destroy your life or hurt your career a lot and what i used to do is i used to have christine who's my wife and my shrink and my wife and my shrink um she um i used to ever read some of my emails i'm like did i sound how's the tone here that sort of thing because things can be really misinterpreted you know like if somebody types in all caps which i never do but it's like they're yelling and usually with almost all my emails since day one i use the word please and thank you and all it's just on my birth thanks something i've always done yeah touch hand only once yeah yeah oh my god i think i screwed that up but screw it let me go back there i meant to say something else there but that was good advice screw it we'll keep that in there it's fine touch hand only once i'm such an idiot it's an old school business thing which is this in the old days you used to get interoffice memos and there's a string on it you unwrap open the envelope and the best business people in the world will say when a memo comes in your hand or an email or whatever it is only let it touch your hand one time and take care of everything right away if you can unless it's something that's gonna take forever to do and i've adopted that actually in many aspects of my life and this is gonna sound out there but it saves me time when i make a salad at night and i love salad with oil and vinegar and salt and pepper and i have this awesome uh bagel spice it's it's it's it's what you put on everything bagels but it's a spice i get it from trader joe's the best ever but i only let all those things touch my hand once so i open the cupboard up once and i take all those out at the same time once you put them all back in at once right i know it sounds silly but if you use that mentality you will save a ton of time a ton of time so touch hand only once okay all right so now i want you to please go to your workbook and click on number 10 meaning section 10 on the front page and then i want you to take three minutes please and write down notes on how you can apply the lessons in section 10 to enhance your career or make you happier you've got three minutes go do do all right let's move on now to section number 11 which is called navigating corporate politics and swimming with sharks yeah all right so the first one here is keep that letter in your drawer i i i'm such an idiot i jumped the gun i already talked about this one so i'm just gonna skip it okay but just keep in mind that a lot of times in business you don't get to the next level because of politics which sucks and i'm going to give you some i guess some some tips here on how to um how to swim with the shark so to speak as much as i hate that so religion and politics leave them at home don't ever talk about them in work ever ever ever because the way that politics works usually in most countries there's two parties party one or party two you know or sometimes there's three like in canada there's there's a bunch actually there's progressive conservative which is like right wing relatively speaking you got liberals and then you've got um ndp which i can't stand i mean ndp yeah which is uh they're more socialist yeah yeah sorry about that sort of and in america you've got republicans and democrats and republicans means that you're more rightwing and democrats means that you're less rightwing you're more leftwing and i live here in california on the left coast get myself in trouble there i gotta be careful but if you tell people what your political affiliation is and i think i'm probably a libertarian i believe in the power of the individual and that you can accomplish anything so i'm less so married to these parties although i will swap every now and then okay but if you tell somebody that you're in one part you like one type of politician then half the people will hate you or not like you as much i don't know what half but just be careful it's not worth it so what do you do when politics come up at work well you just don't talk if a bunch of people are around or if somebody tries to bait you into it you can say two words i understand and that won't let them know that you're one with one party or the other party i i understand that will help uh and religion is is is tough it's tough um it's really really hard because i am really passionate about stuff but and i'm i'm very respectful of every religion on the planet but just be careful at class or at uh at um at work getting nervous now yeah yeah just be careful yeah all right next up is um unjustified criticism is a disguised compliment i had to mention this one twice okay and so yeah if somebody criticizes you unfairly you got to tell yourself thanks man like don't say it out loud it'll drive them nuts um don't say it out loud it'll it won't help you but just tell that to yourself and your mind and that will say it is yeah yeah so remember that unjustify and write it down please write it down unjustified criticism is a disguised compliment that will add years to your life it'll take away a lot of stress in your heart and your mind as well yeah all right um what do we have next number number 54. come on slides move faster there we go good all right next one is um how to talk buying people's backs and that's um looks like a nail file but i it's it's actually a butter knife um i didn't want to have a real real knife whatever but the best way is not to do it at all i know it sounds silly and you're like chris seriously like i'm an adult here right i know but don't get tied into that like office gossip like stay away from gossip at the office um like sometimes it's you're around the water cooler and somebody will be gossiping you're like yeah yeah you're interested in hearing it but just don't don't be a part of that people won't trust you and if you gossip even a little bit about somebody at work they'll appreciate hearing it but they won't trust you you know it's like somebody that backstabs their wife or their husband you know says something bad about them um you're like dude i can never trust you so stay away from gossip at work it's not worth it it's not worth it at all yeah all right next up is observe and then make your move so every company has a slightly different corporate culture and every team does and every board does as well so when you join a new company i don't want you to make your move right away and try to really impress people right away hear me out i want you to question things at first like question in your mind and really observe how the system works because every company's a little bit different you know and be nice to the assistants please anybody that isn't is an plus the assistants have been there longer than most people and they probably worked with their boss at the previous company as well and they know how to get stuff done and if you confide in them and get them to mentor you they'll love it they'll trust you you'll trust them and they'll help you with your career yeah yeah you can really you can really understand what kind of a person somebody is or how much jerk they are by how they treat assistance so observe observe how the system works at first before making your move you got one shot to really impress people just sit back a bit don't be lazy but don't talk up too much initially just observe how it works you know quietly observe the system because every com every company is is a little bit different a little bit different yeah all right next up is the army promotes you because of this um so it's so hard sometimes to to deal with authority and not talk back and just do what you're told to do and but sometimes if you if you kind of follow blindly i hate to say sometimes it helps you with your career a lot uh and you might be frustrated but it in the long run it'll it'll pay off because you'll get what you want and if you're frustrated enough you can leave anyway but the biggest thing here is that when i used to work in consultant it was kind of like the army you know it's when there's a war the troops go and fight where the war is if you're a consultant you're sent wherever the client is wherever all the any any it might be a different country and i've been all over the place doing that many countries and there's actually um there's a guy who who used to be the cochairman of goldman sachs and he actually came and lectured at columbia university uh and i think his name was uh was was stephen levitt i think yeah um actually i gotta go find out right now because his son actually is the guy that wrote game of thrones let me let me go here here sorry i i have to find out right now uh but but i remember he was there and i was in new york and i was about to join goldman and goldman wanted me to start my career in tokyo and and i didn't want to go and so what i did um hold on a second bend the office guy's last name i'll talk about this guys what i did was it was i said to him i'll get that second i said do i really have to go and he stared me down in front of everybody there's like 60 people in the class said yes you do so if you want to get promoted to a senior senior level in companies sometimes you have to move if they tell you to move it sucks uh but but if you do that you take one for the team but don't go unless you get something promised in return you know basically say i'll go but i want to make sure i get promoted and you can hold up you can kind of use that card and they'll promote you as they send you um but this guy's name um the guy that wrote like game of thrones uh he um okay so he was the the screenwriter david benioff and his dad was a professor steven somebody i gotta know because he changed his last name benioff yeah steven friedman it was steven friedman yeah yeah he changed his last name from benioff to friedman because there's lots of david friedman that are writers but that's his dad yeah his dad was um goldman sachs where is he getting here now now i'm curious stephen friedman that's right here is the guy this is the guy that that stared me down yeah yeah then eventually he went into government because at goldman sachs i worked at goldman for years and i understand after i left why so many successful politicians from goldman sachs er come out of uh by so many successful politicians come out of goldman sachs yeah yeah it's tough place to work but it's fun too i'm proud it's on my resume and again they don't have the smartest people in the world way off track okay anyway next up mr bean uh facetime is important i hate it you know but but early on your career when you're first starting out you got to be first in and you got to be last out okay it's something i i call philo first and last out it sucks and hopefully you don't have kids and all that stuff um when you first start your career but but it's important it's important um i hate it i hate it but it's important face time is important and michael bloomberg who started he's a billionaire he started bloomberg and he was mayor of new york whatever for a while that's what he did early in his career he would show up for anybody and um yeah that that's base time was important i got that one from him actually yeah he's done quite well all right next up is dta which stands for don't trust anyone sharks are tough to spot sometimes it's so true it's so true um usu when you go with your gut usually you can tell somebody's a shark but sometimes you don't know like if push comes to shove and you're competing with somebody get promoted at work um don't trust them man don't trust anyone like just be really really careful like don't date anybody at work either ever unless you're sure it's uh if you're positive this is the one this is the one yeah just be careful dta don't trust anyone okay and i debated whether i include this one or not and actually in my book i renamed this chapter it was it was chapter 59 in the paperback version and the kindle version um and i actually changed the title because i angered people then i'm including it now so it's good i don't care so um a valuable lesson about donald trump so and when i wrote this book is before trump got elected but but years ago i i read i read a book from trump called uh the art of the deal and this guy can get a deal done he can't nice let's be intellectually honest he can't especially in business but he said something um years ago that made a lot of sense and when i first heard it i thought oh my god that's i don't know if i agree but he said you have to remind people of your accomplishments otherwise you'll never reach you know your highest your potential in life and as a canadian you know growing up we're very humble whatever it just wasn't our nature you know um you know wayne gretzky used to say when when when you when you lose say nothing when you win say even less but but trump is right trump is right um if you don't remind people of of your accomplishments you'll never get promoted uh you'll never get you'll never be able to raise money you'll never get customers you got to remind people and and sometimes it's as simple as you're trying to get a big contract in your sales person you have to remind the person that you're meeting with after you bond which other big contracts you've signed in the past big reference customers if you're allowed to disclose it and you have to brag about your accomplishments as well um and there's ways to do it like i'm going to brag in a second and and you'll see how i'm going to brag and it won't come across as as being a big brag here we go oh my god i talk a lot i'm humbled to say that i think that i'm a very good judging character so you i i through the beginning part and i'm humbled to say that you know whatever uh but yeah and trump certainly doesn't do it that way uh but if you don't um if you don't remind people your accomplishments you'll never get a promotion you won't you'll never get a raise you'll let you never get a job you'll never get anything in life you have to do it you have to it's going to be humble but at times you have to brag it's a do or die mentality okay uh and and yeah here um ask often how am i doing how am i doing and i got this one from another goldman sachs partner that i met with when i was at coleman you have to ask how am i doing often not all the time but every month or two meet with your manager and ask her him you know okay you know i really enjoy being here at the hermitage or whatever you know what i mean i'd love you can please provide me some feedback on on how i can contribute more to the team even more at the time and they'll start off by saying positive things if they're a good manager and then they'll tell you additional things that you can do and you can even ask them was it you know to get promoted to the next level like what else do i need to do what else do i need to do and they'll tell you and once you accomplish that stuff remind them when they're in a good mood it's kind of like asking mom and dad for something only when they're in a good mood remind them that when you've accomplished those things so you can get that promotion but you have to ask how i'm doing often and if you do that you'll most likely never get fired or at least surprised uh and fired yeah always ask for feedback otherwise you just don't know how good of a job you're doing all right um and the only way to get promoted or a raise and i was looking for the energizer bunny i couldn't find it so i threw the durabell duracell battery in which takes a licking and keeps on ticking that's what they used to say i think so or is that time asked can't remember uh but the bottom line is you just got to be relentless you got to be relentless and ask over and over and over and over and over and over again to get a raise or promotion and there's tactful ways to do it too and you don't have to be annoying about it um or piss off your manager you meet with them every couple months and when you ask how am i doing that's when you ask you know it and maybe you strike when they aaron's hot when you achieved a milestone and they give you great feedback then you you say awesome awesome do you have time for coffee now and you go for coffee uh and you'll say thank you very much for the kaufman i appreciate it it's it's been great being a member of this team and together we've accomplished a lot you know what i'm doing here right so that then you say well i'd love to ask you if it's okay what do i need to do and it's really making this it's really expensive living um here with the family and whatnot as you know and i have to provide and so i'm i'd love to ask you please what do i need to accomplish how much more how much about more value can i add and what kind of value can i add to the team in order to get a raise or a promotion and and they'll give you the criteria and the second you achieve those criteria and your boss is in a good mood and it's not too busy crazy at work it's a slow day meet with them and ask otherwise you won't get it you won't get it people that make ceo are ones that have asked that have asked many times to be promoted and many times for a race they're sales people they're selling themselves they're relentless and they brag as well about their accomplishments tactfully tactfully if you don't remind people of your accomplishments and if you don't ask for a raise or promotion you'll never get it you'll never get it it's kind of like when you were younger and you were in school you kept your head down and when when you did well in a test you were congratulated your parents are happy teachers are happy everyone's happy you were happy then you graduate and you start working and you keep your head down and you work hard and you do well and you think to yourself well somebody's going to notice me just like in school and then you look around you're like dude why are these people getting promoted instead of me i accomplished so much more than they did oh my gosh that guy got a big raise i didn't what's up with that it's because they asked so you gotta ask all right um next up is uh there is a plan b uh before you quit uh and that's by the way it's an american power conversion uh older backup battery i've got four of them here uh running just in case because i blew a fuse once or twice because of all this equipment and lights and stuff in the air conditioning too but i put it there because before you quit let's say you got a job a job offer from another company for more money and a better position whatever whoa that scared me sorry that was my alarm that remind me to put the kids to bed but there's no school tomorrow so it's fine we're good we're good um sorry about that so before you quit think to yourself why are you quitting you're probably quitting because this other company is paying you more money or this other company is giving you responsibilities that you enjoy more or this other company is giving you a different type of role in a different geographical location whatever it is you got nothing to lose so when when you go to tell your manager that you're resigning um just let them know that you've you've been offered a job and before quitting there's nothing wrong with asking them if they could match that offer or find you that other role internally so you can transfer you got nothing to lose nothing to lose and everything to gain okay uh next up is avoid this at all costs okay and duff beer what is duff beer from you got to tell you what duff beer is from um it's a great cartoon that i've been watching since the 80s and i can't believe it's still on uh and i'll tell you what it is in a minute if you don't already know and conan o'brien used to be one of the writers okay but i want you to avoid alcohol at all costs um at all events right and i i used to drink i don't drink anymore and not judging anybody it's fun but i want you to be careful and what my what my my grandfather god bless him he gave me advice as well um when i was going to my first job i asked him i asked a ton of people for advice and he said to me he said chi chi christie when you go to a corporate party if if you're forced to drink just take that drink whatever just i don't know when no one's looking throwing the plants yeah and i thought i'm not going to do that he said or what you can also do is just get a 7up with lime in it or sprite with lime in it because that looks like a gin and tonic or something anyway just be careful with alcohol at work it's it's so weird because i used to go out and party whatever and i worked at hedge fund industry in different companies i had a blast like i have no regrets but a lot of people they let their guard down right and a lot of these rules i've taught you today are humble lessons whatever like don't trust anyone whatever all that stuff like dude people people let their cards down when they drink at corporate events um and you know let them fall in their knives so to speak for their swords that was nothing to say but you know what i'm getting at i'd rather i'd rather you rise to the top um yeah so anyway that took me a while to create there there you go now you know where it's from now you know where it's from that that's that's uh mr burns uh front from the simpsons uh and he had this guy named smithers that worked for him and i remember one episode he said mr burns i love you in that shirt that's funny so number 64. and i couldn't get the eyes to work i don't know why so i just threw silver everywhere and had to recolor it but um number 64 is don't ever go over your boss's head um unless you have to and i'll explain what that means so don't ever talk to your boss's boss like you can say hello good morning whatever it is but just be careful just be careful uh and i've done it before just naively trying to help and i've added a ton of value and then my boss got jealous and yeah it happens just be careful however if you think you're going to be let go or if you work for a jerk and you got nothing to lose take that risk go to your boss's boss when your boss is not around add a tremendous amount of value i worked at a very big hedge fund once not gonna say which one and i got an offer from an even bigger hedge fund and the owner of the hedge fund that i was leaving said if you stay we might give you a more senior role and he was implying i guess i might get my boss's job i i didn't have the heart i can't do it i couldn't do it even though i've been for a heck of a lot more money i just can't it's not me it's not me but that option's there yeah yeah so don't go over your boss's head yeah now you know what duff beer is from yeah now i got that song duff beer for me in my head okay here we go all right moving on speaking of the simpsons um my uncle i have to cross arms like like like homer that's homer simpson so funny his name is homer like that's supposed to be like an intellectual name my uncle who worked at general uh electric um i remember asking him when i was like what was i was 22 when i went to accenture in 94. yeah i remember asking for advice and and he said to me he said something i never understood he said well he said also don't ever date anybody at work um he was right about that unless it's a sure thing because he said you'll get fired or they'll get fired or both whatever it's yeah but he said to me something i didn't understand he said chris just be a nice dumb guy i was like what the hell does that mean i understand that it's my uncle mike he's great i love him he said just be a nice dumb guy and i didn't get it but i kind of get it now years later years later and um i think he was probably my age when he told me that's interesting wow basically what he was telling me was don't don't come across as a threat to anybody like especially your own level it don't be dumb whatever like that like he's mentioning here but just don't come across the threat just be you know be a nice guy or a nice guy whatever and you know don't try to show people up you know impress people you know your time to shine is when you impress your clients or your boss or your boss's boss if your boss is away and you just happen to be yeah yeah whatever um just be nice dumb guy don't come across the threat and a lot of times people that make it to the top sometimes they're sharks yes but they rose to the ranks as well with that mindset you know it's it's kind of like when you're interviewing to get into a company the hardest interviews are with people that are the same rank as you because they'll feel threatened yeah so now i understand be a nice dumb guy i'm homer yeah all right uh next one is uh never never complain isn't that a cool graphic i found there uh explain is that a complaint yeah and dale carnegie said don't ever criticize condemn or complain like let other people whine about things at work because if you complain just one time the wrong person that feels threatened by you somebody the same levels you whatever they'll say well chris was saying this just just be careful just keep it in your head keep it in your head and never bring it home as well like don't like when you go home don't don't complain to your spouse they bottle it up otherwise they'll they'll say how was work together and you're like oh god he's such a jerk again today it's not worth and then your kids find out your kids will say it and it slips whatever just don't do it don't don't bring your anger and frustration home like that just leave it at work just don't don't complain and you know what dude if you're frustrated good it'll motivate you to get a better job anyway you can move you're not a tree yeah focus always on what you can control in life all right now please go to your workbook and click on number 11 meaning section 11 on the front page and then i want you to please spend three minutes writing down notes on how you can apply the lessons in section 11 to enhance your career you've got three minutes go section 12 only take advice from successful people it's crucial that you take advice from the right people the right people always always don't don't assume because somebody's confident they know what the hell they're talking about you know just take advice from people that have done what you want to do okay so less number 67 is you need yodas and i love this analogy uh yoda was a mentor for those that aren't star wars fans was a mentor to um luke skywalker and you need many yodas you need lots of mentors in your life and i want you to find people that work in the industry that you want to work in or currently working or people that have a perfect lifestyle that you want meaning they have a wonderful family life and they found worklife balance and they're successful and people love it when you ask them to mention them as well you gotta ask though right so you need to have many yodas and if you're working at a company now and you're not happy in the division you're in you've got to network internally and find mentors in different divisions and get them to pull you into their their team or if push comes to shove and there's a restructuring round and people are going to be let go including you maybe you can call your yoda in another department and ask them uh for help and hopefully they can pull you in you need yodas all right next up is i want you to follow people that inspire the heck out of you or are doing what you want to do one day or they're they're they're business tycoons they're amazingly successful and i put the graph there for audible which is owned by amazon and you can subscribe for a monthly fee uh i recommend doing it it's a great investment in yourself it's investment education and i want you to listen to um at least one or two books per month from successful people autobiographies or biographies if you can't find them and if you can find them where the the person that that wrote it if it's an autobiography narrates it themselves like so richard branson that's even better because you can hear their positivity in their voice and people really let their cards down once they've achieved success and they want to share success and help you to kind of pay that debt of gratitude forward so to speak so seek people find people that have written books or find the book names or whatever or or the business tycoons or icons and listen to their books so that you can understand their blueprint and why reinvent the wheel they're going to help you do it anyway they've done it they've done it and i'd love you all to one day turn your business icon uh into your rival turn your business idle into your rival yeah all right next up is i've never never met a successful person with a negative attitude and that there is uh one of searcher branson's companies uh virgin atlantic uh is i've never met anybody that's really really really successful in business that doesn't have a positive attitude because there's so much working against you there's so many naysayers around you saying you can't do it you can't do you can't do it don't take a risk you might fail people will laugh at you effort the people that make it big are the ones that are really positive really positive people make it big so if you're not a positive person it might be because you're hanging out with people that bring you down cut them off you can control your environment all right tied fun with that graphic there all right next up is follow the smart money i still want you to do your own research on all investment ideas but i also want you to be aware of who smart investors are and what type of investments they own and just learn from them as well always do your own research as well but i want you to be aware of who the smart investors are and follow the smart money so to speak and once you find investments that they've invested in then do a lot of research as well don't just take their word for it follow the smart money okay actions speak louder than words always too people like to vote with their wallet so please go to your workbook and click on number 12 meaning section 12 on the front page and as always please spend three minutes writing down notes on how you can apply the lessons in section 12 to enhance your career thanks do next up let's talk about section number 13 which is called only the paranoid survive uh it's crucial to be paranoid about the issues i'm going to talk about in a second and as you can tell there the one there uh in the 13 those are those are chips and i've actually got it right here let me go off script it's a it's a pentium processor so i have those chips there in the 13 and it's from intel because there's a brilliant man uh who passed away recently god bless him he's one of the cofounders of intel um in his name is andy grove and he wrote a great book that you guys should read called only the paranoid survive and he was so paranoid running intel and intel is is a company that makes chips we all know that but what many of us forget or didn't know as documented in his book which came out in 95 95 or 96 i think i loved it intel back in the 80s and the 70s uh they made uh ram right which is random access memory uh which basically is a commoditized industry there are little chips that allow your computers to have more programs open at once and what happened was that the japanese were so competitive with intel in the early 80s in japanese companies at that time they were more interested in market share than they were in profit margin and so they they basically flooded the market with cheap ram and it intel could have gone out of business and so what happened was uh andy grove he he pivoted and he made the company focus on a new product for them called the intel processor they had what's called the 286 and 386 and 486 and pentium and all that stuff whatever you probably heard that in the past uh but andy grove was was very very paranoid uh of the competition and bill gates was the same way too when he was running microsoft bill gates used to say that microsoft is always one and a half years away from bankruptcy he even said that in the 90s and of course we we know that there's no way it would go bankrupt within a year and a half but that's how paranoid he was you got to be paranoid like that like i remember i remember steven friedman and and i have the the notebook actually and i mentioned him before his son is david benioff friedman was a senior dude at at goldman and i wrote down every word he said when he came to guest lecture and i still had the notebook and i read it the other day but what he also said was watch your back because there's always somebody that's smarter faster younger cheaper than you that wants your job uh and it's it's it's kind of that's part of paranoia as well so just be careful like like for me for example i've got multiple audio tracks right now just in case it it messes up like i've got i've got a blue yeti there i've got this sure mic here i've got cheap microphones and all the cameras as well really really cheap ones just in case and so we can synchronize the video as well um just in case one of the things goes down um and whenever i give presentations i always have a second laptop which i used to borrow from a friend now i have my own whatever i'm a nerd i know uh and when i raised to give wedding speeches i would use a laptop and i'd also bring overhead slides just in case always have a backup plan always always always when i used to go to interviews i would over prepare and i would always bring a nutribar and put it in my pocket because a lot of times they forgot to feed you and if you can't if you if you're hungry you can't think and so i would go to the washroom and you know gobble down the the nutribar um but but but i was i was very paranoid and i think it helped me a lot to have a plan b and it made me more confident as well in case something didn't go well i had a backup plan so for intel the backup plan was the processor so you always want to have a plan b always always always yeah only the paranoid survive great book by andy grove read it please all right um next up is hit this key and lose your job we are one little keystroke away from destroying our lives just be careful otherwise what can happen your career is you can quickly be end it just be careful triple check all your emails you are a product a representation of of the digital communication you send out um don't just spell check and grammar check but also think to yourself can this be misinterpreted by anybody and if you're ever emotional or upset just get away from email man or from your your cell phone or whatever it is just be careful your career can be ended quickly and this is a mechanical keyboard here and i love these clicky keyboards by the way i have one like that it's by a german company called dust keyboard yeah all right next up is let the secret out and you're done and that secret is that you want to leave your company and go back to school even if it's for whatever degree don't ever tell anybody don't ever tell anybody that you want to leave unless you want to get a reference letter whatever which you can ask in a more diplomatic way which i can talk about if you want me to but if you tell somebody that you're interested in leaving to go back to school at some point you know they might they might say oh that's great that's awesome i agree it's a good idea but then the next time a recession hits and business is very cyclical and companies tend to over hire when things are going well and they tend to over fire meaning they cut into muscle not just fat when things are not going well but if they have to the way it works in big companies is if companies have to you know cut expenses so they can make their quarterly earnings when they report earnings what will happen is management will tell all the bosses in all the different divisions i need one head each that's how it works it's quantitative and your boss will think themselves well and i'm going to make this up chris is great he's one of my best performers but he told me a while i remember a while ago he told me he wants to go back to school so if he's going to leave anyway i might as well choose him dta don't trust anyone don't tell anybody at all at work that you're ever thinking of of going back to school okay all right next up is oh dude this one was so dope that was boba fett boba fett was the best character ever uh and he was barely in star wars he was in revenge of the the jedi for like a nanosecond and then han solo turned around and he fell down into that big hole he died when hans was hans couldn't see and by the way i've got to go there i'm so sorry i don't care i'm going to do this i'm i'm a star wars fan so do i have my star wars thing there it's right here yeah yeah all right so there's politics in movies as well if you're a real jerk of an actor or actress you won't get rehired and that's what happened apparently hearsay whatever with megan fox remember she's in the transformers and stuff you don't see her anymore because she was she was difficult to anyway on one of those productions you can google it if you want to and a lot of great actors that you don't hear about anymore it's because they were difficult there's politics you know at their job as well like there's politics with us that's why i'm talking about sharks but i have to talk about harrison for it because he's he's he's awesome he was so difficult to deal with in empire strikes back so difficult when they were making it that what they did was they didn't know if they were going to bring him back in to return the jedi and so what they did at the end of the empire strikes back is they froze him remember that he was frozen um anyway and they ended up bringing him back and and that's why we're talking about boba fett when he couldn't see because he was unfrozen for a while and return the jedi he yeah anyway but you gotta admit boba fett's pretty pretty dope pretty badass yeah yeah so i always have a personal backup plan okay and what remind me to do this is because boba fett's dad or something had a gazillion versions of himself made cloned whatever but always have a backup plan in terms of what do you do if your company might let you go um and a lot of times you won't know because what can happen in business is everything is going well and then we go into this horrific recession in a nanosecond or something like um like a black swan event occurs like like a virus or whatever it is or terrorist events or i don't know the 2008 crash whatever it's something you can't control they call it black swan because black swans are rare they're usually not black yeah so the backup plan is this i don't want you to be loyal to any company that's right you're thinking chris that's not ethical loyalty i'm sorry i swore but i want you to remember this no company is going to be loyal to you and your family okay when when when push comes to shove they have to let people go you got to be loyal to your family first than yourself than the company that's right that's right you got to look out for yourself and if you don't look out for yourself and have a plan b then you're hurting your family or your future family and so if a headhunter calls you that's why that's why i put both that's right he's uh he's a headhunter or something or a bounty hunter bounty hunter that's why i put him but if if a headhunter calls you um saying that they're interested in interviewing you to maybe hire you or whatever take that meeting take every damn meeting and just don't meet with them in a place too close to your work obviously and and by the way if if your company gives you um if they give you a cell phone at work if you have um if you have enough money to do it i want you to get the exact same one for yourself because at work you know you're gonna be using that phone whatever but i also want you to have another phone just in case in case you want to make personal calls or in case and it's a good investment in case uh some other company calls you and you're setting up an interview you don't want you don't want anybody to be able to fish through your emails and personal stuff also if you work for a jerk and you will one day uh i'm not hiring though in case you're thinking i'm a jerk no but if you work for a jerk um and this jerk makes you stay late at work just for facetime whatever and it's bogus i want you on your laptop whatever to use your personal wifi network with these things and write a business plan on their nickel that's right if legally you're allowed to start screw that i don't care i'm i'm a pit bull and a pork chop helping you always have that plan b always always always please yeah all right next up is question motives and why do i have an old tv there i i have a tv because um whenever somebody's being interviewed on television i i want you to before accepting what they say is gospel or being true or legitimate or whatever i want you to ask yourself what's their angle why are they saying that what's their bias remember bias always if it's a ceo they're saying great things about the company because they're sales people that's their company they're not being unethical but they're biased of course they're going to say great things always and if somebody's interviewed that's a money manager like maybe they're a portfolio manager at a mutual fund or something of course you're going to talk about the stocks they own even if they disclose it of course they're going to say positive things about it there's a bias they want to get you to bottom to push them higher so always ask yourself why are they doing that you know why you gotta in your in your mind question motives and it's part of game theory which is like chess thinking a couple heads uh moves ahead of what somebody might do it's game theory always question somebody's motives not out loud but just in your mind you know it's not as politics and work and paranoia within within corporate environments is is all about game theory and chess moves you want to understand somebody like what their background is you know what their interests are and just more about them you know that's game theory you're doing your research um you want to think like they're going to think when you meet with them and you can always go to their twitter profile to see who they follow to learn more about them yeah or the bottom of their linkedin profile to see which companies or people they follow and by the way don't ever follow politicians ever ever ever on linkedin or on twitter you know if you're curious what donald trump's going to say on twitter you can go and type up the real donald trump and see for a while but don't follow you know even if you're republican it doesn't matter just yeah be careful all right um that's paranoia i guess all right and that's what the back of tvs used to look like there yeah they weren't dude they were massive back then massive yeah all right uh so now i want you to go to your workbook and click number 13 meaning section 13 on the front page and then spend three minutes writing down notes on how you can apply the lessons we just talked about here in section 13 to enhance your your career you got three minutes go all right section 14 risk taking i love this one i love this one it's crucial you take the right kinds of risks you'll never get ahead in life unless you take risks and plenty of risks and embrace failure embrace failure and fail fast and i'll get to that soon all right so let's talk about risks yeah fail fast and fail early okay um if if you start a company give yourself two years and after two years i want you to ask yourself if i had known about all the issues that i uncovered i discovered over the past two years would i have still have started this company and the answer is no pull the plug move on you're going to start a lot of companies in life and as mark cuban said you only have to be right in business one time every single amazing business person you know of you only know about their successes you don't know about the crappy companies they started and they failed the best you know like uh bill gates and paula allen together they started a company called trafford ida where they had these little wires on roads you know when you go over it and it counts cars they failed yeah so fail fast and fail early and don't give a damn what anybody thinks anyway because you are going to make it huge one day regardless what anybody thinks you give a damn what people think anyway fail fast fail early keep moving forward all right next up is opm not the drug but opm stands for other people's money and that's danny devito great actor funny man um he was in this movie called other people's money which is a great movie you gotta watch it because it will explain to you what is private equity in a fun way it's a great movie and like every hollywood movie the rich person loses at the end or is a schmuck or becomes nice or whatever it is what it is there's no exception every movie because i have to appeal to everybody whatever i should stop now but um i actually learned that from rush limbaugh is that terrible years ago uh the the rich person's always a schmuck a movie but but watch that movie if you can because it'll really explain you what what opm other people's money and how private equity works but the reason i put opm here in devito is because i don't want you to use your own money to start companies if you have a lot of money yes you can but i don't want you to put your family at risk or put too much stress on yourself i want you to raise money from high net worth investors but i want you to raise money from high net worth investors initially okay now the sales cycle is quite shorter than going after venture capital and if you network and find something in common with people and you present with passion right from your heart like i'm going to teach you you will be able to raise money and when you raise money i want you to make sure that you pay yourself the same salary at least that way you make at that previous company you're at because i don't want you to bring your stress home i want you to make sure your family is happy and you're happy as well use other people's money you can do it if if you don't think you can then you won't be able to but you know it as henry ford said whether or not you think you can do it you're right be relentless like a pit bull on a pork chop and it will happen i promise you all right next up is um don't invest if all the founders have left and i put here and you can go if you want just do it do a search um on on me chris haroon venture beats so venture beat is the it's it's like the wall street journal but for uh for uh for venture capital um and then you just you'll find this article i wrote years ago uh and i wrote about this and i really do believe it that um when i found and i was just a guest columnist i love writing like it's fun for me and it's good for your career too and we'll talk about embracing the media really really soon how can help you it's free pr everybody wins they win you win so network a lot to get meetings with the media and i'll talk more about that later on but when um when a founder leaves a company when all the founders leave a company and are no longer engaged at all you gotta run for the exits man you do because most of the time that company won't be as successful in the long run because what happens is founders run a company and the board loves the founder and investors love the founder and the founder doesn't give a damn about anybody except making that company change the world in the long run and so they're given a lot of leeway like jeff bezos or elon musk whatever um i shall let me stick with with jeff bezos on this one so jeff bezos he doesn't even get on the earnings call the quarterly call he doesn't care he's longterm focused he doesn't care if people are saying well you're not going to be making a big profit this quarter so you know i i think we should find another ceo no investors are longterm greedy and focused on bezos that's why they own amazon if he left that company point watch out because what would happen is this like it does with most other companies where the founders all leave and are no longer engaged usually what happens is bureaucracy and politics rule everything because if if you're at a and it happened with with uh with buddies of mine i worked at hewlettpackard you know they were senior executives and they didn't want to take any risks because you know they were getting a nice paycheck and climbed the corporate ladder and if they took a risk and they created a new department or product they they if they messed up they're not going to get promoted they're done and if they are successful with that they're not going to get paid a huge amount anyway so the status quo is keep being a politician collect that paycheck you know grip and grin which i despise climb through the ranks and and be political i hate it but if the vander still there the founder doesn't give a damn about politics the founder is longterm focused remember what warren buffett said the longer the view the wise intention and they're not political at all so be careful be careful about when founders all leave a company all right so please go to your workbook and on the first page as always click on number 14. uh and then um spend three minutes writing down notes on how you can apply the lessons in section 14 to enhance your career you've got three minutes go do so sales best practices uh the best ceos are the best sales people learn these crucial sales secrets and i think i messed up the graphic i mean it it looks the way it's supposed to look but what i was trying to do there is this is actually a setting from the first movie blade runner 1982 classic um and it's one of those chinese restaurants that harrison ford ate at anyway i had a lot of fun doing this i feel like an artist with this a crappy artist i get it like i'm no uh i'm no picasso and i'll leave picasso here to give me a little bit of uh inspiration and you got to do a search on picasso quotes he's got great quotes so anyway castle's my friend i have more hair than him though okay so um yeah let's talk about these ones here sales best practices number one is less is more always with corporate communications never have more than three sentences ever again in a paragraph less is more keep it short and we'll talk a lot about how to give a great presentation and how to raise money by having fewer bullet points on a slide i'm telling you you don't have to work as hard now three bullet points on a slide because we can't handle more than three things at a time uh on on a slide when you're trying to raise money whatever uh and if you do try to use images or some fun innovative way to do it less is more quite often people will only read the first page of a very very long report anyway less is more and if you have to write a big report then you know try to you know try to have like a summary on the first page or lots of summaries and i even did this um see the berlin wall behind there i even did this with this book like i realized that you know shorter chapters are better like each no chapter i don't think there's maybe one or two that are longer on the page but a lot of them are really really short really really short you know less is more and that's how people consume media these days you know gone are the days when you gone are the days when when you read a 5 000 word editorial article in vanity fair whatever it is or whatever newspaper it is less is more that's why twitter is twitter all right moving on oh yeah i started to use yeah movement here might be a little distracting sorry i want you to present with passion and enjoy public speaking condition yourself to love it and you'll excel at it and most people are terrified of it and i'm going to make you into presentation rockstars very very soon in the smc courses enjoy it embrace it all right next up is shut up and i say with love my heart speaking of the hardest up there i made it smaller but it's still beaten shut up if you think you close the sale don't sell past the close sometimes when you when you get the impression somebody loves a product that you're selling or service don't sell it anymore stop stop right away otherwise they're gonna think this this is what will be going through their mind okay they'll be thinking oh gosh i love this product i love this service gosh chris is doing a great job selling i love it i love it why does he keep selling it am i missing something am i a sucker why am i so lucky to be given this opportunity i don't trust him i don't know oh no i do trust him i don't i just don't know he's overdoing i'm not gonna buy next up is small clients are just as much work as big clients and sometimes a hell of a lot more try to bag the elephant if you can go elephant hunting that i don't mean that way but just try to get big customers if you know what i mean instead of smaller ones um because small small customers are small customers are more work than big customers sometimes they have more of their net worth with you and that's why um or they spent more money as a percentage of their net worth on on the product or service they bought from you than a bigger customer just be careful um you know i i i value all my customers uh and i love them all sincerely i do but and for me it doesn't matter it's kind of a moot point because all my customers are the same right it's the same pricing point always but when i used to work um and i would get customers the biggest customers were the best because the amount of time and handholding i had to do with them was much less because they were more sophisticated sometimes as well yeah be careful be careful all right next up we've got all i heard was not no i want you to sell sell sell sell sell sell sell and keep selling keep selling keep selling keep selling until you sense they're interested then stop talking until then keep selling selling selling selling and tell yourself in your mind all i heard was not no all i heard was not no and don't forget to ask for the sale like a lot of times people go to meetings sales meetings and they'll talk about their product and they'll have a great lunch with somebody whatever and they never ask for the sale you gotta ask but don't get discouraged until you hear the word no and by the way when you hear the word no it basically means not yet all i heard was not no all right next up talk business later bond as much as you can with your clients a big rookie mistake is you show up and you start talking business right away you know business we know it's about relationships first and product knowledge second talk business later okay all right how to get a meeting with anyone so the route of how to get a meeting with anybody is as we know you want to find something in common with them right and the stars kind of got all kind of a line for somebody to take a meeting and and love you and do business with you so you want to appeal that personal personal motive so to speak um find something in common with with somebody you know um and and i talked about how to get informational meetings using linkedin et cetera cover pages by finding something you have in common maybe you're from the same hometown talk about your hometown when you meet with them you know how to conduct that meeting anyway and talk about how your hometown has changed or the schools change whatever it is and what i was going to do actually for for this uh for this um let me go back actually i don't want to look at that baseball one yet now you're all looking at the baseball ones we're there let me go back here yeah so what i was trying to do initially and i couldn't find the right 3d models to do it was i saw this great movie ratatouille and great movie i'm sure you've all seen it it's about a rat that makes good food and there's a critic a really really mean food critic that comes into this dude's restaurant and the rat is nervous and so the rats like what kind of food should i make well i want to appeal this person's background his emotions and so what happened was the rats made ratatouille i guess that's why it's called that uh it's and when the food critic you gotta watch it man there's that one scene where they they pull in and push back at the same time on his face when he takes a bite of the ratatouille and he drops the the the fork in in slow motion and then the the food critic goes back in time and remembers growing up and his mom basically touching his face uh and giving him ratatouille as a child i couldn't find that image so i looked everywhere for it i couldn't find it but you got to check it out you got to appeal to emotions and find something in common with somebody as well it's a different angle different way of thinking but it works exceptionally well you gotta yeah every battle's law enforcement fought as you know um and speaking of ratatouille so the best restaurant in america is called french laundry and it's about a 40 minute drive north of where i live here um it's it's in napa valley i've never eaten there it's too expensive for me it's 500 bucks to eat there not including alcohol and what rats what the folks at pixar did was they actually went to um when they were doing research on the movie all the kitchen scenes for ratatouille were modeled exactly after french laundry uh up in napa valley it's pretty cool it's pretty cool and speaking this is a good little side note here but but speaking of um speaking of pixar in 2008 i went to a party here uh for one of my kids they were in the whole birthday party phase between the first grade and fourth grade whatever and i met this guy at a house here in hillsborough and you know a lot of my best contacts actually are through my my kids friends parents it is what it is and this guy at that point in time he worked at pixar and i asked him i said oh dude i'm a big fan what movie are you making next he said well it's this movie about this old man and this short little fat kid and there's a bird named kevin and they throw some balloons on the house the house goes up in the air and they go on a journey and i'll never forget what i said to him i said it very politely i said this i said dude that's a merchandising disaster like you're not going to sell any toys like it's it's like why would you why i mean the incredibles was awesome you can make incredibles part two three four five six whatever you make a gazillion toy stories because you know toy story you got all the toys and my kid loved that that woody or andy doll whatever it was um and buzz lightyear and he said to me he said you know chris we don't make movies we think people are gonna like we make movies from our heart we don't try to do it to make money it's not about money it's about touching somebody's heart by using our own heart and and my goodness was he right because up that movie was the bomb i loved it not a bomb it was awesome i loved it and the soundtrack too by michael cameron's last name but oh my god and there's one scene from that movie too where he goes his wife passes away it's sad but that like three or four minute entire lifespan of that guy's life um when he was young when he met her to the great pen he had remember the great pen he had uh got married they couldn't have kids and she passed away i'm just getting shivers thinking about the music just appealing emotions anyway it was a great movie a little off track there but thinking with your heart is great because if you don't think with this this don't work this ain't gonna work so always try to appeal the emotions uh if if you can i'm gonna put picasso back on the shelf here all right good all right next up is uh confidence uh leads to competence i love baseball i had to throw a baseball in there somewhere um and you'll never like athletes do exceptionally well because they're confident you'll never see an athlete who's who doesn't have confidence especially in baseball where dude like you've got somebody's throwing a ball at you that's 100 miles an hour that's curving it might hit you you got to be confident it's even harder in qriket dude because in cricket that ball can bounce as it's curving and then hit you and and there's a windmill as well it yeah you got to be confident i think therefore i am uh in lebron james before each basketball game he meditates and he thinks of himself shooting shots getting in it over and over and over again that's almost as good as practicing um confidence is a it's an attractive trait um and for those of you that are trying to get a date if you don't come across as co i'm not gonna i suck at dating but you gotta be confident man you gotta go in there ask somebody out and just tell yourself i don't give a damn if they say yes or no and if they say yes i'm not gonna i'm not gonna say do mind games never you gotta you gotta be confident you know what i mean polite but confident too yeah yeah all right so yeah confidence leads to a competence if you believe in yourself um there's there's nothing you can't do and that's why on wall street they love to hire former athletes actually a lot of the time give me one second check yeah all right um they like to hire former athletes because they're confident and a lot of jobs on wall street you're in sales and if you're confident and you're selling not arrogant but if you're confident then confidence leads to perceived competence all right next up is sports is crucial boardroom talk it is it is um and not everybody's a sports fan and you can talk about movies and whatever arts or whatever it is that interests you but talking about sports is i mean i could talk to anybody in about baseball at least if i meet somebody from st louis you know i'll talk about one of the best pitchers in history bob gibson if i meet somebody from baltimore they'll talk about cal ripken the iron horse and some of you might not know who these people are but i say this only because if you tell me what city you're from i i will immediately talk about a baseball team in that city if there's baseball and that's it overseas it might be you know football like the real football like the one you you kick soccer yeah um don't don't underestimate how important sports is you know that's why a lot of corporations they do a lot of sporting events like they'll they'll take clients to to tennis matches um they'll you know they'll rent out boxes at football stadiums basketball stadiums i've gone to a ton of hundreds actually of baseball games and boxes as well as basketball games too in hockey games too when i worked at golden we actually had a suite and maple leaf gardens years ago yeah it's important it's important and and i say boardroom talk because there's always before a board meeting starts you know people are always just kind of hanging out and haven't seen each other in three months board means usually quarterly and you know before the minutes i read from the previous meeting and somebody says let's start the board meeting you just chit chat and usually talk about sports or something else you have in common just it's great for idol chit chat and you can always go to somebody's um twitter profile see if they follow athletes i follow jesse barfield he used to play for the toronto blue jays and you can tell i'm a blue jays fan it's it's it's in my heart like i love it i love it it's what my brother and you know my dad and i have in common and my kids love it too and it just i just love it i absolutely love it um and it's a great way to bond with people as well and i remember in 1992 we finally we won our first world series typical american oh my god people can be pissed off i don't care here we go it's called the world series because well it was always called the world series even there's only teams in america and they they put a team in toronto as you can see there in 1977 that was the first game and then in 1992 we finally won the world series in toronto and of course i had that i got teased all the time by my american friends who are very witty they teased me about boots being canadian so i teased them i remember that 92 after on the world series i was like ah ah yeah we won the world series yeah who's who's the king now huh and they said to me it was so funny it was good the retart was yeah so what dude your americans beat our americans i was like oh shut the up okay anyway it was funny sports is crucial boardroom talk yeah all right next up is golf often and i know golf can seem expensive it's not if you look around and play at crappy places which is what i do in fact my son dylan um it was personal here so my middle child here dylan it's like a son of me i'll stop using the same jokes over and over again i promise you oh here we go you can kind of see it there yeah okay i should use this one to begin with so uh dylan this guy here in the middle his golf teacher uh is a guy named matt who's uh my videography i i hired him he's a great guy he's a great guy i met matt at crystal springs which is a golf club where it cost you 30 bucks play around it's a great deal it's a great deal um but um and actually i'll talk about the reason why i hired matt only because he's editing this i'm just kidding um so he was um he's really social and you can pick up a conversation with him about anything anything nice guy nice guy um and and he noticed that i was reading a book on youtube and he said to me oh cool you're looking into youtube whatever and then i sized him up in 30 seconds i knew i knew right away but he talked about green screens and all this stuff nice guy though nice guy more important than anything else you know relationships are more important than product uh product knowledge uh but but you got to make sure that um if you can get on the links and golf with people and don't worry if you suck and you're new to it so what so what i don't know like get out there have fun with a couple of buddies you don't have to be me and by the way i've learned a lot about people by golfing with them if somebody cheats in golf i'm convinced they're going to cheat in business i've seen it i've seen it yeah yeah golf off and uh if you can if you can yeah all right uh and it's always like i've actually i've gotten some of my biggest investors on the golf course by accident like they ended up playing with us on an average course whatever they're like hey do you mind if we there's two of you there's two of us can we play with you and i met people that way and they become my biggest investors yeah it's amazing um yeah anyway next up is number 16 which is dress for success it's so true um you got to play the part like a lot of times before you get promoted you have to kind of dress um like somebody one level above you very subtly don't overdo it um but you have to dress for success and people will judge a book by its cover so you know like in silicon valley it's a little bit different here you can just kind of be laid back and whatever wear crappy clothes and people wouldn't be wearing what i'm wearing but i think it's important it's important how you carry yourself especially because you're not going to get too much exposure to senior executives right away dress for success all right next up is leverage the media oh yeah this is where i was going to come back to it so mark benioff who uh he's the founder of the largest company here in san francisco called salesforce.com and a wonderful humanitarian a good guy i read his book called above the clouds where he had a bunch of tips on how to make it and one of them was leverage the media and i first met mark i think a couple years before salesforce went public in o4 and i i remember he was at all the goldman sachs conferences when i worked at goldman and then later on when i was a client of goldman in the hedge fund industry and he was always on panels saying software is dead software is dead cloud is the future the cloud's the future and we're all like i don't understand but he sounds passionate so cool i like it and he was selling something you can't see feeler touch something virtual something boring cloud computing but he made it exciting but he was being controversial it was brilliant by saying that software is dead and i ended up working in his building same building one market plaza here in san francisco and actually i'd see him sometimes walking his dog and bare feet his beautiful labrador in bare feet on on the main floor the lobby the public lobby he didn't give a damn that's why he's successful he doesn't care and i remember once i went out to dinner with him and i sat beside him before the ipo and we were up in the bank of america tower on like the 50th floor uh and i'll never forget he wore hawaiian shirt he was just himself it's just mark it was cool man mark with a c and it was a a a fee pricks or fixed menu or whatever it is and what happened was every time they brought some food over he didn't want he very nicely gently took his knife and fork and put into a big x but he was just himself but he leverages the media big time and the way he leverages the media is he's controversial and controversy sells and you got a network and i taught you how all how to network uh using your backgrounds and all good stuff linkedin find journalists and meet with them okay and and be a little bit controversial as well like for me if i were to do it and i'm probably not going to but if i did i would say twothirds of harvard business school hbs twothirds of hbs is bs and if i went on talk shows and did that i get some air time then they'd say what about harun business school i said it's a different age okay leave me alone but i could do something like that or like if you look at um richard branson when he launched virgin cola one of his many virgin companies and he declared a war on cocacola and pepsi he rented a tank in the early 80s and drove through times square with virgin cola cans all over it of course you couldn't do that today but he was controversial controversy works leverage the media as much as you can because it's free advertising as well if you do it right all right next up is please go to your workbook and click on number 15. the cover page meaning section 15. then please take a boot three minutes writing down notes on how you can apply the lessons in section 15 to enhance your career you've got three minutes go so so section 16 think different i love this section i had so much fun putting this together uh and i wrote the top there crucial highly profitable differentiation strategies uh and so what you see here really shapes my character this changed my life this computer here and i never threw it out um and so let me let me grab it hold on a second whoops this here is from an old um this is a before that mac came out this is from apple ii which we had as a kid and um i just pulled this out for the first time in decades and on it here i don't know if you guys can see it i'll read it you probably can't read that uh but it says um getting older i gotta look like this galaxian um ms pacman hero and mario brothers and championship load runner yeah oh and i took a hole puncher i remember this i took a hole puncher here so that you couldn't erase it i guess on both sides or whatever it is this is in the days when you take the disc out and flip it but this here is from an apple ii um and let me just put this down here this thing changed my life okay and and i remember when um steve jobs decided not to ship these things with disk drives anymore and people thought he was crazy he was thinking different he was brilliant because of it um i guess i can get a pin to take that out there but whatever um yeah this is msdos years ago but i remember i was um i was younger and they wanted to fail me in the sixth grade in the eighth grade and it was because well they thought i had a learning disability but them sorry i have this gripe with teachers like my school i went to when i was younger it's a wellknown school whatever and they've asked me to come back and give guest lectures and keynotes or whatever it is never i'll never mention them either i think that a teacher should not have an us versus that mentality and look to look down upon students but treat the student as a customer uh and build their confidence right that's confidence is the most important thing in business one of the most important things you know with confidence you you can achieve anything last thing you need is is a a bastard teacher trying to bring you down or a teacher that's just teaching so that what they can do is they can do research in university that's why i love them teach um but anyway sorry there's a lot of beautiful wonderful teachers in the world okay most of them are sorry about that off topic but but they want to feel me and so i went to this it was a testing center uh in uh oakville so my dad says oakville ontario oakville uh on lake shore road called chisholm uh and they tested me there um whatever i think they were wrong i think they were but my dad bought me this and the second he bought me this everything took off for me i loved it i had fun with it you can tell i like i enjoy this stuff like i light up like a christmas tree like tweety bird like i enjoy this stuff i love using technology and that was my passion one of my passions i guess but this changed my life this this box here and the original ones if you open it this is not an original one but if you open it steve jobs and his whole team signed everything and this is ice put my mouse here i had a velcro on the side and i still do that actually under the table with other stuff yeah um you can see all the all the baseball stuff and everything yeah so anyway this thing here changed my life and so it it's fitting that we now talk about think different you know what i'll do is i'll i'll leave this dude up here with me actually i'll put it back here because that camera won't work all right so so think different is the title of this one here and i want the galera to get in your face there good okay think different and i used a product code called adobe dimension to make all this stuff if you're curious it's easy to use i can show you if you care all right so think different so lesson number 90 we're almost done is be a contrarian and watch your net worth soar um if you buy the same stock everybody else buys you'll i've said it before but you won't make money in the long run because who's the incremental investor to push it higher you've got to be contrarian and just be aware of bubbles they they occur yeah and hundreds of years ago in europe there was a tulip tulip bubble uh and everybody chased the momentum and kept buying these tulip bulbs which kept going up in price an insane amount um and if you weren't a contrarian you you lost your shirt and human nature repeats itself office all right next up is big companies cannot innovate and i'll always bet on two girls or two guys in a garage to change the world uh instead of a big company always always small groups of people can always change the world always always always i think it's competitive advantage and jeff bezos the way he runs amazon is he won't let any meeting take place uh if more than two pizzas are required to feed the room that's why amazon's still very successful they're big but they kind of run like a startup big companies cannot innovate remember that to the same extent uh especially i should say if a founder leaves i should correct that yeah if a founder leaves especially because after steve jobs left apple as much as i love apple what have they done you know they they made a watch which is doing okay they don't publish number of watches they sell because they're probably not selling as many as they thought they should have i don't know i still don't know what the killer app is for this thing i've i've got it or i put it aside here actually it's over here um i wear it and i met johnny ive um at um san francisco moma dinner events we were honoring him um and right when before this thing came out and i said to johnny i talked to him uh and he's the the guy he used to the british dude with a short hair with with a british accent he speaks good and all of us nice guy very serious though i asked him i said what's the killer app for this and he said we don't know yet but perhaps the haptic feedback which by the way is just vibration that's what it means but he sounded really smart by saying haptic feedback he said perhaps that haptic feedback will be a way for families and i enjoy it i have the product but he said it's a way for say a husband and wife they're in bed together and not that but there's a newborn baby in the middle sleeping with them and um the husband gets up or the wife whatever to go to work and if the alarm goes off it wakes up the baby is disaster so this is another way to wake you up whatever because it vibrates on your wrist but he didn't know what the killer wrap was at at the time but but since steve jobs god bless him has moved on they haven't really done that thing anything too radically different like they made a bigger ipad a thinner ipad a bigger iphone a cheaper iphone um yeah so anyway i don't think that big companies can innovate as much uh if the founder has left so don't don't ever feel intimidated by a big company because don't forget that apple was basically steve wozniak and steve jobs in a garage taking on ibm successfully yeah yeah so there it is there it is the computer changed my life yeah yeah all rights i'm going to show you this commercial to you now this commercial you're about to see was only shown one time in history it was shown in 1984 during the super bowl and 1984 is the title of a book by a brilliant man uh who wrote animal farm um the man's name is is george orwell about an awful future where we're slaves to the government whatever and so what happened was this commercial was only shown once and it was 1984 during the super bowl it cost a million dollars to make and ridley scott was the guy who directed he did gladiator uh as well as top gun um and um it was brilliant it was brilliant and as you watch it obviously you'll know which character represents apple and which character represents big blue or ibm uh and the woman actually that that um represents apple um was uh sylvester stallone's wife at the time so check it out i hope you enjoy this and while you watch it just remember that one person or a couple of people small groups people can destroy a big company today we celebrate the first glorious anniversary of the information purification we have created shall talk themselves on january 24th apple computer will introduce macintosh and you'll see why 1984 won't be like 1984. it's pretty powerful okay next up is the most important chart ever made okay um and i know i've talked a lot about a lot about a lot of important things so far but this is the most important thing okay so everything i've talked about so far is a bit important and we've seen a lot of charts in business this one is crucial please pay attention okay here it is right here we have pi i've eaten and right here we have pi i've not yet eaten no no i feel like that was phil dunphy from modern family i i feel like that guy people used to say that they remind me of a i remind them of phil dunphy that the father from the dad humor stuff from modern family okay i'll move on okay that was a joke all right the real number 92 is this ready this is good this is powerful form your own opinions dummy all right and i'm saying dummy with love my heart i don't want you to rely on anybody else's opinion i want you to rely on your own opinions always you know you you might think you're a cat adorable cat like that you look in the mirror you're not you're a ferocious lion right you're you're king or queen of the jungle nobody can touch you vincent van gogh said if you hear a voice in you that says you cannot paint then by all means paint and that voice will be silenced arthur ashe great tennis player he said one important key to success is selfconfidence an important key to selfconfidence is preparation over prepare for everything dude everything and that will help with your confidence big time if you prepare more than anybody else does for a presentation or a sports match or anything in business you're going to enjoy it and you're going to kick ass every battle is warm for it's been fun i think therefore yeah next up eleanor roosevelt oh this is a good one eleanor roosevelt said you wouldn't worry so much about what others think of you if you realized how seldom seldom they do it's powerful and if you guys want you can do a screen print and all these too let me go back a couple screens uh if you want take a screen print i'll go through it fast don't worry so take a screen print here whatever i'll give you three seconds to do it next one here and you can put this on your iphone or android handset as a whatever um and then one more here there we go and eleanor roosevelt by the way she also had another great quote which was something along the lines of they're going to criticize you anyway so you might as well just do it okay oh i love this picture this one's awesome look how adorable that cat is you yourself as much as anyone in the entire universe deserves your love and affection buddha you gotta love yourself mark twain he's great he said 20 years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you did not do than by the ones you did do so throw away the bow lines sail away from safe harbor catch the trade winds in your sail explore dream discover brilliant brilliant all right so form your own opinions please all right number 93 is take that walk i was inspired by gandhi with the salt march uh and i actually tried to um i tried my best to find one with a lot of people following it cost a fortune like i got a lot of these for free they're royalty free but there was one that cost a hundred dollars that was tempted so i didn't pull the trigger but but great man great man but so steve jobs used to go on these long walks every day at one o'clock and i do it as well and i put it on my schedule a lot of times take that walk and when you go for a walk it helps you to think differently it helps you to release serotonin it's it's like when you exercise when you feel like crap and then you do a little bit of weights whatever or exercise it releases serotonin in your brain makes you happier and this thing rewards this thing and a lot of my best ideas yeah i think about when i'm walking you know i've written entire courses on long walks i used to take 12 to 14 hour walks by myself uh it just it was lifechanging and it's fun too you can bring some tunes if you want classical music whatever um and then just go to a starbucks or tim hortons or coffee shop like that whatever it is and just just collect your thoughts yeah it'll allow you to kind of get outside your own body and see the forest from the trees and where you are in life and where you want to be yeah all right next up we've got passion for platforms that's a road obviously so the best type of business models you can create are ones where you you own the road and cars go on the road and you can charge the cars or the toll booths kind of like facebook is a platform for social media i don't trust them it's amazing facebook actually doesn't publish anything but they make money by publishing other people's stuff because it's a platform they're a tool keeper airbnb who'd have thought that the most important hotel company in the world wouldn't own a single hotel their platform same thing with uber who would have thought that the biggest taxi company in the world now uber doesn't own a single taxi they own the platform that's how i want you to think about business models because once you own the road then you can charge the car so to speak and you get other people to be incentivized to populate your platform it's brilliant the ebay has done it microsoft did with windows ios google it's amazing it's incredible all right next up we have don't respect tradition respect innovation i was trying to be innovative here as much as i could um everything is going to be disrupted and product cycles are getting shorter and shorter and shorter now and disruption is happening faster faster faster but just don't don't respect tradition i'm not saying you'd be a jerk whatever but just always question everything every product can be disrupted you know microsoft windows used to be the most dominant operating system platform on every device basically and then windows ce never worked like microsoft really should own the uh you know the smaller form factor operating system market they don't they don't don't respect tradition respect innovation always always always yeah i had a lot of fun making that slide all right so please go to your workbook and click on 16 on the cover page number 16. and then spend three minutes as always please writing down notes on how you can apply the lessons in section 16 to enhance your career you got three minutes go section 17 it's crucial to find your passion you be you it's a little cloudy but what are we looking at there number 17 you be you we save the best for last here okay so i want you to be honest and speak from the heart always just be yourself you know people might not remember what you said but never forget the way you made them feel that's a great quote from maya angelou but just be you man just be you don't be a robot don't be data from star trek you know be kirk just your ursula just be yourself and and when you're up there on stage if you mess up whatever you ever see somebody on stage they kind of mess up a bit and you start liking them a lot more because they're a real person you kind of like that just be yourself don't give a damn what anyone thinks you got this far in life and your family and friends love you for being you so why try to be somebody else you know when you were younger in school you were yourself everyone loved you then you start working you get older and you're in the workforce whatever and you're not being yourself why what's the point do you know that when a senior executive walks by you in a big company and if you if you suck up to them or if you're not yourself do you know that they don't respect you more for that they lose respect for you and even worse your colleagues hate you for it just be yourself it's too hard to try to be somebody else anyway and as dr sue said the great thing about having kids is when you read them books at night sometimes i feel like the author of the book is is talking in two languages one to me and one of my kids you know it's like the simpsons it's so brilliantly written the simpsons when i used to watch it my parents were around my parents would laugh every now and then when they were half paying attention because it was written at a different level like they would quote old movies and stuff whatever but dr seuss he said those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind just be yourself everybody else is taken all right next up is listen to your spouse they love you they fell in love with a certain person that was themselves and that person might have changed a bit go back to being you listen to your spouse they will help you they'll help you a lot they'll be your your senate your sober second look when you have an idea that you're not sure if you should pull the trigger on so to speak careerwise you know sometimes you'll look to get advice from lots of people and you forget that your life partner the one you can trust most in life is right beside you remember why you got married in the first place you know only my wife can tell me that i'm wearing a shirt that went out of style eight million years ago i thought plaid was still in in style it's not apparently or if i've dyed my hair too dark i'm getting better now it used to be a little bit too dark at times um listen to them listen to them yeah so there's that guy too he looks kind of cool it's funny all right you be you listen to yourself next up don't let anyone rent space in your head don't ever be somebody else's prisoner don't give a damn what they think about you because as you become more successful they're gonna backstab you anyway and remember unjustified criticism is nothing more than a disguised compliment get them out of your head ethan those who mine don't matter and those who matter don't mind i had to say that one again don't let anyone rent space in your head live your life to make yourself happy don't live someone else's life to make them happy all right next up we've got take time for you damn it yeah you got to schedule time for yourself like when you make the the one pagers um and you can always download that again from i'll tell you in a second it's kind of complicated the link but i'm gonna show you the graph in a minute but take time for you like i don't know if you're stressed out like schedule time in for you to unwind and binge watch curb your enthusiasm if that makes you laugh or or i don't rent that movie you've been dying to see for a while um or take a day off from work and don't go because you're mentally drained take time for you take time for you schedule time for you otherwise you'll burn out and what's the point you're gonna make yourself happy and if you don't laugh every day you got to find a way to laugh every day what made you laugh when you're younger like when i started today's lesson today's uh lecture i sat in that chair that made me happy put yourself back in that situation remember the trigger point the trigger point is an event that occurred in your life that made you so insanely happy that when you think of it again shivers just thinking about it and this this one here this is the jose batista one here and by the way if you're curious these here are rookie cards for dave steve uh and um george bell another great blue jay player and i have velcro because i put them i have a man cave i built out the attic by myself it's a hack job i don't give a damn it's fun i learned a lot too and i put these all on the ceiling every blue jay card so anyway don't grow up people okay just be the happy you you were years ago you be you take time for you yes i collect baseball cards still oh one up i love it i love video games i love playing mario when i was a kid is it mary or mario i always forget and now when my kids ask me daddy can you help me with super mario galaxy or super mario odyssey's new one uh ow don't pull my arm too hard i'll be there in a second and help you i love it i love it but i wrote here you're you're never too old to start over you're never too old to start over you're not you're not um colonel sanders he actually used to live in my hometown of mississauga which is just outside toronto which has a bigger population mississauga than san francisco but most people don't know it but colonel sanders he started uh kfc and it's interesting it was actually for marketing reasons they rebranded kentucky fried chicken to kfc to deemphasize the the letter f for fry but when um colonel sanders he failed a lot in business his entire life then he was 65. way before i was born he was 65 and he started kfc and he made it huge he did really really well so you're never too old to start over and people today are living 26 years longer than they did back in the 1950s so if you're 65 you're not you're 39 and you're never too young to change the world as well look at the beetles i've actually got them can you see it up there yeah at the top there awesome the beatles up there that's abby road and by the way oh this is awesome the reason why um the reason why they did that album cover and it was so innovative at the time because it was the first album cover without the name of the band but they were the most four recognizable people on the planet but i gotta i gotta go off script and get this but they were gonna go to mount everest because this was gonna be the triumph their last big album uh ended up not being their last album and then what happened was they uh i don't know life got in the way and john was spending time with yoko and paul is spending time with linda and whatever and they're like screw it i don't want to go to everest that's a lot of work man so the name of the studio they were recording was called abbey roads and they walked right outside abbey road and they're like screw it let's do it let's just take a picture here let me get i want to show it to you so the beatles and i have to talk about this because you know the beatles but they did all their brilliance in their 20s in their 20s unbelievable so if you think you're too young to um change the world these guys did it in their 20s in their 20s it's unbelievable and by the way if you're old older like me and you're you you always wanted to start a rock band outfit do it now you'll be the first 80 year old rock star someone's got to do it we're living longer anyway so you're not 80 or 17 54. yeah all right so um i want to go through this here quickly i want to show this to you all right so abby road it's because it's cool and we're going to study this in marketing but i have to do it now i just have to i'll show it to you here actually what you've got here is they went outside and they took a picture and they learned that controversy sells in marketing okay so what they did was this there was a rumor that paul mccartney was dead there was a rumor he was dead um in fact if you listen to the end of strawberry fields and you play it backwards it says uh i buried paul um although john lennon said it actually says cranberry sauce it says i bury paul they're messing around with the media it and there's a rumor and then what happened was that rumor spread for a long long time and here in sgt pepper's there's a patch on paul's shoulder here you see this i got to make sure this the light's not there okay good hold on right there and people thought that said opd but it actually like officially pronounced dead opd that's actually opp yeah you know me opp is ontario uh provincial police opp because i used to live in the province of ontario we call them ontario party poopers and then um right here i think this is the best one to show here let me get it right because this is fascinating check this out this is cool being controversial helps you sell like mark benioff damn it okay here we go so you can see here this is a funeral procession uh and so john lennon is in white there okay and he's the priest then you've got uh ringo starr the drummer he's he's uh he's wearing uh he's the pallbearer the guy that carries the coffin then in the back you got the gravedigger which is george harrison um and then you've got paul mccartney who's in bare feet um smoking see the cigarette there in his hand signal uh signifying death because they even knew back in the 60s hey man smoking's bad and if you look closely this here is a volkswagen beetle it's a reverse here right right here beetle it's clever and the license plate if you zoom in it's probably hard to see here but it says 28 if meaning if paul mccartney were alive he'd be 28. they were playing around but controversy cells maybe have to hold up here and matt you can zoom in if you want there we go yeah yeah anyway so that's pretty cool and even on the back people thought this guy was a a skeleton or something whatever it's pretty cool pretty cool so um it was neat it was neat yeah yeah so and initially with this album they wanted to put which is oh my gosh it's genius they want to put it in a paper bag george mart the producer did and because they uh they thought they were gonna get sued by people here bob dylan everyone but whatever a little bit off topic there but interesting nonetheless we gotta pull this over here cuz we're gonna talk about this in a minute all right we're still recording great yeah so you're never too old uh to start over again right just remember that that uh john lennon song starting over um and i actually met annie levitz who took the the picture of john lennon actually uh on and i got to show you really quickly because i met her she's the best photographer of the last century she's amazing and she was at a benefit just around the corner here um that i went to and i got to meet with her and she she's amazing but let me show you actually so annie levitz and there's a reason i'm showing this okay annie leaves i asked her also like i do with everybody why are you successful and she had some unbelievable things to say uh but you've seen a lot of her her pictures right so um yeah leonardo dicaprio you've seen the cover of vanity fair demi moore and all that stuff there she is there she's wonderful star wars she's the last oh right before my goodness before she passed away that's right just amazing pictures but i asked her why are you successful and she said because her um my favorite actress in history here she said because when i was younger my father was in the army and we moved around all over the world and all over america and so i spent my youth in the back of a a station wagon a car and i kept i saw america through a different vantage point because i was looking outside the window and that window was a metaphor for a frame for a picture right is that right like that yeah yeah a frame and so she thought saw things differently and let me show you um i'll show you the john lennon picture she she took actually uh on the day he died and she my god this is brutal but the day that john lennon was shot um she did a photo shoot okay and she was working for rolling stone at the time uh and and she took um like this picture here right is is was one that's yokono and john lennon obviously it initially um i'll just show you these ones here so initially yoko wasn't supposed to be in the photo shoot and john said no she has to be and i only agree to do this photo shoot if you put yoko on the cover of the of the rolling stone magazine with me uh and so what what she did was um this is it here yeah um this is this is the cover here yeah so what what happened was uh he was some some jerk named mark david chapman uh took away john len's life with with a gun at the dakota on the upper west side in 1980 i think and then after the guy shot him after he shot lenin he was leaning again i'll show you that picture there sorry i'm going to scroll down he was leaning against uh a lamppost waiting for the police to arrive reading catcher in the rye yeah out there i know but um oh and so the editor of rolling stone of course they wanted to put uh john lennon on the cover with something on the lines of the the day the music died or something um and um just john lennon and he said absolutely not yoko's got to be there as well i i promised promised john lennon yeah but she showed a couple more pictures how she saw things differently like she took a picture of nixon um when when he was uh no longer the president united states and for those who don't know about this richard nixon used to be president who was no longer he was booted for lying about something yeah um and so she showed the picture she told me how she she wanted to think differently from from the peer group from other people and so she took this picture here and everybody took the picture of of nixon going i'm not a criminal or when he left her we were in the helicopter um and you can go that if you want but here's a picture she took which was pretty cool man and she saw she waited until nixon was in the helicopter leaving the white house launch she was there uh there's the washington memorial right there uh and she took a picture here of these these three dudes here putting their hands in her hat so that that hat didn't blow away which is pretty cool so anyway yeah pretty pretty pretty interesting but i had i had to pull the beetles into that it's kind of cool it's neat i love the beetles yeah all right let's move on now number 101
