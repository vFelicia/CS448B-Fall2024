hey everybody its Jesse and today we're gonna do something a little bit different so yesterday we worked on just some styling things and I haven't had a chance yet to do anything else with the styles since yesterday afternoon so I don't have any updates when it comes to that what I did do though is I have a server completely up and running and I have a version of the resource center project that we've been working on now live and so what I thought we could do today is I want to go through check it out in a browser first I'm just gonna click around you know in Chrome and see see what happens we'll resize the screen maybe open up a few other browsers and you all will be able to go through the site with you know whatever setup that you have I know I'm on a Mac right now and there's certainly going to be some of you on Windows and I know a few of you are on on Linux systems so in the past we've had you know very different experiences depending on our combination of operating system you know browser or device so I thought it'd be nice to just go through and try to figure out you know if anything just looks really weird or is you know kind of acting differently than it should and see if we can we can fix that you know at the very least you know it'd be nice to just get a list of things that that need to be the need to be fixed so I will say this the forms are not working right now so I already know that so if you try to submit something through the forms they're not working and I've left the error message up here basically what's happening is it's trying it's trying to send the form data to http and then our C Francisquito University and then port 9000 slash uploads so obviously this is a ridiculous URL this is not where you want to send it so I'm gonna work on that the problems in the service dog a.s are yeah the service center I'm sorry service requests today s is the component where the issues had so I've done a few things already to try to correct it obviously it hasn't worked it's a little tricky because I have to make the changes push them to get out pull it down to the server rebuild it and then test it again so it's not the the fastest way to do things so I think I'm just going to think about this for a little bit instead of changing little things and trying again and again and again since the you know the feedback loop is you're not quite as tight as it normally is when we're developing locally okay so let me just let me say hide everyone to check the live chat really quick I do have one question Saran Saran CH says what's this soft on the screen though you mean what what software is on the screen I'm not exactly sure I understand the question this is just chrome dev tools right now and I'm running the dark theme so it's not it looks different than the default so let's go over let me bring over the the actual site you can see there's some things like this page the letterhead page obviously I haven't finished this yet so I need I just need to put in the data for this so not really a big deal I just keep forgetting to do that I do want to show so you can see this this page is exactly you know how we left it off we already spent a bunch of time on this page earlier so I'm not even really gonna test this out there's not much I mean I guess we can we can check this out and see how it looks on a smaller screen and you know that's that's fine that's what it's kind of nice about using some sort of CSS framework especially for a grid system is that it's normally very consistent you you don't you don't see as many bugs like if you try to do your own you know from scratch it's been my experience at least that it um if there's it's way more likely that there's gonna be some bugs if I try to do it completely on my own but if I bring in at least some elements from an existing system that's used by a lot of people and it has been tested it's you know you can reasonably expect that it's gonna act how you how you want it to act I do want to check this out because we haven't we haven't really done much with this since we've set it up I don't even remember the last time I looked at this page so it looks like you know we see we see all the logos that's fine this is working that's great getting a phone call but that is some type of solicitor some representative from some company keeps trying to get me to have a meeting and they call me every day and send me emails I can't even remember what their company does but for some reason people think I have decisionmaking abilities and the ability to buy things and I really don't I mean I just I build the websites I can make recommendations to people higher up but oh so let's check that out not not really a browser specific thing but don't want that color there in the dropdown so let's check that out now so I figure on normally if I was going to do testing I would just when I saw something I would just write it down I put it my Trello board and then go back to it but that's gonna be I think somewhat boring to do so what I'm gonna do now is if I see something I figured like let's just we'll dive right in we'll try to figure out what's going on and fix it so we may not get through everything you know in terms of testing but I think it'll make for a much better stream in terms of viewing experience much better than just watching me click around on the site so let's check out let's see this is I'm assuming that we just use the the select input from did we do so selected we do a dropdown let's just check out this this page and see what we use because I'm guessing there's probably some prop we can pass in that will change this color if that's the case then that'll be really easy if that's not the case this may actually be a color right now let me check this out I just said I had an idea we have a custom theme somewhere I don't think I have it up already see there you go it's in the components holder so we have this custom theme and I'm so I'm guessing that that's this pink color here and see we are using it as an accent color so let's get rid of that color and let's put in as the accent color that let's put in that yellow that we've been using elsewhere and as I mentioned yesterday if we're using sass it's better to do variables I haven't really taken the time to set up my color variables and things and import them correctly so this is one of those cases where it's like yes this works but this is definitely not the best way to do it in terms of organization this could be a lot better but for now let's switch out this pink I think that's the only color that really needs you know everything else is somewhat neutral right we have different Gray's black white I'm okay with that but obviously that pink is not it's not in the color palette for to the University so that should work and then now we don't need this pink so we could take that out as well and now let's see what we have here hmm do a hard refresh hmm has it changed maybe it's somewhere else oh I don't know what I was thinking obviously it wouldn't change it we're checking the I was checking on the live version so let me click whoops I didn't put this in in quotes so so this is the local version so we should see the changes reflected immediately here so let's check it out all right great so now we have that color I'm not a hundred percent sure this is the color I want here but at least it's a color that's on the official color palette for the University so it'll be all right it does match you know what we have here so I'm okay with that for right now let's keep going and I do want to check the I want to do the checks on the live version alright let's see yeah those links look good so our logos page is good on our posters page so on this page we had the same issue that we have the home page in that you know we have a few cards here and we have it vertically aligned to be in the center yesterday when we worked on it on the home page you know we we tried it out being not vertically centered and it was you know obviously it looked better so I think we should probably do that here as well there's enough content here and a little bit of color with these links I don't think we need to add that that little kind of bar with the accent color that we did on the home page let me know what you all think though because you know we might want to do that I don't know I don't I guess I could see going both ways we could have consistency by doing it or you know it could be overdoing it if we use it for everything but for now at least I do want to move this up so that instead of being vertically centered it's just at the top all the time so let's do that now pages this posters and I forgot to set my timer oops of it on the other page let's set my timer and that would be a good time to explain what's going on for anybody that's that's new to hey everybody and EMS are you using web Pappa web pack I am using webpack but I'm using create react apps so they took care of all the web pack config so I don't I haven't done anything with the config to customize it but behind the scenes web pack is doing a lot of stuff all right so for anybody that's that's new if you haven't seen any Austrians before this is me doing my everyday work so it's not not really a tutorial although I try to explain things as best I can so some of the work gets done in between streams and I try to catch everybody up on what I've done the way I break up the stream is that I use a Pomodoro timer so it's a 25minute session of coding or whatever we happen to be working on and then five minutes I go back to the live chat and I answer any questions that anybody's posted in the live chat then we do another 25minute session I like to do at least two sessions per stream sometimes more today I think I'm gonna keep it a shorter stream because I I'm still just not feeling well I have a sore throat I don't want to lose my voice and I really have a lot of work that I need to get to I want to get that service request form working but I'm also I have that if you've been watching you know that I have that Udacity react nano degree that I'm working on and there's a project due soon I need to doublecheck but I'm pretty sure I have until September 15th if anybody's in that course and I have the the date wrong let me know although it depends on when you signed up I guess but I need the project the project needs done so I really need to get to work on that as well but in any case we get in to Pomodoro sessions and then at the end whenever I'm done with the coding I answer any questions there in the live chat I almost always get a chance to answer every question occasionally for if there's something like a meeting I have and I really have to cut it short I won't get to them all but I would say you know 99% of the time I get to all the questions so if I don't get to your question right away if you can stick around till the end I will answer it all right so let's start this up we'll go in here to the posters jazz component and you can see all this code on github so there's a link in the description we're on the master branch right now so you've if you want to follow along or see how the how the code works you can go there feel free to clone the project if you want to use it if you just want to mess around with it or use some of it as a base as a basis for your own project or if you'd like to submit a pull request to this project that's that's awesome you know feel free to use any of it I mean obviously you can't use the University logo I don't have permission to let's use that as well but all the code you can certainly use however you want to use it okay posters thanks I think we can get rid of this so we did have a logos posters view and I think we can get rid of this because we're not gonna use that now we set things up differently so let's just delete that while we're in here and we already have enough going on with all our file structure we don't need to keep in things that aren't doing anything right now okay so in our posters this should be a really easy fix let's find our container here we go if we remove this class of the line wrapper right this is the class that's giving us our vertical alignment and we've imported this you know we brought it over from materialized CSS so we're not using the entire framework mainly because it's a lot of it is based on jQuery I don't want to use jQuery with react for various reasons that we've gone over and previous streams if you really want to know the reasons ask me in the live chat and I'll explain it on one of the breaks but there are some really helpful things in materialized that we brought over so the grid system they're responsive font sizes and also this vertical align alignment class that uses flex behind the scenes there so if we take that out that should fix our alignment let's I keep forgetting that we're no I guess I shouldn't have removed that so I deleted that file but I must be using it somewhere let's see where what is going on I need to figure out why let me try restarting the server before I go in and start doing anything else see if we get the same error or not I think we are yep we are okay so it looks like it's a little bit here we go routes that's what I wanted to say I thought it was in routes but better to just kind of wait and see what line is that does it say alright it's not telling me a line but let's check out our he said routes component let me there we go raus and let's remove that from logos posters let's get rid of that and see if we have it anywhere else them as posters yeah we don't need that here either okay so that should work now great all right so let's check out that posters page see there you go now we don't have that vertical alignment so I am going to check in the lab check because I asked about the the styles for this I'm gonna see if anyone has any opinions on that also I forgot to mention to anyone watching on Instagram if you want to see the code that I'm working on right now that you can you can kind of see the edge of the screen there a little bit but if you want to be able to get a better view of the code check out the free code camp YouTube channel I'm live right now if you see the recording of this then the recording will be available the title of this stream or this this video is browser testing react projects and I should have I should have put browser testing a react project I guess it doesn't really matter I just it's hard for me to come up with titles sometimes but anyway it'll be browser testing and that's project 2 day 31 of live coding with Jesse so if you're watching on free code camp right now then in the end you want to see see me while I code you can check out the Instagram the links in the description for the video so it looks like John Hanson says consistency of design is always good yeah yeah we definitely could let me see how this looks again here's what I'm I'm kind of torn though because on the home page these are all really links I mean it's not like the on the interior pages these are more informational blocks of text so they do have a different function I mean some of these are lengths but functionally these cards are different so I think we have a reason to treat them differently I'm you know I think it works with these cards they're very small I just am worried that it'll be too much on these larger cards I'm gonna think about it we'll go on and check out some of the other pages I'm gonna think about it if you all have any opinions on whether or not we should put a colored border on the left of these cards let me know in the live chat please but I see video tutorials oh yeah let's not forget this page so this page has tutorial videos yeah I think this is fine there's not really much to do on this page just needs to display the videos one thing I think I do want to do to keep things consistent is have a title on every page right now only some of the pages have the title so I think it would be nice to have the title here for each page or at least something here for each page so let me go back and see I'm okay with not having it here for logos because we have this this menu here so I don't really want to add another thing here yeah so we should put I should put letterhead here as a title at the top yeah let's do that now let me see how I did this in posters okay I just had it had a div that's h2 and Pedro says letterhead so it might be a bit too small to see but over here in our all our folders here all each page is its own component in the views folder so you have them separated out from the rest of the components and there pretty much all of them are named the same name as the title of that page we also have all of our tests that we're running for the pages there with within the views folder as well okay so let's throw in let's try to put that in right here and see what it looks like letterhead I don't think we need this flex here I think that was necessary when we were doing the vertical alignment I don't think it is anymore we'll find out okay so we have letterhead what's different we have a different class going on here flow text okay so let's let's add the flow text class here and this is that responsive font font size class that I was talking about a few minutes ago that we brought in from materialized so all this does is it changes the font size based on screen width so if you add that here we're gonna end up with there we go so end up with a larger header a larger heading and then we also have larger text here I don't know that I like how much space is there let's see yeah we definitely don't have nearly as much space here so let's get rid of some of the space let's see where that's coming from so I guess this Pete yeah I think if we just get rid of the margin that should be good yeah that looks a lot better that's more reasonable we could probably shorten that gap even more but I think that's I think that looks all right so let's do that in this case I like to put a style like this directly on this age tag if I find on some other pages I need to do something similar then I may think about just kind of globally doing this but I'd rather not put a style directly I'd rather not set a global style for an age tag like that because we may use this in other places and so I just don't want to inadvertently mess up Styles elsewhere but in react we can use styles in line let me do it a little bit differently than you normally would in HTML so we have our Styles you know like normal or styles property but then we put these curly brackets the first set of brackets means that we're gonna do some JavaScript inside of here the second set just makes an object right like normally if we're doing JavaScript brackets or an object right and then we can write let's see Louie De Marchi and bottom there so we can do marginbottom camel cased not hyphenated like we normally do in CSS so you do that camel case just like a normal object we're going to put our colon and then we're gonna put our value I'm gonna put 0 pixels here I think it would work let's just try it out just for a demonstration here since it's just a numerical value if I put the zero it should work even if it's not in in quotation marks maybe it didn't work all right let's try this again so this was good I thought it would work although I'd never tried it so let's try this again let's try it like this hmm did it not work either way I could be that hmm oops I put an S there I'm sure you all caught that sorry about that okay so that worked here now now I'm really curious I do actually want to see if this works with just us here okay and in fact it does work right so normally when you do styles like this you have to put that bat value as a string right you have to put it in in quotes or the back take if you're gonna do a template literal something like that but if the value is just numerical then you can put that in and it works as well okay great so this is looking better as I said I think this is the first page I had up on the screen when we first started checking there's a lot more than he's done on this page and if we get through everything else we may come back to this and just start start changing some things on here but for now I'm gonna move on because what I'm looking for mostly right now is you know kind of really obvious things that need change you know padding things things like that I really actually I really don't like how this card title is up here without any padding but we're not gonna use the card title so I'm not gonna worry about it right now I just have to keep that in mind later on if we if we do end up using a card with this this title here okay let's check out our share story page okay that looks good we don't have a title here so let's put that in I think I'll just call it hmm sorry is yawning yeah let's put in a heading but just says shared story I wanna I can't remember what I call it on the homepage suggest the story yeah maybe I'll put suggestive story since that's how I have it here okay so let's just bring in let's copy what we have here and we'll put that in story so we're in the story j/s component right now and we have more more than usual going on in this component since we have a form here and we have to handle that form data but for this we don't need to change mas it's just a story all right let's check it out whoops and let's move this flow text up to the container div there we go all right and I want to shrink this down just to see how this looks okay no bad I'm kind of I don't really know what I can do about it right now but I mean let's think if this was really somebody's fun they're only gonna see this at first I think I have to scroll down before they get to the forum I can see that as being somewhat annoying especially if someone has already gone through all this you know several times it's not a long scroll I don't know that it would really look right though if I just had the form first and then the explanation under that so I guess it'll have to be like this for now to be honest though very few people access the current version of this right now on their phones and this suggests a story form is rarely used I mean where I would be surprised if it's been used more than a dozen times in the last year so probably shouldn't put too much thought into this right now because it it really won't be seen by that many people and it'll be used by even you know fewer people all right let's share the service request form now we do have some stuff going on here that we need to think about you know fixing I haven't looked at it on a more narrow screen yet okay not bad so you can see right away there's some some things going on with spacing here like are are checkboxes that have icons have a ton of space between them we need to fix that and make it consistent with the rest of the checkboxes I don't love the fact that this goes down onto another line but it actually lines up with this button somewhat so I'm not I'm not really that worried about it hmm this completion date line doesn't go all the way to the end although we certainly don't need that space for a date it would look more consistent if this went full width so maybe it will do that all right so right away we need to work on these check boxes you know possibly we need to make this a bit bigger you know full width and we do have some issues where okay so on the when these are full with this works but look what happens whenever we go up like this all right so you see it messes up a lot of what's going on here so let me let me go back out here right so our project description is here in this side but if I put the wrong value in there the project description actually even flips to the other side now so at first I didn't notice this it was earlier today that I first noticed is that not only do we have more space here but it's actually flipping the order around so we definitely want to figure out what's going on here and fix that so that it doesn't change the order that's probably the checkbox spacing in this are gonna be the number one number one and two priorities on this page let me go back I did ask a few questions about you know your opinions actually I have three minutes yeah I'll just work on this for a little bit and then on the 5minute break I'll go back and check out what you all thought about the few things that I'd asked let's see let's let's check out this first I'm just I'm really curious about it I want to see what's going on to move this over a bit so we can see okay so here's our our Colin okay so something's going on I guess inside there is no difference to this you know container this column class that should be separating these properly I guess we do have this added see what it what it looks like okay so definitely think the issue is with this div this is the only thing that's really changing I mean other other than the the color of this border underneath let's see okay all right so nothing so far just kind of messing around in in dev tools trying to change the display value and things position I guess may yeah certainly if we change the position to absolute this would work right so I'm CEO this okay that's really tight that's not a way although actually if you made it tight like that I don't mind that okay so potentially if we changed it from position relative to position absolute set the value for bottom to 15 actually let's get rid of that and then we can just set this value for the bottom to eight negative eight pixels and I think that works there's a little bit of space here it should work as long as this doesn't bleed over on a second line which would just have to test and see if that would would happen thinking would probably only happen on a smaller screen so we could do this in a media query that way it'll behave normally on a small screen let's try that we'll try would I just done here and we'll try to apply it to everything and just kind of click around and mess with it on different screen sizes and see if it works I'm okay with this right now I know the spacing is a little bit tight but you know hopefully you know people won't even see this that often right they'll type things correctly and in fact I think this looks fine and if I hadn't have first seen it with more spacing in between here I probably wouldn't really think that much about it all right my timer did go off so I'm gonna set my fiveminute timer now go back to live chat answer any questions you have and see what what your opinions are on what we've been doing so far all right have some people kind of shouting out where they're from so from South Africa Africa Ukraine Ghana awesome welcome so awesome everyone's watching from all over the place okay who's this no Peter's saying expend a little more to the div element it's more suitable to your screen I'm not sure what I was looking at when you said that if I had to guess I'm thinking maybe you were talking about the homepage cards maybe you make them a little bit bigger anyway no beer let me know would you or when you were thinking because that was about yeah that was a while ago for that comment so I I had scrolled back up to the top of the live chat and I'm working my way down Frank asked how do you move that window from side to side is it a Mac yes it's because I'm on a Mac so I can you know have multiple so I've like multiple desktops right and I can switch between them so for each I'm running three screens right now so you only see one of my screens but for each screen I have multiple desktops and can switch between them so it's really useful especially if you're consistent and then you kind of memorize where everything's at and I can flip between things pretty quickly and it's all just hand gestures so if I use three fingers and I swipe then it it goes and goes between them so it took a little while to get used to but now it's definitely more efficient to do things that way Raina's says congrats on working on your nano degree Thanks yeah hopefully I get the nanodegree to be honest with you this the first project was okay I did I did decent job on it you know I I passed the second project now is having to do with redux and I've never used redux before so that's been a lot more difficult for me the first project was just react react the router stuff that you know we're using on this project so it was a lot easier but I'm struggling a bit with this one so I need to really I'm actually considering taking a day off of work to work on my project hopefully I won't I won't have to do that but I'll be spending a lot of time probably Saturday probably most of the day Saturday this week working on it okay cool so Umberto says in regard to that this you know flipping between the desktops that you can actually do it on Windows 10 I was not aware of that I haven't I have a few computers running Windows 10 at home and but I haven't really done much with them for a long time so I have to try that cool thanks for mentioning that Umberto okay here's a good so CF coder 2 says I would encourage you to include a left edge color bar you can perhaps code color code each category of your site so when we're talking about I'll show you on this this one so I don't mess up I'm doing here dev tools so like putting a color bar here we could have different colors for each each section I don't have to think about that because we do have a few other colors in the color palette that we haven't even used it all yet I'll think about that nobody says nicelooking header Thanks thank you appreciate it and Frank also says pretty hot header thank you cf coder says is there a reason not to use a class on the h2 tag no not I mean we could definitely use a class on the h2 tag to do what we're doing initially I thought well if I'm just gonna do it for this page I'm gonna do the inline Styles and I could always change it to a class if I end up doing it a lot I ended up doing it a few times so might not be a bad idea to just add a class to that to that age tag so yeah maybe we'll add a class on there I'm trying to think of what I would I mean really I could add a class called no bottom margin and then that that's really all we're doing so it could be a utility class I almost hate to add a class just for that because it's it's only saving a few characters from actually doing the inline style so often I think now that I think about it I don't even I don't know if it would be worth it if I added some more to that class it might be worth it but I don't know I know there's a lot of different ideas about how to do CSS how to organize classes and things like that so I don't really want to get into all those differences right now as you can see there's not set sorry to say but there's not that much logic to what's going on with my sass files right now so they've been kind of like an afterthought and just throwing in some Styles here and there where I need them I haven't really taken a good approach to organizing it yet let's see alright my timers up so let me just I'm actually really close to the bottom of the live shot let me just take a few more I did go over a little bit on my first 25 minutes so let me just get to the bottom here this live chat since there's not much left let's see no beer says I'm curious about your shared story page how do you in that in in the input area when input is focused it exactly works like YouTube live chat or Gmail login page how do you do it can you explain okay yeah for sure I'll go over that I'll go over that in a second actually whenever we get back to this because that is kind of a cool a cool way to do it Frank also said can I use some of this logic and logic in my project yeah for sure you use any you know whatever stuff in the in the code or you know whatever you want and if you use it in a project I'd love to see your project so if it's if it's available on github or somewhere let me know like send me either let me know in the live chat or if you don't want everybody to see it you can just send me a direct message on Twitter or something like that but I really do I'd like to see if if you are using some of the stuff from the live streams in your own projects that I think it's really cool to see what you all do you know kind of based on what we've done here and how you improve it and do different things with it that I usually never even thought of doing okay I'm actually I'm gonna go back here now and just explain a little bit this so this kind of no beer I'm assuming that you're talking about just this kind of effect here that when we click it you know we get that that line underneath so this is just it's a material design kind of thing that you'll see commonly so that's why you know you see it on you know Google things basically this is really easy to do and react because it's built into material UI so if you use the material UI components this is going to happen for you automatically it also happens with materialized CSS so if you're not working with react you can still get this effect if you use materialized as your your CSS framework but you can also do something similar with just regular CSS so really you you could do a CSS only version of this too if you wanted but you know all that's happening here is you're changing the position and the size of this of this text here and then you're adding in some color and a size to this border right so just knowing that alone won't give you the exact effect because if you can see it's actually more like a second border expanding here so if you wanted that effect of it expanding you'd have to do a little bit more and actually have an entirely different you know span or div there that was going to grow in size so but you could certainly do that and I think I may have implemented some form of this in CSS and a previous project I can't remember what project it was right now I think though I didn't have the complete effect I think what I did was I just changed you know this border here so it didn't kind of grow out but everything else works the same so anyway hopefully that was explained a little bit of what was going on there but yeah you can easiest way to do it is use the framework either material UI if you're using react or materialized CSS if you use thing else or you can do it on your own just probably the easiest way is just check out how it's done on a Google site just to get your values for your CSS so you know font size and the amount that this moves you know things like that the the width of the bottom border here and the change in width so get those values from some site that's using something like this and then you can work it in you know whatever way you like to do it into your CSS or even use some JavaScript to help you with the effects you know depending on what you're comfortable with and it's not really it's not super hard to do I when I had done this just in some CSS I remember being somewhat surprised that how how easy it was to get you know something really similar to this going okay so let me start my time up again I wanted to get through everything in the live chat but I'm I'm not I'll have to wait till the next break to get get through more of it so I will come back to that same spot in the live chat so right around for me for my timestamp it's 234 p.m. so it's Eastern time okay let's start this up again and let's try to apply what we've done here so basically all we changed for this element is we've set the position to absolute and we've put the bottom value as negative 8 pixels so now let's figure out how to target this it doesn't look like there's hmm so there's no class no ID we can target let's see let me check so we are using form Z react and in particular we are using the material the material UI version of this which I think there's a link to form Z material UI so if there's a way to target that div specifically I'd like to do that otherwise I think we can do it with I think we can do it another way let's see that I pass who and I don't see not really much for documentation for this all right well let's alright let's just try to target this then with some CSS so if we go let's look at what's going on here I think I have this open already that's a test service request test maybe I don't have it open anyone there we go alright so let's check this out these are calm classes let's see if we can add a class name okay cool so we have our class now on this container div and we know the last then we have all righty Serena's house okay let's try this where's our styles are I'm just gonna put it in the home styles because we are using forms on more than one page so let's do this that's what we named it right rooms the input and let's see I think if I do div can I do last that's the will that work let's try I always mess up when I try to do these kind of pseudo selector things but it's worth a shot we're gonna have to use important to override those inline Styles normally would not be using important but not really not really a decent option to do it other than that and would be a bottom negative eight pixels alright so let's see if this works oh ho nice okay so we got some stuff going on here oh do we not put important that's important important so this should work now yeah it works all right let's make sure it actually applied to some other things awesome great let's see project description I think this needs to be to be not having I guess we didn't have any type of validation on these other ones actually this one is numeric right now there we go okay interesting this is this shouldn't have done anything Yeah right I should have done anything okay let's add in that I was just I was just checking it out because it should not have it shouldn't have done anything with the styles but this seemed like this was a lot tighter up to the bottom of here than it normally would have been so for a second I thought that some of our Styles did somehow get applied but we didn't put the class on any of the multiline inputs yet so let's add this class name in to our multi line fields as well and like yes I guess we can add it in here let's see this added in here as well and we don't have to worry about the checkboxes and now let's awesome great ok so we have you know we have these working great great alright so let's see I guess the next thing we're going these checkboxes then I know what you think I mean check the live chat really quickly just to see if anyone has has anything to say like maybe I did something really silly and I didn't realize it okay so it looks like CF code or 2 s is the input dropping location below the label from the form input as you type into the input something you styled or did that come with form Z that is formzee so well yes I mean this this effect here is not actually just forms this is material UI but you know this here is its with form Z I'm pretty sure it is I could double check maybe this does come with material UI in forms he just gives you some extra ways to format this and validate I'm not 100% sure on that but so you might want to check out the material UI documentation on text inputs to see if they have this validation field builtin but this for sure is built in a material UI Rohan good good look so Roman says it is it just me or the underlines gone you're right the underlines are gone what the heck all right so something happened and we don't have underlines let's see what happened water bottle all right let me take let's take this class name off of something here see if that brings him back okay yeah so definitely something we did took this took those boarders off the bottom so let's see what we did it says no that's not what has the border with part of this has the border this is it okay so this is where the borders coming from so let's see what it's the one on these that's what okay I thought about this and I didn't realize I didn't realize that these that this div contained the borders so they're actually a chars right with with borders okay so what we want to do then is let's put it back in here just take this out we should still have borders see I see now okay all right I see now so this won't work yeah if this won't work so what's happening is the div that I was trying to target as the last if they're only appears if there's an error and then it's not even in the Dom if there's not an error so then it switches and this becomes the last day of where the border is so we need to figure out some other way to target this div all right let me see I I haven't I this is gonna be the not a great way to do this but I think it's gonna be how we have to do it so we have to so let's just do EQ 2 for our target here so let's give how's this work I can't remember how you do this and CSS I'll have to look it up oh no is it not CSS there's it I'll EQ is the jQuery way to do it all right we could do let's let's do what was that I'm Shawna remember if it's zero indexed or not I don't think it is okay all right let's try it try this let's put this in this world how can we do somehow this is Oh ro alright I just looked over the live chat and see you've seen what you type in there everyone it's not gonna work let's see if this works for this okay so it's working for these it's not but for the multiline inputs it's not working so let's we're gonna have to do something different for the multiline so I'm guessing that this has okay so this the second div for these inputs has the border I mean it's gonna be a little bit more complicated and I want it to be but I think and we should only need to customize it one more time Farzin multiline alright let's see see what that does okay that works Wow all right okay all right so that looks like it is working now we have our underlines okay all right so this is what we ended up needing we needed two different classes so that's okay it looks like oops we need to change this is a multi line for our upload the the input that we're putting our file names into is multiline as well so let's switch that okay great I want to check how much time I have left and this old man two minutes okay I do want to at least check to see what's going on with this why we're getting such a large amount of space between here interesting okay we change this all right so for this I'm wondering if we couldn't do the similar thing changing it to absolute position mmm the only thing I'm I guess I could just position out there yeah I think we could probably do the same thing with absolute position and then avoid having that gap so let's go with oh no it's up wait all right we would need to switch there we go okay so this is going to be probably not going to finish this in the stream but this is I think going to be the solution that will work so we've changed the positioning of the image itself to use absolute instead of relative position and then we just need to adjust the top and the right attributes here to get it positioned over to where it was before but the key is you notice when we first did this and we made a position absolute when we took off that top value it went way up here right so what we had to do is make give the containing give the position of relative then it would be absolute based on that container div so that's kind of CSS has I don't know it seems like some weird things when it comes to positioning and that and correct me if I'm wrong but from what I remember from the last time I dealt with this the absolute you put position absolute on something it's absolute as related to the nearest parent div that it has a position of relative if there's no parent divs that have a position relative then it's just based on basically the entire window right so that's why I shot right up here and that's why it went back down whenever I took this div and I put position relative on it right so if you have something happen like that if you if you can without messing things up at a position relative to the container div then that should make it a lot easier to position things like that so I think this should be this should solve it I definitely want to test it out to make sure but I haven't even tossed any other problems but that should be it and then you know we'll have a much much nicer spacing between that okay so been streaming for I did two I only did two Pomodoro sessions but I think I went over on both of them and I went over talking so on my break so we're actually almost an and a half into the stream at this point so I'm going to go to the live chat now and answer some questions so if you can't stick around for the question and answer session totally understand that the coding portion of this is done so thank you so much for watching if you can't stick around and you have questions please put them in the live chat right now even if you don't have a question it will be nice if you could help answer some of the questions in the live chat I'm certainly not an expert at at everything I may not be an expert at anything but so it definitely helps if more people were in the live chat and helping to contribute to give you know some really good answers to anyone that's in here so don't worry if you're a beginner you know any questions are fine don't don't be afraid nobody's going to laugh at you or say anything mean to you for if you ask a question that they think is basic or something like that I guess if someone is mean to somebody about the questions they ask in here then I'm not gonna be happy about it so let me scroll up to where I was and keep going from from that point okay so Rohan says the last two paragraphs in the submit suggested story forum should actually be shown after someone submits the story so let me check that out again look into each tip in determine my my fila website yeah I guess it would make sense I'm just wondering like would that flow be weird if there's a forum just right in the middle of these paragraphs I guess I could just I just do it and see what it looks like but that I mean I would move the forum up a little bit more well maybe I'll have to check that out at some point and just and see how it looks if it doesn't if it doesn't look weird to have that form right there then I'm okay with that actually I mean if on a different site what I would probably end up doing is is having this in some sort of banner so like a full width like color section here and then put that in the middle and then it would kind of stand out I think and not look but with the way this site is I'm not I'm not sure that it would look right we're not doing anything else like that on the whole site yeah I'll have to think about that anyway thanks for the suggestion I actually haven't I don't even remember the last time I read what what this text actually said it's probably been like a year and a half since I've read this stuff so you probably helped to read it and see if it even makes sense where I'm putting it okay Alexander says Jessie you can resize your page to a certain device in dev tools it's the second top left icon yeah definitely thanks for bringing that up so I I do use that sometimes so talk about this this dev tools icon here which brings this up so you can do like right now it's iPhone 4 I had to use this before I found what I use so this is good I use this but what I started to use that I think I like even better I mean that this is useful and really quick to do but if I have time to do more I like to for since I'm on a Mac for iPhone devices and iPads I actually use the simulator in Ex tools and that gives me a more accurate representation of what it would be like on a real iPhone and then well obviously I have an Android phone so I test on the Android I have a pixel so I can test on there but then also we have a browser stack account that I can go on browser stack and test on on different devices as well so I know browser stack is you know cost money but if you if you can get your employer to pay for it it's really useful or you know if you have if you have your own freelance business or agency or something like I would I I've found it to be very useful and definitely way less expensive than buying all those devices for testing yourself but thank you thanks Alexander that's definitely like such a useful feature in dev tools and Alexander also is a question it says is it better to use inline styles on a component or to write CSS in a different file using classes and all that goodies of preprocessors yeah so I don't I don't necessarily have a rule that I stick to all the time but it would depend on what I want to do in the situation right so if it's just kind of what I was saying before like if I need to make a change on something that I don't think I'll use often or you know anywhere else within the site I just use inline Styles it's fast it's easy for someone to come in and look at that component and know exactly what it's gonna look like because they can see the style right there if I have to put a lot of styles I'd rather do it in a separate sheet right because I don't want all those inline Styles cluttering up that component if I have a style that I want to be repeated in lots of places throughout the site I put it in a separate CSS or sass file if there's something that I'm doing that I want to do that would be beneficial to use the you know preprocessor for like sass like mixins or variables or something like that then I'll do it in the sass file if I need to use a hover effect or a media query I'm obviously can't do that inline so I'm going to do that in a CSS file so it kind of you know the answer is it basically coming just depends on your situation but for sure like it's just really fast especially if I'm testing things out I'm like I'm not sure if I really want to keep it like that I'm just testing styles it's usually faster just to do something inline really quick especially if you don't already have a CSS file you know linked up to that component you know a lot of times I just put it in there a third option is to do something like CSS and j/s or there's a there's a lot of different ways right now to put CSS in the component and it's not inline but you can put it either like in the top like as a constant or something and then you bring it in to the component or you can it just depends on what you're using so there there are other ways than just the kind of the two either in line or in a separate file there's kind of a hybrid method of having styles that you can write out like normal styles you do in CSS but they're actually included within your component so in my last project I got into some of that and then in future projects I'll probably try some different methods out as well because I'm really interested in trying the different ones out and seeing what's the best one so my knowledge at least from what I've read in videos I've watched there's not really like one standard that's emerged is the best way to do it there's still a lot of different things being used so which is kind of cool I'm sure at some point once things you know kind of mature with react there'll be something that is kind of accepted that most people use but for now I think it's it's kind of wide open as to what you know to use what's best for your use case for your situation and and just your preferences anyway that was kind of a long answer but hopefully it was helpful okay CF kotor actually asks a similar thing I noticed CF kotor 2 says I noticed you use a lot of inline styling is there a reason for not using more class definitions to reuse styling so I basically my answer the last question probably answered that because that's that's kind of my my philosophy on inline vs styling versus using classes and things like that so hopefully I answered that if not if I didn't answer that you can you know ask ask me to follow up on that and be more specific I guess okay so no beer actually had a response to Alexander's question about the inline styles versus you know putting in style sheets so no bears opinion is that styling you know directly in the component is is better than having it in line because then your component or your HTML depending on what you're using isn't is more clean right so yeah and I'm definitely so I would agree with that right so I think as I said before I'm not opposed to using inline styles in certain situations as long as it's a you know just one style or maybe two styles right but I don't want to get it cluttered you know I want everything to seem clean within the component as well so I'm not entirely against it but definitely I definitely agree with that okay CF kotor says your site looks great thank you I appreciate that but also some suggestion you can enhance your site even more by adding a background image semitransparent or left edge more bold image that shrinks and with as device shrinks yeah I'll think about that I actually I was thinking about that a bit when we were looking at the the homepage so yesterday we had did some stuff to the homepage but I mean right now especially I mean this probably isn't a common trying to find a more common screen with but it's not as bad kind of with a more common with but if you get a large screen there there's just so much space so I kind of thought about doing some sort of background image or something but I'm not 100% sure about it yeah I'm not I'm not sure about it I'm kind of still thinking about it I almost I didn't want to go with that because so I'm recreating in react something that already exists as kind of a jQuery single page application and so I'm trying to mimic the how that looks so that the transition will be as easy as possible for the users so I didn't really want to add too much but I'm definitely going to think about that because I this does just look a little bit you know I think yeah we think we talked about this yesterday is it just looks stark yes I'll think about that thank you for the suggestion okay at some point Alexander capita said use an ID and then put some question marks oh sorry I didn't get to that earlier I'm not sure was that when we were I think that was when I was trying to to get the get the div like for the service request form for that error message so I mean I wanted to use a class instead of an ID because it was going to be applied to multiple elements right because we were iterating over the data and putting in multiple elements so unless I'm unless I'm mistaken about what the what you were talking about with the ID I think a class would have been more appropriate there but maybe I'm misunderstanding okay cool so CF code or to actually put a a link to a site that's kind of an example of the image so let's see I'm checking out on my other screen here okay cool I'll bring this over on my screen to C so C F code or two was saying like to put kind of an image like in the background so yes I could see that yeah yeah I think about the one that we use a lot of things like this for our external sites that are more like marketing site usually focus that trying to get students interested in the university I haven't really done a lot with this kind of thing for internal sites because I kind of I just keep them like really like more more focused on you know here's what you need to do so they're not nearly as kind of flashy but okay yeah I'll think about it thanks for the for the example all right click on the shows page to see if cute coder says click on the shows page okay so are you thinking then maybe each section would have you know different things like this different color yeah I really like this I mean I agree normally so here's what I'm kind of what I'm kind of torn between right so like normally I would be more flashy with with my site if he like said if this was an external site if the audience was external but whenever we bring this up so like initially when I was designing this I was having a lot of meetings with people in my department one of the things that they really liked and wanted was the fact that immediately users see all the options and only the options and there's not a lot of scrolling involved basically the idea was this needs to be very user friendly and appeal to a lot of people the university that are older and really don't they don't use computers that much and there's actually a certain percentage of people the university that are very against using computers for a lot of things so the idea was basically like don't clutter don't do anything like just give them and initially we only actually had six options here so we didn't even have as I added these three for this one but the current version of it only has six so it's really like immediately here are the things you can do and that's it so I'm a little bit hesitant to the kind of change that so I agree that it would look nicer if we did something else more flashy but I'm kind of like it's almost like think of this as very like a utilitarian like a dashboard right if you go to like Google Analytics dashboard or something they don't have a lot of images and flashy things like they would have maybe if you go to like the Google store right where they're trying to sell you something Google Analytics like you're going there because you want this data and you want to see your options right so this is kind of what what we're going for here is like there's certain information that people need to go here we don't need to sell them on anything this is more of just a resource so anyway that's just kind of like a background as to what we're going for here and maybe kind of the reasoning for doing this so I am still gonna think about this and how I can incorporate it but I'm I mean at least like you could see kind of my reasoning as to why I'm more hesitant to do it like that the other reason to that I'm a little bit hesitant about images is once you get into that then you have to I have to actually think about what images I want in there and select the images and handle you know handle everything that goes in with images because if I did that I'd certainly want to have multiple image sizes to do you know responsive images and things like that so it does add a little bit more complexity to a project that you know really should be wrapping up and should go live probably next week it's not entirely up to me I need to get feedback from other people but assuming that I would get prompt feedback you know this needs this should go live soon anyway I think it's a good debate I kind of would want to hear what everyone else thinks about that yeah because like I said I haven't really I haven't really tried anything like that for this but yeah I don't know let me know what you all think I can't guarantee that I'll be able to go with you know your suggestions in that area even if I agree with it you know I still kind of have to since that would be a significant change to the look of this I still you know it would have to be approved by people higher up in my department as well but I guess I'm open I'm open to the idea okay Rohan says positioning and CSS is a nightmare yeah sure it's uh yeah sometimes it can definitely be it can be tricky let's see oh cool Alexander says thank you Jesse you're the man you're welcome CF kotor 2 says Jesse what's your contact info I'd like to chat offline later yeah my I have some of my info in the description so like Instagram Twitter if you go to my youtube channel which I think I have links as well in the description if not it's just I think I for sure I have a link in my Twitter a description I also have linked up some of my other social media so if you want to get a hold of me through through whatever social media channel you like best that's cool just you know send me a message Oh John Henson says if you use a background image you would need to prefetch and store it in cash not sure how create react app uses serviceworkers to make that efficient yeah actually I'm not sure either I haven't done a lot with with images and create react app I say did do the first project I did for the nanodegree had images as well maybe I'll have to take a look at that and see how how about was done but that's a good point I hadn't really thought of that uhhuh okay John Hanson says in regard to the images I guess says I get older we usually need simple straightforward mike says I bet I am the best coder in here that's entirely possible Mike I've never really seen your coat or your work but you know that's it's definitely fault I don't think it would take that much to be a better coder than I am so I'm not gonna argue with you there but we do have some really knowledgeable people in here in the chat so definitely have some competition for best coder oh cool all right so CF coder to found the my Twitter and sent me some some tweets they're so awesome well take a look at those and get back to you soon as I can mike is saying I might give even give you some lessons sometimes you just have to go if your passion yeah Mike certainly if you ever have any advice and you want to put it in the live chat it's definitely appreciated okay Rolo I mentioned earlier that CSS positioning can be tricky sometimes and John Hanson says positioning is a charm with CSS grid all browsers will be on board except internet explorer by January 2018 that's awesome off to check into that I haven't really done much at all with CSS grid so if it's going to be supported with browsers then that's that's great all right cool Steve asks how much would it cost to have this site developed hmm I don't know I haven't really thought about how much I would charge for for this site I guess I could give you like a ballpark figure I suppose I don't know maybe like if I were going to do something like this for a client also like including like server setup and everything like that SSL like I don't know maybe probably the lowest I would go is I don't know it's tough to say on the spot but maybe like I don't know somewhere between 5,000 and 15,000 I know that's a big range but I have to really think about it more it's hard to say though because this is not really a normal site like so many decisions were already made ahead of time the content was already there so things were already set up like some of the accounts were set up like the SendGrid api stuff so I don't know so I guess this project seems somewhat easier than it would have been if I was starting from scratch and had to make a lot of these decisions that were already made so that's why I have such a big range cuz I'm not I'm not exactly sure what this would be like let's see so anyway I don't know I'd be good to see what you all think that you would charge for something like this or that you would pay for something like this it's always interesting to see like pricing opinions on pricing and also I'm not sure what it's like for different areas of the world so like right now I'm in the United States so in other countries or even other areas in the United States I guess pricing could could be a lot you know different chuna instances don't don't web developers make around $5 an hour when they charge $30 an hour are you are you saying that because projects in the community John I'm so what's what's up with that they comment are you saying that because projects end up always taking longer or what if it's hourly I guess it shouldn't matter right okay all right I've gotten to the bottom of the live chat so wow we've been going for almost two hours now so it's definitely definitely about that time to wrap things up I really appreciate everything oh we had a foreigner okay so DP solution says I think he didn't make preparation he is like a child speak for a while and then silent so I'm assuming this talking about me and you're you are right I I make no preparations for these videos so yeah and in terms of the speaking and in being silent like yeah that most of the time that's because I'm trying to read something what's going on the live chat so anyway yeah that's entirely right yeah these these streams are not I don't prepare for these the the point of these streams are to show what it's like for me as a frontend developer to do my daytoday work so I purposely want to keep in any mistakes I make I don't want it to be scripted or rehearsed because that wouldn't be an accurate representation of what I do so obviously I don't narrate what I'm doing doing my normal job but I I do want us to be somewhat helpful as well so that's why I try to narrate things but so that's why you know coming in if you know this is definitely not the place for a thorough tutorial and it's certainly not efficient you know since right we're doing this on the fly I make a lot of mistakes I stop for questions I do things so you know definitely a shorter more concise tutorial would be better if you don't have a lot of time but like I said this is not the point of this is not really like tutorial based it's more of I just had the idea that it might be good instead of saying pre rehearse videos which are awesome just to see somebody mess up sometimes and but still work through it and still produce you know produce something so yeah so anyway I try to I don't always remember to explain that when I do the streams but I try to do it you know when I remember because I imagine it could be somewhat confusing for new people watching to see like hey what the heck is this guy doing like he doesn't know what he's doing he's messing up so anyway that was I just kind of thought like I know when I started out at the beginning it was I loved watching the YouTube videos or these people that were amazing but it did somewhat make me feel like wow these people were like way better than me and they were better than me legitimately but it gives kind of a false impression that like I was making way more mistakes than I should when in reality I think at least for me I make mistakes right I I produce websites that work that fulfill you know the requirements of my clients of where I work so I am employed fulltime as a frontend developer so I mean I'm I'm getting work done and I'm producing work that I'm proud of but I still make a lot of mistakes and I have to learn as I'm going so I just kind of wanted people to see like that and kind of see how I need to struggle through things and I was kind of hoping it would give new people some hope that like you know that everybody's just kind of struggling and learning as they go so anyway that was that was kind of purpose so hopefully that kind of explains why it does you know it does really seem like this is just kind of me winging it sometimes because that's that's the point so I didn't get a few more messages while I was while I was talking so let me just read through these make sure there's no questions that I need to answer before I end things okay bill well says thanks for all the effort Jessie oh you're welcome today I have one question should I just watch your videos or would it be useful if I code alongside you two I've never really thought about coding alongside I would say it definitely depends on what you want to get out of the videos and what type of learner you are some people do really well with just watching other people have the ability to do multiple things and still pick things up so if you know like that that handson type of thing is better for you then go ahead I know there are some people that do other work and just kind of listen to me in the background and then occasionally like they'll they'll come over and contribute in the live chat so I guess I don't really have that I don't really think there's like one way that's best to watch these these videos you know I've found you know people do it differently some people don't even watch the live streams often and they watch the recording on like two times speed and that's better for them so sorry I can't really give you a definite answer on that just some ideas for how other people have told me that they do it okay Rohan says I personally have the stream going on in the background while I browse through the interwebs projects here targeted to practice alongside yeah for sure that's that's a good point yeah sometimes it might be difficult to go alongside to code alongside also because I work on this in between streams it might sometimes be hard to catch up I do try to keep the github repo as uptodate as possible so potentially you could pull in all the changes at the beginning of each show and be right right there so it would be possible I think to code alongside but for me I would probably have trouble doing it personally but you know that that might just be my you know kind of my style of how I learned enable am able to do things but it might work well for you I don't know okay now I'm for real this time to the bottom of the live chat I've read through everything I think I think I've gotten to all the all the questions if I miss your question I'm sorry about that you can ask it again in another live chat or put in the comment to the videos send me a message on social media somewhere and I'll try to get to it when I can I will I'm gonna try to stream tomorrow my schedule tomorrow is really filled up I have meetings in the morning I have a doctor's appointment in the afternoon it's going to be tough to find a time to get into stream but if I am going to stream tomorrow I'll schedule the stream sometime tomorrow morning I'll post on Twitter when I'm gonna stream so if you don't see anything on Twitter or any notifications come up for from the free coke and YouTube channel then I'm probably you know not gonna be able to stream it I really just am not sure how long my appointments gonna take so I don't know whether I'll have time to to come back and stream after that I had hoped to be able to stream in the morning tomorrow but then I am now required to go to a very long meeting tomorrow that I didn't think I'd have to go to so and I just found out about that yesterday yeah so I think in case I don't get to stream tomorrow I have a wonderful weekend everyone should be back same time on Monday in any case no matter what happens tomorrow thank you so much for for watching for contributing in the live chat you know for all your your your help and your opinions going through this I it really helps it makes the end product just so much better so so I guess in until until tomorrow or maybe Monday have a have a great day
