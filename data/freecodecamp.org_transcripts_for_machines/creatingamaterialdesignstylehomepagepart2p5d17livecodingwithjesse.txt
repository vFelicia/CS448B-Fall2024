hey everybody is Jessie and welcome to live coding with Jessie today we're gonna continue on with what we were doing yesterday which was making a homepage using material design so we got our our buttons sorted out yesterday I think we got our bunch sorted out I just looked at it on my other screen here and they don't look right anymore he'll be on all right I'm on a different branch alright so I have my node member hat on today so you kind of see the node member on there so it's cold and today we get to dress down and my coworkers are trying to peek in on the last string we got to dress down today so I got to wear normally I have to wear dress clothes but I got to wear jeans my November hoodie so I haven't gotten to show off any of this gear on the stream so I figured I would today rights all right so let's get started I let me switch to y'all can see the screen okay so yesterday we got these buttons in here and they will keep this configuration no matter what the screen sizes and their narrow enough that they will fit on small screens even on the narrowest of phones the only thing I was thinking of with this and I'm not worrying about it right now cuz we're just gonna try to lay out a potential you know homepage to show my boss we might actually they have more than one will just I will probably just do it on different branches but I'm thinking maybe on a larger screen these buttons could be larger and then we'll use some media queries to scale them down on small screens we also put in this events section within this card and right now you know it's really basic I think this is enough just to kind of get the concept that we could put a list here it could be events it could be news whatever we wanted to put there now I'd like to fill in this using kind of like a masonry grid style and just throw in some different types of content just maybe some stock photos some areas for text some areas for video just so we have a nice visual what could happen with this homepage and I don't think we'll get this done today but if we do get that done today then maybe we'll move on and I'd like to do maybe a more traditional homepage that would be kind of linear and tell a story so you know would you'd still the hope here a section would be the same but then you may have just some full width sections that would explain what's so great about Franciscan University why would you want to come and finish up with another calltoaction at the bottom I think those will be two good points to start from and then I think we can get some feedback and you know we rework it we'll probably come back to this page several times over the next month or so and work on some interior pages as well but we'll go through a couple cycles of you know trying some stuff out getting feedback and then making some adjustments getting more feedback so enough talk let's start out this Pomodoro timer and I started doing some code now if you're not familiar with Pomodoro timer this is a way to break up your work and I like to use it when I'm working throughout the day but it's also nice on the stream because it reminds me to quit coding and check out the live chat and answer any questions that there may be in there so that's what I'm gonna do if you ask a question in the live chat during the 25 minute session please be patient and I will get to your question whenever the 25 minute period is over we'll do a break answer some questions do another 25 minute session so I'm hoping to do two coding sessions today let's start the first one all right so yep this is our our code and right now we're using react and we're using next js' to kind of scaffold out our react app next j/s offers a serverside rendering without very much work on our part and then it offers us a routing system built in so anything in this pages folder will become its own route so the home page is indexed j/s but then the other pages are just you know what their names are here so we have we have a page called page we have a page called faculty all right so we're going to be working on just on the home page today so we're gonna scroll down normally you wouldn't want to hardcode things in your component like this this end is going to end up being a really big component once we're done with it but then what we'll do is once we're set on a design we'll go back and we'll actually break these down into other components and have it populated with data you know from an a database we'll pull it in with a graph QL API and then that way these will get a lot smaller we won't clutter them up with you know with a lot of you know text content right here in the component okay so I'd like to add let's see I think I'd like to break up this section here and two maybe two cars let's see how this looks breaking this up into two cards I don't want it to be too too small but at least on a large screen I think I would it would be okay to have it like that so let's try that first see all right so here's that first card and just has an image at the top so what we'll do is we'll just copy this now we're using material UI for a lot of our components because it uses that Google's material design if you're not familiar with react just think about using the bootstrap for a regular site material UI plays the same role for a react app as bootstrap plays for just a normal you know HTML site but in in this case it's following material design and this we need to make this alright that's good and then let's change these values so instead of we have a 12 column grid so if you give it a value of 12 that means it's full width if you give it a value of 6 that means it takes a path the width of the screen so we want it to take up 1/4 so we're gonna put in 3 so that each one of these takes up only 3 columns let's say that see what we get alright great so now we've lit this up into two cards on let's see what screen size we can get I'm gonna shrink this down just to get a more realistic screen size the screen that I have on right now that you can see is is pretty large 20 it's over 20 inches I don't remember how how much over 20 inches it is and it's also a 2k screen so it's not not everybody's gonna have a screen like this ok not bad I think we can definitely fit some content in here and it won't look you know too small let's see so I just checking out the live chat a bit hey everybody alright so let's throw in some text content in here and I don't have to think about what I want to put in here so let's remove this media and you know let's remove this card actions so I think what happen is when we originally put this in here I think the card content would have been the proper thing to use but it was overlaying over top of the image or something was happening so that's why we ended up born with this card actions normally you would actually have you know clickable actions in here so let's get rid of some of this yeah this just get rid of that and let's put in I believe it's card Connie has card content so if you're not familiar with what's going on here these components that we're using they don't come builtin with react these come from the material UI component library so we have to bring in material which we just added it through node package manager and we've import these components up the top you see we're bringing in these components for material UI and and I am using Visual Studio code as my editor if you've seen in previous videos you know that I I've used atom before so I'm still getting used to what I have here I was expecting a autocomplete for this for this tag I thought it would make the closing tag automatically but it didn't so to check my settings but a bit of the card content and then we'll want to do a typography typography tag and let's go with type and give it a type of let's give it a type of h3 just see what size it is and let's just say it's a 99% graduates I was super awesome alright so that is definitely going to draw students in let's see how that looks wow that's really small I can't believe h3 is that small maybe that's not even a real type I guess we'll try an h2 and see I hate to use age tags unless they're actually headings hmm all right something's wrong let's look up typography in the material UI documentation may be under style yep typography okay if you want to follow along and check out the documentation be sure to get the documentation for the latest version so for the beta version so the URL is material UI next calm okay check out the API hmm okay you can't put an H you could put in display that's weird for some reason I thought you could put in a stag's maybe my memory is just terrible or maybe this changed at some point all right well now we definitely need to switch things up a bit so let's see what we want let's try display two there we go all right not bad just to show and we're gonna have to be hmm here's where we're gonna have to be careful and we'll be able to see it when I add some more cards in but I want to make sure that these gaps get filled in so we wouldn't have the next row all starting here and then a big gap here and I also don't want this card just to fill up the space and have a lot of white space here so let's see what happens when we do this with this current grid system we're using if we don't get what we want we're gonna have to try something different but I do have some ideas so I think I have at least two ideas one of them I know has worked for me before on previous sites so we'll try them up okay and I know that I see there's some questions in the live chat I'm gonna go over all the questions in about 13 minutes so whenever this timer is is done I'm gonna get all the questions so just please be patient and I'll do my best to answer everything all right so let's just add in some more cards I really want to see how these stack and the easiest way to do this is just going to be to throw in some more items so first thing I'm going to try to do is still like this within the same container I'm not sure exactly if this will work or novelist's try it out okay so doing it this way you see we have the problem that I thought we would have let's go to the documentation and see if there's already a builtin way to solve this okay I'm sorry I just glanced there michael says can't follow along as usual at the hospital getting my biweekly phlebotomy for a blood issue I hope everything's okay with your your health issues Michael so I didn't realize that you had that so I hope it's not really serious always like talking with you here on the live chat so anyway if doing the stream at this time conflicts regularly with your appointments let me know and maybe eggs try to do it a different time because I'd hate for you to have to miss okay where we at grid area okay so we're we're checking out the grid here online content interface between his face around the foolish well alright let's check out the demos I don't not worry about that all right I don't think there's anything covering that stretch centers my staff listens I'm a maybe align content or align items would work but I don't know I'm I'm a little skeptical that this would do anything all right so I'm gonna go to my next options right so I have two ideas one idea we've used before previous projects and that's to bring in masonry layout package that'll handle all this for us and we'll position things using javascript I'd rather not do that if we don't have to but we might have to my other idea and we saw this yesterday briefly it just kind of caught my eye so I thought why not try is to use or is it I don't remember what it was called so I'm I have to go through this list it was a great list you know what I don't want to go through the API I want the demos component demos I think this was it I think it was the grid list let me see if this is actually giving us what we want you know it's so far I'm just seeing I'm seeing everything in the same height in each row so the still isn't really solving the issue so let me check and check the source okay there they're mapping over this all right so I'm going to I'm gonna adjust the height okay yeah this is pretty much what I thought let's adjust see if there's anything happens yeah so this isn't gonna help us either we still have these gaps okay I don't think there's anything builtin to material UI I'm going to go through this list quickly just to see if there's something that maybe I'm missing here yeah I'm I'm not seeing anything okay so we're still gonna be able to use the grid the grid elements most likely but we're gonna add in package it's going to use a little bit of JavaScript to position each one of these cards and the position will update if the screen width changes and that way we're always going to have we're going to make use of all our space we're not gonna have these big gaps trying to think where did we use this we did use this on on the project actually let me let me see if it bullets I don't know if I actually made this site now I didn't I think I just have the site locally I don't I don't have a live version of it but we did this on the bulletin site so that'll probably be the best thing to look at to figure out how we're gonna do this so let's check out github and I'll make my font size a bit bigger wow I just got a bunch of emails my work email alright it looks like nothing is important here we go bulletin react so I'm going to that FUS mark home bulletin react repository and let's check out a source and it's our views probably homework it's been a while since I've looked at this repo grid renderer okay so you got to find rid renderer cojones there we go let's open up grid view and list our grid render and grid view to try to see what's going on and let's see okay all right I see it looks like what we had done here was we imported some CSS from another library so not material UI I think we imported some of the classes from materialized CSS which is basically just like bootstrap accepted as material design styles so I'd rather not import this if we don't have to certainly not gonna import the whole thing I mean I maybe would pull little pieces of it if we need it but it seems like yeah this is something we could definitely do alright and let me check this one out as well grid renderer okay this is just switching us between the different views so we have in this particular project we had a toggle well actually is more than at all you could you could toggle grid view or list view but then you could also go to a print view if you wanted to it's not going to be that complicated for us we're gonna have one view I mean we could certainly have more than one if we wanted but let's just start off with one okay I'm gonna pull this over onto my other screen to make it easier for me to reference it and then let's pull up our code on this screen and let's make sure let's double check that this repo that we are using is uptodate react react nation tree component check to make sure it's up to date they haven't had any braking changes or anything that we need to be aware of so we can go to the releases and see their last release was up 20 second let me think I think that we we worked on this project the bulletin project around or after that time so there shouldn't be changes we could always verify by looking at the package.json and our project so we'll bring back that repo here check out the package.json and see react nation component sixpoint 0.1 yeah so we'll have the same versions which is good so we won't we should be able to do this the same way and a reward and yep that makes me components all right so my timer is about up I'd say the last thing we could do is yarn add react masonry components and we'll let that install while I go back to the live chat I'm going to take a short break and scroll up and try to answer all your questions all right Dimitri yes where I got the the grid where I import the grid from its hero UI so let's check that out where you import so I had to do like an NPM install of material UI so I have already done it so I'm not going to do it again but you if you're using NPM I think what would be NPM it's it install save so how you do it it's been so long since I just used NPM but co UI or what I usually do is I use yarn so I do the yarn add material UI that will bring that into your project and then you can do the imports and you can use material UI so check out the material UI github repo or their website and it'll walk you through how to import that into your project and use it and this is for react only that you want to use those components so if you're not doing a react project that's this is not what you want to use if you'd like to use material design and a non react project try out materialized CSS and I think that's I think it's materialized calm and mature as a materialized CSS calm it's worth looking up yeah materialized CSS calm that's what you want to use for you know like a non reacts ight you know plain HTML site it's basically any site that you normally want to use bootstrap for you can replace bootstrap with materialise and it'll give you the same stuff just in material design style Patrick's is one percent of graduates are super lame yeah I didn't really think that one through but I guess that that's they could just be regular awesome they don't have to be lame so it's 99% of graduates are super awesome and yeah let's change that up right now because I could see that could be problematic how's that see then there's no negative connotation everybody's some type of awesome the hopeless Brit says might be a silly question but do web developers working in offices have an open mind about people who think out loud when programming I guess it shouldn't matter if people have earphones in I actually can hear it so I have my own office so I don't have other people working right next to me so it's not really a problem but I can hear the person in the office next to me I can hear them on the other side of my wall talking sometimes but only if I don't have my headphones on so you're right I wear headphones all the time when I'm working I always have music going so noise doesn't bother me if I happen to not have headphones on for some reason I can hear noise it's usually not a problem for me there's a classroom right on this side of my office and I can hear the professor's lecturing in their classroom depending on who the professor is I can hear them and that can be somewhat distracting if I don't have my headphones on but I would say I mean if if you're the type of person that needs to talk things out out loud then if you can at all like stay away from the other people you know get a little bit farther away from that probably best just to be respectful I guess you can't make them wear headphones so huh I don't know how I'd handle that luckily I don't have to deal with that I'm not sure how I would handle that one yeah it doesn't bother me personally because I can always wear the headphones I'm gonna go back to the coding here in just a second I wanted to make sure I made a note of where I'm leaving off 19 okay so the last comment that I got to a live chat is from a beam of sis I don't know how but I'm in love with material design all right well this is this is the stream for you because we material design everything here all right so the rest of the questions I'm going to get to after this next coding session if you can't stick around to hear the answer then check out the recording of this stream later on when you have a chance and I'll answer all the questions towards the end of the the stream all right what were you doing okay I just installed the masonry layout great so let's bring in masonry and like I mentioned at the beginning the stream but I think it's worth mentioning again I wouldn't keep this component as it is now in this state I would definitely refactor this and remove as much of this as I could into separate components so just for now when we're messing around I don't think it's worth it to make all these different components because we may not even keep half of them you know for the finished product but eventually this will need to be refactored it would just be a mess to come in here and try to figure out what's going on if we left it like this also we are going to be able to reuse a lot of these components and other places in the site so right we can't reuse them if they only exist in here all right so we got masonry in here now now let's try to do something with it so let's wrap that was a really hard piece out I just made those weird let's wrap our components in this masonry hmm let's see what happens if I change this grid to masonry I'm not really expecting this to work but if it does it'll be pretty awesome and quick so it's always worth a shot then I wrap the wrong thing in here I did all right let's try it again I didn't mean to wrap that part and it this is what I wanted to wrap in in masonry and I need to get rid of container and all the way down here Mason all right well that's something right let's see probably let's see i flex Thanks I think our we're gonna we're not going to be able to use grid okay just rook just says in the live chat that for the new newest versions of NPM you don't need to use the save flag anymore you can just NPM I and then the package name alright cool that's that's a lot shorter so I mean I mentioned earlier a much longer way to do it it's unnecessary so you could just do NPM I and then with your UI or whatever package you have thanks for that rook I'm behind the times on on NPM that is much easier all right so let's change these let's change all this grid stuff because the the CSS that's going along with all this these grid components is conflicting with what we're trying to do in masonry so let's for now just change these all to divs all right so they're all going to be divs I don't think it's going to work we're gonna have to add some other classes to that all right let's all right so for everything where we have the three let's just say hmm now I understand why we added in the materialized classes last time I'd hoped we wouldn't need to do that but we probably will so let's go with style with 25% we have a 25% with for that one and then for the ones that are six oh why don't we have another six yeah three three six we should have another six do we not add another one I guess we didn't okay so only have one that's small six and for this one we're going to change it to be 50% we're not going to keep things like this this is just to test it out if this works we'll change these into classes so just to test we're kind of making our own little grid system here our little column system I said probably won't stay like this once mmm let me see what the styles aren't here I gotta be missing something okay I'm checking out how we implemented this in the previous project just to see if I'm missing something hmm I think we're missing anything let's see we had our masonry layout up didn't we their react nation tree component let's take a look at their documentation just look at that basic usage mystery options you let me check I think we're using the Maestri component right I think the problem is our containers this a little bit better let's try this so we we had a display flex on our hero cards which this is not really a great name for these now at one time they were gonna peak up into the hero section let's try to use this without display there we go all right better much better there we go okay all right so you can see how this is supposed to work obviously we need to set our our gutter right our space between which we haven't done but aside from the awkwardness of that you can see we're not wasting space right if we had more cards you would see it would really not be wasting a lot of space we we didn't add in anything for smaller strains but this would of course everything would go full width and for a smaller screen but this is what I wanted this kind of fluid grid system that automatically adjusts it doesn't take up space all right not bad would rather not have have to do this in a totally different way let me think just wondering if I could read implement our grid and just adjust the CSS for the container and if that would work I think it's worth a shot it's not like I did that much work that it would be hard to to get it back so I'm just gonna hit the back button a bit bring our grid back and then take these out see what happens okay not not super terrible actually so if we can just figure out what's making this so thin we might be able to continue to use our grid which is nice that means we don't have to come up with our own our own system our own column system or we don't have to import it from materialize all right so let's check out this is the container div and I can bring dev tools over for this so we're checking out that container div that definitely needs to be bigger or else you all can't see it let's switch this around a bit to move this over and stretch this out there we go alright so this is a container you can see it's getting this positionabsolute the exact positioning from the JavaScript which is what we wanted let's see I'm gonna go through so removing that doesn't really do anything let's see there's anything in here that looks like it might mess things up no nothing there just doublecheck yeah if we took out everything we needed there okay okay so if we switch from using having it say max with 25% and instead have with 25% then that works a lot better mmm so I guess now the question is is it worth it to go in and switch these classes up or should we bring in our own system so much time we have before we tackle at eight minutes let's we don't really have to change anything in here we just need to add with oh okay John Hansen I just saw your comment about the image with that makes sense so notice this was only happening on images so let's take this back to max with so the text was fine the events are the events are okay they do look different than they did before but this actually isn't yeah let's see if we can do this so we want the interior of not of that one this one hmm the card width is set to a hundred percent interesting let's see all right so we're actually not getting hmm yeah Joanne you caught that they're using a CSS background image yeah so that's kind of not that's not obvious from the way it looks in the code right let's show where the code is yeah so you have this card media and you put an image and Atari right it looks like this should convert it to an image tag but it's not it's a background image so I mean that's fine there's nothing wrong with that but it is gonna make we just have to make a decision really about what we're gonna do with these with these cards how we're gonna handle this this issue here I guess we could make John Hanson says you need to have the elements in each flex div stretch all right so what's the as it flex I'm not good enough with flexbox to know what the command is where you put stretch on flex start so is it flex flex basis flex direction I can look it up but I figured John if you knew offhand it might be faster yeah definitely not not basis I just saw it somewhere where did I have it at I was just thinking I just saw it in the documentation for material you I it was in the it was in the API for grid I think no not grid list do they not have an API grid align items okay we're justify content yep that's it that's what I just I just remember I saw it there you had it first that John thank you all right let's see flex yeah let's go million item stretch all right not that one let's try I might be putting it on the wrong thing one time stretch let's try putting it on a different or something here nope hi this one nope okay alright so that's not working hi there I'm I may be doing it wrong but I think now we're back to we're not going to be able to use grid unless we make our own classes let's see you need to see what direction first row or column hmm let's see or what we have now that's for index e we don't have a container anymore that's setting it if we did it it was said it column don't know if we have our overall container still as is using flex yeah all right well my timer is up so I guess I'll work on this work on this for a little bit today maybe or tomorrow morning and so maybe before tomorrow a stream I'll have I'll have this working I'm not sure what the best solution will be at this point but I'll either create some of my own classes to handle the width issue or and continue using it with the the grid elements or I will just import the column classes from materialize and bring them in and use them just like we did in that bulletin project if we do it just like the bulletin project that does have the benefit of being able to just really reuse you know code between the two projects which is nice I'm also way more familiar with materialized column classes than I am with the material you eye classes for grid and all the options they have so we'll see it'll be one of those all right so let me scroll up now to where I left off in the live chat and I'm gonna go through an answer everything that's in the live chat now if you have a question please put it in the chat now when I get through everything that'll be the end of the stream let's see koukun and Angie says Sweden says hello hello Sweden thanks for watching novena why can't we use polymer for material designs you can use polymer in a lot of cases I'm not sure where we're at as far as being able to use polymer components in react I'm sure it's either been done or there's somebody working on it some sort of you know library to be able to use that but I just haven't tried it so I I mean I'd be open to trying it probably not on this project because we you know we have a tight deadline so I don't want to have to learn something new if I can help it for this project but maybe for a future project we'll have to find it I said I'm not aware exactly if of anybody doing that right now but I'm sure somebody is doing it ah hey sin sins s YNS says hey how do you make your github look like that yes so I'm using the dark theme for github so you have to download tampermonkey if you're on Chrome I believe Firefox has an equivalent I don't know if it's called tampermonkey or something else and then you need to get the github dark script so if you type in github dark it should come up in the search and it'll have directions for how to make that work then you get this theme and you also get more options so you get all these github dark settings to change things and you know I have this theme on but there's lots of different themes that I could be using so anyway it's pretty cool I always like the dark themes better I think it's easier on the eyes but that's how I get my github it look like that journeys wait ah all right so w ey ir a waiver way uh sorry I want to pronounce that right so let me know I'm probably pronouncing it wrong let me know how it should be pronounced and I'll do my best to remember and pronounce it right but anyway they say I joined today and would love to do all five projects how do I find it okay I don't I have every project in its own playlist yet some of them have their own playlist but the live coding with Jessie playlist on this channel the free code camp channel on YouTube has all the projects in order if you go back to the first video that's project one and you go through right now the titles will tell you what project it is I think for project one I don't actually say it's project one but for all the projects after that I have it right in the title so it'll say like P two and then D like five for your like project to day five so right now that's like the one big playlist as everything I'm going to continue to break things out as well in the separate playlist to make it easier to follow along and I'm glad you join welcome I'm I'm mission says how long did it take you to learn graph QL I I don't know I mean I kind of I learned it on the stream with you also I've only been streaming for like eight months something like that maybe nine months so less than nine months for sure and probably way less than nine months so I don't I don't know graph QL like I'm no expert at graph QL I know enough to definitely use graph QL you know in terms of from the client side of getting things from graph QL in terms of setting things up servers I'm I don't really know that much about it so I haven't created my own graphic you of API from scratch or anything yet I imagine probably end up doing it at some point but to be able to learn how to get data from a graph QL API that's that's pretty easy especially if you already understand how API is work like a REST API it's not really that hard to make a jump to graph QL and if you're using some sort of helper library like if you're using Apollo you know it makes it really easy so if you want to get into graph QL I'd say like client side it shouldn't take too long at all server side I don't really know because I haven't gotten into that yet guru Tegh says why don't you try material design bootstrap you know what actually I I haven't checked on that in quite a while to see if that was good I remember you know several years ago when I was trying to decide on a material design you know framework to use I didn't like it as much as materialize I don't know where that projects at now although maybe it's better now I just don't know let's see Robert asks is it better to use materializer bootstrap I I don't I think it depends on what kind of look you want if you're trying to go for a material design look you're gonna it's going to be easier for you to use materialize you could certainly use bootstrap and then just adjust it you know I I wouldn't adjust it directly but I maybe like add you know a theme on the of your own on to use in addition to bootstrap then you could make it look like the tier design but why you know I don't really see the point in spending all that time trying to turn bootstrap into something else so it just depends on the look if I didn't want a material design look if I didn't if it didn't matter whether or not I had a material design look maybe I'd go to bootstrap because more people use it so the odds of you know the testing is better right there's just way more people using it reporting errors and things like that more people working on it it would take me a little while to get used to the bootstrap way of doing things because I have much more experience with materialised I have build things with bootstrap before but you know with materialised I remember a lot of the classes without having to look them up with bootstrap I don't so for me I would probably go with materialise just because of that but if I was starting from scratch I'd go with if you want material design use materialized otherwise build a bootstrap that'd be my recommendation kaathal says only came in now what is masonry used for so the masonry the concept of a masonry grid is I mean it's pretty basically just this isn't a good example and it's all messed up now but basically you just have all these different you know elements with different shapes different sizes right different widths and Heights and they all fit together with the same amount of space in between with the same gutter and as you change the window width they all adjust so that you don't have this weird space in between that's what I mean when I'm talking about masonry and so we actually use this masonry component there it is react masonry component and what this does is it takes the masonry package that was made for up by I think it's like dis saundra or something like that trying to make one of the other thing so masonry use the free version there's another package JavaScript plugin called isotope this is a paid version and it basically handles this masonry layout some sorting and things like that but it's just a regular you know JavaScript plugin this is a component that takes that and you know it actually uses that code but it makes it into a react component so it makes it a lot easier to use with with react so that's how we're using you know masonry in our project and this is the best masonry layout library this one here that I've seen I wonder if there's a link I'm actually surprised that there's not a link to the original the original site hmm if you look up masonry or isotope as you know like a JavaScript plugin you should find it and you'll see more demos and it kind of like what it could do here we go there's a link to dis Andros page so here it is this is the masonry grid layout so you can use it with jQuery without jQuery and the regular version but then if you want to use it with materialise I recommend using the the component that that we were just looking at just makes it a whole lot easier I believe we tried to do it with this on one project and it wasn't impossible to do but it was definitely more difficult I look says anyone here heard of em you URI Murray grid system does say miss thing as masonry only saw a live demo I've never heard of it I've never used it so I might be cool to check out you know see if it's if it's better than masonry I mean it seems like masonry is kept up to date I mean there's some updates from five days ago that's pretty cool yeah so maybe it's kept up to date but has been around for quite a while there might be something new or out there that does a better job maybe more lightweight Edwin says you robbed bro thanks for the for constant the constant motivation you're welcome I'm glad I can give you some some motivation here I actually had trouble getting motivated coming back from the holiday break there I thought about making a video about how I ended up getting myself motivated to help out so we'll see maybe I'll make one but this stream always motivates me so if I can help motivate you all I'm really happy about that then a yak says background size cover or 100% for the image maybe yeah let's try that out where's our here backgrounds cover about mmm nope good suggestion though Oh sin says they see the dark theme for github with stylish not same alright let's check out that dark theme then let's see I think this is what I use yeah this is this is what I use yeah so basically what you want to do is I think I used the userscript addon it's yeah so I did the chrome install with tampermonkey so evidently there's a lot of different ways to use this so I already had tampermonkey installed that's why I did it this way if you don't have tampermonkey installed it looks like you can get you can get addons you know for other things so one of these ways should work the way I use was to add the script directly into tampermonkey beyond ad IO and any I'm pretty sure it's Dion right I think we may have talked about this before correct me if it's not if it's not pronounced that way Dion says bootstrap is more flexible materialized as more rigid to custom changes I definitely agree that's actually that's a really good answer so we were talking about whether or not to use materialized bootstrap that's a really good point bootstrap is more like designed neutral and meant to be changed but you realize it has a purpose of being material design style so it's it definitely is not as open to being adjusted so yeah I definitely agree so that's if you want material design go with it but if you don't care about material design bootstrap is definitely the way to go you'll have an easier time of creating your own style thanks for that deal and that was a really good point ketosis thanks for the thorough explanation on masonry you're welcome I hope that was helping for you let's see ok sin says yeah I use it with stylish and that works but it's not the same as yours that's interesting I wonder why it's possible mine's different because I have an older version I am an older version that's not been updated awhile co2 4 oops oh yeah I think I may be pretty behind in terms of versions whoops where'd I find that 120 I don't know actually is this the CSS version you know I'm not that far behind that's weird does it autoupdate then anyway I have no idea why mine looks different okay since ed I installed the tampermonkey one and it seems way better than the others okay cool I had never tried any other ones so I just lucked out then and got the good one right off the bat okay and it is the same cool yeah I did tell you truth I didn't even realize there were other ways to use it it's I sold it a while ago and I haven't looked at the documentation since then I haven't really tried out any options it might be cool to you mess with those at some point all right so I've got through the live chat and Wow my slack for work has a lot of messages and so does my email so now is a great time to wrap things up and see what's going on before I before I head out I actually have to leave work early because my car won't start so cold my car won't start so my wife's car is a lot newer and it is starting up so she has to pick me up from work and so she needs to pick me up earlier than normal so I need to quit talking and get ready and leave but thank you all so much for watching and for helping out in the live chat and thanks for all the questions I love it when there's a lot of questions gives me something to talk about and it's cool I like whenever we can help each other out I should be back tomorrow's Taurus Friday already Wow this week went so fast so anyway I should be back tomorrow around the same time I'm gonna try to do the streams closer to one o'clock now I used to always aim for two o'clock but I really want to do it earlier for everybody over and and in that area in that time zone because you know I don't want to keep you all up really late and I know there's a lot of viewers from that from that area of the world so plan on being around 100 100 p.m. Eastern Time I'll do my best to to keep it around that time and hopefully tomorrow I have some of this sorted out some of this masonry stuff sorted out and we'll have something a little bit nicer to look at but until then thanks again and have a great day
