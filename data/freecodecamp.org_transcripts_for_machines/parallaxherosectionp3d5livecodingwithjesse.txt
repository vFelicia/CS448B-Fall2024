hey everybody welcome to live coding with Jessie and today we're gonna do a hero section I I think this will be probably easier than the the side nav for sure mainly because we don't need to import anything from the content management system so we just need to bring in what we've done on the the demo site so let me show you in case you haven't seen that so we're gonna bring this section in and just a little you know little parallax effect not really a big deal I don't think the text that's that's here or the link here is gonna change very often so this is fine if we just hard code this and also the image for now I'm just gonna hard code I'm not sure how often will want this to change but for now I don't know maybe I'll use the same stock stock image or or a random image figure that out when we get there so the only thing that I've really worked on since the last time was putting this logo in it needs some prices some padding at the top on the bottom I just got this in just a few minutes ago so I haven't really worked on it but yeah it's not not bad a little bit different than the original because we we got a new web logo but it's not bad hey everybody get some people in the live chat now let's see okay a head heavy on says I want to learn C++ yeah I am I don't know much C++ so we're gonna work with it a little bit but not really not really an expert but we do have someone that's frequently on the live chat that's putting together some tutorial videos for C++ so I don't know if I'm Berto is it's in the live chat today or it's watching but Umberto if if you're watching maybe you could give some info about your YouTube stuff and I can't remember if you had some stuff up already or if you're still working on it but anyway let us know if you're here otherwise when Alberto is ready I'll definitely throw a link to his his videos up here so because I'd like to watch them too and so I could figure out a little bit more what's going on with this Aramis site we're working on csharp that's what I have my mistake eze e on said C++ we're working csharp so in Umberto's working on csharp so my apologies for that the camera froze already Wow we had so much luck with it on Friday it didn't freeze at all so I don't know I haven't done anything different it just freezes some days and other days it doesn't I said before I was going to try to work on using my camera as a as a webcam like our upside my phone camera as a webcam and I looked it up but there's not it would be a lot easier if I had Linux but on on a Mac it was a little difficult like there's an easy way to do it with some programs on Windows and there's a really easy way to do it on Linux but on a Mac it's not so easy so some stuck with this the builtin camera that freezes alright let's get started hey Kevin's in the live chat I haven't seen Kevin in a while how's it going alright so I think the first thing we'll need to do is work on this container so if you see we have a container div and so we actually have several content container divs going on here so it's a little bit a little bit complex I think there there are more divs than necessary on this page so we'll see if we can cut them down that that might be good just simplify things but this first div you can see it wraps everything and then it has margins on the side because it has a max width of 1280 pixels and then it's setting you know margin0 auto so it's centered so what we want to do is I think what the best thing will be is if we just completely remove whatever styles are on that and then we just use the layout from materialise going forward I think my original intention was just to do a minimal amount to the home page and try not to affect a lot of the other components going on but now I think I think we're just gonna have to change a lot of stuff I don't know that it'll work it'll be get really complicated to try to have a lot of a lot of different things going on try to cancel it all out so my plan right now is to just get rid of a lot of what was already going on on this site so a lot of this stuff and the styles that went along with this and then just rethink okay what do we really need on this page and you know where are we gonna put it and then build it out with materialized and that's if you're not familiar with that it's it's like bootstrap it's a CSS framework except it's material design and yeah I mean I think that would be that would be better right I mean if we're gonna if we're gonna redo this like let's let's redo it and as far as the interior pages go there are quite a few interior pages but they all follow like a certain pattern so you know for each academic department they all have their own page but they're all the same template and a lot of templates get reused for multiple things so I think it won't be quite as hard as I thought I remember last week I was talking about trying to just make our CSS selectors very specific so we won't mess other things up but but I don't know III think it would be better if we don't worry about that and go through I really think we got a shot at redesigning you know a good bit of this and if they're conflict if things look weird then free wife Gantt refers again Wow and it was like in the same position that my face was in the same spot so anyway enough talking about it but that's kind of my thought on it this this week I'm thinking a little differently I don't know maybe after we dig into it a I'll change my mind again but for right now I guess I'm feeling ambitious about this this project okay so first things first let's find that container div and and you by the way you can check this out as I'm updating it it's franciscan dot edu slash home test all all together home test the code as of right now is not publicly available on github hopefully I can get it publicly available at some point okay so it's not here it's not here it's in the main I really wish the file structure was a bit more organized here I didn't really have a choice about that this was all made before I even started working here master faders there it is see this is to the play that's frustrating so we have a master pages folder within the site folder that has main mastered CS and main master but that's not really the one that you edit to get anything done there's a master pages folder that's a sibling folder of the site folder that has the same files in it and those are the ones that really do something when you edit them so but there are other files in the site folder that seemingly do stuff when you edit them so it's I don't and I have not figured out the logic of this yet completely but I think what we want is here and we want to format this as HTML it's amazing how much you rely on you know just something simple like the you know the different colors in in the code editor trying to go I know if I try to go and have to edit something where I don't have the highlighting it's it's difficult you know not impossible but you know your eyes just get used to certain way that things are and it's hard to to pick things out of the code without it okay yeah I think this is what we want and we should have the main there we go this is the div that I think we want to turn into our main div in terms of materialized so let's make sure okay so we have body form which we need the form okay so the first div after that great so this is header its ends up being our header div and then this will be main so that's that's awesome that's what you want so what I'm gonna do and we'll see how much this messes things up but I'm gonna change it let me find out where that closing div tag is first body form it should be this one let's double check I'm hoping it'll highlight up here it did not maybe it's not that one do they have the footer as okay I think they have the footer as with being within the main I'll have to double check but I think in materialise you put the footer outside of the main div so we're not to the footer yet that'll probably be the next video that we do assuming we get the hero section done today or if I finish it in the morning tomorrow but I think that this is probably our div that we're looking for so let's change this to main and I went too far and then let's take all this out and change it to main if it's just CSS that was happening with those tags then we should be fine if there was some JavaScript that was trying to reference those classes then we may get some errors but it's worth a shot see if we could get it to work so let's refresh see what we have I have dev tools open on the other screen and there there are no errors in the console and look at that so this was actually best case scenario in my mind so automatically the styles that were make making that a find max width of 1280 pixels are gone and we can see now let me find my main here okay so the main is taking up the full page which is awesome it does have we will have to adjust it a bit you can see it's kind of going up under the that the header so I'm not worried about right now we have no content but I imagine if we get some content in there might be cut off it's only slightly being cut off so that may be all right but that's a good first step so now we have main in there now we can start to put some things in here and they should be full width and that's what we need for that hero section initially when before I got here when there was the company that was hired for the site was building it it was requested that the site be a full width site and from what I understand the people that work at my University were told that that would be much too difficult to do which is insane to me because I mean literally it's one line of CSS to change that max width now would it throw off some other stuff you have to judge probably but to say it was too hard was I don't know I mean maybe like bestcase scenario the person just was unaware of what to do I would hate to think that they were purposely misleading him but I guess that happens sometimes all right so let's find out now what that section is what goes in here so I guess we look for this content yeah I'm not sure that I really want to get into making more of these I don't I'm gonna call them components I'm not really sure what they'd be called in you know dotnet but I don't know that I want to make more of these components I think I may rather just try to work with what's already there we'll see how it goes if it's too complicated then maybe it might be better to just clean up this structure and and make our own and you know configure our files you know like we would do maybe four for some of our other projects where we'd have a components folder and you know a folder for all our CSS or images I mean maybe we could I think at least at some point this may have been organized like that and then it just got really messy but for right now let's see if we can find let's see if we can find where this is pulling some things from now I already found let's see that keV I think froze again I'm gonna move my my OBS window to the to the middle screen so I'll notice faster whether or not my screens frozen actually having the background this little I don't know if you can see that but I have a little USB like plasma ball going back there so I thought that would be fun it's fun for you all to see this oh and I forgot to set my timer so let's do that so we already started so I'm just gonna assume that we've taken I don't know what time is it probably 10 minutes something we've taken in 10 so we'll see I'll set it but I'll keep an eye on that and if if we get down to it and it's like 10 minutes left then I think we'll be safe to stop and do five minutes of questionandanswer I do want to try to be done by 230 Eastern Time so just about an hour of a stream I have a meeting at 300 actually I should doublecheck because when I said that it just occurred to me that maybe my meetings at 330 instead of three and if that's the case I could go a little bit longer let's see no it is it three hours right okay so I have a meeting at 300 so I wish I could stream for longer today but oh well I mean I pick something that I thought we could get done the hero section in a short amount of time so we'll try it yes let me find out I think the home page wireframe which I already have a test version of that I had a test version what happened to it maybe it's in I'm wondering if there we go that makes sense okay so I was looking in this site section but as I said earlier I think that this site section here is just a copy I'm pretty sure that this does nothing when you edit it and at some point someone just copied it and I don't know why you name that folder site instead of backup or something like that but this is what we want so we have this test home wireframe I think this is what we need I think I already linked this up okay so main test master okay content place already and what was that main so caught it was content placeholder main I'm trying to find the name maybe it's in oh okay now I see I kept wondering how I did this so I actually did this months ago I made these tests wireframes and but I it was throwing me off because as you can see you know there's a lot in here but there's not a lot on the on the actual page right there's there's nothing in that you know main section here right and even when I looked in my inspected it and dev tools there's really not much there at all but this is how I must have done it and I really don't remember but no one else has access to these files that would even attempt to do anything so it must have been me I came in here in each section you can set it to be visible or not so there's I think four I think there's like four main sections to the page so these three sections and then above it there's a like a top section and so I just set everything to visibility false so that's that's cool we can selectively start putting things back in and now I know at least what to do so we already have this hero section here so I'm just going to keep this I'm gonna remove everything that's in there right now but I'm gonna keep the name because that certainly fits what we're trying to do and I'm just going to click set this to true if I could spell it to this I'm gonna set it to true now hopefully we can see something after I refresh I guess not let's I'm gonna double check and just inspect Oh actually yeah we do have something great all right so you can't really tell but there is now we do have a hero section just kind of just the bare bones of it in you see an indepth tool so you can see it says hero outer wrapper right so we have this this section with a class of hero hey I don't think that was in there before oh actually now it looks like we even though I set the visibility to false we still have these outer kind of these outer divs there's just no content being filled in them huh all right well let's let's see let's put some stuff in there and see what what happens okay so let's find out our hero section okay so this is what we need to keep that and then okay here's our section okay I think we need to keep I think we need to keep this alert so I'm pretty sure there's some type of there's some type of alert that would happen if there was an emergency on campus that should pop up I've never actually seen it happen but I think that's what this is so whatever we do in this section we need to incorporate this somehow and maybe we'll try to test it and see if we can get it to pop up because I don't want to mess that up in case there was some type of emergency but everything else we should be able to get rid of so we'll keep well let's let's grab our code first before I figure out what to keep and what not to keep all right so let me grab yeah this whole thing here it's gonna bethe and that's gonna be it's gonna take the place of our section so I'm not gonna have these section elements what I'll have is a div with a class of section that's how that's how I have everything set up already in the CSS from the other site so I want to keep it like that as I said last week these tabs are killing me but I'm just gonna that relax it's amazing how like something little like that just bothers you okay so now let's get rid of yeah let's get rid of this let's get rid of that part in this part we do need to be we need to be careful about some of this because I think we do want to it's alright I'll take it out because we always have a copy of this that we can refer to basically what I was worried about is at some point within this featured section there is I think there was something that pulled in data about his future stories slider yeah it was this feature story slider okay I think we're fine to take kind of this stuff out right now and that we can always just look and put something else in if we need to later on yeah let's take this out for now and you don't need this anymore you no need this anymore either now we will put yes we want this alert still I guess we'll put this in within our our section here since that's how it was before okay all right let's say that see what it looks like and after I see what's going on here I'm not bad not bad we got some stuff on the page now I think yeah I thought the image should load because it's just a CSS background all right not bad that was way easier than I thought so since we had a lot of the CSS prebuilt this just works right we had it in here so I kind of feel like my title actually have some weird stuff going on so let's check out the CSS I feel like my titles misleading because I said you know we're doing a pair of like parallax hero section but I didn't actually demonstrate at all how to do it you got to be kidding me I'm I'm frozen again I'm have to watch this video at some point and just see like was I only could you only see the live video for a few minutes for this whole thing I'm gonna check my timer and then okay about three minutes all right when I gets down to ten minutes we'll do our five minutes of question and answer and then sorry I haven't been looking at the live chat I actually I covered it up with dev tools for most of the time so if you asked the question I will get to it I'm not intentionally ignoring the live chat I just I inadvertently covered it with with dev tools okay so what I'd like to do then since we have it here we have it working what I want to do is figure out why this isn't centered center it figure out why we're not getting the the color on this it should we should have it hmm I'll see I actually I think I know why the colors not working on this but we'll get the right color here because I don't want that color we'll get this centered and then in the process of doing that we'll take a look at the CSS you already saw the the mark up the HTML extremely simple but the CSS is where we have all this other stuff happening so we'll take a look at that and that'll probably be that'll probably be everything that we get to so I doubt that that will take the full 25 minutes of our next Pomodoro session so we can we'll just get that done once we're done with that then we'll do question and answer for the rest and hopefully finish up around in about about a half an hour I just I looked at a lot of chat kevin says yeah most of the time we're frozen that's crazy I don't know if you remember so a couple days last week got freeze on and off Friday what the entire time I think it was nearly two hours didn't freeze at all and now today I don't think I can go two minutes without freezing that's just crazy I have all the same programs running I've changed nothing if anything I've actually closed some windows I had a lot more chrome windows and tabs open on Friday so oh well like I said I want to try to find a real webcam at some point and hopefully just be done with this this problem I probably just took up the rest of the few minutes yeah it's close enough let's do five minutes of questionandanswer and then we'll finish up okay I'm scrolling way up to the top now and try to get through as much as I can hey everyone a lot of people saying hi everyone thanks for watching frozen again that's okay cool Kevin I just saw you said haven't done parallax before so I wanted to see how that works yeah I'm gonna show you just a super simple way to do it there are you can do some really cool things a different way and I'll explain the other way I'm not going to show it right now but basically I've seen the ways to do parallax fall for me in my mind at least in the two main categories and one is just plain CSS and the other one is using javascript to track scroll and positions today I'm going to show you how I did this with just CSS and then I'll explain a little bit of how you might want to do it in JavaScript if you do want to see a better way to do it check out dev tips it's a YouTube channel so dev tips has a video I don't remember the name of it but it talks about doing parallax effects and I think if I it's been a long time since I've seen this video but I remember there was some really cool stuff that was happening in that video that he was doing some some parallax at like different speeds and things and having like three different images all appear to be going at different speeds over top of each other it was just really cool so he's actually the guy that does that channel doesn't do a lot of videos anymore cuz he got a job at Google and and then now he's just really busy with that but he did have a lot of good videos before so I recommend that to learn to some kind of it more advanced techniques but today out I'll show you something really easy there are so many messages saying that I my camera's first thing yeah I just saw Kevin said legacy code yes yes definitely this is the this whole project is just going to be trying to figure out what's going on here and make the best of it okay no beer says Jessie search input looks much better but when it focus it and I'm looking okay I see the rest of it it comes up with height or border maybe that doesn't look very nice are you talking about this search input or this search input which I should probably look at it on the on this site so this one we're still getting that this thing where I need to fix this it should not automatically go to the search page or maybe this one yeah this one's doing there's some stuff that's happening here that should not happen that I fixed on the the demo page so it seems like there's there's some things that I tried to override that aren't being overridden now and I'm not sure why so off to check that out all right Brian has any questions says I'm probably unleashing a beast but what's everybody using is a build tool these days I'm still using gulp because I'm finding webpack overly complicated for my taste all right I actually for simple projects so for you for this project which is just like static like regular HTML you know CSS JavaScript I'm actually using gulp for this so you I mean if anyone wants to check out how I'm using it this is it's on github not on my github account this is on the the fus mark on one the same one that our last couple of projects have have been on but I have this starter template code there with gulps ooh but I find for small projects like that really simple ones gulp is extremely easy to use and I do find webpack to be more complicated and overkill I'm sure that's just because I haven't taken the time to really study webpack maybe if I had I would I would use webpack more but what I'm working with react I I'm a certainly use webpack but almost always I bootstrap the project somehow with either create react app or next and they take care of the webpack config for me so I mean it's there's one less thing that I don't have to learn right now and helps me get started faster definitely want to learn it you know better at some point just haven't really taken the time to do that yet okay all right cool I did get to the bottom of the live chat the timer just went up a few seconds ago so we'll go back to this I didn't see Samson says I like your videos Thank You Samson I appreciate that thanks for watching all right so let's start this Pomodoro timer I think will definitely be done before this goes up but let's let's just see what's going on here first things first and this hopefully will be an easy fix I know that's hard to see maybe we should just change the color on that while we're in here let's see what's going on let me bring let's move this over and bring dev tools over here I'm not sure where I had this dev tools from I'll just get rid of that let's see why this should be see this Center here should be going down it should be inherited and everything within it should be centered but it does not look like that's happening I just want to I want to try to find it and see what's overriding it okay so it it it is trying to be applied but it's something is overriding it so what is that let's find it let's go to our whoops it's not what I wanted let's go over here and look at our text align so it's being aligned left and there we go interesting oh I see this is this is really interesting so it I don't know if you can see that but it's form and then P so since this is more specific than just the center class this is overriding it but this is on it thinks it's in a form because of course this entire thing is in a form so what we'll want to do then is we're probably going to run into more issues because this is within a form so we may want to use a custom version of materialized but for now I'm not gonna get into that I think what I'll do is just yeah in this case I'm just gonna add on to our custom CSS file to handle this and we'll see we'll see how much more maybe I'll have to check out the non minified materialized CSS just to see how many things are formed specific so for now we can just find let's find our CSS there we go new design and let's go to alright let's just put this at the top here so I'm gonna say Center Center and I'm used to Adam like just automatically giving me good suggestions I'll need to get a similar package for Visual Studio code been spoiled by that okay so let's see if that worked it should be specific enough now oops I guess not are we still still happening let's add one more let's add this now this should do it there we go okay all right so that that work so basically we just got more specific with our selectors and now we have this in the center let's yeah let's add in some materialized as a class it has these classes for text color and things so unless this is mm I guess it's being something is overriding this right now okay yeah so the styles.css for the you know that was here for the original site is overriding this right now so we're gonna have to put that white text class on both of these normally you don't have to you can just put it on a container and it'll work but let's put this on here and put it here that should do what we needed to do okay I just looked at the live chat here and Kevin says use important and this is not pretty but it can be helpful when dealing with legacy code yeah definitely it definitely can whoa that's crazy it still did not override that now I really want to know what's going on here let's see it could be that I spelled something wrong let's check that first yep I forgot the equals I see that thanks Jambi I'd I just noticed that you already got that I said the good thing I should remember that more often if something happens on a website and my thought is how is that even possible I should look for a mistake that I made because computers don't just do things differently right that they just respond to what you give them so if they're doing something weird then that means I probably gave it something weird all right cool so at least we can see this text and the last thing that I want to do before I show you this CSS for how we did this parallax is just check on this button now I was surprised at first that we had this color but I think what I had done on the demo site is I was using a modified version of materialized there's I took their CSS file and I went and I changed their sass variables because I think I I think what I did was I imported all their sad stuff and then just ran it through gulp and had it up just all bundled together you know with the custom stuff that I was doing and so that's why we're back to this default stuff because I brought in materialized CSS from the CDN for this project so what we could do I mean really we just need to change this background color and yeah let's just grab this for now let's just grab this whole thing for now I'm gonna paste it did at some point I do want to add in my own variables into the SAS for materialized and then I'll run that through basically what I'm gonna do is just pare down all the CSS to what I just need for this site and take out everything I don't need then then I'll convert that so I'm gonna do that with the SAS I'll convert it just to plain CSS then I'll bring it in and use it for this project but I'm not gonna do that until we're almost finished otherwise I'm not gonna know what I need and what I don't need so until then I'll just have to put in a few things here and there to make it look right and then I can you know remove those places where I override things so this is going to be one of those places and let's see let's try to comment out the stuff that I think I can get rid of later on so I'm just keeping I just want to change the background color that's why I got rid of all that stuff all that stuff obviously will still be applied we just want to override this and I can grab that color from actually now that I'm looking at this I don't see all here it is there's the sass I was missing it so we'll get components here and go into variables of course it's it's an alphabetical order I should have known okay the variables are green FES yellow okay now I need to go to color so you can see where the variables are coming in here for our secondary color I made it that yellow but I'm importing that from colors or color dot s CSS so you can see I've made these custom colors here so anyway this is all I want right now just the hex code but this is what we're going to do at you know later on towards the end of the project okay all right and that should do it give it a refresh all right cool so I'm not sure if all haha the hover we didn't bring over the Hubbard all right let's do that oops I forgot to click it there we go all right so so let's add the same thing for the hover actually let's be a little bit smarter about that probably if I wanted to really make this better I would have a slightly different hover color but for right now I don't really care that's going to be handled automatically if we put in the correct variables into the SAS file it'll like automatically lighten or darken things so I'm not worried about it now okay all right oops I still have Ron no I don't doesn't really look like he's doing very much hovering now okay I can see a slight change yeah the the change of color would be good but I'm not gonna worry about that now okay cool so we have this this parallax thing going on let's check out how we did it so we're in the section with the class of here oh yeah with the ID of hero so here's what we did so our container div for that section and let's so here we have this is the entire section here so you have a container div with the ID of hero and then inside it we have another div and that's what holds the text and the button so right now we're just going to worry about this container div so on that div I've given it a minimum height of 80 V H okay so that's 80% of the height of the screen so that's V H is viewport height I wanted it to just be 80 because I want I you can do a here a section that covers the screen completely and I do like that sometimes but my boss would like it if some of the content down below were immediately visible because the site right now has these these little news stories and things immediately visible so he didn't want to lose that so I really wanted to have a clean kind of hero section and said well why don't we do it like this we won't have it be full height but we'll leave space here for those other things to still be visible so we'll get to that and build that section out at some point but for now let's that's why I didn't make it fullscreen alright and here's the the parallax part of it so we've taken this image and right now this is just a stock photo and we've set it as the background image then we've set the background attachment to fixed that's what that's what the parallax is we've also put background size cover so it covers you know everything up and then I've also done a few things here so I've changed the image dimensions based on our media queries so that on a smaller screen it would load a smaller image and also different dimensions so even on a smaller screen you can see these are all landscape this one actually changes to portrait because at this point you'd probably be on a phone in portrait mode so I like to do that it just it looks a lot nicer on a phone in your portrait mode one thing that note one thing to remember when you're using this is this does not work on iOS so usually what I end up doing is I I do something just for iOS so I don't think I did it now I don't see any special stuff but for that but I'll have like a special class I'll check for if it's iOS and then put some sort of class on to change this and then basically I can either I can either use a JavaScript parallax effect at that point or if I don't care about the parallax as much I can just have the image in there it's just a normal image that has no no effect so I I haven't tried it with any of the newer versions of iOS it's probably been a like a year since I've tested it so maybe it's different now but it was like that you know a year ago and and that's it that's all you need to get that that parallax that parallax effect now if you did want to do this with jQuery or JavaScript or you know whatever I mean a lot of people do this with jQuery cuz jQuery is like just very easy to do things like this with I just I wonder how I would do this with react that would be cool we'll have to do that one day on a react project but the benefit of doing it with JavaScript is that you can do you can do different things you can have a different speed of the parallax effect you could have different effects of like you have things coming in from the side and moving so you could do a lot of crazy things I don't really like a lot of that stuff going on it's distracting sometimes but it can be cool if done well but it would work you know on on any device that has JavaScript enabled so you're gonna be able to have it work you know on on an iPhone you know running Safari so you have more control but I mean it's just it just kind of depends on what you need right this is by far the easiest way to do it and for me it's it's worked for most for most cases yeah so again we get that effect and it just seems as if this is staying still in the background this image and everything else is just flowing over top of it all right so I think that's it I want to see how fast we did that okay not bad we took up a lot of the time and so we're almost right about the time when I wanted to be finished so I'm gonna go through and answer some more questions I know this was kind of a shorter shorter video if you can't stick around for the question/answer that's awesome you know just thank you for being here and and watching if you can stick around that's great too please put your questions in now and if you can help answer questions I would appreciate that so let me scroll up to where I left off okay cool so not not too much so we should get through this in a few minutes abdulaziz says says good evening hey how's it going thanks for watching Oh Rashid says I love this video lessons they really pull me up and xenon says me too bro that's awesome I'm glad you that does that for you I really appreciate you saying that okay okay so spar spar willsez why is there more than one CSS file I love that question this this project I've this website was built before I started working here two years ago and it's been worked on by a lot of different people so a lot of different people at the company that initially made it and then different people here at the University and it seems like everybody just kind of added their file there was no attempt made to minify or concatenate anything so I have made some attempts to cut things down and but there's still a lot so we're gonna systematically try to get rid of as much as we possibly can all right there's some jQuery plugins that were in here and you know that their CSS stuff is just sitting in those files and their JavaScript so that's why it's kind of a mess normally I would never I would never have set this up like this you know if I was doing it from scratch but there's quite a lot hopefully we don't need that much and we can get rid of most of it okay actually jonbi maybe I misunderstood the question because John B's answer is a little bit different and that's probably because I didn't remember at what point we were at when that question was asked so if you were referring to all of these which I didn't realize that was still on the screen which you probably were referring to then ignore what I just said before while true that probably wasn't what you were talking about these are all like part they call them parcels I don't know what they call them for sass but basically these are partials so they have this underscore underneath here so these are all meant to be brought in to a different file so if you see this materialize scss we import all these partials right all the smaller files so you actually do end up with one sass file that gets compiled or transpiled or whatever we want to call it what do we call it with sat from sass to the CSS I don't know is it compiled transpiled processed I'm not sure but anyway it gets changed into this materialized dot CSS so basically you know pretty much like John B was saying these are all it's just a way of organizing all the different features so that you can easily go in as a developer and change what you need leave out some of what you don't need you know I could go in here so I click the wrong thing I could go in here into this main file and just comment out you know let's say I didn't I didn't need the nav bar I just comment out the nav bar and now when everything gets changed into regular CSS all the nav bar stuff is gone now I have found that materialized is built in a way that some of you can't just do that some of these depend on each other so you you will get errors at times so you have to be careful about that it's not it's not so straightforward but you could build it in such a way that it would be more straight for like that but I've been able to do what I need to do and get rid of a lot you bet I'm not using before pretty easily like this alright okay so Shay yes hey Jesse how did the weekend project go you were working on something for your udemy class weren't you yeah well my Udacity class but yeah so I was hoping that it would be finished and I could actually show you a demo although it was I don't really have time to do that today anyway so maybe tomorrow I can get a finish but I it's almost finished so yeah so thanks for asking I worked on it like all day so it worked on a Friday after I got home from work for a while and like all day Saturday and then I stayed up late Saturday night so I did a lot of work on it I got so much done it's really I cleaned things up quite a bit it's with Redux in my reducers were just like a mess and now I've cleaned it up a lot and it's working a lot better now so basically it's just it's like a blog site with comments and you can you can vote so you can upvote or downvote the blogs and the comments you can add comments delete or edit comments and the same thing with posts so I have all that functionality ready I think the only thing the last thing I did was I needed to be able to sort the posts by date or by vote so I got that working I just need to apply it to comments as well and I'm pretty sure that's the last thing after that I just need to just fix the UI a bit it's really basic the UI is all I'll show it to you because I'm kind of like just really messing around and making a silly kind of UI for fun so I'll let you see it when I when I'm finished so at that point I'll turn it in and then they'll do a code review so somebody from Udacity you'll do a code review and then if anything needs change they'll give it back to me and it's cool even if I've met all the requirements I'll still get suggestions for how to make it even better which is cool so I'm looking forward to that and I've started the third section which is react native so I've already started into those lessons even though I'm not done with the other project because sometimes I I can just you know read the lessons and watch the videos but I'm not really in a spot where I can actually code something so I could even do the lessons on my phone when I'm just waiting you know in line somewhere so so I've started to get get to that I'm really excited about about that so far it just looks really cool see all Brett asks do you have any redux code up on github I do so my the project that I'm working on that I was just telling you about is up on github let me show you I don't remember what the name of it is so that's why I'm gonna show you let's see here we go I think it's this one yeah okay so it's my Udacity react and II readable yeah this must be it yep yeah so the sorting was the last thing I did so this is it you can check it out it in order to run it you have to run there's a server that runs as well so you'd have to get that from Udacity so I didn't I really need to put that in the readme but basically you run the server and you make the API calls to that to the other server so you wouldn't be able to get any in for like if you try to run this you wouldn't get any of the information from the API calls but you could at least see what's going on there and I'm sure I'm making so many mistakes because it's the first time I've ever tried to use Redux so so just if you want to check it out like to get some ideas or to be exposed to Redux just disclaimer I'm not sure that I'm even doing it right I haven't even turned in my project yet so that I'm almost positive that that's not the best way to set up a react or a Redux project I'm you know I'm sure that there are much better things I could be doing because it's my first time like the odds of me getting it perfect from only don't hit once all right so small so check it out if you want to but I don't want to mislead anybody into thinking that that's a good example see Philip said when I was trying to ask what you call changing sass the CSS he says trans processfile yeah I don't know there's got to be a name for it I just not sure what it is okay let me double check and make sure I got everything okay all right cool I think I did get through everything let's see I kept thinking that I was missing something like I I missed somebody's question I was gonna go back to it I'll just take maybe like ten seconds just to doublecheck cuz I don't want to miss something okay now I know what I saw okay so there was a comment earlier about the lessons like these video lessons it says that they really pull me up and that reminded me I just want to talk about this just for just for a minute because I need to yeah okay so I can spare a minute for this although if you know me it's definitely going to be more than Meno probably more like five but I just wanted to say I do get from time to time like people will talk about in the live chat like motivation the idea of like how do you stay motivated and you know some people would you know just stay motivated to keep going projects some people get down because they're looking for work and they just can't find it so I just wanted to talk about that just really briefly because I know you are going through some stuff like that so I think I mentioned this here and there before but like I I struggle with motivation a lot I do my best to try to sound as upbeat as I can during the videos I said I don't want to be you know just really boring and down I'd rather be positive and upbeat for everyone but like I struggle especially in the morning you know starting to get going and and one of the things that there's a lot of things that help me so like we've talked about this before I exercise is a big thing that helps caffeine helps me write vitamins and things like that so staying healthy in general helps out but sometimes you know even more so basically like I recently have been getting like super just super depressed and not motivated and I've been I've been struggling with depression and you know taking medication for it for years and recently like it just got really worse and I got put on another medication in addition to the one I've been taking and I'd crazy side effects so I got off of that one and then had to weigh couple weeks to see someone out and get on a different medication and now I'm taking something different but it takes a while to kick in so it'll be like I don't like a month to six weeks before I can really tell and if it works great if not I'll have to switch to different ones so I'm just saying like if anybody's struggling out there struggling with that kind of thing like I know a difficult that is so you know my I'm open to if anybody needs to talk on Twitter or if you want to bring it up in the live chat or something so you know I know a lot of other people struggle with things like that and sometimes it is just you know you get a little bit of exercise and that helps but other times it's more than that and I don't know for me like a lot of people just don't talk about it from you know where I'm at I don't know how it is in the rest of the world but it's kind of something that's just like you keep hidden and I don't think that really helps it doesn't help people very much to keep it you know to try to keep it hidden I think it's better better to talk about it so I mean this stream isn't a mental health stream right it's a coding stream so I'm still going to keep it like 90 percent coding but you know for if we're chatting at the end doing question answers like you know definitely open to any insight you all have you're going through something like that I'm open to open to talking about that or talking privately about it but I'm gonna do my best to keep putting on these videos I almost didn't stream today because I was just feeling so down it came down to the wire if you know I I didn't announce the stream until about a half hour before I was going to cuz I just like I just couldn't couldn't do it I just couldn't get get motivated but luckily I did I always feel better after I stream and you know talk with you all so anyway that's my that's my heart to heart for this with today's stream but actually I do want to check to see if anybody responded to any of that before I end the stream I guess that did that took less than five minutes so I was that's not bad I know I tend to go on and on at times let me double check really quickly see what's here at the end of the live chat and then we'll we'll wrap things up huh Kevin says I don't actually like coffee should I really my life as a developer I don't know maybe you know everybody says that developers you like they they drink coffee in produced code right that's I actually don't drink coffee that much either I I mean you've seen me I switched to energy drink I drink G fuel and I feel much better I still like the taste of coffee but I feel much better if I drink the G fuel instead of instead of coffee probably because there's a lot of B vitamins and stuff in there that coffee doesn't have okay Brett says Jessie I built my resume site from your videos and your fus marcom /ci react project you're super helpful oh that's awesome that's really cool if you if you get a chance send me a message on Twitter or some something some social media and send me I'd love to see see your resume and see how you built it that would be cool I mean obviously you base it on mine but I'd be really interested to see like where you change things and and how you did things so if you don't mind and you get a chance send me the link please okay I just saw you I didn't notice the second one so I see that now so I will check that out so if you wonder if I was laughing he actually did put the link in right after that and I'm I did just didn't even notice it okay I'm just typing it in so don't make sure I got it right cool I see it awesome I'm gonna check this up well I got to go to a meeting in a couple minutes but I'll check it out maybe when I get back from the meeting maybe I'll bring my laptop to the meeting and check it out during let's see alright so thanks thank you everybody for for watching contributing in the live chat really appreciate that as always and I'll be back tomorrow and we'll work some more on this and maybe we'll do on that I might do the footer tomorrow I think I want to skip I'm gonna skip down and clean up the footer since it's already there and we could already see it I want it to look nice so maybe we'll skip to there and then we'll start working on the main content all right okay Wow this video is less than an hour I haven't done that in a while shortness may be here for a long time so I'm going to end it so it stays less than an hour and yeah so that's all for me have a great day
