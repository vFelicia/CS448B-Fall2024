hey so I'm pretty cast ready and as I just wrote in my blog post I'm starting my first year pretty series and the whole idea is that I've gotten a lot of emails from programmers who are kind of learning the code and they're trying to break into and get their first jobs or really just try to learn to code and they have a lot of questions or doubts along the way and and I'd love to kind of take the time out of my take some time every week to kind of answer some of these questions that I think are very very common questions I get and I think I can give you my best advice based on the experience that I've had kind of breaking in and out into the world of being a developer right so this week I got a question from a girl and what she's asking was she said I'm really keen on getting some reaction experience but anywhere I applied to they seek an experience react engineer I have learned reacts to my own and recruiters don't seem to appreciate it further at this stage I pick at the big companies I reach one or two rounds behind the final round and then they say they found a more experienced person for this role recently I got a rejection from company X and company Y they both required five to six years of industry experience my application took me to the initial rounds and they seemed interested in gauging my potential only to find that I was not as good as someone they were looking for next week I'm going to another full stack ball at company C but it's clearly out of my league they're seeking at least six years of experience in JavaScript I'm pursuing it honestly for the interview experience and maybe who knows what if it works out somehow I don't know many people who can who can refer me to these jobs either so how do I get my first reactor without experience I totally empathize with this issue ah and I have been interviewed and probably a little bit over over a year for an engineering role but I was just curious and I kind of Rani's and I went to look at the descriptions of some of their job postings and so for example there's one on Facebook where they're looking for Instagram software engineer and graphics I'm scrolling down into the minute into the qualification section and yes it definitely says you know a BS or master's degree in computer science it says five plus years of professional experience interactive computer graphics using C or C++ a bunch of other requirements so definitely they have the years they're listed another roll at Facebook is a software engineer full stack and look at the minimum qualifications it says BS or MSN electrical or computer science two plus years of relevant work experience so yeah again they list they want some kind of work experience here to another one I went to was Netflix what's funny about Netflix is they don't really have anything but senior software engineering roles on their website so the senior software engineering law partner engineering it says ESRB in computer science five plus years of experience in software development um so again another company that shows year of experience um let's see I also went to LinkedIn I'm looking at their software engineer performance mobile or web this is probably the most daunting job application I've ever seen so many requirements makes my head spin okay one you plus year of experience in mobile web one plus years of experience in software design development algorithm related solutions one plus year of experience in programming and object oriented language two plus years of experience in mobile web or browser performance engineering C yes again they list years of experience that they're looking for then I decided to go and look at some earlier stage companies one is a firm and their application doesn't have any years of experience listed which is cool and it looks like you know they're kind of looking for passion and drive someone who's fluent in fun and web technologies comfortable finding their way around backend API but nowhere does it list years of experience interesting um another startup I went to as a company called data breaks I'm looking at their full and it looks like they too don't have a minimum qualifications or anything it just says someone who can you know develop HTML CSS and JavaScript good communication skills etc so interesting it looks like some of the bigger companies listed years of experience while some didn't but I'd have no surge to figure out like what kind of companies list years of experience and what don't but overall um it's definitely clear that there's a lot of companies that explicitly state the number of years of experience and honestly sometimes you're looking at these requirements and you're like this makes my head spin right like I totally understand your pain some of these applications sometimes can be extremely daunting because they make it look like there's looking for someone who almost has superhuman capabilities um but you've probably been coding for like what a year maybe two years maybe even less and you really need that first job just like prove yourself right um I can't give everyone like blanket advice but I'll tell you how I approached it when I was looking for a lot of something said like X years of experience it didn't mean that I didn't apply right I'll typically look at the requirements and and and kind of that what the job application said and give a sense of what they're seeking I would try to evaluate whether I can honestly fulfill those requirements for example in the first Facebook one where they were looking for five plus years of experience in computer graphics clearly I don't have five plus years of experience in computer graphics I don't even have one year experience in computer graphics in fact I don't think I've ever worked on computer graphics so I wouldn't apply for that but the second Facebook role with just software engineer at just a fullstack software engineer even though it says two plus years of relevant work experience the rest of the bullets I feel like I can fulfill and even if I don't know everything today I'm confident I can learn it on the job if I need it to so uh that's kind of how I would devalue whether I make it make sense for me to apply or not um and if I'm confident I can fulfill those roles and I would apply and also one thing I've noticed pretty frequently when I was applying was that a lot of this senior a lot of the roles at the said like senior they they must have meant someone who could do the work without needing a lot of help maybe not needing a lot of mentorship someone who can like kind of just run with a stand on their own feet and beard and think through these problems themselves and if you think you kind of made that go ahead and apply who knows maybe you'll get the get an interview right and again it's just important to be reasonable if they say five plus years and C++ experience if you've never written a line of C++ then don't apply there's no need to waste your time and their time with that application just be honest with yourself when you're applying and another really great way to get in the door is get referrals I found this to be incredibly helpful and in fact there was a lot of times where I would get a referral into a company and even though they didn't have the job listing for me on the on the jobs page they would they would still give me a phone screen at least because because you know referrals go a long way someone is out there watching for you and saying hey I know prithi I think she's awesome I think she's smart I think she's capable so I'm referring you to this company they're putting their their name in front of you and and they're willing to do that for you so the company kind of takes that as positive reinforcement they're like okay so she got a referral so maybe it's worth kind of bringing her in and seeing what she's got right and another thing that I found really helpful personally was kind of showing them that even though you don't have those years of experience what have you done outside of work right this can be things like you know making sure that you get her profile looks good like do you have side projects that you're really proud of maybe make the public so that someone who's a recruiter or manager can go onto your github profile and see what you've been working on another great way is contributing to open source even if it's just documentation whatever it is any kind of small contribution to make to open source goes a long way it shows what you're capable of and shows your involvement in the community and your passion for programming um another really great way that worked for me is I love writing and I started writing pretty early my programming career and I used writing as a way to explain concepts that I was learning and so that really helped me in my job process for sure people would kind of run across my blog and see that hey like even though she doesn't have experience she she knows what she's talking about right and so the idea is that even though you don't have the experience to show them somehow figure out a way that to show people that you're really capable and you have the potential to those requirements and so you apply and if you get a response Congrats that's a huge step right the first thing you difficult point is a good phone screen and from my personal experience I've had a lot of people use this phone screen to kind of ask me to quantify what experience I've had in the past and I'd be honest I'd talk about my side projects in depth again you know like you know if you don't have experience don't talk about what you don't have talk about what you have because because then you can kind of really show them that even though you don't have that work experience you've done a lot of programming on your own right and again things like sideproject open source projects blog post these goes a long way to fill in the gaps for the experience I think that you don't have and once you get past that phone screen at this point the ball is really in your court there are way any doubts that you had along the whole application process about your ability to perform when you apply just throw it all out because you're really in the driver's seat at this point the company what if they've given you their first interview they've indicated that they think you have potential to fulfill the role look they get hundreds maybe thousands of applications and they chose you and they're saying okay this person I think he or she has potential and now it's really up to you to prove that you you do have potential and that you're capable full from the role and I often found that the best way to kind of prepare for this was you know reaching out to the recruiter and asking her like I met her like really bugging them about the role like what is a tech stack what's your role going to be like what are you can expect it what are you going to be expected to do and build what's the cultural life what are the key skills are going to be testing and looking for what's the interview style like is it like a whiteboarding interview is it like a practical takehome interview is it a mix of both like don't ever be surprised about the interview really anything that the recruiter is willing to share with you and just like use all that information to prepare as much as possible and I can go I probably can go talk about the preparation process in another video but the main point I want to get across is like even though the application might have said X years of experience if you've gotten the interview then then the ball is 100% in your core and you really have to use this opportunity short of everything you got because they've kind of put their truck by giving you an interview they're like okay I think she has potential he has potential um and now it's your job to kind of prove that to them and honestly just be honest with what you can do and what you can't do and if you don't know something the best you can do is tell them that you don't know it but should tell them that you have Oh show them somehow that you have potential and that you're excited to learn are you capable of learning that even though you don't know this that you'll you'll you'll sit there and you'll figure it out because honestly no programmer knows everything right like everything every programmer is learning almost every single day learning something new and and they're really looking not looking for someone who knows everything under the Sun but they're looking for someone who knows a good amount but you know if they're throwing something you don't across a problem or faced with some kind of debugging issue they can figure it out they can learn they can they can grow that's kind of the people that's kind of the people that a lot of these managers are looking for to hire and even if you don't get the job because you know you don't meet some you don't have the experience or because some other senior engineer got the job over you really don't waste this opportunity use it as an opportunity to get candid feedback ask the company hey like I know that you know you hired someone else because they had more experience where could I have improved where the variables I'm missing experience was in my should I learn more about databases was it my computer architecture questions was more my algorithms and data structures like where was I lacking the experience and what can I do better next time because you never want to make the same mistake again right and you always want to focus on improving some of the weaknesses that you have don't focus on what you already know really really well for the interview just focus on for the next interview making sure that you improve on what they told you you could have been proved on and honestly if you got an interview for a job that said five plus years of experience and you have no experience that's pretty awesome let's admit it you were basically competing against senior engineers and experienced engineers so use it as an opportunity to grow and learn and and really just experience the process of interviewing for some more advanced roles and kinda conclude um I totally get that getting your first gig is almost the most hardest one and most frustrating one I went through this process myself and I was honestly pretty shocked but by how difficult the process is and I totally get it and in fact my little sister is going through that process right now and it's been taking her a few months what I often found is everyone kind of wants you to come back next year when you have a little bit more experience and you're like sitting there going well like where the hell am I supposed to experience from if you can't give me the chance to get get this experience and I trust me like I know that feeling but this for your first job particularly keep persisting keep applying keep looking let people know around you that you're looking for a job and just use every interview as a learning opportunity sometimes the whole process takes weeks sometimes it takes months sometimes it might even take a year but once you land a first gig it's you you're kind of the next one gets way way easier so work really hard for your first one and in no time you'll have your first job alright I'm done
