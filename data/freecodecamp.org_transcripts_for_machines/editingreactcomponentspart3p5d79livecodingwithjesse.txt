hey everybody welcome to live coding with Jesse I'm Jesse and today we're gonna be working with react again and lately I've been working through all the issues in the github repo the links in the description if you want to check out that repo and I think we're just gonna continue on with that today so last week we did and the we check out the the latest on the repos here I think we worked on that jobs component yeah yeah I think we did that so I don't know that we got to add entirely finished so maybe we'll finish that up and then we'll move on to something else so I think that was issue one number 107 yes we'll start out with that let me switch up my screen over here and I'm gonna check the live chat quickly before we get started we got a few questions right off the bat guru says q please explain the header customize for different devices there's a sidebar a drawer and links in the app bar or welcoming to other devices app are links move to sidebar also explain multiple menus in sidebar oh yeah so the the header is just CSS so it's just media queries so it just detects the width of the screen and when the width of the screen is small it hides part of the part of the markup there when it's larger it shows it okay so those are just media queries and then the sidebar menu which let me get a browser window over here so we can see it so we got a localhost I think I have it running I had it running did that break something it works so that side drawer it just has collapsible so there's a collapsible component that comes with material UI so we've just nested those collapsible elements within within the different menus here so certain of these options are collapsible right so that allows us to go pretty deep with the navigation without being overwhelming you know at first because most of it is hidden and I think we've done streams on on how we built that so if you want to like really detailed like how we coded all that you know check back on some of the streams when we were you know doing the side drawer subtypes oh sorry about the yarn I think sometimes we would title the stream to a bar or things like that all right let me I see that there's a little bit more in the chat but I want to go ahead and get started and then after our first Pomodoro session I'm gonna come back and answer some things in the chat so hello to everyone who's please in here now but let's let's get started on this so I have a Pomodoro timer on one of my other screens and I'm going to start that a 25minute session and after that 25 minutes we'll do a little question in the answer and and we'll go from there Bogdan said he looked shattered me I don't know why I feel really tired and I my eyes like look really tired oh no I should Jin had more caffeine before we started okay so we're gonna start with that jobs component so let me close out some of these tabs and we don't need right now here we go we're gonna do this job list because that's what the last thing that we did work on and see if we have yeah let's go let's see what we have on the screen first I think that was HR and then yeah yeah okay now I remember this there's several URLs now that we have set up that will take us to the same page and what we what we were planning on doing was adding some filtering but you know what I think I don't know why I didn't realize this last week but but realistically you know we rarely have more than 10 job listings at one time I don't think that that justifies spending as much time as we would need to spend on all this filtering and building the UI for the filters because if there's only let's say ten or less jobs that's not really a lot to scroll through so I say we put that on hold and that could be one of the things that can be done at some point after launch and what we need to do right now then is just work on basically two things one we need to include a little bit more info so if we're not going to have a the property have this be sortable we should at least let people know if possible like what department this is in although I don't know that we have all the data for the different staff departments we do for faculty departments but then we should let them know whether or not it's a faculty or staff job and then also we need to have some way of taking something off the list so you know a lot of these jobs they're not open anymore so we don't want to list them so I think it's probably worthwhile to have a keeper listing at least for a while you know in our database but we don't want to have it be visible so that might simply be you know going into WordPress and switching that over to a draft instead of a published post you know maybe that'll be the easiest way to do it but what to think about that but first things first let's just clean this up and let's make this look you know as good as we can make it look without spending too much time on it so in the component itself I think everything is is okay for the for this job list AAS component yeah so at this point well we can make it a choice here do we want to make another component for these individual job listings or not I believe we had talked about modifying our faculty was it our faculty list yeah you know what we ended up we did make a job list I thought we made a jobless component alright so since we made a jobless component I don't know I'm sorry for some reason I was thinking we had a component but maybe we don't you know for now let's build it out here we'll see how big it is if it seems like it's way too big and we should move it to another component we'll do that but let's not optimize prematurely okay so I am gonna leave this up though and actually this might be too small for you oh I'm sorry I'll make it a little bigger here I'm gonna leave this up just so that we remember what our structure is to get data and let's see what else we can get out of here so right now all we're doing is just displaying the job title but we should display let's see so we have faculty departments or staff department let's go into our WordPress installation and add in some data for this because we need some data to be there for us to see how it looks and right now we don't really have any so it's fine where those jobs are and I'm just gonna open up the first couple of these just so we can get some data okay they did show up all right so accounting clerk this is a staff job and since we don't have a large staff departments filled out here I'm not gonna worry about that right now this is operation support clerk it's also staff job let's see what this one is faculty secretary even though that's a faculty secretary that still falls under staff so faculty would just be strictly professors online enrollment counselor that's a staff job and then that's also admissions so we can actually we can click that one okay so it looks like we're gonna have mostly staff jobs except this one was faculty and we already set that up so at least we have those those all set up now and let me close out of most of those all right now we'll have a little bit of data to work with and we can go through now and grab the data that we need but what we also need to do is make sure that we check first because we could definitely get errors here because sometimes if there's no data this is just gonna be completely empty so we can't just try to find what's there because we'll get an error if you let's say there are no staff depart there's no staff Department selected or something like that so let's go through we're gonna have to do everything within this component here and I think that what I'd like to do is maybe make a few constants to make this look a little bit a little bit cleaner we could we could put our checks you know inside our component but it's gonna make our markup look messy so let's do let's do it like this so what we're gonna do is put our curly brackets here and so normally we can it's just an arrow function just Auto returns anything so if it was all in the same line you wouldn't even have to put anything you could just return what was there or you can put parentheses which is usually as recommended if you do multiline things just so you more like readability I'm not even sure it's 100% necessary but if we want to start putting in variables and things first we need to put these brackets in there and then we also need to return so we we need a return statement now out of this whereas before you know we didn't need that return safely so let's copy this inside here so we're still gonna return the same thing for now we're just gonna make a few variables and we add it in an extra paren so we're gonna take one out so we're even down there but then now what we can do here is as we're looping through all of the objects in this jobs data array now we can pull out pieces okay so we're gonna do const we'll call this const this yet we'll call this category and then we'll do another one we'll call this department launch department okay so for a category what we need to make sure of is like what at what point do we need to stop and check to make sure something's there so if you're not sure what I'm talking about right now it'll make sense once we actually get this going so for now we can go and use this tool that we've been using pretty frequently which I have been calling what do I call it I've been calling this graphic UL but I watched the YouTube video recently where someone called it graphical which now makes a lot of sense so let me know in the chat I'll learn in the comments do you pronounce this graphical or graph e qo obviously the term graphical makes a lot more sense cuz that's like a real word so so now I feel a bit silly but it's always hard to know how to pronounce things when you just see the spelling and you never you never hear it okay so this is not updated data this is from the last search that I did but this will be better for illustrating the point since we have so much data missing so we go in here and our first like if we were to be looping over this right we go data jobs edges okay so this is the array we're looping through here this edges array and then the first object in the edges array is this object here so let's zoom in so we just are dealing with this one object first so we go to this one object we go to node and then within that that node we can see we have job categories edges and then edges in this case is another array of objects so if we wanted to select this we would say edges zero and that would give us this one and then we could go dot node dot slug right and that that would work but if we went down here and we did staff departments dot edges dot dot edges 0 dot node right there is no node right we're gonna get an error so we can't just say ok like let's let's get these in a straightforward way so what we need to do is have some sort of check to say like ok we can see edges do we want to check and say if edges dot length is greater than 0 then do we go forward you know maybe that's what we want to do ok so let's try that check first because it looks like based on the structure as long as edges has a length of greater than 0 that means there's something in here and so we should be able to get the data then so that's the first check we're gonna go with so here's what we're gonna do we so since we're already in let me show you so from our perspective this has already been done right now we're strictly in here right so when we look in here that first array is called job I'm sorry that first object is called job so we need to go job node job categories and then check the length of edges right so john node edges dot length is greater than zero so if the length of that of edges is greater than zero we're gonna do a little ternary here so it's like like a little if statement so if it's greater than zero then let's let's go ahead and get that value so let's go job node edges 0 dot node dot one was a slug got slug okay now if it's not we want to return will should return I don't know false let's return false we're gonna do something similar for Department and you know maybe we should do we should split it up and say like faculty and staff Department right I week we could probably do it so that we could check for for either one right in the same constant but I don't I don't really want to I think that would look kind of complex and I don't mind adding one more constant in here so I'm just gonna take this and copy it and we're gonna do the same thing let's see whoops I forgot job categories didn't I yeah it's a job node let's go jog all right that was lowercase there we go all right so I'm assuming somebody caught that in the chat so sorry I didn't look down at the chat but okay oops and I only did it for that lower one did not do this all right great since job categories we want to do the same thing down here for faculty departments okay faculty departments and then down here we'll just copy and paste that and change faculty to staff okay I don't know why I'm trying to work with this tiny space we really don't need any of this other stuff right now okay so now we have constants for category faculty Department and staff Department if these are present they will these will end up being strings if not they'll just return false so since we have that now we can go down here and display our our information so the first thing we want to display and maybe we'll do it let's do it like this will style it in the minutes this is not gonna look great for now so let's just do a span and we're gonna use dangerously set enter HTML inside this band and we're gonna say category and I guess yet I'm kind of interested to see because I know some of these we don't even have a category for I'm interested to see what this will do if it returns false if it freaks out then throws an error then we'll we'll need to put a check here to make sure category is actually a string and not false otherwise I'm hoping that if we try to put false in here it just won't render okay so we'll test it with this first I'm not even sure what a span will display as hey there we go okay so evidently it actually displays false aha so we definitely need to change that so let's see I wonder if we can put the oh you know we can just do it like this so let's say category and all right so what this will do is just say if category so that means if category exist if it's not false then so it's just going to do the rest of it right so it's sometimes called I think like a short circuit I don't know they call it a short circuit operator but anyway it's just a little shorthand way instead of doing everything for a ternary you just do that so let's make sure What's it telling me I think it's just spacing so I think this is fine it'll work load there we go okay cool so it worked so now this is only rendering if we happen to have the category present which I wonder why we don't have staff present I thought we did put stuff in yeah and I updated it interesting there we go okay so those updates we made are they're wonderful so you know we can add in a few a few things here like see if we can do this inside is that a function I think it is I mean I know you can do it I just I can't remember if you can do that in JavaScript yep you can okay and we could have done we could have done this in CSS anyway I didn't explain what I just meant I I mean I know you can do it in JavaScript but I didn't know if that was the syntax that they clicked so um all right cool so we're gonna do a similar thing for down here and here's what we're gonna do though we're gonna say this is gonna be a bit more tricky so I'm sure there's gonna be more than one way to go about doing this but here's what I'm thinking we'll try first so if faculty department or staff department back department or stats department and you can't Nestor Nerys can you I don't know if you can nest on it yeah alright let's take it back take it back a bit here's what we're gonna do alright so if faculty department then we're gonna say faculty if there's a faculty department and then we are going to display it and then if there is a staff department we're gonna display it all right so this is one of those times where it's like first step is make it work right cuz there's probably a way to do this without the repetition that we have here all right so let's see oh yeah there we go okay so we see it's saying nursing and admissions so this is where you have the department but let's see how do we want to do this I don't I don't like that I don't like having the top and the bottom so here's what I want to do instead let's make it so that all right so let's see if we have this then all right let's do this what I want to put in is just a let's do this for now this is going to look weird gonna do that we're gonna have a nested span alright let's see how this loose okay so we have that there but I definitely want I want a space to put the space see if this will work this is this code is starting to look not so great all right cool it works I don't have used caught what I just did I wanted there to be a space in here so I just put in right we dropped into our curly brackets here which drops us into JavaScript but then I just wanted to return what a space right so that that works now what I want to do is take these and render these up here yeah let's render them up here first and see what we get basically what I what I want is them to be right after this faculty thing here yep all right that works cool so really basic not sure this is what I want to go with you know for for sure but that basically tells us this is a faculty position in the nursing department right cool does that make sense then I think this is cleaner than having it at the top and the bottom okay and then obviously to clean this up a little bit more wood I'd like to do first let me check on the Sam out oh no my timer went off I didn't even know it all right let me go back to the chat right now and answer some questions and before I get too far ahead oh yeah I went way over on my son oh whoa aha code normal sis I'm learning angular is angular fine or should i reconsider reacts it really depends on what you want to do if you want to get a job somewhere and you know they use angular stick with angular I I don't know I mean it it really depends on your your situation your preferences you you do see you see job listings for both and react definitely has more momentum right now but there's still a lot of places that use angular and build things with angular I mean it's back to by by Google so it's it's not like it's going anywhere anytime soon hey Anna and asked how I'm doing not too bad actually I coded in my living room that the rest of my family was gone so I coded in my living room for a while this morning's inside the Sun comes in through the window so I was just kind of like relaxing had the windows open listened to the birds so that was kind of kind of cool through bit through off my schedule is I didn't get my normal workout in in the morning so I'm gonna have to do that after after I stream but otherwise not doing too bad how are you doing in shelter Rovin says do you have to be good in mathematics to study / work in computer science field no not necessarily it depends on what you want to do there are definitely some areas of computer science that require more aptitude and skill with mathematics but if you let's say you wanted to be a frontend developer then I I don't really use any upper level math you know ever how so and yeah that's that's another one are those questions that it really just depends on what you're interested in code normal says I have to work with single page applications with a lot of forms let's say CRM good is react for that type of web app yeah it can be I mean you can definitely handle forms and react we've done forms before it's not it's different than how you'd normally do a form but it's not difficult there I'm really sorry about this name Aero Lua ir e higher so I'm sorry I can't pronounce that let me know how to pronounce it let's pronounce it right but ir e o l UW a says is this visual studio it's visual studio code so oops wrong way yeah so this is the visual studio code or people call it BS code so which is definitely different than visual studio both made by Microsoft though Michael creo says I'm a little upset that y'all work on a graph QL query without me sorry I'll make sure we save all the graph QL queries for you mad justices here says good morning good morning how's it going okay so michael says it's definitely graphical okay I will do my best to remember that and pronounce it correctly hey JavaScript this here says hey what's up having talked to well nothing just working lots of work I got this project that I'm working all day on and then if you know when I try to get time in the evenings I'm working on this this balanced IO app which is really really cool projects so I'm happy to be able to work on it but it's taken a lot Michael krios talking about inline fragments for graph QL okay yeah I haven't I haven't tried in inline fragments I will have to check that out as well Oh mad you said to go see it thanks for watching whoa Nicky says fallout 76 will be set in West Virginia no way um if y'all don't know I am from West Virginia I don't live in West Virginia right now but I live close to it but I was born and raised in West Virginia so I'm excited I'm definitely gonna check out the trailer to that later today okay let me answer a few more questions since I went over on my Pomodoro session I'll go over a bit on the question and answer session here before we finish this component up hey hard shits here how's it goin hard [ __ ] javascript is Jesse you can press f5 to refresh they don't always have to move the pointers and stop the browser yeah I just it's just to have it I mean I know that you can use the keyboard shortcut but yeah I'll just need to force myself if I force myself to use it for a while then I'll remember it I'm I've been so used to having the auto refresh work that I never I never need to manually refresh but when I'm doing these streams the OBS uses so many resources resources on my computer that the auto refresh just takes too long I'm not patient enough for it so I just keep like spamming the refresh button so anyway thanks to JavaScript it a horse should ask the pompom broke so harsh it made the Pomodoro timer that I'm using right now you know the alarm definitely works I just my headphones that are plugged into my phone right now and I'm listening Spotify to save some of the processing power on my computer for the stream so I have my computer volume turned all the way down and didn't hear the timer but yeah the timer I always hear the timer from from Paul Paul alright I'm gonna go back I got through most of the questions I'm gonna go back now we're gonna do one more problem into our session and finish up some stuff with this component so let's see okay so we've got these listings now we are listing whether it's faculty or staff and if there is a department selected we also list that if not it just doesn't display anything there but this doesn't look great so and it also doesn't have a length we want to have lengths to a page that has some info so that's what we need to add and we need to add in the link let's do the link first cuz that's that's a necessary functional thing and then depending on how much time we have then we can look at you know maybe switching up you know how these how these look your styling a bit okay so for our length we can use where's our slopes I know we're grabbing this look somewhere and we're already using it yep so we're already using for our key this job node slug right and let's see we need to check to see what what the current website is using do we really need to know we don't yeah I don't think we do right cuz job listings expire so frequently we don't have really have to follow the old pattern but let's see what they use if it's reasonable then we'll use the same URL structure if not we'll switch it up so let's go to Franciscan dot edu slash HR and I guess I could have gone into faculty openings or something but this will be okay all right so let's go into faculty openings I do want to make sure I get a count here so there's only two here let's go to staff opening I said earlier that we never have more than like ten job openings at once so now I want to make sure that was true yep I think we have nine total actually and this is interesting the clinical nursing clinical instructor is actually listed under staff openings that's crazy okay let's go read more it looks like it's just HR VP development all right let's make sure that's really the structure cuz that seems to me like that could get a little okay alright so they don't really have a clear pattern here so what I'm seeing is for these positions that are kind of like lower down in the organization it's the URL is HR slash staff opening slash and then the name of the position and usually with like a date tagged on at the end of it but for these upperlevel positions like vicepresident it's actually HR slash in this case VP development so a vice president of development so they're not included under staff in the URL structure and then for faculty openings I'm assuming that it's gonna be slash faculty yes it's gonna say slash faculty opening / oh okay yeah all right interesting yeah I'm not gonna keep those let's switch it up and here's what we'll do so let's look at our server for a minute to see what we're doing with with these types of things so let's find okay so we already having an HR here we can go HR and then faculty opening staff openings and what else did we have careers yeah so let's go let's have it be HR careers so HR slash careers slash whatever the job title is or whatever the slug is for that particular job yeah that seems more straightforward we don't have to maintain this this structure of multiple pages and things for the different categories and we'll keep it like that for everything and since we're just saying careers from from what I see from the old structure is that somebody must have taken issue with people higher up being counted to staff or with faculty being counted as staff or staff yeah it's amazing like how much terminology like upsets people and makes people like people get really into this terminology I don't know if it's everywhere but at a university is for sure like well this person is a doctor and this personally as their masters so you can't call them this or that like it's wild so anyway we're gonna get rid of all that and we're just gonna say careers and leave it at that okay so let's make our route now what we'll need to do is say so far page with careers I just set up a route with three things on it recently how did I do that let me scroll through for a second and see which one I set up I think I put it up here up at the top okay that's not thought it was departments I guess not it wasn't for that I can't remember what it's for I noticed her [ __ ] said something about this object being really long yeah it's getting really long and that's what I mean I've been afraid of that for a while now I hope out how long this is this is getting alright so since I can't find where I did this I'm just gonna try to make this work right now which I just lost my spot here HR alright so we're gonna say HR if we go to careers jobless so let's go with the type all right so what we need to pass along is so if we go to careers it's going to render jobless as the page don't want that right so we want to say this is gonna be tough how am I gonna handle this I should hold on this thing hard she says I will rewrite that surveyed aijs file using SQLite or sequel Lite DB in a PR if I a time sequel I tis a file DB there will only be a DB sequel a file on the root of your project all right that's interesting I haven't noticed any issues with this being too slow and other the only issue I've had is just it just takes a while to scroll so I usually just use a search right so I just find where I'm at but if it would increase the speed I'm open to other other solutions but anyway so here's what I want to do for the page so I do have it set up I just need to direct these to the single job page which did we already create that let's see where's our pages here now we didn't even create it yet huh yeah we need to do that but for now I guess I'll just call it job job Jas so what I can do is thirdly this will work but it's not gonna be ideal is gonna get a job so basically any time we see that there are three yeah anytime there are three parameters in that URL it's gonna automatically go to thirdly which is okay unless we have some other places like some other instances in the HR pages that have three then it's gonna mess things up so I may have to rewrite some stuff in the router or something to deal with this or I'll just have to look at my router a little bit more and see if I've already dealt with it and just can't remember and then here under type we're gonna say actually we don't need to worry about type do we no we don't we don't necessarily have to worry about type since we have a custom query for that particular part okay let's just leave it for now we'll leave it that leave this off we definitely will need the ID though so so we already have that default in there looks so the ID is basically what's gonna tell graph QL what piece of content to get so thirdly he's gonna be if I need to do it like that careers what if I can just go with careers I don't I don't I think about it this should be fine this should just pick up it should pick these up automatically and send it to this component all right that should work okay I spent a lot more time on that than I anticipated but now we can go back to our job list and we can say that we are gonna add a link in here there we go so let's make this a link I'm gonna have to look up how I do links cuz I haven't made one for a while next link all right there we go it's a link prefetch there we go so link prefetch a true profile link so that's not what we need right now what we wanted to get is /hr slash we're gonna use a template literal here so we're gonna say /hr slash careers slash and then we're gonna come in with variable which will end up being for this particular thing the slug so it'll be job no slug and down here we can end our links I don't know what did I do I think I got rid of the h2 accidentally there we go yeah it should be yes you were okay still getting a lot of weird red lines here see if it broke yeah Oh links not defined all right so let's pull in link so we're using link instead of an a tag so that we can have some clientside routing happening so therethere won't need to be a page refresh cool okay so it did when we clicked it it did take us somewhere else but of course that page doesn't exist because we didn't set that up yet so that is working I will definitely want to do Styles link is gonna be we're gonna do cursorpointer for length all right and so that way it'll look like it's clickable and is it styles is it classes class name class is created okay okay let's make sure that that words I remembered the this time to use to use my refresh shortcut oops I accidentally clicked it all right I need to put this maybe I need to put it on the h2 there we go okay all right so now it looks like it's clickable much better okay so in terms of functionality this does what it needs to do now it has a list it gives us basic information and it's clickable in terms of style it's not great so that'll be the next step which probably won't do on this stream so my Pomodoro session is just about over about three minutes and then I'll go back and do some more question answers Wow and I've got a lot of messages from work let me check really quick all right so those some of the work messages are just about where we're gonna go for launch all right so I think I'm good I have some work emails I'm I'm actually really amazed by how many icons are across itself my phone right now okay cool nothing nothing urgent so let me I'm gonna commit this now before I forget whoops and add it all your on CM so we're adding a new feature and what we're adding is category links to just okay that works and there are no breaking changes but it does affect an open issue we're gonna say yes and what do we say that was issue 107 I believe this issue 107 I can double check yeah 107 so we're gonna say this is regarding number 107 hopefully this passes everything it always makes me nervous when it takes a while yeah alright what did I do each female entities must be escaped or my 108 and one night scene this does not make very much sense I messed up something here sits freakin out indentation come on oh I see why would you tell me we're trying to do it like this I don't think it likes that I have these brackets out there it's upset alright let's share this if I can get it to work right now I'll just answer some questions and then I'll do it afterwards all right let's grow up and yeah it worked I got that saving just in time all right awesome I'm gonna do questions now Wow y'all been talking a lot in the chat I keep scrolling up trying to find where I left off I think I found it the vibe house says I correct me if that's the wrong pronunciation but they say how can I learn to develop progressive web apps with react if I am new to react Jas I would use something like create react app to start out with because it's pretty much ready to go to be a progressive web app right off the bat that would be the easiest way to get started with it so just follow their documentation as well and you know make sure you're doing everything you need to for it to be a progressive web app Eric says I'm learning both react both rails and react can you do a tutorial mixing it so I have a full stack application tutorial unfortunately I don't know any rails so I wouldn't be the right person to make that tutorial my wife is actually learning rails and react right now so maybe at some point she can do a tutorial for that but if anybody knows of a tutorial out there or if you build something with rails and react please let us know in the chat another error Oh No oh just a timeout it's just timing out because I have OBS running so it's taking too long so I'll just run it after the stream is over flexy says are you good at drawing and painting do you think I can be a frontend developer without being the greatest painter AHA yeah yeah for sure I'm I don't consider myself good at drawing or painting at all so that doesn't really matter there are some frontend developers that that are more creative in that area and they can do some design work but to be a frontend developer you don't have to have any artistic ability now that you know at least in the traditional sense of painting and drawing sculpting things like that if you wanted to be a designer it could be a lot more helpful though but I don't know that it would be necessary Rolle hate says what's the deadline for this project the deadline is kind of fluid right now we had some selfimposed deadlines that we push back for like various reasons so there's not a set deadline right now I would like to launch it before the end of the month I'm just not sure it kind of depends I have some some other people that are gonna help me work on the data that's the date has really been the thing that's taking up almost all of my time the only time I work on react stuff anymore is for the streams and the whole rest of the time I'm I'm just pulling in data and building out those routes so I just work with the the node router that we have and with WordPress data and that's it and I'm hoping to get some help with the data side of things and if that's the case then I can start to move really fast with finishing up the the you know react stuff and the styling and I think it could work but it just all depends on how much it works out you know if the people that are helping are you are able to go through it fast they don't have a lot of questions then that would be great if it ends up that you know they're not really like confident in their skills and I have to take a lot of time that to help them through it I don't know maybe not this month so definitely sometime within this month or next month though I think it's very reasonable and and I would be very surprised if it goes longer than within another month oh man Michael creo says no offense Jesse how could you tell the difference between before and after fallout in West Virginia yeah I mean they're all right West Virginia is a very poor state I'll give you that but it's also a very beautiful state it has a huge percentage of the state is covered in forests nice there's a lot of natural beauty in the state you know some of the cities are a bit rundown not you know not that much in terms of industry happening but you know it just depends on where you're at you know there's some place in West Virginia that are pretty rough and the poverty is like really really high poverty rates so yeah but some places look pretty bad Christian asked about which shortcut are you using forgetting cursor where the other word was highlighted command B so you talking about multiple cursors so I can go like like that for me it's command D that's what it wasn't Adam and I brought over all the Adam keyboard shortcuts when I switch to vs code so I don't know if it is command E and if you're on Windows I think it would be ctrl D I don't know if it's like that by default in Visual Studio code and it may be different in other editors when I don't like a song I keep pressing my keyboard to skip ahead and forgetting that I'm listening to these songs on my phone I'm glad you can't see me defend so Michael says if they based it here in Mississippi I'd ask the same question hi Michael creo says hey a VP position sign me up yeah go go Eddie you try to apply I imagine it's gonna be pretty tough for that spot Harshit says is it necessary for the site to have 100% URL backward compatibility not 100% so in most places yes but there are some areas where we can change it so in areas where content expires so for instance in events that right now on the site they don't keep events around they expire and then you can't get to the URLs anymore so we don't have to worry about those we also don't have to worry about it in job listings because they expire as well so those two areas I'm not worried about and then in the news I'm not gonna worry about it because they're just too many news posts and the URLs don't match up with the slugs like as they got pulled in from one database to the other so at some point if we have you know maybe a student worker who needs some extra work to do they could go through and try to make the slugs match up with what the old URLs were but it's not a priority for me those pages are rarely visited glad to ask what editor I use Visual Studio code Harshad s asking shredder run Apache bench on this and see the request for a second yeah I don't have a patchy bench installed right now I have been worried about the speed of requests having to go through all this so I did have an idea to split this up into multiple objects so that a request would never have to search through the whole thing so I mean that's still possible to do but if like you know if you have an even better idea than that I'm you know I'm definitely willing to go for that how cool Aniki says so some of the locations in West Virginia that the video game are going to be a set in is Camden Park The Greenbrier New River Gorge Bridge and West Virginia University wow that's cool I I used to live in the city that West Virginia University is located in sits Morgantown West Virginia so I live there for two years and I've been to that too Morgantown many many times for American football games Michael said I think you kids are crawling around in the ductwork yeah my oldest my so my my two sons have they share a room and then my daughter share a room although Cordelia always ends up sleeping in in my room so she's not really in there but anyway this my son's room is right above me so if you hear a lot of noise it's probably them like jumping around and playing jeff says practicing their ninja skills probably Anoop Singh says can we make and make OLX like app with react yes I'm not sure what kind of app that is so if you get explain it to me a little bit more I'd be happy to try to answer let's see our ketose TV says it didn't know where to ask this got my first real project I learned react recently and want to use it but don't know Redux gravity well should I take the risk of simply using expression jQuery now you shouldn't need to use jQuery if you were thinking about using jQuery to fetch data just use fetch so don't use Ajax use fetch instead so just check out the fetch API if you have to fetch on the server you can get you can get packages to help fetch work on serverside and clientside you can definitely use Express though Express is used frequently with react so yeah but anything that you're gonna want to try to do with jQuery you can already do just with react so with the exception I would say of like asynchronous calls you're gonna want to use fetch oh oh I see sorry I misunderstood so it wasn't he wasn't talking about using jQuery with react it was using jQuery instead of react yeah I mean that's a tough thing it just depends on how confident you are in your react skills if if the project has if you have a decent amount of time to finish the project I would say try to go with react and learn what you need to if it's a very short timeline and you just need to get it done then go with what you're good at right now so that I mean that'll be a call you'll have to make because you you know you know your own skills and your own timeline so yeah but I mean I I understand sometimes you just have to get stuff done so it's totally fine you know if you got a we got a you jQuery instead and then just try to keep getting better at you react until you get to the point where you know you're you're faster with that then you are with the jQuery that's exactly how I went about learning react as well I had kind of a mix between jQuery and reacts until I could take that step and just do you know straight react development Andre says do you use Gatsby in projects and do you like it I tried some stuff with Gatsby I did like Gatsby but I'm I haven't used it a lot not that there's anything wrong with Gatsby it's just this past project well I considered using Gatsby I ended up going with next I was more familiar with next anyway and then this project has been going on for a really long time I just haven't had an opportunity to try out Gatsby again but from what I did use of it it was it was pretty nice michael says do you really need users to know it's a staff or faculty job probably not but I I think like people at the university probably faculty members will I had imagined there would be some faculty members that might be a bit upset that they no longer have their own page for faculty listings and so being able to have them quickly tell like what's faculty in what staff position is probably better so but I I don't think it's necessary for the from a user's perspective but I'm just trying to avoid or have like an alternative solution there that I think will probably be acceptable or at least will sound reasonable so if anybody alright I'm gonna give you some insight into the psychology of me trying to get people on board and supporting my project so I always assume there gonna be some people that are gonna be opposed to something that I'm doing like no matter what they're not gonna like it even if I explain it and I'm not worried about those people but it making consensus around a lot of the other people who their minds are a little bit more open to the ideas so if the person that let's say doesn't want it to change would strongly object to not having a separate faculty page I could say something like you know this is gonna make things a lot more simple for people to find jobs if somebody were to accidentally go to the staff page they might not even realize that there are faculty positions and since we're listing very clearly which ones our staff and which ones are faculty we no longer need the two pages and it'll still be clear to the user which one it is possibly even more clear than it was before that logic may or may not convince the one person or it's a few people that are really one at the old way but all the rest of the people that would be listening to that logic would probably think yeah that makes sense and they'd be on board and that's really what matters because there's not really one or two people together that could be rail you know whole project or you know unless they were like let's say the president of the university or something right as long as majority the other people can see the reasonableness of what I'm trying to do that's enough to to keep going with the project so that's usually how I go into thinking about presenting things and meetings and things like that I just I try to think and identify like who's gonna have these objections and it's it's not how do I convince them it's how do I convince everybody else that my way is more reasonable and usually more user friendly cost effective and you know things like that so I find that that works well otherwise if you try to keep pushing the issue with that one person you run the risk of seeming like obsessed with one issue right or and so that you end up looking worse to everybody else right I don't know if that makes sense to you all but sometimes you just need but you don't need everybody on your side you just need most of the people on your side or the right people on your side in an organization so that that's what I usually try to do and I just always assume that there that I'm not always gonna get everybody on my side so it's just a matter of like managing the few people that won't be and so anyway that's my that strategy has worked for pretty much every project there there may be only been one or two times where I really had to implement something that I didn't think was a good idea but you know and we're talking over the course of almost three years now so I you know it's worked out fairly well Aniki says also isn't faculty technically staff I don't eat it at a university it's it's a weird situation where like faculty are in a class all their own in terms of like their compensation their hours like how they're treated is different than the rest of the people that work in the university you know they can get like tenure which is basically like a guarantee that you won't get fired unless you do something illegal nobody on staff ever gets that right and they're even weird things like if you're a parttime faculty member that makes you an adjunct adjuncts don't have access to a lot of things but if you're a parttime staff member you get a lot more benefits and then then a parttime faculty member would but if you're a fulltime faculty member you you get more benefits than a fulltime staff member would in terms of when you think about things like tenure and being able to take sabbaticals and things like that so it's definitely a huge difference between faculty and staff what's expected of them and how they're compensated at least in the United States it's like that I don't know if it's like that in other countries so he's saying extra Andre saying there's an extra slash in length all right let me check that up was that the problem the whole time no that's not it oh yeah job list they must have gotten taken care of then the extra slash John says I setup hey John thanks for joining us and John says I setup vs code editor to use the es lint RC to run prettier on each file save it's amazing behind says thanks Nikki yeah for sure it's so awesome if you're not using prettier check it out think about using it like try it it's it auto formats your code for you it's so much nicer to not have to worry about the format of your code as you're coding it's just like you have this freedom to just just get the code out there and then you know like it's gonna be alright everything's gonna be formatted the way you want it no matter how messy you put it in it's really cool Carlos is here hey Carlos how's it going Oh her she is asking about feedback on components for a JavaScript AF UI let me pull that up on the screen really quick here so I'm gonna paste this in the chat as well so y'all can check it out so harsh has been working on this these UI components here so you know check them out it's got some really nice ones here like so anyway you know check out the link check them out give some feedback if you can I think it's I don't know why it's not working some of it just might be my my machine being slow because we're running OBS yeah but you can see a lot of cool components UI components yeah so let him know what you think if you if you get a chance Bharath says could you suggest any web resources or books to understand the best react.js file component structure oh I don't really know myself I've always just kind of stuck with the structure that I've seen like in the tutorials for whatever I'm using so in this case it's next j/s I don't know I guess I haven't even thought about file structure for a while you know I just I just do what I've been doing you know that's interesting question yeah I really don't know anything off the top of my head if anybody else knows of anything that can help please put it in the live chat our ketose says thank you for the answer I was recently working on stuff using react and didn't really know how to pass data from my express server to the front end kind of how it works with ejs or handlebars okay so you know what try out next Jas because they have a like a function that allows you to pass things a little bit more easily from front end and to do serverside rendering or from the back in the front end do serverside rendering so try it out it might work for your use case its react but it just adds a little bit of stuff on to react so yeah I'm not sure but it might be worth to try to just check out the documentation and see if it would if it would be a fit for you are ketose also says might be a very new question but is is that where Redux our graph geo comes in which one do I need to learn first yeah no it's not a new question I don't think it is but so basically graph QL think of graph QL just like you would think of a REST API okay you're gonna use graph QL is just a way to query a database right so it's just like making an API call you're just using a little bit different format than you would for a normal REST API once you get that data and you could if you want to use Redux to store that data and to make sure it gets to the right components you don't have to use Redux though but if you had a large project it could potentially be beneficial to manage all your state and all your data with Redux hopefully that makes sense let me know if if it doesn't if you need some more explanation see uh John says are you just gonna take that server JS file and shrink it to a dozen lines of code it will call backend API I don't doubt Archie could do it our students work is always so impressive but I know our shoot is very busy right now with school and with side projects and things so school needs to come first I have Michael says I'm just hoping when harsh eight codes the next Facebook before he's eighteen that he remembers us if harsh it's eighteen and he's not a millionaire in charge of his own company by then then I'm gonna start my own company and hire hard [ __ ] because he's he is definitely an impressive coder our ketose is asking about context react context API I haven't used it myself yet but it kept that could potentially be used instead of Redux and might be a little bit more simple to use yet Redux is a bit tricky to learn at first so I will say that if you can do it if you can do what you need to in react without Redux I think that's usually a good thing bringing in Redux can definitely help make a complex thing more simple but if you're just dealing with simple stuff it can end up making a little bit more complex than you you need it to be see michael creo says you might want to stop talking about your job now i don't know was that when i was talking about my meetings and stuff okay Carlos says we were talking earlier about using rails with react Carlos says I would create an API and then use react to fetch the data all right that makes a lot of sense yeah and then I mean you could build things out just like we're doing use either graph QL or fetch to get data depending on how you built your backend yeah that's a good idea Kyle says how do you link graph QL with my sequel well in this particular case we've done it through a wordpress plugin I don't know how you would do it by default you know you'd have to build I don't think you'd have to build your own thing from scratch I'm sure there's probably some sort of setup that's out there are ready to do it I'm just not aware of it but we wanted to use WordPress for content management because it would be user friendly for those people who are going to be managing the content so we use the WP graph QL plugin to be able to call that my sequel database where all that wordpress data is stored and send that to our react project our ketosis thanks a lot Jesse first time on the live stream we'll definitely come back again awesome awesome I'm glad you liked it I glad glad it was useful two years so yeah I'll definitely be looking out for you in future live streams Harshit says I will be 18 on December of 2019 all right so I got to start my plan my plan to start my own company then in hire hire you Harshit will have to have to have everything ready by December of 2019 Shubham says what's the best way to learn Redux I learned Redux from the react Udacity nano degree Udacity react nano degree yeah so that's what I learned it I'm not really sure if you wanted a free resource so that's a paid program if you wanted a free resource maybe check out I don't really know does anybody know the best free resource for learning Redux there's got to be something good out there I mean I was thinking probably west boss has stuff but I'm not sure if it's free stuff or paid I don't know see Heath says so what are we building here now we just finished up with some coding for the day right now I'm doing some question and answer but we are building a react site with that gets data with graph QL yes so that's what we were working with today we do have it connected to my sequel database with via WordPress and the WP graph QL plugin but we were just doing some you know there's some basic component editing doing a little bit of work with a custom node router qasas Thank You Jessie you're welcome no problem Christian says Jessie wanna wanna partner up okay harsh it says there is a free restore resource so West boss does have a free Redux course so I haven't done any of his courses but I've heard good things about them so you may want to check them out Harshit says it's at learn redux calm Oh Carlos just thought about free code can't Redux lessons I didn't realize that they had Redux on the new curriculum okay awesome that's good to know I'm actually check that out okay Nikki says Dan Abramov has a Redux course on egghead and it's also good cool our Tito says the thing I was working on was a simple contact form after sending an email or not from Express back and I wanted to pass a message to my component and changes state according to show message okay cool yeah we're we're doing some of that in some of the the previous projects that we've done on the stream so it's definitely possible with react it's it's not it's not that difficult so yeah you can definitely use react to that krishna says how do i get into the new courses and free code camp I think everybody's automatically in now I think they switched it all over correct me if I'm wrong but I thought that's what it was and I think it's learned free code camp torgue and gets where they're at now okay I've gotten through all the chat stuff so I'm gonna finish up now been a decently long stream thank you all so much for all your help and I'll most likely be streaming again tomorrow yeah we'll probably be doing similar stuff react component stuff so I guess until tomorrow have a wonderful day
