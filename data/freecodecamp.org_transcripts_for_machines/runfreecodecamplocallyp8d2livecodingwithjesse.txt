hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to pick up right where we left off last week in the last stream and we're getting free code cam to run locally so when i say free code camp i mean the the lessons the curriculum on freecodecam.org so if you didn't see the last stream here's a quick recap of what we're trying to do we want to make we want to add some react native lessons so gwen faraday has created a react native curriculum and we want to get that running in the browser all right so react native does not run in the browser you know just as is but we can use react native web to make it run in the browser so step one is getting it getting the curriculum to run locally which we started last time so we'll finish that up this time hopefully and we'll get that running so hold on one second all right i forgot to get my music on i usually stream with music in the background because all right can y'all hear me everything cut out for a second i don't know what happened i think i'm back uh all right that was weird there's something with my internet i don't know all right but anyway i like to play music in the background and then that way i i speak a little bit louder otherwise i tend to be kind of a low low kind of speaker so i want to make sure y'all can hear me okay so i'm gonna get some music playing in the background all right i have a lot of stuff in the chat right now so i'm going to check on the chat in about uh 25 minutes or so uh and then oh yeah there's a lot of stuff so i'm just gonna say hey to everybody and then i'm gonna check on the chat about 25 minutes and i also want to let everybody know that i probably won't be streaming next week so probably won't have another stream until the week after so i'm gonna be in chicago at the end of the week for the react loop conference so anybody in chicago um let me know i have a very limited time in chicago i'll be there thursday and then just in the morning on friday and then i'm going to fly back so if i know anybody in chicago and you want to hang out let me know quickly and then maybe we can hang out on thursday and then after that i'm going to come back on friday afternoon and then drive to the beach with my family so i'll be going all week with them and i'm not going to try to stream from the beach okay all right so let's see it's been a week since we worked on this so i need to get up to date on this all right so the last thing that we were working on was trying to get to run locally and that was our that was kind of our challenge right uh also you know let me get a pomodoro clock running and let's do this trying to see where the best place to run this is thought i had one up already but i guess not pomodoro clock is just gonna be like a 25 minute timer okay all right so this is our package json so here these are the uh kind of like the commands that we have we're working with right now see challenges all right so we're going to want to see the challenges but first we actually need to i believe we need to do is get this running so let's check out our let me let me pull over a window here uh browser window i thought i had one going but from the last time i didn't close anything from the last time but you know how it is when you have too many windows open it's easier just open a new one then then define the one you have open all right so we're gonna go to github's free code camp and let's check out the contributing guide uh if you're going to do an open source project sometimes you'll find there's a contributing.md and always make sure you read that you have a much better chance of getting your pull request actually merged if you follow the instructions let's see there we go all right so we've done a lot of this stuff yes we've done this we've done this oh interesting okay so they recommend using docker i do not remember seeing that last time um so they i don't think i have docker installed on this machine so docker is uh like a container system since we already started with the local build stuff i think we'll just go on with that maybe if i have time i'll check out the docker thing and maybe we'll switch to that but for now i think this is probably probably the best way to go okay so we've done this environment variable thing let's see we're not on the docker build okay so that's the docker build we don't want that all above needs to be run only the first time you set up the local dev environment what is ci is let's um i do not believe we ran a ci on npm so let's do that also i believe we found that there's kind of a different structure here um so there's lerna was being used so we might and this is basically on the main branch there's a different structure to the project than on this branch the react native challenges branch so we're going to have to maybe do it a little bit differently so we'll see if we can't get this working we'll see lerna basically um lets you have kind of a structure where you you have um like your main project and a package json at the main level and then you have folders within that that also have their own package jsons and it ties them all together uh i wonder if i can see an example okay so like this is our main package json right and let's see if we have another one here yeah so then we have this this sub package here with its own set of stuff right so that's that's uh lerna is lerna so you could check it out if you want uh i haven't used it for a project but i was considering it for a project that i'm working on hopefully i know enough about it that we can get through this otherwise with to do a little more research all right let's go back to our docs our contributing documentation hey and i think i found the one i was originally looking at okay um on windows let's see we need to start mongodb in a separate terminal okay so let's try to run this i don't remember which one we installed all right let's let's check out our program files mongodb server 3.6 let's see which one we did all right it opened on another window let me just check this out see program files mongodb server all right we have 4.0 okay so we should be able to just copy this and we'll run this in we'll just run this on another little spot another terminal here i believe that was the command let me double check that though mongod that's that's what we wanted i think we had some issues with commands not working so we'll see if this works oops nope that's all not so that's not it uh let's see how did we get that working last time let's see um in the comments it says you can add that path to your environment variables and just run it typing mongod in the terminal oh okay all right that's cool that works um ratted to your environment variables oh or i can cd into that folder and just run it from there you know what that's how we that's how we got it last time thank you brandon so brandon's saying that's where he got stuck last time and that's what i just realized awesome okay so let's let's get that working i'm just gonna cd out of here um let's see if i can get this whoa oops there we go what was it server yeah 4.0 and then i think it was ben after that was that it yeah ben okay there we go now we can run this whoops i just need to run it all right i'm checking i'm checking the memory says i think adding it to the environment was a better choice to avoid cd every time yeah i think you're absolutely right i'm just doing it this way so that we can try to get it started quickly um but yeah you're right i think there's some setup that um that should happen there georgette says it looks like a live stream on how to debug yeah that's pretty much what this ends up being most of the time we actually get stuff done too but um especially when we're starting a project or doing something new it does end up being a lot of debugging all right um let's see so we need to run the dot exe um so let's see okay mommy's giving me the command here so let's go there we go all right cool let's see what happened here i'm gonna go starting on the localhost all right cool so it looks like it worked at me reminding me you're on windows jesse i know i know i normally develop on a mac so uh but i stream from uh pc so uh it's when it there's definitely some differences that i need to get used to so i probably only use a pc i don't know like five percent of the time that i'm on a computer probably less uh so apollo is used for being a little rusty for the pc okay so i think we have this working and so let's see if we can go on to the next step which is i believe seeding the database yep so we'll do npm run seed okay cool that that looks like it's working she completed inserted 200 new articles awesome okay very cool and you should be able to type npm run develop and that'll do everything so i'm hoping that this part is all the same on this uh branch and we'll find out in a second okay i'm just i'm i'm not used to switching between uh windows on a pc on a mac like there's really cool shortcuts to just flip around different like desktops so sorry i'm so slow oh it's doing stuff oh yeah we're using gatsby i forgot if your code camp was built with gatsby all right so we're getting a bunch of messages but nothing that's like oh here we go graphql error challenge us okay so we did actually get an error here hmm interesting all right let's go to our package.json and see if some if it's different all right i believe the seed command is different but i mean not the command just like the the script so the name of the script looks like develops the same interesting let's try oh okay in the chat it looks like a few you're telling me to do alt tab to change the windows let's see oh okay cool and it brings up all my windows awesome it's bringing them up on another screen but like oh that's really cool okay all right let's see so we typed in i'm going to try to force myself to use this alt tab dang it i must not have done it right all right i need to get the hang of this okay so we ran npm run develop but did we ever run yeah we didn't run any type of basically what i'm looking at are these commands here like this this stuff which is um the learner stuff so i think that's what i want to run is this so there's a free bootstrap post install okay let's see all right i'm gonna run some of these i'm not 100 sure that these are what i need to run but let's see i lost my terminals there we go i'm going to cancel wait is that how it works here maybe i could no how am i supposed to get out here there we go it just took a while to kill them all that's such a violent command right to kill the processes could you say like stop them shut them down okay i got about four minutes until i'm gonna go to the chat and answer some questions so if you're if you've been waiting for me to read your comment just hang in there almost there all right so what i want to try to run is this prebootstrap bootstrap and then i guess i can do preboot strap and post install although it seems like it seems like this probably should have run already after we did an npm install but i want to make sure that it it actually ran okay thank you for the uh shortcut for the terminal who did that um so uh so rob sorry if i'm mispronouncing your name but thank you for the the command there okay all right so let's try um npm run what are we gonna do pre bootstrap and this is gonna do the ensure environment okay like i said this stuff may have run already and i just didn't catch it all right now from what i know about learner let's see similar game through shop10 packages all right i kind of think that this stuff ran already and now let's try develop all right so i'm kind of expecting we're gonna get the same thing the same errors we did before but i just wanted to try it out just in case oh now we're getting the same thing this graphql error unknown field challenge node on type query on news article node hmm all right so we're still having those graphql issues we did the seed right we ran the seed command when does this start develop so develop okay so the develop command does run start develop okay and it looks like an ensure environment start to build up okay so this already runs and we ran seed okay i want to see what we ran okay so we did do seeds so that should have seeded challenges and news we do so this command here that this seed and then the little asterisk up here that means it'll run all the commands that have you know seed colon so it should have seeded both okay i think my timer yeah my timer's up i didn't get a notification so unless i just missed it but anyway let's let's go to the questions and then hopefully one of us has some idea where to go next because we keep hitting this graphql error all right i'm going to scroll off to the top try to get through as many questions as i can let's see all right so i have a few people asking me what this is about um i explained it at the beginning uh and then on the last stream that i did i also explained a lot more so i'm gonna just say like refer back to the beginning uh gabriel says what is what is the code camp all about um free code camp is a nonprofit organization that helps people learn how to code for free it has a lot of things so it has the the lessons on freecodecamp.org that are like two coding tutorials um it has a bunch of uh blog posts a youtube channel a podcast a whole like wiki site uh a forum so i'm probably missing out on stuff but there's just a ton of resources for people to learn how to code all of it is completely free okay there's a ton of stuff in the chat so i'm trying to scroll through quickly apologies if i miss your question rusty asks what language is it we're going to be using javascript let's see all right uh georgette says hey jesse do you think you can create a series in which you create an app with react native so actually the the last project that we worked on that we're not finished yet is a react native app so we're gonna go back to that once we get done with this uh so that'll be project seven so you can go back and look at all the project seven videos on free code camp uh just just my videos the live coding with jesse stuff to get an idea of how you would do a react native app uh prince the boss says do you use pomodoro to get yourself into the flow state when you start yes i do try to use pomodoro when i can at my my normal job so i'm a software engineer at dick's sporting goods we do a lot of pair programming it's kind of harder to get in the flow state when you pay a program but when i can i do try to get in that flow state and i do use pomodoro technique but it's not always possible when you're pair programming meltdown is asking for a shout out hey meltdown uh gregory says wondering is there any free code campers in georgia hey any free code campers in georgia give a shout in the chat or in the comments uh let's see uh ready and says can i fork yeah yeah for sure you can fork this repo um anybody can contribute to the free code camp repo it's not like uh um there's no prerequisites or anything well i guess you have to be smart enough to get it running which evidently i'm not there yet but i'm gonna get there and then he says hello jesse how are you doing uh hey i'm guess i'm doing all right um pretty busy this week getting ready for the conference and um uh for vacation and everything but other than that i'm doing all right thanks for asking uh goulet says do you have save recordings of your teaching javascript and html uh yeah so all my live streams are recorded and they're saved on here on the free code camp channel just search for live coding with jesse or check out the sorry check out the live coding with jesse playlist you can also check out my youtube channel the links in the description i have some tutorial videos there and also some live streams there and i'm gonna try to put out a video before i go on go to my conference or before i go to vacation on vacation um this next week um so i haven't decided exactly what the topic will be but i'd like to do another kind of short tutorial video since i haven't done one for a while okay i didn't get through everything so i'm going to mark down the time stamp where i left off so i can go right back to it he says i think if you empty your cash and try again the arrow will go okay um let's see all right that's where the shot should you empty how am i supposed to empty my cash remember this is a silly question but um let me know i'm not sure uh who's who's scifi says looks like you're really tired i'm tired it's it's uh it's not that early here it's 7 42 a.m um so it's not super early but i am a little tired okay um somebody asked me how many people are watching right now that's a good question i didn't really check uh 123 people right now so that's kind of cool that's that's a decent amount of people all right lettuces do a clean build all right let's get this out of here we don't need to see all right i'm gonna hide this on the side just for a second here because we don't really need it also going to give us some more space here okay everybody keep getting comments about why is it so dark down here it's dark right now because well number one it's it's dark outside because it's raining yes it's very cloudy i'm also in a basement so it's pretty it's pretty dark and um i just left the lights off because there's less glare on the screen it's okay all right so i guess we could try oops oh i know what i wanted to do um so we are running on a on a fork on a different branch so it may be that there are different instructions so let's go we go so we're gonna go to gwen faraday's uh repo and we're gonna there we go we're gonna go to her branch and see if nah i don't think so i was hoping that there are updates to the contributing file but i don't think there is actually we would want this file right set up free code camp locally i'm just trying to see if there's a difference here or i don't think there is no definitely not okay i probably should just open the local host just to yeah just to verify that it's not going to run oh okay so we got some more so hammy says um that's what i found on github's gatsby page the error was found before you can search for the error message on google and you'll find the steps okay cool thanks so much so let's just google that error um i'm not sure which which era i'm gonna feel let's just grab this one all right well let me see we could try npm cash clean whoa okay so feels encryption shoes interesting all right i can force this command if i want to just do that i love it you're using force i sure hope you know what you're doing all right cool and i believe the command that they said was all right so let's try that also let's look up i want to go back to the free code cam thing and i want to try to look up this error uh yeah i didn't think that this error would come up specifically usb issues all right yeah this was like this same error no yeah i don't think that's it all right cool so let's try this now develop that's it oops i'm used to using yarn and you don't have to type run with that hmm okay same thing let's see i'm checking the chat here to see what advice everybody has all right it looks like all right looks like we're still going with we need to look up the air let's see on first builds okay accessible after a second run all right and mommy said npm cash clear works for me works with no error for me hmm okay that was interesting i want to run this again that the other person there that had that error um oops there we go said when they ran it the second time it worked now we already tried twice in a row so i'm not really hopeful that this will work but it's good shot i mean that's an easy fix if it works you graphical error unknown field well it doesn't look like we're not alone in this but that also means there'll be a lot of stuff we need to go through expect there's a step shooting process the update schema steps should be processed without errors all right that that looks very close to what we have in terms of what the errors directory is clear i'm able to reproduce this and getting it on the first run i'm also seeing this air regardless cash cleared that's not really giving us a solution all right let's go back to the chat see what you all have to all think what you have to say uh think verse says what repo are you using for the fork good question um i'm using so let's grow up so this one so um gwen faraday's um fork of free code camp so it's not directly from free code camp it's it's off of her fork the reason i'm using her fork is because she has um react native lessons on there uh so that's what we need to work with okay fernando says are you missing a module i'm not sure because let's see successful after second run after clearing the cash all right mommy says successful after a second we run after clearing the cash see that's not me i'm so glad you got a success but i'm not getting a success here um so we did clear the cash but we're not getting we're not getting any success here now it is it's possible that there's some difference because of this particular branch on this fork and maybe i just need to talk to gwen and see after second second time after clearing cash i mean i guess we could try to clear try to do a clear again okay okay so this is just the same one keep saying that uh they saw a ghost behind me um as so long as the ghost helps me debug this i'm okay with that um all right yeah this is the one we just turned every time the catastrophe is cleared all right let's clear all right let's clear this and uh me are you using the same fork and branch that i am okay i'm at me saying the cause of the air is gatsby and not graphql that's what i understood don't know all right let's see you know what let's run learner i actually think all that runs so there's definitely a difference so i believe all this stuff with lerna is not present in the main free code camp uh branch and the documentation we're running off of is based off of that maybe that's where the difference is coming in okay the only other thing i can think of is clearing the cache and completely removing um all the node files but it looks like it's remove existing node modules before install so it says it's doing that let's try this out now okay cannot read property minimum level of undefined all right i'm going to take a look at what we're getting here a little bit more closely hmm hmm all right and mimi says you can check can you try using a newer version of gasping graphql john hanson says i recently had a similar issue turned out to be windows 10 path issue i cleaned up path variables and ran a node repair fix it for me oh okay um john could you walk me through that then so this is interesting so uh like i mentioned before i don't normally develop on uh windows so maybe this is some sort of windows thing hammy are you on a pc2 i'm also going to run this just one more time since this would be the second time after clearing the cache again which worked before for uh for hammy and i got about three minutes before the next timer goes off and then i'm gonna go back and answer some more questions i'd love to get something running so so far we got running which we didn't get running last time i don't think so we had one small win all right so that did not work all right so john's saying npm config path prefix should show the path john says open environment variables in windows i'm going to open environment variables i'm going to find this i need to like is there a search on windows where can i search for stuff on windows there we go type here to search oh it opened on another screen let me move this over all right environment vehicles clearing the castles okay me was on ubuntu okay okay make sure your pass system variable includes your node.js path all right environment variables okay okay include your no jazz path i'm guessing is that would that be the right path i'm showing users jesse app data roaming npm in the path on the system variables oh sorry sorry sorry oh okay let's see what we got here okay all right yeah program files node.js is here should i have something separate for npm all right john says the path looks fine for no jazz so i guess it's not a path thing okay i actually wonder now go to add or remove programs all right all right node this is some some legit debugging here debugging windows um all right all right so we found node and we're gonna run run repair modify and repair repair we're going to repair node i hope this works and it's helpful for somebody out there all right while this is happening i'm gonna read some questions and stuff oh is it finished already huh i guess i'm not going to read questions as well as john instances you may want to reboot the system all right well i'm not going to reboot in the middle of a stream so i might have to wait until the next stream the only other thing i thought of doing was so i could do yarn develop and see if it does anything different and i know it seems weird but like i have had it happen before that a command will work with yarn but not with npm so it's worth it worth a try it looks like no same thing same air all right i'm gonna do that and i'm also gonna do clean out the node module taking out node modules and the package lock json doing like the legit destroy everything whoa let's see let's try this all right so that'll take a little bit and i can go back to the questions now all right so i'm scrolling all the way up to where i left off so hopefully i don't miss anything georgette says why didn't you continue your last episode react native on browser actually this is a continuation of the last episode um this is kind of the first step in that all right cool that took less time than i thought it would um and start the next oh same error may as well run it twice since since the people on uh on github had success trying to run it twice not really that hopeful at this point though uh i don't think we're gonna get this to work during today's stream which is all right uh it may just be that since we did the repair i just need to restart my computer i'm not going to do that obviously because if i do that it's going to cut the stream off so i'll have to do that after the stream and then hopefully it'll work for the next stream also i'll probably reach out to gwen and ask if there's anything special i need to do um since her project is set up differently so let me i want to show you just so that maybe it's a little bit more clear like how this um what i mean by setup differently right so if we look at like the package json for this and then we go to the normal free code cam master branch and look at the package json let's see if it's looks like there's learning here now maybe i had an older version whoa looks like no dependencies actually there's a lot more going on here now i wonder where's the last time six months all right so the last commit to this was on february 10th about this one january 6. it's possible and the last commit on this was three days ago it's entirely possible that there have been some breaking changes and that's why we can't get it working so i wonder i wonder if it would be a better idea and i don't have time to do it today but um it would be a better idea to try to get free code camp running from like it's its latest updates from the main repo just to get it running then we can pull over like let's say one of the challenges that gwen did as a test to try to get that running because as long as we get it running then gwen can incorporate that into what she's doing and then eventually hopefully that can get put into the free code camp curriculum so everybody can learn some basics of react native i am going to try to do a restart on my machine just to see if i get it working if that doesn't work then i think we're going to go with that plan let me know what you all think about that plan so the the backup plan here is clone so fork and clone the main free code camp repo with the latest changes and try to get it running based on that because that's we're using documentation from the latest repo but we're trying to get something to run that hasn't been updated since february 10th so it's entirely possible that that's part of our issue so the the plan is use the main repo next time if we can't get this one to work let me know what you think of that plan if you have a better plan or if there's something i'm missing here that's like obviously a bad idea uh what exactly is gatsby um gatsby is just a i don't know you would just say like uh a tool or something like um to build sites with um with react um i guess i don't know how to explain it more than than that um from what i understand and i haven't read up on gatsby or tried to use it in a long time but you can use markdown um and then that gets changed into like actual like web pages uh so i think a lot of people use gatsby for for blogs and they can write their stuff in markdown all right and uh i'm not going to read all the comments out i'm just kind of going for the questions now because i'm running out of time here so apologies if i'm not reading out your comment i am looking at them i'm just not reading them out loud uh georgette says what does fork mean uh so a fork is if if you go on github to a repo you can fork the repo and that means that it it just takes everything in this repository and it copies it onto your github account so that you can then work on that code without affecting the main repository so usually if you're going to contribute to a repository the process is fork it first then clone your fork so that you can run it locally and make changes and then if you change your fork you'll have the option of then submitting a pull request to the main repository and whoever controls that repository can decide whether or not they want to merge that pull request which means your code will then become part of their code part of the main repository uh i did check out my youtube channel i believe i did some git and github videos that explain this in more depth so um i guess check that out if you need if you want more info about that i think that i did do i have done some live streams where i've done that whole process before i don't remember what the exactly what the titles of those streams are though uh atse says i want to learn programming from you can you please send me your direct contact number future correspondence um i have some links to my social media stuff in the description uh if you want to send me a dm or something that's cool i'll try to help you out uh yes he says where am i from um i'm from the united states specifically i was born and raised in west virginia which is a part of the united states and right now i live in ohio and i work in pittsburgh pennsylvania in in the united states i had i see a couple questions about like what am i coding what it's going to be if you go back and watch the last stream the last video um so project eight day one i go through all of that of like what i'm building and what we hope to accomplish mimo says basement sleepless dark theme dark room good probability of having no girlfriend or whatsoever this guy is epic hashtag real life programmer well i'm i'm sorry to disappoint you uh but i am married and i have four kids so i i don't fit all of that but i am in a basement uh i do have dark theme everything and i'm in a dark room um the sleep sometimes i get sleep sometimes i don't and it's not really about programming it's more about like which kids wake up uh who's his iphone says are you a gamer by the way i don't know a former gamer i don't have a lot of time for for games right now i do like them i just i don't have a lot of time to play um love your video ryhon says love your videos please make a basic tutorial of complete react.js how to use templates um yeah maybe i'll do some basic react.js stuff at some point usually i put the tutorials on my youtube channel uh links in the description to that because i haven't updated that channel in a little while but i'd like to do another video sometime this week for that channel uh says what's a good way to learn a lowlevel language i don't really know a good way like for me a good way for me to learn anything is i try to find free resources online do the tutorials watch the videos read the documentation um and then if i really want to learn something actually building a project with it is a great way to learn uh uh randy keller says what kind of fancy typewriter is that very fancy typewriter here uh i lost my place i don't know why i it just get down it moved my scroll all the way down to the end of the chat and so now i lost my place let me see if i can find it again all right i did um georgia there was a question but i think it was directed at somebody else and not at me um do you prefer python or javascript i prefer javascript because i'm better with it i don't have anything against python i've used it before and i kind of like it but i'm definitely better with javascript now georgette says you should rename the live stream as a series of debugging yeah honestly that's all it's been so far we're gonna actually do something at some point but we gotta get the setup down first um i've always wanted these streams to be like a realistic look at what it's like to be a developer or software engineer and realistically a lot of time is spent debugging like things like this happen so that's why i leave stuff in here i don't edit the streams i don't delete streams like because as as weird as it is to have a live stream like this and not actually get very much done like sometimes that's the way it is when you actually um you know working at a company uh okay so i had mentioned my um all right so uh so i noticed somebody put in a derogatory remark i'm assuming it was meant to be derogatory i don't know but i just deleted it so just as a reminder everybody we try to stay positive here so um and georgette thank you for putting that message in about no negativity here so we stay positive uh if i see anything in the chat like i'm just gonna delete it i'm not gonna argue with anybody like so just you know if that's your thing this really maybe isn't you're not gonna have a good time in here uh if you wanna be negative uh there's enough negativity elsewhere in the world and online so uh but here we try to stay positive so just a reminder to everybody uh you know keep it keep it positive um i mentioned the idea of let's just try to go with the main free code camp branch next time uh john i believe in response that says that sounds like a good idea i got some thumbs up for that so i think that's probably what we'll end up doing uh dts says what are skills required uh for a present web developer i mean the the skills that you need to be able to like learn fast on your own because everything changes so quickly so problem solving skills as well now in terms of like technical skills i mean html css javascript for sure you definitely need that for web development anything else on top of that is really going to depend on what the particular project is you know and what your client or your company uses but if you know html css and javascript you're going to have a good foundation to pick up anything else um dale asks if the stream just started or attending uh it's ending now but you can always watch the recordings the recording will be available sweetie sweetie sweaty ass what are you doing right now right now i'm just answering questions in the live chat uh did the body ask for blockchain tutorials uh i did do some blockchain live streams on my youtube channel so the link to my channel is in the description uh you can check that out it was a while ago but i used um solidity to do some like ethereum uh apps so maybe you know you could check that out i'm no expert at it but if you want to kind of see what it's like just you know check it out all right cool uh so i got through all the questions like i said i did read everything i read all the comments so there's a lot of a lot of people are complimenting uh and i appreciate that thank you so much um i'm gonna wrap this up now and like i said i probably won't stream again until maybe like july or maybe the very end of of june because i got conferences and vacation coming up but i'll be on social media so if you want to talk to me there i'll definitely be there i'm on twitter and instagram a lot and i'm going to try to put out a video on my youtube channel this week as well so if you if you want to talk to me go ahead again i'm going to be in chicago at the end of the week so if i know anybody in chicago reach out to me uh maybe we can hang out get some coffee or something on thursday thursday will probably be the only day i'll be able to hang out of this week uh all right so thanks everybody uh it was a good show i had fun in this stream it was good i mean it's we found didn't really fix what we were trying to fix uh but that's the way it goes sometimes so we got a good plan for next time i'm excited about that i think we will get it to work next time and uh yeah so until then have a great next couple of weeks and um yeah thanks again for watching
