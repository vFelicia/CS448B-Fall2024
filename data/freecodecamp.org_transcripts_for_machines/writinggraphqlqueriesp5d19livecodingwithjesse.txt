everyone welcome to live coding with Jessie today we're going to do some things with graph Q up so if you've never heard of graph QL before or maybe you just haven't worked with it yet I'm gonna do my best to explain things just start out let me go through some of the technology that we're using and then that way if you want to go check it out at least you'll have the names of everything you can check out some previous streams as well to see where we set up some of these things but first of all we're building a react website and we're using Apollo to help us write the you know graph QL queries to get the data we're getting the data from a my sequel database right through WordPress right so it's just a normal WordPress installation but we also have added a plugin called WP graph QL that's gonna let us send queries to that plugin and then it's going to do its thing to get the data that we need and then send it back to our react app so what we need to do today is write the correct query to get the data that we need and be able to display that data on the page so we've done that once already for a different page and Harshit who is frequently on the channel frequent contributor really talented coder has already set a lot of this up for us so this isn't going to be a from scratch video but we you will get at least some of the basics of how graph QL works all right I apologize for scheduling this stream so late this was busy with other things and then just it kind of realized how late it was thought oh schedule this so I know there's probably gonna be some of you who won't get to see this live because you won't get the notification to later so I apologize for that I'll do my best to schedule earlier tomorrow also sorry that I wasn't able to stream yesterday it was there's actually a water line break so the main road to get to where I work is the big hill there's a water line break at some point on the hill and water just went everywhere all over the road down the hill and it was so cold that it froze so no one could go up or down the road and so no one could get to work so that's why I didn't stream yesterday those at home and as many of you know my internet connection just can't handle streaming at home so anyway but I am in the office today it's warmed up and I think it's just slightly above freezing so roads should be fine so let's get started and if you have any questions just go ahead and put them in a live chat and I'll answer some questions a little bit later on in the stream I'm gonna start a timer here to remind me to check back in and answer those questions and so I have this is the data that we're going to try to get so I've pulled over and we've done this in previous streams if it's shown how I'm migrating data from sequel server database over into WordPress so I've migrated these they're called directories in the in the database so they're directors they're basically just listings of each department here at the University I work at and who works there with their title is what building they're in and what their phone number is so I'm hoping that they're all kind of in the same order we'll find out when we pull the data over but that's all we just need to pull over you know this piece of data is for the title and this piece of data here and we're just going to display that so I already have the I'd set up and we'll show you that now whoops I forgot to change the camera apologies here's what I was talking about we're just gonna grab this data say it wasn't really that important we're just gonna grab the title and the content from WordPress all right so let me show you first of all the page so we have a react component if you're familiar with react this should should look familiar to you just pretty much a normal react component we have some different things going on since we're using next we have this get initial props function available and this helps us be able to pull in data both on the server side and client side so anything that we try to grab inside of this function will also that that data wall so B input into the markup that is built on the server for our serverside rendering so that's pretty awesome and that that's an XJS thing so you won't find this in every react project and so what we this is a copy this was just a copy of one we've done already for our posts jas so we're just going to get the ID from our URL we're gonna pass it and when the user goes there and that's going to be the slug that we need to be able to display to be able to grab the right piece of data and then we're just going to display that so we have the title well we are we're gonna have to add one tag just to display the title but we'll wait till we get some data in before we put that in but we'll display the content here and I've already changed this to be directories so this is setup properly the only thing that we're going to need to change is we're not using this sample query anymore we're going to create a new query and I'll probably end up changing the name of this query when heart should set it up it was an example so that's why I was named sample query but I changed it you'll see here this query to be the post J s so we ought to change the name as well and actually our shits in the stream right now so hey everybody I see some activity on watch at harsh it let me know and anybody else who who's worked with graph QL let me know is it the common practice to have a different JavaScript file for each type of query or is it a more common practice to have multiple queries in the same file I think in a previous project we had multiple queries in the same file oh hey Jason's here Jason is the creator of WP graph kilo which is the plugin on the WordPress side of things that is going to help us you get the data so that's awesome well when when Jason's here it's always a big help I appreciate it oscy so jason said in another meeting but it fall along yeah that's cool thanks thanks for joining us even though you're busy with another meeting I really appreciate it okay someone away it's like I'm not getting the response from hurshe maybe he's not able to watch live let's see alright so I really think I said I really kind of think it's gonna get there's gonna be way too many files if we try to put everything in a different file right okay harsh it's back arson I just wanted to know if it was common practice to have a different JavaScript file for each query or to put the queries all in one file or maybe hear them into several files part of what says hey how's it going all para I want to know which library Apollo we're using Apollo for our you know on the react side of things so in any case basically it's going to be very similar our query it's gonna be let me double check but I think it's going to be almost exactly the same obviously we're not gonna get we're not gonna say faculty we're gonna say directories and we're not gonna say faculty departments in fact I don't think we have any categories at all okay Harshit says that you can put you can actually put the queries right in the component if you're not going to reuse them i I think I want to keep them separate for now there's a chance that we may reuse some of these I'm thinking especially like this faculty query you know we may want to pull that in we talked last week about maybe having highlighting some faculty members on the homepage so we may want to pull in something from our faculty pages and I'm assuming you know we're gonna have some other things like that so for now I'm gonna make things everything a separate component if we want to when we go to refactor some of this if we find some things that we're sure we are not going to reuse we can always change it up let's see okay Paula asks we using Apollo server or Express graph QL let me see Harshit set this up we think our should I assume we're using Express graph QL because we do have expressed at least I was pretty sure we were running Express yet did I see it no are we not bringing anything in it right now for that I guess not all right so let's let's just make a whole new file then and eventually we're going to change this we will sort this out as far as kind of the standard names for our files in our queries but for now let's just grab all of this let's make a new file let's call this directories ojs let's paste this in and what's let's change our query name to directory query we're going to change this to directories and we don't need one two three just counting out loud the number of Semak or the number of curly brackets I have and I don't think we needed that at all let's see id title slug content that looks looks like what we need all right great so let me save that alright just an answer to par watts question let's see how it says we are using PHP WordPress graph QL server provided by WP graph QL plugin and personally I recommend using Apollo server I like more than Express graph QL harsh it says install graph QL plugin just feels code would have a plugin syntax relatives queries oh all right whoo I will I won't so that I'm not gonna sell it right now during the video unless you all think that would be good to show let me know in the live chat if you'd like to see me install a Visual Studio code plugin in the live stream otherwise I'll wait and do it later thanks for letting me know though that'll be useful because we're gonna end up writing a lot more of these queries before this project is over all right let's go back to our directory dot j s page component and let's change this to director is is I what I said let's see what I named it directory query directory query all right I want to set this up the same way so we had before wonderful all right let's see now I think we have enough to test this yeah so I already let me show you the server I've already changed this before so I added here in our server that when we want to go to when a user goes to our site's URL so be Franciscan dot edu slash contact slash whatever's after that second slash will get passed along as the ID to our directory component so the the route it's parameterised that's going to say so parameterised routing so you can check that out in the next documentation so even though next comes with its own router sometimes you still want to do some things like this not really hard to do so I'm if you want to see the full thing you check out the repo to check out the repo for next as well there's a link to this repository in the description below alright so let's go here I do want to make sure our slugs Counseling Center since we have this one up let's try to go to that one so we'll go I think it's three thousand yep so here's a site and let's say here we go I must have tried it before so the reason directory query is not defined alright that I'm not I must have missed a step let's check it out whoops I forgot to import it that's I figured directory query from directories so up here we're importing a lot of the different things that we need so if you didn't see I was importing the wrong query so when I try to call that query down here of course it didn't find anything the reason I'm using contact and not directories in the URL is because the current site uses contacts for for their URLs so I want to keep the URL so you can see here we are the data has come through and actually the title did come through so there must have been oh yeah it did have an h2 already in here so that's I was thinking I'd have to make an h2 in the component but it's already there that's wonderful and the formatting actually is not really that bad I think I can live with that formatting really I mean obviously we want well you know we're gonna want some padding and things like that but just in general not really too bad for that formatting I mean really if anything it might not be a bad idea to have it stacked so that it's you know named title and then building and phone number although since they've added this in is this this pipe here does make it difficult but not bad all right so let me let me test out a few more just to see if we have consistent in the consistency with all with our data I've checked a few but I haven't checked everything so let's go in here and see let me check out my department let's see what the slug is all right now about a little bit different so for some reason we have a lot of space in here and we have a phone number at the top but so not bad but the format of everything you know here is the same and there I am don't call me during the stream that will just feed the stress but all right not bad we just have to keep in mind it's kind of doublecheck these to fix the spacing and things let me try one more as I think we may have some departments that are a little irregular remember see if I can remember which one was a little bit different I see let's let's go through the say oops type the wrong thing in let's check out the live version of the site right now Franciscan dot edu slash contacts let's see general contact info admissions let me just open up several there we go admissions was the one that was that was different let's see if wow this is interested missions had a completely different URL as well maybe that didn't even come through see there's little things like this that are making this somewhat difficult no admissions wasn't even part of this so yeah what I I guess we'll just have to be aware of this and try to figure out you know what to do I'd love to keep as many of the URLs intact as I can but some of the structures not really I don't it doesn't make a ton of sense right so I I do get that this page is supposed to be for prospective students so they wanted to make it different maybe more attractive for students a little different layout but the whole change in URL makes it I don't know it just makes it problematic I guess for trying to organize everything so there may be some cases where we might want to display the same content on two different pages because you know I think it would make more sense to have admissions underneath that section of you know contact right but it it may also make sense to have the admissions counselors listed in the admissions section right also you can see who's not listed here there's some people maybe I just have to go to the next page but there are definitely some people in the department who are not listed here at all so for now we'll just go on to the next one alright this look standard department chairs all right that looks pretty standard I want to know if that actually came in contact up into my shoes great that did come in good contact directories I had this one I'm not sure what this one is why was that even in there Wow so development departments link is a link to a different site this is a bit of a mess let's I about three minutes left on this this Pomodoro cycle and then we'll go to the live chat but I think this is gonna be some change to how we do this because from a user experience standpoint I don't think this is the best if you're trying to go through and get contact info for this depart these departments you know there's a certain standard layout for some departments whether you go to admissions and it's different it doesn't even show all the employees you go to development and it takes you to the site where you have go to give money to the university it doesn't even list the people that work in development so we're gonna have you're gonna be different I think we're gonna maybe like have to either we'll do it you know I'll do it or we'll get someone else to do it put in in WordPress you know some extra directories that follow the standard pattern to make up for those sections that we're seeing here that that just link off to unexpected places even some of the office of Khattak addicts doesn't even have a link Community Relations I mean I realize they do have a phone number but you know what we'll have to see because this is definitely you know a bit confusing and we may have to to make a page like this so the page that is just contact will have to be may I don't think it all came in I thought it was this one yeah this does not look like it's the same as this page is it general contact info let me double check maybe it was yeah maybe it is okay so we do have this that's good alright so we maybe will just have to work out the URL then that's good news at least we have something to go on all right I'm gonna go to the live chat now I know we have a minute left but I mean what am I really gonna get done in a minute so let me start this short break timer and I'm gonna check out what's going on in the live chat so I got a little distracted I got a message from my wife I just she's asking me a coding question my wife's learning how to code she's doing the Flatiron school right now Mikey says something about spaghetti not sure not sure what you're referring to Mikey may have to clarify okay par what mentions saying a polo server is is not stable okay I'll keep that in mind thank you Nura asks why are you not in Facebook live I've never done Facebook live is there a reason why I should be on Facebook live as far as I know free code camp doesn't do live things on Facebook so we have a presence on YouTube I'm pretty sure there was a twitch channel as well but I don't think we do anything with that right now Paul watt says hey Jessie who set up this project Harshit did a lot of the setup so I mean I did the initial setup of you know next right and I created like some of the layout but then in terms of all the graph QL stuff Harshit set all that up so pretty much everything in this lib folder har should set up a little bit everything I've done in here has just been slight modifications you know based on our needs with the data so it's been a collaboration if you want to know really who did what check out the repo and look at the the commits let's see all right so harsh it said the name of the visual studio code plugin for graph QL is is in his blogs if you've never been to harsh its blog very helpful and informative it's HP tech blogs comm so check that out there's a lot of good good blog posts in there about you know react and different technologies for really like full stack development Paul watt says hello everyone I have a github repo of graph QL real ajs implemented you can check it out my username and github is par 108 so that's P a RW 8008 thanks for what I appreciate that maybe I'll check that out see depending on how long the stream goes maybe I can check out out after I do have to leave work a bit early today so I may not have time but I will check that out JC Q says hi from Malaysia hey how's it going thanks for watching netskope says I always have trouble making navigation bars got any tips from me it depends on what you're using so if or if you want to let make it from scratch you know with just CSS HTML then I don't it just really depends on what style you want to make I would look at I usually copy and paste code from previous projects or check out how its implemented in other projects but if you're using some sort of framework if it is just a regular HTML site you know check out bootstrap or materialise or foundation or one of those and it'll help you a lot with the navigation borås if you're using react you can check out you know material UI or uh there's a react bootstrap there's you know there's a lot of different options but you you could probably find a component library or a single component that would do a lot of the work for you so I mean you definitely have some options there and then once you get through it you know once you have some code to go with you know you can always copy and paste and adapt it you know for for future projects so anyway that's my advice if you want a more specific advice and you have like a particular project you're working on now you know let me know send me a link to it or something to the code I I could check it out and help out so but just in general you know I'd say you know don't try to do it all from scratch if you don't have to you know definitely use some of those the resources that are available all right and there's a few more questions my timer went off but I'm just going to go through these last few questions that are on here this is I'm so close to the bottom the hopeless Brit s opinions on learning PHP versus learning JavaScript with node do you think we'll see PHP dropping off or do you think it will always be an item in it depends on what you want to do I think if you want to be well it if you want to be a frontend developer you must learn JavaScript JavaScript is everywhere no matter what's used in the backend if you want to do backend stuff though you don't have to go a node right PHP is still a valid option a lot of things use PHP it's not going anywhere anytime soon just WordPress alone the existence of WordPress and how popular it is I think guarantees PHP is going to be around for a while because WordPress runs on PHP and if you want to specialize in that then definitely learn PHP but what I'm doing and I I kind of recommend this unless for some reason you you know really like another backend language is just go full stack JavaScript you know we don't have all the time in the world right people are busy you only have a certain amount of time to dedicate to learning so why not learn one language and be able to do frontend backend right it's a lot easier so I mean that's the way I look at it so I'm focusing solely on JavaScript both front and backend I do way more with the frontend but as you can see on these streams we still have to do some things with servers and form handling sending emails and things like that so we do work in the backend a bit but I think either one is still a valid option for backend programming PHP or node I do see I don't know numbers but I get the feeling that using node on the backend is getting more popular I don't know if PHP is necessarily dropping off but I I don't get the feeling that is it is you know gaining more traction so that's just my feeling though from you know social media and articles and things I don't have any numbers on that so don't don't take that as for sure hopefully that answers your question Victor says being new to programming should I learn to program JavaScript before languages like Python alright so this kind of fits a little bit with the last question and I would say it all depends on what you want to do if you want to get into more stuff with the web JavaScript for sure if you're not sure what you want to do and maybe you're interested in I don't know like game development or data science or like machine learning I think Python is a great choice I don't know that much in Python but the little bit that I have you know done with it I enjoyed using Python the other option to consider is if there's a certain company you want to work for or a certain type of program you want to do you may want to do some research into what's used right if if you if the company you want to work for only uses Python no sense learning JavaScript right or it could be they could be using something else you know completely so once you weren't learn one language it is a lot easier to learn the second one so don't feel like you'll always be stuck with with that one it's you know programming is programming it's dropping from one language to another is mostly just learning new syntax all right netskope says yeah use bootstrap already so this was the question from earlier about navigation bars so netskope says I use bootstrap usually but sometimes you have a project at school we're not allowed to use this stuff and just need HTML CSS this is where I usually get stuck okay all right good that's a little bit more specific I would say this check out what's going on behind the scenes in bootstrap so look at one of your bootstrap projects where you have a navigation bar that looks kind of like how you want it to look on your your plain CSS project and go in dev tools inspect things and see what's the actual CSS behind those class names and then maybe you'll get an idea for for how it's done right you can take that then adapt it to what you need and I think that's a good way to see how they do it you can even try you know check out some other sites and see how they do it you know you'll find differences there's there's not just one way to to do it you know even the positioning of all the links and things there are several different ways in CSS that that could be done sometimes depending on what the menu does you know there may be JavaScript in use so that's what I would do just do some some dev tools inspecting and that should give you a give you an idea of of how different things are done all right there's all right let me a hardship is really excited about me installing this plugin so let me install it really quick so command P and what are we gonna do and paste all right let's all right let's check it out that actually was really fast our shoot you were right where's our I think I have anything open in terms of directories oh here we are okay cool now we have some nice syntax highlighting with our queries awesome thanks argit that was super easy all right let's see alright well we actually we we did what I wanted to do and we finished it in one Pomodoro session so I mean I I thought it it was possible that we could do it but I we just did it really fast so I guess I'm gonna go through the live chat a bit if there's anything that anybody wants to see me actually do I in this project let me know otherwise I'm just going to do some live chat stuff this may end up being a short stream and unless I can think of something that would fit you know kind of with what we're doing but so we have a comment here from Basel and it says hello it says guys hello from Ukraine hey how's it going is it basil or basil how is it how is it pronounced let me know I want to make sure I pronounce it properly for you the hopeless bridge says I think it's always good to learn it without a framework first move on to learning frameworks for CSS and navigation stuff hopeless bread also says node is growing here in the UK and cheers for the response oh no problem hope hopefully it was helpful netskope says is it normal that I want to learn everything like web development app development game development etc yeah you know what I think that's normal especially if you're starting out something you said earlier you were in school so yeah I think that's that's normal you're not really gonna know what you want until I think you start to specialize and even then there's always going to be a part of you that says wow it would be cool to work with this so I mean I still do that I've been doing web development I don't know I've been a frontend developer here for two and a half years and then before that I was freelance for a few years and I there's still times when I read about you know some other new tech technology and I'm like wow that's really cool I want to get into that so but I'm happy with what I do you know you can't learn everything and you can't expect certainly can't be an expert at at more than you know one or two things at once unless you know maybe you're you're some type of oneinamillion genius or something like that but even then someone who's a genius could always be better at one thing than at multiple things at once right that's that's what specialization does specialization is great because you get better at one thing but saying yes to that one thing means you're saying no to all the other things is you only have so many hours in the day but anyway at that point at this point though netskope I'd say try out a little bit of everything and figure out what you really like and then go into that and then you could always switch later on so you know don't feel like you got a I'm not saying you do feel like this but in case it happens don't feel like you you know you're gonna get trapped in one you know one area the horseshit says my first language was Java by the way oh cool haven't really done that much with Java for a long time once did a little game in Java though it was fun hopeless Britt says Java is great never really supported the fact that our uni made us learn both Java and then C++ yeah when I the the one computer for a main course I took in college was C++ made it calculators Mohan says hello from India looks like I'm a bit late to the party you know what I got finished with what I wanted to do so much earlier than I normally do mainly because everything worked North normally I messed something up and it takes a lot longer but everything worked this time so I'm happy that it worked but I guess it makes the live stream a little bit boring let's see the hopeless Britt says what do you often find more challenging / rewarding frontend backend or fullstack I definitely for me at this point I think backend is more challenging I've been doing frontend for longer and it's it's so visual I think it's really easy to see when you haven't got it right and when you got it you know you can just look and see alright that looks great or you can tell immediately that won't work that's terrible it looks awful backend is not like that as much you know they're so coming from the front end and now trying to learn back end of course back end is is more challenging to me front end seems more rewarding though simply because you see your result at the end of the day and other people see it like I never have compliment somebody saying like oh you know you the back end on that app is just amazing no nobody says that they always say all the sites so beautiful it's so clean it's fast so the back end may have something to do with all that but people don't see it now if personally rewarding I do really like when I get something to work in in the backend because it's hard for me so it is rewarding in that sense I would love to be fullstack at some point I think it would be fun and provide you know for a lot of variety I'd also be able to you know complete you know create things you know completely on my own if possible I really do like working with other people especially with with you all on projects but if I really wanted to I could create a project on my own so I'm moving towards that direction I mean I think for those of you who watch the the stream you know for a while now I think you probably have seen more of a progression of you know us getting into more backend things so I've definitely come a long way you know just you know in the last year with that but you know for now I'm front is my thing actually that reminds me I talked with I was talking with somebody yesterday about learning management systems and they were talking about how there's just not a lot of good options out there especially for open source learning management systems and I know we've talked about it before on the stream but I think I really want to start working on a learning management system built with react fullstack JavaScript like progressive web app style right I may be there's something like that out there but I don't know about it yet I just think that would be very useful especially for you know companies just starting out they don't have a ton of money to be able to commit to one of like the big learning management systems I don't know I think it would be cool make something that's really fast can work offline you know just think how much like in countries that don't have reliable internet access like how nice would it be to be able to have a progressive web app as your learning management system so that like a nonprofit could just use this opensource system you know in a lot of those places so you know people have cell phones you can just load it you know as a web page right and you know we could even do a you know an app with it if we wanted but loaded as a web page you know load up a lot of the stuff you need for the class so that when you don't have a connection it's right there you can do your tests and everything when you do get a connection everything just gets synced up oh yeah that would be really useful if someone knows or something like that that's already out there you know let me know I'd be happy to check it out or maybe even help contribute but if there's nothing like that right now I think that would be a really cool thing to work on so if anybody else thinks that would be cool to work on you know let me know I'm you know I'm busy I mean I think we're all kind of busy but that that's something important that I think it would be cool to make time for and could really help you know help out a lot of people so anyway you know I would need probably I mean obviously like frontend design stuff I got that a lot of the react things you know I have that but this would be something where you know you would need it connected with a database and I'm I'm not great with databases you know we would need some type of login system user authentication we definitely want it to be secure right there's gonna be student records and things so there's going to be a lot of areas where I'm just not gonna have the knowledge and it's probably not the best use of my time to try to get better in those areas if that's not really my thing right now if I have to I have to but if anybody out there knows more about that and wants to help you know let me know I think it'd be a cool project so maybe I'll make a repo for it soon you know just so that we could you'll get started get some ideas start talking about it alright I'm going to go back to the I'm gonna go back to the live chat now and answer some more your your questions Lucas says good afternoon my friend good afternoon thanks for watching rook says what does the with rude higherorder component actually do something with styles let's see with root component where we get where am I missing that was that what it was called there are my components there we go yeah so let's check this component out we're bringing in our styles go with your background all right yes so this is wrapping our our mui themed provider is from obviously material UI so this is wrapping everything you know within our app in there and then yeah we got a lot of other stuff going on with our styles which I'm not even sure I'm assuming this is a lot of the stuff I think are she did this I'm assuming this is a lot of the setup from the material UI Doc's on how to bring in on how to bring this stuff in but basically yet what it's doing is just making sure that all the material UI theme stuff is available in our components ours it says as project is getting to completion what is your deployment plan will you be using digitalocean site now is getting really good you can scale to multiple servers on one command with managing servers I you know what would have to think more about that but I I don't think I'm gonna go with digitalocean I think maybe AWS so Amazon Web Services or I'm open to something like using using site I've I've done some side projects on site and I do really like it it's really easy so I'm gonna have to reassess yeah it's been a couple months since I first came up with a deployment plan we actually even before that I started planning it out you know a year ago so maybe I should reassess before I really have to launch and see you know is the plan that I came up with before still the best way to do it maybe not maybe there's better a way to do it now that you know that I either didn't know about or didn't exist before so I'm glad you brought that up it would definitely be helpful to be able to scale things up with a command instead of managing multiple servers so that's a really good point hard yeah whatever we do we just have to make sure it has all the functionality that we that we need which really I mean we don't even have contact forms on the site right now so it's actually gonna be pretty basic so I just want it to be fast whatever we do it just needs to be fast and reliable see the hopeless bridge says great job with that sequel and PHP very true you never hear that I don't remember what I said the hopeless Brit I don't remember what I said that that comment is is directed toward let's see hopeless spirit said I have to say I think projects like Khan Academy gave me my inspiration to move towards the full stack developer side of things cool you know what I actually haven't looked at Khan Academy for years I'm gonna have to check that out and see what they have available on the site even for my own kids I think maybe it'd be useful all right in regard to this component this with route Harshit says it server renders material UI stylesheet and classes using JSS okay and then reuses the context on the client all right that makes a lot more sense as I was looking at this I kept thinking this is a lot more setup than we've used before with the theory you I and that totally makes sense now so to be able to use material you I with our serverside rendering and on the client side then that's where a lot of this stuff had had to happen so thanks for clarifying that hard dragster says I have a question can I use react without node J s I guess I believe you can I have never done it but right correct me if I'm wrong but you can it you can use react without node right because you can use reacts clientside right okay he's saying right I don't want to say anything wrong so let me know if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure you use react without note and if I you can use it just clientside if you want to I should also says you don't need to manage the SSL's if you use it that's cool I'm not really worried about the SSL it's kind of you know once you set it up and set up the Auto renew it's it's not that hard you know it's only it you know less than an hour set up but that is cool that it manages it although that might be an issue I know because the IT department purchased some SSL with all this insurance or something for the main site and they may want us to try to use those certs I I don't know we'll see how that goes all right hopeless bridge says Khan Academy is such an amazing platform plus you can find a lot of their learning tools are open source very cool I'm definitely have to check that out hopeless bridge said they for sure gave the site a facelift could be a lot faster though yeah I really think a good learning management system should be fast right that the slowness of the system could definitely distract the learner right so I mean speed is speed is important for every site but I think it's very important for that I mean there's already someone who's trying to learn something already has to fight distraction so much to be able to focus you know you don't want to cause them more distraction by either having a terrible UI or having your site be really slow so I think yeah like the it you know if you design it right off the bat with that in mind I think you could definitely have something that's really that runs really quickly it's not hard sang Zeit automatically uses HTTP very cool it says the katha catechol site has a good speed and it's not using HTTP yeah the katha catechol site is fast I mean way faster than some of the other university sites that were made before I started working here all right cool Arsen says you can use custom shirts was i all right that's cool I'm not worried about it I don't I think we'd be fine with you know let's encrypt free certification or you know SSL certs but I don't know we'll see I mean you know how things are sometimes you know if if that cert was already purchased for I don't know years in advance that's not gonna look good for the IT department if you know anybody higher up found out like oh you paid all this money for the search you're not even using them you know you did it for free so you know just to like kind of help them out it might be better just to use them and then maybe when they expire switch over or something but I don't know what the case is all have to talk to them and see exactly what's going on trying to think too if they have it I mean they may have it be applied to other like subdomains I'm not sure what what's going on with that I wasn't involved that much in the pro mean I encourage them to get is an SSL certificate but I wasn't that much involved in actually you know purchasing it and you know applying it it was I don't really know that much about iis servers anyway so that wasn't my thing Harshit says you should enable HTTP to HTTPS ooh and nginx settings and catechetical site all right that's cool I'll definitely have to look that up I hadn't even thought of it but I should do that yeah I I do as you all know I mentioned I do want to make some updates to the cata catechol site I've been working on it we updated a bunch of packages on the stream but I need to switch over the videos not working anymore now that I updated so I'm gonna switch that up to YouTube instead of JW player and try to get it to work like that and I need to make some other changes to the UI we're gonna add some contact forms and things so there's definitely more work that needs to be done and in that process of doing all that I think that would be a great time to update some more things including using HTTP to update packages on the server you know a lot a lot of things like that Harshit says but if they purchased did you sort use that it has what is that a million insurance or something I don't know how many zeros are there yeah million yeah like I've said yeah if they already purchased it then I'll use the they're purchased certificate but I would like to know like how much time is left on it if they only have a few months before it expires then do we really need that we're not taking anybody's payment information we're not even having a user login or anything like that I do we really need the insurance I don't know off to look into it the hopeless Brit asks so if you've got any experience with laravel I think if I ever was to learn PHP framework it would be larva I personally have no experience with laravel but I I hear about it I see articles about it things so I think that's probably a good way to go if you do want to do PHP you know larvell seems like the way to go but I don't really I don't know that much about it I just know that I see it mentioned a lot all right whoa I think been streaming for about an hour so decent length stream anyway I got through all the live chat now so which end up being a really good chat I love it a lot of great questions got some great info as well so I really appreciate all that I think I'm gonna wrap things up so I should be back tomorrow I'm gonna try to do things stream over around 1 p.m. I think that's seems to be a good time for a lot of you you know that are watching from different time zones yeah so anyway thanks for watching today and until tomorrow have a great day
