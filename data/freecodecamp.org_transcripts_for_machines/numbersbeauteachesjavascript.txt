this is a quick video about the basics of working with numbers in javascript i have it set up to log this number to the console so we'll see it appear over here and the numbers up here the number equals 12. you can do all the standard operations in javascript so i can do plus 2 14 i can do minus 2 10 i can do multiplication with the asterisk yup 24 like you can do division with the slash 6 and you can even divide and get a decimal answer also there's the modulus operator that gives you the remainder so 12 the modulus 7 we're going to get a remainder of five it would really be one remainder five seven goes into twelve one time with a remainder of five and you can do all of these operations with decimals so i can do seven point three we can multiply by decimals and you can divide with decimals and one thing to notice is that all numbers are eventually rounded off so it's not going to go on forever so that could affect accuracy in some programs okay if you just want to add one to a number you can do plus plus at the end that is going to increment the number one so it started at 12 and now we're at 13. and you can also put minus minus to decrement the number it's gonna now go down one a lot of times in programming you want to do something like this number equals number plus five and there's a quick way to do that you can do it like this plus equals so whenever you see this number plus equals five that's the same as number equals number plus five you can also do that with multiplication that's number equals number times 60 when the number is 12 you can do with division you can do it with subtraction and then i just wanted to show you one last thing with the numbers plus plus and you can see that it's going to show 12 but if we do console.log number again so it's going to console.log the number then it's going to increment after it logs it so then when you log it again it's 13. however if i take this plus plus and put that at the beginning of the the number let me clear the console and run that again it's going to increment the number and then log the number so if you have the plus plus or the minus minus before the number it does that before doing what i was just about to do with the number which was logging it but if you put the plus plus or minus minus after the number first it does what i was going to do which is logging it and then increments or decrements the number well those are numbers thanks for watching my name is beau carnes don't forget to subscribe and remember use your code for good
