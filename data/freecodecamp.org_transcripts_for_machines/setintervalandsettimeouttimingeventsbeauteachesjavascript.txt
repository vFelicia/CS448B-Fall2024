there are two timing events that are part of the window object that both allow execution of code at specific time time intervals the two timing events are set timeout and set interval for set timeout you pass in a function in milliseconds and the program will wait the specified number of milliseconds and execute the function let's see some code okay here's the set timeout function it could be window.settimeout but the window is implied you pass in the name of the function which is by and then here's the function down here you also pass in the milliseconds here so after 3 000 milliseconds which is three seconds it's going to run the function by which this is just going to console.log goodbye but before that it's going to console.log hello so let's run that one two three so you saw it said hello and then goodbye it is possible to stop the function from running after the set timeout is called you must assign the set timeout to a variable so luvvar so we've set that to var timeout id and then we're going to call cleartimeout and pass in the variable so let's try that it's going to say hello but it will never say goodbye because we've cleared the timeout the set interval function is similar you pass in a function in milliseconds but the program will execute the function continuously waiting the specified number of milliseconds between each function here we're creating a timer we're going to set the count to zero and we're going to call set interval pass in the counter function and 1000 milliseconds that's one second so every one second it's going to call this counter function where it's going to log count it's also going to increment count one and we're going to set it to an int id up here i already have a button so in the button we have an on click event that says clear interval with an int id the end id is down there we can stop the timer by clicking the stop timer button and it won't go on forever so let's run that and see how that works well you can see it's counting every second but if i click the stop time button it stops so clear interval just stops the function in the set interval from running well that's all for now thanks for watching my name is beau carnes don't forget to subscribe and remember use your code for good
