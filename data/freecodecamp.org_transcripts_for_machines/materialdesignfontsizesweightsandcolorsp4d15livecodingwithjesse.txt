hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse today we're going to do some work on our fonts so i mentioned a few times that at some point i was going to change change our fonts kind of mess around a little bit with font sizes font colors font weights and uh try to find something that that really works with this layout so that's we're going to work on today i just want to take a minute to show some of the pull requests that we've got uh and so we're on the same page uh with where we're at here the um let's see so sebastian and harshit both submitted pull requests sebastian did some work with the padding here at the bottom of the card so that's a lot nicer also with the colors we had several different colors for our click effects here now it's it's all gray so at least it's consistent i'm still considering maybe changing the color but the consistency is a big improvement and sorry if i'm missing something uh sebastian something else in the pull request there were several things uh kind of lumped together in there uh now a harshit's pull request is is interesting so this is a filter filter and you could filter by my month year so let's let's take a look at how it works so we're going to go to the current bulletin so we have everything up here and here's the thing about the filter though right now see if i can grab i want to try to get it to a date that will actually work so let's try this um what is that april may uh may 2016. let's go may 2016. okay great so see all these posts are from may of 2016. awesome um let's go and then you can actually go back if you want to and submit and then you get everything uh but here's what i note i i did notice one uh slight bug so i don't know if anybody caught that when i went back and um selected none for these and submitted i'm let's see actually i gotta let me go back to the category here let me just demonstrate this again so we're gonna search for february stuff okay nothing in february now if we want to go back and submit we get everything even though we're on category 2 and if i click category 3 i still have everything still of everything uncategorized of everything if i click see i got to actually click all and then back so that is potentially an unlikely bug someone would have to first pick a category and then want to filter by date within that category and then select none and submit again but at that point potentially it could be confusing so i'm going to say that it's definitely a bug but it's not a very likely bug uh for for anyone to encounter um but uh you know it's something to think about maybe we'll we'll work on that i definitely put that in a list of maybe things that would be nice to have before we launch but not 100 necessary um unless somebody really wants to do that then that's that's great uh something that maybe i'd like i'm i'm wondering about the button here i don't know i don't really know how i feel about having a button in the side the side nav uh just from like a look perspective um the alternative would be maybe try to go with a different style button see if that looks a little bit nicer or uh potentially just have the search happen on change um i think it could be reasonable that someone would want to search an entire year but not reasonable that someone would want to search every let's say february no matter what year it is i don't know what do you think about that um so we'll see my thought is basically you could have a check so in the live site where i'm doing this basically it just checks to make sure that these are selected and then it only does the search if you select the month and the year although as we get further along i could see the value in wanting to select only the year and make that an option right now i guess we're coming up on 2018 so you know potentially that's that's more legitimate than when i first made it uh so anyway there's just a few things to think about maybe to customize this a bit so i welcome your um your opinions on that and uh maybe i'll try to get some user data for for some of the some of the real users and see like have they been using this i actually had a user call earlier today and asked me how to find something from a previous bulletin so previous month and so it was actually helpful although i rec really the search function would have been the most helpful in that use case but um there was there was a desire to be able to search by date so anyway good work car ship um yeah definitely helpful and uh like i said so i have that kind of minor minor bug but i went ahead and merged it in any way because it it fits the functionality of of what we wanted and like i said i i don't even know that that the odds of that even ever happening uh are probably small so i think it's good to go uh merchant to master and you know then every you know we can all work from that so let me check the live chat quickly before we get started with our fonts oh okay uh harsh it's saying uh recommending do not use uh material ui and further projects it was a nightmare i was almost gonna lose my mind all right i mean i'm i'm open to other things we just need to find a material design framework that has what we want and what we need so i mean within material ui we have two options we have the older one and then the newer beta and then potentially there's others out there it's just a few projects ago when we were checking around material ui was let's say the most complete solution that we found out there maybe things have changed so if anybody else is using a material design component library for react let me know let me know what you think about it um harsh has been having a rough time i i don't know i i there are some minor annoyances with it um but i don't think i'm i haven't used it enough to make a a good judgment i i would think i would need to really learn how it works a little bit more before i make a judgment about the beta version of material ui i know i have had to kind of adjust some things here and there because i didn't quite like how things worked but um so far it has served its purpose but like i said i am open to trying other things okay oh that's right sebastian also changed the print view so now the close icon has moved to the right i'll probably just a few things about the print view um i'll probably end up taking out these uh horizontal lines uh because in in the print view i think it's it breaks it up on first glance it seems like this is supposed to break up between posts but it's really not it's between this is all one post with a line in the middle so either we'd remove the lines completely or we'd have to move the line below attachment also i think i'd like to have some some padding on the sides i think that would be good and then potentially i would maybe want this clothes icon to line up more with how we have the menu icon so in terms of of positioning but otherwise the print view is i mean even now at this point the print view is fulfilling its function uh you know these are just kind of small details that i would like to see so i'll either work on that at another time or another stream or anyone else can work on it if they'd like um okay um i think so shashank uh saying i believe about the print view that each post in a tile uh well the the idea here with the print view is to be as minimalist as possible um but we want to optimize it for print so the less we have to print um the the better so i'm kind of leaning towards just completely removing this and instead making sure that there's a reasonable amount of padding between each post you know for instance we would tighten this up so that the attachment name was really close to this maybe you know no more than 8 pixels between the attachments and the attachment name you know but between the posts no less than 16 pixels uh you know possibly more we'd have to see so uh you know i'm just kind of thinking it adds up if somebody's printing this out maybe a lot of posts every week you know all these lines take ink right so anyway so in this case really the way it looks on the web is is entirely secondary to the way it would print out so that's what i want to keep in mind for that okay well let's get started i'll come back to the live chat and go over anything if i i've missed anything uh but we're pretty about 15 minutes into the stream and and we haven't gotten to uh we've i mean we had to get caught up on some of the changes obviously uh but now i'd like to start my pomodoro clock we're gonna do 25 minutes of in of coding in this case we're going to be you know mainly working with css and some of the builtin features of material ui okay so first thing i want to do is work on this this by far is going to be the the font that is seen and used throughout the site more than any other font okay so we're going to work on this but then we're also going to visit this sidebar uh we're going to we're going to look at you know the heading headings depending on how much time we have and how long it takes we're going to look at every bit of font on this site but first let's deal with this because if we only get one thing done today this is going to have the biggest impact so here's what i'd like to see i would definitely like that font to be bigger and i i kind of i'm not a huge fan of the font weight so let's just play with it a little bit i know in a previous um in a previous stream we had worked with what was built in with material ui in terms of font styles but i i really think i'd like to customize it exactly how how i want it it's nice that material ui has those built in but it's really not that big of a deal to change some fonts with css so uh some font sizes and weights so i think in this case uh we'll get a better result if we just customize it uh ourselves so let's go into dev tools and uh we'll just play around a little bit with the fonts now i've also had the idea of bringing in that responsive font from materialize css that we've used on previous projects so that's still an option i'm a little afraid that it might be too big people are used to a font that's somewhere in between this and what we're using um when we use that responsive font from materialize so we'll see oh that's interesting why is that in an aside tag really interesting okay well let's bring this up so we can see what's going on here and let's take that font size and i want it to be at least 16 pixels i don't want to have any fonts that are smaller than 16 pixels um let's go with font weight let's try 400 yeah i like that a lot better do you see that that difference um we'll be able to you know side by side see the difference but already i think this is let me zoom in here i don't know about you but at least on my screen already i see a big difference in terms of readability uh this just seems a lot nicer uh so let's let's keep going with this um i do want to check what do we have a color okay i like that color we have that um this is the correct way to do color with material design on the web um black uh with uh some transparency uh particularly 0.87 for your primary text okay all right that's not bad let's try to bring this up though let's see if if it will still be reasonable and i'm going to zoom out so that we see what it's really like would it be reasonable to go up to let's say 18. i think 18 i think 18 looks nice all right let me go back let me see the live chat what do you all think um i i don't think 18 looks too large at all hmm okay who say john hanson says uh lighter font weight i find much easier on my eyes especially my old eyes yeah that's i mean that's what i'm going for really um you know for somebody who's i i mean for somebody that has perfect vision right it's who cares the font size doesn't really matter they're going to deal with font size no matter what but i'm more worried about you know there's going to be a lot of older people reading this we we certainly have especially among the faculty here you know there there are some some older uh professors that i want to make sure that they're able to read this so um i kind of want to go beyond you know just the normal use case okay all right uh shashank thinks actually that the 18 uh pixel font is um uh a little bit it's clogging actually i would like to see um maybe let me apply this 18 pixels and then see how it all lays out because right now you know we're doing this within the card so you see it's kind of going over we really aren't going to know until we see everything like that so let's go ahead and try this and yeah we'll try this let me see okay so this is not this is really interesting i would have assumed that this was somehow in a paragraph tag and not an aside that's interesting does anyone know should this be in an aside is there any benefit to that and is there any way we can change that since you know we're not actually creating this tag directly it's it's being created by mature ui hmm let's see how i want to select this mui card content see all the uh the classes are they're not helping me right now i guess i could just do all the sides um okay brett says aside is good semantically okay cool i just i really haven't used the side very much so i just wanted to make sure that you know it was the right way to use it i'm glad that it works i wasn't really looking forward to digging into that component and trying to change it okay so let's go with that let's um let's go to our just our index.css i would like these styles to apply um over a wide range of things so this is i i think the the proper place um let's see let's go with p and aside and we'll add this in let's save that and the wrong way i guess we'll need to refresh ourselves okay uh i suppose we're getting overwritten here let's see what's going on yep we are so we're gonna have to i really hate to use important on something that's this kind of global in our styles but i really also don't want to have to go into every place and put these things in so let's see let's see all right so harsh it's saying use style.js um all right let's check out our style.js i mean at this point we're pretty much still testing it out as well so um i'm all for putting things in the right place but we're almost like designing as we code so i guess i could just do it in devtools i guess i don't have style.js open currently so let's grab it from here some styles okay let's see what yes i'm just wondering what is there a class already being applied that we could just add on to see these are all have these numbers added okay okay i should say an open post preview alright we'll check it out okay so at least it's being applied here which is nice um it's not bad actually in post preview we have quite a bit of space we could probably go larger if we really wanted to i think this is fine for now but uh we definitely have that opportunity um okay all right i'm i think i'm yeah i'm okay with that for now let's go back to this view and we also do want to make sure that we don't forget to check this view as well all right so let's check out what we have going on here um i guess i could check into the um let's see okay should i you keep saying i mean the js file oh okay um the component post preview okay so not the sorry i thought you meant go to the post preview and not the components um oh yeah post preview okay says see their card content yeah do we did we have card content okay there we go okay so here's where we're pulling in that that content okay uh so i don't know i'm i'm thinking here since we haven't found a uh typography type that we like for this should we even be using typography um could we get i mean ought we to just use uh a paragraph tag um our is support did you really submit a pull request already on this um are you saying check the pull request when we did this so i'm actually interested to see we would have to switch it up because we can't just pop content um well i suppose we could because we've already sanitized it so we could put it like that um let's see we could type last name i mean we could just add a class on it are we already using classes content okay actually hardship has submitted a pull request basically doing what we were doing here so um where are we at so what we're doing here now is we're going to keep the typography and we're going to add a class okay then up here where we have all our classes here then we can just add that class in and we'll put in our our css as if as a an array or i'm sorry as an object so you can see there are several ways to do styles and react all right we're we're using a mixture so we're doing some some normal css here right uh this is should be very familiar which works in react it's it's it's totally fine it works but there are some other ways this being one of the ways uh where we're actually making an object and we're using that within our uh within our components so this kind of allows you to have a much more selfcontained component if you have all the styles for your component and in the actually in the component it's much easier to just take that component and reuse it anywhere right but if we put all our styles here in index.css well number one they're all global which which i mean global styles aren't in themselves bad but it can be bad there can be conflicts it can be difficult to manage so anyway depending on what you what project you're doing and you know how you want to organize it you may want to do these there might there are other ways as well these aren't the only ways to do it okay um i will say this though if you do it this way i find it easier to transition to react native uh because this is the way you'll you'll most likely want to do this in react native uh with slight differences but uh we did a stream on react native if you want to know more about those differences but it's a much easier transition so if you just kind of start learning it this way it's a little bit weird at first to get used to making it as an object and there are ways to actually put real css in here in terms of syntax as well if you really want want to do it like that but anyway that's we're going to do so i know we kind of almost had it done here but i don't want harshet's work to go to waste so i'm going to bring in his pull request just really quickly and get rid of what i was doing here and just so that i don't have to deal with any merged stuff right now oops there we go i'm going to get rid of everything that we've done and here we go so let's just double check hit status no index.css has changed what did i change there we go all right is that better now it's probably just indentation um actually that's really weird why do i have that indented like that i never indent things like that this is really weird indentation okay anyway let's just uh i guess it doesn't matter now i messed it all up all right let's go with this p tag again uh since i do want this to apply to all paragraphs no matter what anyway uh we use a mix here both both ways uh what was it fonts size 18 and font weight 400 and i may end up changing this as well i'm thinking it might not be a bad idea to do the responsive font for the paragraph tags and then go with the standard font for that post preview the cards so that's probably what i'm gonna end up doing i doubt i have time on this pomodoro session maybe on the next session we'll do that um but anyway let's just let's just commit this quickly and um let's this be a little bit more descriptive there we go okay so i had blocked my live chat um let's see okay harshit uh thanks for that i always forget that uh you could just if i wanted to just revert everything without manually doing it uh i could have just done uh get checkout and then um a dot so that would have been faster thanks um let me check my time okay perfect timing we'll um just finish this up and now i can merge great and awesome so now we have all of harsha's stuff we're gonna see it now great okay so here's what it looks like with the size 18 font i something needs something could be better maybe it's the line heights maybe line i know we can we can do better it just seems something's off um all right let's let me take five minutes now and go through the um uh the live chat answer any questions you have then we'll do another uh session and uh i think i'm gonna i'm gonna check out some previous work that we've done and just compare what we're doing in terms of uh line height because that may be that may be what seems off to me here okay so let me scroll up and i'll try to get through as much as i can in these five minutes okay so red 23 has a question uh do you think that html is easier than python um yeah for somebody who has no experience in any type of com coding at all or web development i i do think html would be easier to learn now if you already have a background in programming like let's say another programming language you know maybe you're into java or some form of c um it it actually this may sound weird but i think it actually might be easier to go with python than to learn html and i wouldn't normally think this except i i i do know i've i've talked to at least one programmer who was always used to doing just strictly um like software development uh with with c sharp and trying to learn more frontend stuff like html uh it was actually somewhat challenging because it's a whole different mindset so you know it's hard to to measure you know what what's easier not easier you know what unit of measurement is there for that but i would say the majority of the time html is easier but it somewhat depends on what background you're coming from in terms of of your knowledge base uh okay not really a lot of questions going on so sorry for the long pause i'm just trying to read through and see um see if i uh need to answer anything so um oh harsh it says uh node 8 is now an lts so yeah um if if you uh haven't upgraded your version of node for a while now might be a good time to go up to node 8. i know in particular for this project it will not work unless you have at least node 7 4 i think so 7.4 so not a bad time to upgrade oh good good question joseph asks if there's a print view for individual posts and uh yes there is um so if we click an individual post and then hit print view we we have our print view here so um actually now that i think about it i don't think this is a really important uh you know it's not a priority but you know it's possible that we could do a little bit with with this section here to make it more printer friendly um so like obviously i wouldn't want any color uh in the the print view because most likely it's going to be printed black and white anyway um yeah we'll see i mean i i think this is acceptable as as is but well um maybe we'll come back to that at some point but anyway good question okay uh denon j says um learning uh in stanford online cs 101 course um says is it is it worth learning um yeah i i i think having a basic knowledge of computer science is is very useful um even even just if you're doing web development is it necessary for web development no not it's not necessary but i think it it could definitely be helpful um and it makes it easier for you to kind of branch out and maybe go into different things if you don't want to stick with web development because you have that background kind of a a better view of the big picture uh in terms of all of you know the computer science realm so um i think that's awesome i haven't uh checked out that stanford 101 course i have done a bit of the harvard cs50 course and i thought that was very interesting if i have time i'd love to finish that um just got got busy with other projects um but no i i think it's if you have the time to do it it's it's worthwhile all right let's go back okay let me go back and let's start our pomodoro session and um we're going to um let's let's go ahead oh okay now i remember what we were gonna do uh we were gonna check out this spacing there's just something about this that's that i don't like right now uh screen check that out oh okay harsha mentioned it i i had said i thought it was 7.4 for the node version we actually need 7.6 and that's because we're using async await on the server so we need at least 7.6 so if you try to i believe we have this in the documentation for the project so i i think it is in there but in case you you didn't read that and you're having trouble getting the project to work on your own machine make sure you have the correct node version okay all right let me check out actually i want to check this out on the current bulletin so i'm on my other screen i'm just going to bring up dev tools just to check quickly what what kind of styles were we have here on our and and the current bulletin these are in paragraph tags but um okay so our font is that line height uh where's our line height coming from 1.5 all right let's check our line out here now hmm that's a line high 24. where are we getting this from yeah all right let's try some some different things with line height so i'm basically running 1.5 is the line height and let's see what that changed it to okay so let's see the difference actually i really like that i don't i don't know about you all but that just at least for my eyes seeing this that just made a big difference not bad so i mean it was only a few pixels different so we're going from 24 pixels in line height to 27 pixels but i i think that makes a big difference all right let's throw that in so there's two places where i want to change this right now because i think i'd like to apply it to paragraphs as well so i'm going to try to keep using the setup i have now for the paragraph tags although i still might change it to use a responsive font and by that i mean if you're not familiar with a responsive font the font size will actually change based on the screen width so it'll be a more optimal viewing experience basically the idea is to keep the words big enough to be readable and not only that but the amount of words per line in that sweet spot which is which i think what it was i can't remember for sure the with the optimal amount of words per line is um it's easy to google and see if anybody remembers what that is uh please let me know in the live chat um but there there is actually an optimum amount if you want people to uh be able to read things easily on your site and it's hard when you have multiple like different size screens to actually get that a responsive font can help you stay within that range um so it doesn't always work it's not perfect but you have a much better shot at staying within that range if you if you do it like that um so what i just do line heights 1.5 and we're also going to do it here so where's our area card class line height and 1.5 okay so whoops this should give us an auto refresh and let's double check to make sure this is being applied it definitely should be yep it is wonderful and we can check in here make sure it's applied as well and nope did i forget to save it it's possible all right let's give it a refresh oh there we go okay awesome all right so this is acceptable right now um if we have time later on we want to keep messing with it we certainly can let's go to this side nav because aside from the titles which right now i think are acceptable i i i may want to work on them a bit but aside from that i just want to make sure that everything we're doing here in the side nav is it's all you know as readable as it can be so i'm not we may not have to do much but i just want to double check a few things and um make sure so the first thing i want to check is the font size we're 14. i don't want to be at 14. so uh let's bump this up now to let's see what is this category three yeah let's bump this up and we're gonna go font font size 16 pixels okay yeah i think that's much better it doesn't look like we're in any danger of having you know something be too long everything's short enough here that it should work all right so let's go ahead and do that um i think this is this component is called the drawer so let's find that we add drawer and here list item yeah here so we're gonna have these uh these list items and i guess we could put it right on the the link we say we already have a class classes link on here so let's edit that where's it at are we doing this down to the bottom there's our classes oh okay we're are we passing in clash i guess we're passing it in hmm okay index central sidebar okay that's what we're calling it we're calling this sidebar why are we bringing this in uh sidebar for let's let's change this to be consistent with our naming so i'm going to change this to drawer um so anyway i guess this is good so i don't i mean i don't know if there's some reason for doing it differently but i think it's less confusing if in general we um we keep our component names the same as the file names for our components so that was throwing me a little bit i was looking for a component called draw but instead it was it was sidebar so we're gonna have to have some sort of standard um like guide for contributing a style guide or something like that so um anyway so if you're if you're submitting pull requests just keep that in mind uh otherwise you know it can get a bit confusing but yeah we didn't really have any type of formal you know guidelines about that so we'll have to add that in somewhere uh i think i think we have a contributing file for this repo i'm not positive though but perhaps we should just have some sort of global style guide um that that would probably help things out um yeah it's classes this cross class okay so we're bringing in okay harsha says we're pulling that in from style.js all right so let's grab that we're at stylus right here right next to it okay um let's bring this in good thinking so he said he um um harsh it name so harsha ended up naming that component sidebar instead of drawer because he didn't want it to be confused with the drawer component um that is is brought in from uh mature ui actually that makes a lot of sense uh let me see i'll be pulling in the drawer okay it doesn't look over pulling it in anywhere else so okay so how about this let's do like i said we'll have to type this up and kind of do it formally but um how about if there could be some conflict where you have we're using a library that has the same component name as the one that we're trying to create our custom one can have the normal name so in this case drawer and then if we do want to use the library's version elsewhere or potentially even in the same file we just prefix it so instead of drawer it would be mui drawer uh then that way uh we can just keep using both if we need to and there will be no confusion about where that component comes from because we're calling it mui drawer so can we do that would that be doable and easy or is that going to be should we do it the opposite way and somehow prefix our component to maybe say custom drawer let me know what you think would be easier or more reasonable to do i'm open to either one but it'd just be cool if we could decide on one way and then be consistent with it later on so i mean i'm sure most of you can understand and handle the distinction but you know potentially if we get newer people who are just learning react i'd like to try to make it um as easy of an experience as possible if they're either looking through our code or trying to contribute and then potentially if i get any student workers here at the university that are dealing with this they're likely going to be new to react so anyway you all you understand uh okay so where sorry i just lost my train of thought oh okay i was trying to find where what styles i need to bring in oh sorry so we have a drawer here class we're passing this props classes okay so basically i should be fine to add a class here and then it'll just go straight down right okay awesome harshit i'm gonna i'm gonna grab your comment here and um let's see uh i'm gonna put it up here quickly just so everybody can see it let me make sure no it's blocked um let's put it up higher okay so this is pretty much this is what we want to do so uh up here it might be hard to see because it's gray but basically we're we're running um let's take this up so we're going to do import drawer as uh mui drawer so in this case material ui drawer but we could really prefix it with different things depending on what library we're using and then it'll be of course from material ui slash drawer so excellent cool i figured there was a way to do it okay uh so let me see george is uh see the class name andrew oh okay so let's just pass it down let's find out where our other drawer classes are just group them together so we have drawer paper drawer header let's throw in um drawer item yeah let's go draw item and then we're going to say fonts size 16. um 16 pixels and let's not forget that comma i've gotten so many errors from forgetting commas in this it's like it's so silly but it's it's easy to forget that little comma okay uh now let's go back in our drawer.js let's go back down to our list classes link oh okay we already had a class shoot let me find that class link and click link i'm not seeing it there we go none color not oh okay you know what for now i'm going to keep this separate uh i don't want to put the because i assume this link color is being could potentially be used in other things and not necessarily the side side nav so so i'm just going to apply both styles here so i'm thinking later on if in fact we do a responsive font i don't want to risk conflicting uh so i would potentially have all of the font one size and then somehow have a link a different size so anyway uh let's do are we at drawer uh so let's go class name classes link how are we gonna how do we do this um actually it says use class name package to combine styles okay how do how do we do that i was just going to pass both styles in so i'm i'm interested in this uh so harsh it's saying we can use class name package to combine styles but i am unfamiliar with this oh okay okay interesting i think uh i've never done it like that before i've done like uh like an array uh within here of uh of classes i think that's how i did it i think it was an array cd it says see at bar okay um so class names classes flex last time awesome that look i actually i like i prefer this way to some ways i've done it previously that's really nice now i'm not going to do it on this one but i am actually just curious what if we wanted to do class names like this but then in addition do some uh oh no we wouldn't want to right because this is the class name it's not direct styles right okay never mind never mind i was uh just thinking about the way i did things um on that react native app that i uh completed i don't know like two weeks ago um but i suppose that was a different use case now that i think about it so please disregard that question um let's see so class names did we have to bring that in no yes okay let's import class names here it might already be imported we'll see nope all right let's bring that in import class names and um now i lost that link there we go um class names so we have class names and then actually let me see did you have to put that bar sorry okay so we we do we have to keep okay so we do have to keep um doing classes dot okay that's fine just wanted to double check we call that drawer item okay let's check this out now whoa let's let's give it a refresh see what's going on hmm i messed something up let's see what did i do um let me oops there it is all right okay so this is this is pretty interesting so let me uh let me share this with you all so harshit is saying um quickly i'm just gonna confirm that we have the right fonts no not yet it's not working yet let me uh let me go back okay so class is for item let's make sure this is what i'm doing item font size 16 pixels interesting um item yeah it looks like it's exactly the same looks the same and let's make sure we are bringing in class names okay let's check it out again let's just do a hard refresh now huh all right let's see what's going on here category there we go that's what's going on okay all right so here's what's happening we are in fact getting this font size uh but it's it's it's on the a tag um and somewhere along the line it's being overridden by this so whoa that was unintentional all right let's see shoot hmm uh all right is there any way to do there is the link component we are not creating that right yeah that's react router um we need to put this lower down on the list item text so that was my mistake i should have never put it on the link so let's go class name classes dot drawer item and then now we don't need this anymore and we don't need this save that and see if that gets us down low enough oh it doesn't look like it let's see where it get applied not there uh here we're so close um yeah i list items and um okay i don't know how we're gonna get further down than that okay so what i need to do is check out the material ui documentation to see if there's some builtin way that i can get at that interior paragraph tag or overwrite it or something so let me do that i know my timer is up but i we're so close i don't want to lose my train of thought here so let's do this and then i'll go to the to the live chat so where are we at wait what was it list item text okay that's actually really helpful i don't know if you saw that uh i really like that feature that'd be cool to implement something like this in some of our projects so just keep keep that in mind you can go on the wish list all right so let's see let's item text let's see um i'm going to disable the children won't be wrapped by typography content oh is that what's happening typography okay um all right so let's try did we already have this on let's see really disable typography see if that does it no it's actually worse interesting and so it changed it to a div it still didn't do what we want oh wait a second yeah that's not what we wanted at all all right let's take that out and instead let's check i'm interested in this uh root here what's up hmm maybe you have to do an override okay um let's see all right these inline style approach everything for style property see how this thing maybe we can do it like this yeah let's try that sorry that text was probably really small i apologize so anyway i'm thinking something like this would let us get it the root component uh so in this case we're going to want to say classes i'm gonna try it like this first i'm not sure it'll work but always worth it to try a simple thing all right yeah that does not look like it's the font size we want see if anything happened wow we're still getting it there i wanna refresh hmm hmm okay i'm not sure what the material ui way of doing this is supposed to be so let's she says if you've written a better way to do it it's using line css directly component um so john hanson says uh it's it's seeming to suggest that uh styles need to be overwritten directly in the component with css the problem is it seems like i can't get any any deeper in than this div anything within that i can't touch so here's what i'm going to do i'm certainly open to finding a better way to doing this at some point but i think this will work so let's go with um let's get rid of this going to do a class name and let's see if we can class name equals um draw item oops keep going the wrong way all right there we go so we got a classic draw item on here now let's just put drawer item p and we'll do font size 16 pixels important now great that works so uh it didn't apply everywhere because we need to put that class on these places but you can see this works so we are able to get down to it so um is there a way to do that in material ui or within that javascript object where you had a bunch of styles in potentially i don't really know but um good old normal css has done the job uh so yeah and i i gave a disclaimer a warning about using important on a previous stream so i'm not going to do it again but just the short version is don't use important unless you really really have to uh all right cool so let's just add this class on so it applies you know across the board here and then i will get to the live chat um all right so let's take this class name to so we want this on all we also want this on let's see how did we do this categories there we go and what do we got pull this item categories sucker um i'm going to take out classic mode now because i don't think i'm going to add classic mode i don't think it's necessary i am going to keep the help page which we'll do at some point all right i think that's it that should be all the places uh didn't work on this one i thought we got that one what's going on here ah because it's a div let's update our styles so we want drawer item p and we want your item div now let's give it a refresh no still not interesting oh actually oh i see so in fact drawer item did get placed right here on that route so um we didn't need droid mdiv what we needed was just simply drawer item there we go now it works okay so we got it here there there take action is the only one that's looking still the old size so what do we have here sure all right perhaps i did not get that on there um let's find where that's at up here a bit uh yeah which one was that take action yep i did not catch that one oops let's grab this class name right on there we are and that should be it yep all right who would have thought it would have been that time consuming to change the font size of these um once again sometimes react makes complicated things simple and simple things complicated i don't want to blame react completely here we were trying to do it the material ui way we went through all the steps before we decided to you know kind of come up with our own solution so um don't want to blame um don't want to blame uh react completely for that um okay so that actually that might be really worthwhile i mean to be honest with you like it's not like we we had to be geniuses to come up with that workaround that's like pretty simple it just seemed like there would be some other way with material ui i think that might be worthwhile as a some sort of pull request to material ui to come up with a better way a better way to do that i'm not sure but um at least a more consistent way right um because for most of the things there's a certain prop or a way that you would do things like that and you wouldn't go directly to the css and add your own classes but then in this case that seemed to be the only way that it would work so i would i think it would just be nice to have some consistency one way or another either go with everything is just your own css or you know uses normal css classes your own css or everything has a uh a specific prop in the mature ui way i mean i don't know does that make sense i kind of like to lean towards the idea of let let's just use our own css for a lot of it right they can they can have classes that are built in but then it would be very simple to just say okay we're going to be able to uh edit this in override classes i mean i just i don't know maybe this is not the case but it seems to me if you're building things with react you're probably at the point where you can certainly manage your own css and if you want to use what's built in for them wonderful but then make it the standard way to change things up should be the same way you would change things up in any type of website which would be write some css anyway i'm not involved with that project so maybe there is some really good reason why it's not like that that i'm overlooking it's entirely possible i don't want to be overly critical of the team that works on material ui it's certainly been very helpful for some of my projects so i really appreciate that all right so now let me answer some questions here in the live chat um let's see okay i scrolled back way up towards the top because that's where you left off at uh and we were talking about optimal font sizes john hanson says that his base font size is 18 pixels so um yeah i like that like i said my bass is usually 16 well i shouldn't say my base my absolute minimum is 16. so if someone wants to have like some small text down in the footer or something like that minimum 16 but the normal text is usually more than 16 pixels um but i don't know if you all have run into this issue but i have people that i make the sites for here you know people in other departments they seem to be opposed to this larger font size and they want it smaller the reason being they want to fit in as much text as possible and i've gotten some pushback on the larger font size and i mean i just explain every time that this is much more readable i don't know what experience you've had with your clients uh you know with things like that but um also i usually explain that users aren't likely to read all that text if even if you make the text small and fit in a bunch of stuff odds are nobody's going to read all that it's much better to just get to the point only put what's really important in there and then have it readable then people may actually read it all so i don't know i mean i've seen some studies and statistics that um seem to suggest that that that i am taking the correct approach to it but i would like to hear what you all think about it as well um i'm always open to changing up the way i do things if there is some proof that there's a better way rook says a lot of people just do control plus on all sites to read better yeah that's i i often do control plus depending on the site and certainly while i'm streaming i control plus everything otherwise you'll never be able to see it but the thing that i worry about is some users are just very very averse to any type of technology and i don't know that they necessarily even know that they can control plus and increase the size so i i am very much opposed to the mindset of thinking as your users as as less intelligent i i don't like that at all i think we should respect our users and try to make things as easy as possible so i like the idea of assuming that if there's some easy work around the user may not know about it because they're not really into computers i think that's perfectly acceptable to assume that um so anyway i just i like i i would like to make that distinction that assuming that a user doesn't know how to control plus is not the same thing as assuming that they're not intelligent uh they could be very intelligent and just have invested their time in learning other things not related to a browser so anyway that's kind of like it always bugs me gets on my nerves when i hear people talk about users or clients in a derogatory way like they don't know what they're doing i mean i'm i'm frustrated with clients and users frequently but no need to belittle them in any way okay i'm reading down through um if if you can't if you can see the live chat you know what i'm talking about but if you can't see the live chat i sort of mentioned so harshit who i mentioned frequently because he's helped out so much with the projects when uh sorry i need ah some of my throat okay uh logged out of salesforce okay um when i'm coding and harsha's trying to get my attention it's just like all caps so they're like sections within the live chat where it's just no with like a ton of o's all caps and so it's it's amusing i i know sometimes i get into what i'm doing and i forget to check uh the live chat so um sorry about that harshit i appreciate you not giving up on me and continuing to try to get my attention uh okay good there's a good question here so um not sure so uh yashuu asked this not sure if you're still with us yeshu um but the question is if we have a separate language for styling why do you use css in javascript that's that's a very good question and a legit question i can totally understand that um css and javascript is weird it's not necessary in react but i believe i mentioned this earlier but i'm going to say it again um because i think this this is to me the answer to why you would do css and javascript um to have a selfcontained react component so that number one you could take that component and use it elsewhere and you'd have everything you need just plug in your data and you're good number two it also makes it super easy for someone to look at your code look at your component and see the big the whole picture of how everything's gonna look when you have your styles in your markup all right there and your logic because javascript all right there so that's the benefit of it i will say there's other potential benefits depending on exactly how you're putting the css into your component so i know on react native um when i use create react native app there was something i believe it was built in to create react native app i don't know that it's built in to react native itself i'm not sure um but there was something that if you used if you put the css in a certain way within your react component it actually gave you a performance a slight performance benefit because of behind the scenes how those eventually got applied so i don't know enough about how that javascript gets transferred and becomes java or swift or whatever to know exactly why there's a performance increase but i do know from from that udacity nanodegree that i did that there is a performance increase so i don't know if there's any similar thing with regular react that could be done but it's potentially i mean it's possible okay john hanson says a nice thing is to style the text to flow in columns as when the width of a single card view gets too wide it's harder to read oh i have never thought of that that's that's interesting that's really interesting i'm going to keep that in mind i'm not sure if i want to change things up in this project because the users already have an expectation but that's really interesting uh we do have some upcoming projects within the next few months that that may come in handy i really like that idea let's see okay yes you also asked why don't you use sas or scss over css to be honest with you i much prefer scss uh i actually really like sas um you know plain sass but um the only reason i don't use it is because you can't copy in normal css and have it work if it weren't for that i'd be using that because i i really like just the indentation style you can that's the fastest i can write css is by using sas but anyway i end up using scss because it kind of gives you a little bit of both worlds the css and the fcss or and the sas this is tongue twister trying to get all those letters off anyway um i do love to use it we just haven't set it up on this project to use it but in previous project we we have um so whenever possible i do like to use sas instead if you're not familiar with sas or scss it's a css preprocessor it lets you do some cool things with nesting of css so i guess a good example if i have a good example here so instead of doing this where i have this comma so draw item p and then draw item i could potentially do something like this no it wouldn't that's not a good example never mind uh media prints shoot i don't have a good example here i'll just have to make one up so in regular css we could do something like this or i would say um let's just go body uh a for all the a tags and then i would put a css something and then so let's just put that in there just so we have something and then i i would need to do in css let's say i wanted to do body p right so instead of this with sass i could write body a uh um obviously this something is not real css so if you're new to css please don't try to type this in it won't work um and then you could write p right and then whenever it was all processed um it would end up looking like this but you saved yourself a little bit i'm being able to do this so it doesn't really seem like as much of a savings this probably takes up the same amount of lines but it can be very useful if you get a little bit deeper and generally you don't want to nest too deeply um maybe just three levels or so uh but you could do this so that's the very basic thing you can also do things like have variables so you could make a sas variable and then so let's say we made this a color variable then throughout everything we could just say like this is our primary color we defined it in one place if later on we wanted to change our color scheme all we'd have to do is change that variable and it would change throughout so there's really cool things there's other things you do with like calculations it's almost like a blend of a programming language and css so anyway that's a brief overview of uh sas or css scss i mean so this is scss syntax there's another syntax called sas that is is different but you can do a lot of the same things with it okay harsha so harshit before the stream sent me a coupon for digitalocean um harshit i tried to use the coupon code and it told me that it wasn't valid so it ended up not working for me so i don't know what the problem is but um thank you for sending that i that was that was really nice of you uh joseph uh whittington asked so anyone can join this project definitely anybody is welcome to submit a pull request to this project or point out any issues or anything like that um of course i review all pull requests i may or may not pull it into the project but i i do my best to pull in everything that i can so i may ask you to adjust some things first and then i'll pull it in but i welcome anybody especially people who are new if you'd like to get some experience with pull requests i know sometimes it can be intimidating to try to get a pull request submitted to a larger repository and not everybody is friendly whenever you submit a pull request sometimes people are frustrated having a bad day and you know i've had that happen before you submit a pull request and the maintainers just aren't very polite uh if let's say it wasn't exactly what they wanted so i'm not going to do that to anybody so if you're a little bit apprehensive about submitting pull requests this is a great place to get a start i'll do my best to uh to try to work with you and and get your pull request merged in let's see joseph also says how difficult do you think it would be trying to learn react coming from angular 4 background um i don't know myself because i'm not super familiar with angular 4. i only worked with uh the very you know first version of angular uh you know back in the day so i don't know for sure but i would imagine if someone had the intelligence to be able to learn angular 4 they certainly have the intelligence to learn react it may be um you have to change how you think about certain things but i would have no doubt there's no doubt in my mind that somebody is certainly capable of learning react if they know angular um yes you ask is it worth it to use node.js against gulp um i'm i'm not entirely sure i can scope all right so i'm not entirely sure what you're asking i'm gonna um rephrase the question and see if this is really what you're asking please correct me if i'm wrong um but are you saying to use like npm scripts instead of uh gulp um so it would just be kind of directly using the npm scripts that you that come with node.js is it worth it i don't it depends if you're really used to using gulp and you have a nice setup and you really like it i you could certainly do fine just sticking with that uh if you're really worried about um the speed and up you know optimization of your your development process your build process i'd say give npm scripts a try they're pretty straightforward um i've always kind of wanted to set up npm scripts i have in small projects before but i always just kept going back to my gulp setup because it was it already worked um so i don't know like i said it does kind of depend on you know how many if you plan on like reusing it for a ton of different projects then yeah it's it's definitely worth it it'll save you time you know potentially in the long run um but i i think that's more of a personal choice that in terms of the end result you can probably get the same end result with npm scripts or with gold arson says you know you're a number three and contributors uh for the bulletin i didn't realize i had fallen to number three so uh thanks for letting me know um yeah so i really only work on the bulletin whenever i'm streaming uh so i have other projects that i need to work on when i'm not streaming so that's why my contributions are low i appreciate everybody else contributing though it's it's really amazing all right cool john hanson earlier i was talking about the optimal uh amount of words per line for for readability and john hanson says it's 80 characters per line so uh not not where i'm sorry that i uh mistakenly said words you're right john it is characters um so 80 characters is you know give or take if you but that's the right spot that you want to be in so um if you if you try for that then it's more likely that users will read your content joseph asks does google have a style guide for react um not that i know of not that i know of so that actually might be good to look into perhaps instead of creating our own style guide from scratch for our react projects we could see if there's a style guide out there that already kind of fits with what we're used to using potentially you can adapt it if we want to but if anybody knows of a good react style guide please please let me know and i could check it out all right all right so i think i'm almost to the bottom of the live chat so if you have a question you haven't uh put it in there yet in the chat please put it in there now because i'm nearing the end okay humber umberto says uh looking for sis admin about to go solo a server boss uh so moving from iis uh from a 2008 machine to a 2012 machine uh with a separate web ser websphere server okay so i don't know anything about iis uh servers so i shouldn't say that i know very little about iis servers so i've worked with them i've never worked with them directly only kind of in a research type of way of uh helping out other people so if anybody else can help out with that please let umberto know john hanson says react is so complex to get keyboard events like arrow left and arrow right to iterate through an array of images as in a slideshow i'm about to give up on that ui function interesting i actually have never done that i don't think i've ever attempted to get arrow keyboard events to work with react so um i'll take your word for it that it's a pain actually i let me tell you about a project i've been discussing with one of my coworkers here because it's really fun and you all please let me know if any of you are interested in maybe helping out with it so this would be a longer term project uh but we thought it would be really cool for um students who are interested in the university to be able to get kind of a virtual tour of campus but it would not be like a normal virtual tour the idea is to create a game an html game right that can play in the browser or potentially be ported to mobile on react native uh but the idea that it would be like an old school 8bit game right so possibly like topdown view like the original zelda game and uh we would recreate things on campus and they would have a little guy that could walk around and see everything so just a basic thing but but we thought uh it would be cool to do it in react because my colleague really wants to learn react so he needs to get some projects using react like that so he would actually be more of the lead but i could help out work with it too and we could potentially work on it during the stream um i don't know i thought it would be fun to do i've always kind of wanted to try to do a javascript game i think my kids would really enjoy something like that so anyway if anybody thinks that sounds cool or interesting let me know then maybe i can move forward with that project um but if nobody's interested then i'm not gonna you know try to put it on the stream i'd rather do some things that that you are more interested in uh you know if possible so anyway i just thought i'd bring it up let's see harshit has reminded me to commit this did i um let's see get thanks for reminding me uh i don't want you all if you if you want to clone the repo or you know or fork i don't want you to have the uh older versions unless you have the latest one great okay uh so inn is here hey anna how's it going um and it says what accomplishment are you most proud of well aside from all my kids and uh getting married to my wife um in terms of what i do with you know with web development hmm i want to say like whatever my latest thing i come out with is always what i'm most proud of right so i've been really proud of like the resource center i was really proud of when i first made it and um i got a lot of great positive feedback um but then now when i look at the original resource center that i made i just see like uh all that mess of code so it's kind of a hard question to answer with projects like this you know like we do because they get old you know and you can see the mistakes as they get old so it's hard to stay as proud of them as as you know i was initially um but i would i would say i i did the first react site that i did for a paying client so it was on the side it wasn't for the university uh that was the first site i think that i ever that i ever launched that i didn't react i used next.js for it serverside rendering i was pulling in data from the wordpress api it was very similar to what we did with catechetical institute i was really proud of that i worked on it just so much that was one of my biggest projects for a client that was that that may have been the project that i'm most proud of currently uh it was great and then it provided a lot of you know extra income for my family uh i got to uh use a lot of that money to um i bring my wife on a trip that i was i was going to a conference and it was our 10year anniversary so we were able to um pretend like we were rich for a couple of days and go to really nice restaurants and things so uh she really really liked that so that was cool that that product the project itself i learned so much on and i worked through so many things that just made me want to like quit being a web developer altogether and just move to a cabin with no electricity um but i worked through it all and uh so i was just so relieved and excited and then the the result you know the the reward for the work was was awesome and uh let me do some nice things for my family too so anyway sorry i went on a little bit about that but i never really thought of it until you asked the question so i i i wanted to give you a good answer but anyway that's that's my most the accomplishment that i am most proud of at least from what i can think up right now on the spot okay harshit mentions that stylus is even faster to write than sass interesting i i never tried to use stylus um it seemed to me stylus was always like um not as widely used um on on projects than sas that seemed to be the front runner has anyone else used stylus what are your thoughts on it john hanson says in the react project i'm doing i did switch from i switched to scss from sas you're right so easy to cut and paste style components work very much like scss and js uh strings um as in like nested so awesome yeah so i mean like it's just um it's nice to have the freedom to pull in css from previous projects or from other frameworks and things and just have it work and not have to convert it um so yeah s that that outweighs the ease of typing in my mind uh and that pushed me to use scss instead of sas so let's see harsh it says i like the the and the ampersand the most in sas cool yeah sas has some really cool features like i only i i don't even use most of the cool features really i i don't think i utilize it as much as i could um but it's really cool uh rook says would using some oh i'm sorry i skipped the question um ein ein bischen uh sorry if i'm mispronouncing that says can you tell me the advantage of using graphql or why you would need it okay so for graphql in previous projects we used the wordpress api which is a rest api and that worked well the problem was sometimes we had we had to choose there was a tradeoff we could either make multiple api calls and get exactly the data that we wanted with those api calls or we could make one api call and get a lot like more data than we needed with graphql you don't have that problem in graphql there are not preset endpoints that you just get all the data from you tell the api exactly what you need and it gives you just that data that you need so you can be more efficient in terms of both the amount of api calls you make and the amount of data sent on those calls so that's why we switched up in this project to using graphql i do think that it is better than a normal rest api i suspect that in time it will kind of overtake the rest apis um i mean clearly i think it is it is better uh so it's i it's just a matter of time before more people adopt it okay so rook's question is would using something like normalize css be beneficial to this project might just try and do that to mess around with the get things i learned um i don't know i'm not sure if normalized css would be beneficial or if essentially maybe uh if materialize or i'm sorry material ui is already taking care of some of that stuff it does anybody know or has worked with material ui to know whether or not that is kind of taken care of uh i'm not opposed to bringing into the project if there's some benefit to it uh but if it wouldn't be necessary then it'd probably be better to not have it in the project so i don't know offhand i'd have to you know check out check that out maybe somebody's probably had a similar uh thought before so i'm sure that the answers out there let's see harshit says you should upgrade from node 8.5 to node 8.9 lts yeah maybe i'll upgrade it um at some point i really i really want to get that um that application that we were working on um the styles for that done that salesforce one so i'm probably going to take the rest of the day and and really work on that i did have some positive feedback from some people higher up at the university on it but they did notice some of those things that that we had noticed that i didn't complete yet so i told him i was working on it so i i'd really kind of like to get it done as soon as possible but yeah i would like to stay up to date on that so um i will try to get that done soon okay harshit says the airbnb guide is the best so we were talking about style guys it forces you to write good code if you have lansing in editor cool rook also agrees about the airbnb guide and um uh it says with minimal adjustment you can make it fit your preferences okay i'm gonna have to check that out the the using the airbnb guide um yeah so there are some adjustments that i would like to make depending on what's already in the guide i i tell you truth i looked at it a long time ago i don't remember anything from it um so i'm gonna have to look at it again but yeah we should we definitely should that would be a good practice for people to get used to using a guide because potentially you might need to use it i guess i get a decent amount of people who are looking for work and they're in here just you know trying to get some experience submit a few pull requests so it'd be good for them to get used to that because they may need to use it on their job so that's a great reason and then just in general it would help keep our cl our code better and i like harshet's idea they're saying it forces you to write good code um let's see ein ambition says uh games are too much work yeah um i agree with you there this would definitely be if we were to do a game it would be a longterm project i'm talking like maybe we want to have it done by next year around this time so we'd certainly have a lot of time to work on it um so yeah uh we'll see oh it's not i'm not convinced yet that we will do it just a possibility like i said i think it would be really cool for the students um and it might be fun for us to make uh so anyway i appreciate the input though um so anyway if anybody else has any opinions on that please let me know um harshad says we might use canvas yeah um oh harsha's asking me so do do you what do you want to be done this weekend in this project um okay so in the bulletin project let's see what do we need done still i just saw something okay here's something that should be done but it's it's on the wish list so here's something that doesn't absolutely need to be done but it would be awesome if it could get done this is something that i wanted to do with the bulletin since i first launched it last over a year ago um i think it would be really cool if so right we already have a user we have their email address right so it would be awesome if based on their email address we could display like potentially up in the corner have a little circular icon with potentially maybe just their initials or if they happen to have their email address linked up with something like gravatar we could pull in their data from there um display their picture i'm thinking like you know how google does when you're logged into google some of google stuff you have your picture there and then when they click on that they could bring up let's say their profile in their profile they could if they wanted to add in their preferred name and potentially their preferences so whether or not they want by default the grid layout or the list layout um if they would like trying to think i i would love to have a way to personalize like what they see i'd i'll still want control of like the very top area in case there's some emergency announcement that we need to put there but um maybe what categories they like to see and yeah i think you know there's so many things we could do with that like potentially a history of all the bulletin announcements that they've submitted uh it would be cool to be able to see that so certainly that that's definitely on the wish list it may be complex if you're interested in taking a shot at something like that feel free but otherwise there's really only some small things that need change and it's mainly um just like ui stuff just kind of the look style changes so i don't know that's all i have and i'm definitely open to suggestions of what other what functionality should this have is there something obvious that you would expect it to have that it doesn't have something i'm missing uh or maybe something less obvious that's just cool just to reiterate for those of you who who haven't heard this already the goal of this is internal bulletin so it's for university employees only there they just get announcements about schedules so any events that are happening on campus any announcements about uh holidays coming up or new employees or if an employee had a baby um or if there was um and one of the employees relatives passed away uh you know they'll put like funeral arrangement stuff in there announcements from the president uh of the university so things like that go in here so given that given what the audience is and the content is i'm open to suggestions so um anyway so i know that's not like super specific harsh it uh so it may be uh at this point if anybody wants to contribute to this project it's it's kind of like imagination time right uh i'm open to other features all right anna says thanks for answering oh you're welcome no problem that was a really fun question so i i like that question thanks for asking it okay so tara incognita says i'm not sure for my current skill am i really able to work efficiently on the oh i'm sorry i think i read that wrong i'm not sure from my current skill i'm not sure that i'm really able to work efficiently on the game project from my current skill i just rephrased that a bit it was easier for me to say um but on a on details of that project uh might make me confirmed about contributing on um okay so yeah we can if there's some interest in the project i could get more so like some detailed stuff on exactly how we would be doing it and um so yeah i'll have to think about that maybe next week sometime i can devote a little bit of time in the question and answer to really getting in more details of what we would want uh harshad said stylus is great it even gets rid of uh colons and has many great mixins built in that's cool oh our says view beautify is the material design framework for vue in its building stylus that's cool hardship also says material ui should have a reset like like normalize okay cool so that's good to know um let's see ein bishon says there's no guide that allows not ending in semicolons oh man that's gonna be a problem then um i've gotten so used to not putting semicolons in uh rook says you can modify the rule well that's good that's good um definitely would um if we can change that then i'm i'm in yeah let's see uh i'm mission says how would you store users history on the word on the wordpress server or locally um okay so i'm thinking uh let me let me show you where's my code so let's check out our server for a second here so so like we've already got this you know store going right this is mongodb so i'm thinking we would store the data there uh and since we're already checking it to make sure that the user's like really uh supposed to be there logged in it shouldn't be too much more of a stretch to grab all the user data at the same time so that was my thought if i were going to do it that's where i would start out at is well let's store all the user data in the same place and then pull it all from there so if there are better ways to do that i'm definitely open to that but that was those were were my thoughts and we certainly could store things in local storage um and then just update as needed i think that's kind of a good good practice as well let's see uh sat tinder says don't be lazy because of a few viewers bro um i'm not exactly sure what that was in response that was at 3 45. so that's a couple minutes ago um i don't remember what i was talking about so anyway so tinder if you could uh let me know what that was what i was talking about let me scroll back and see if i can remember uh fabio says um awesome hi from brazil thanks for sharing the gold with us i'm trying to follow the subject i'm a back end developer back in only developer try to use react in both sides front and back is my new challenge awesome that's really cool i i really enjoy uh talking with people that um can't come from back end so like i'm i'm coming from front end and trying to learn more back end uh and i think it's just an interesting flow of realizing like what's what's hard about front end for people who are normally backend and coming into it that's kind of cool uh and then like what what strengths and weaknesses do people bring from both sides so anyway i'm glad to have you here please feel free to add your your input and your suggestions i'm lacking in the back end experience i'm getting much better than i was with back end even a few months ago but that's certainly not i wouldn't call that my strong point now much more front end oriented so i definitely welcome you know your expertise uh so thanks for uh thanks for saying hi in the live chat uh ryan says good afternoon hey how's it going um let's see harsha says i'm back my laptop battery died oh okay cool uh glad you're back and let's see oh okay you picked it up on the phone harshit says okay so horseshit learn back in first as well that explains why uh your expertise then with with back end so that's awesome yeah i like i said i it's always crazy like there are things that front end people seem are like oh that's so easy but then you talk to a backend person and they're like no way i don't mess with that and then vice versa there's stuff that to a background person a backend person is like oh yeah no problem but a frontend person like me will just stare at that like i have no idea what's going on here so um anyway it's cool i think it's great to have people of all uh different backgrounds and skill sets it just makes our projects so much better and being able to share all that knowledge is it's really cool i don't know of anywhere else where this kind of thing is happening where we have such a large diverse community all working on projects together i know it happens on github but like in terms of the live stream and being able live to to work with each other on this i haven't seen anything like it before i think it's awesome and see ryan says i'm learning how to do react from working with php in my sql uh development on a on a programming career okay cool i'm really glad that we have uh someone with php my sql knowledge because we're definitely we're running wordpress um for for several different sites and um it's awesome that you're here and i you know please feel free to when we work on php stuff which we do occasionally feel free to let me know how i could do it better ambition says back end is way more open front end is all just javascript yeah yeah you're right about that that's a good and a bad thing if you want to do front end there's no confusion about what language to learn javascript is it but at the same time if you don't really like javascript you're stuck with it uh gleb says hello from moscow hey how's it going thanks for joining us what time is it in moscow right now it's got to be pretty getting pretty late right okay terry incarnation sorry about the missing words in my last comment thanks for replying oh don't worry about it i mean i'm like not a problem uh it was more just me trying to read it too fast it was confusing um so i'll follow the updates that's coming soon and i'm definitely interested in working with this current project all right great great i'm looking forward to uh to you working on this so um awesome uh ryan says i've been trying to follow your videos on react and learn more from end frameworks cool hopefully they've been helpful to you let me know if there's anything i'm not going over that you'd like to know about or somehow i could improve uh the experience so i actually don't often get suggestions on how i do these things the only suggestion that i i used to get consistently was you talk too much code more um and then i've tried to do that um but i want to make this as good as i can in terms of my contribution to the stream so suggestions are welcome robert says i learned something new every live stream thanks oh awesome i'm so happy to hear that i'm really like that's what keeps me going as long as i know that there's some benefit for you all from this stream i will keep going it definitely benefits me but if it benefits you all and it benefits free code camp i'm going to keep going for as long as my boss will let me do this um even then if my boss says you're not allowed to stream from work anymore i'm going to try to figure out some way to keep doing it outside of work or somehow because um i think this is a really cool thing we have going here all right gleb says yeah it's 11 p.m here okay cool thanks for staying up late to watch this i i mean 11 may or may not seem late depending on whether you're a night person or not but um i don't know i have a little kid so 11 seems late to me now uh jimmy says hi uh are you gonna make um a tutorial on angular i don't have any plans to do an angular tutorial right now i certainly don't feel confident enough in my angular skills which are pretty much nonexistent to be able to teach other people but free code camp does have someone that's doing an angular project right now so i think last week at some point that video was published so just check back a little bit in the in the videos and um uh in the list of free code camp videos and you'll see one that's at the beginning of an angular tutorial so i haven't watched it yet um but i'm assuming that it's good quality i mean everybody is really knowledgeable and does a great job here on on this channel um i don't know if i want to include myself in that category you all see how many times i mess up on my stream but all the other people are really knowledgeable so uh so check that out um says it's 1 25 a.m uh where he's at uh yeah i figured uh that it was it was even later there so i usually don't ask how late it is over there because i i have so many people from that area of the world that i've like i can usually always figure out what time it is there um just from from hearing it so much in the live stream all right ryan says i'm looking at using react and redux for building an ecommerce store i have a client that would like one built on the framework react that's really i'm cool to think i i kind of remember somebody doing something similar and telling me about it recently but i cannot remember who it was if anybody watching now was the person that recently built some ecommerce stuff with react let me know it's possible i may have just seen somebody on twitter talk about it and then i i viewed it so it may not have been directly to me man i really wish that i could remember what that was so i could give you a link to it now that would help out but that's really awesome um i i'm interested in seeing uh what you come up with so i don't know if this is possible but if you're allowed to have the code on github available like publicly available i'd love to see that uh that repository and if i have time i i may even help out with it and and submit a pull request um but let let me know if it's possible then please send me the link and i think that'd be really cool harshit says to do the ecommerce thing use gatsby maybe uh flipkart uses gatsby react uh which is as it's as large as amazon here okay awesome okay cool all right well i've gotten to the bottom of the live chat and it's getting nearly time for me to uh uh to wrap things up here and go home for the weekend so uh thank you so much uh for all your your help in this stream and i i hope i hope you'll learn something from it uh i know i did and i will be back i should be back monday i have to go see a doctor about getting surgery uh done on my wrist but that's in the morning on monday hopefully my appointment isn't really long so i should be okay to stream um again on monday and uh yeah so everybody have a great weekend and i'll see you all next week
