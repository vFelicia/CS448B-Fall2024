hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to look at a chrome dev tools lighthouse audit of this react project that we've been working on and i've been away for a while and i've been sick but i'm getting better so i'm going to try not to cough a lot uh during this this stream um but i'm still not 100 so i'm pretty tired so if i'm if i'm a little off i'm gonna blame it on my my illness i don't really know what it was flu or cold or something but uh but i'm starting to get better now so let me let me start off by just showing you uh in dev tools where the audit is this is actually uh pretty easy to do uh and it's a good way to just kind of check out like what's going on with your website uh in terms of a lot of different factors so there we go okay so on the screen now this is just chrome devtools i'm running it in uh dark mode and i've also extended it out to take up um the full screen so just click that option there and you can see this is the website that we've run this on this is dev.franciscan.university and i updated this earlier today with the latest changes i did do a few more things after i updated so it's not exactly like what i'm running locally but it's it's pretty close so let me get started we do have a question let's answer this marcos asks if the recordings are available um yeah all the live coding uh sessions are all recorded and available on the free code camp youtube channel i also have some stuff available on my channel the link to that's in the description okay so i figure we're just going to go down through all the pieces of advice that lighthouse gives us and uh we just kind of comment on it think about what we can do to improve and uh hopefully it will make this site a lot better but also maybe give you some ideas uh for your own sites all right so first thing we're going to look at is performance so you can see here are my scores um the only thing i was really surprised about was this accessibility score being so high because we haven't really focused that much on accessibility beyond like the normal things uh so so that's pretty good i definitely still want to go through and try to get this number you know as high as possible um but performance was also a little bit of a surprise but we'll see in a second why it makes a lot of sense why the performance is bad right now sorry for the awning uh so let's go through once you run an audit you can um go through each category so we're going to start with performance which we get a 49 out of 100 and it gives you a lot of useful information so uh just to let you know it tells you what were the constraints put on this uh so we are emulating a mobile uh a mobile phone loading this we could do desktop if we wanted but we're doing mobile and that's the default and it's on a 3g network with a slow cpu so there are a lot of different um well is that the only i assume there are different options it's not showing me any but maybe there's some way to do different options but this is pretty good to do it this way and that way for users that have better conditions great they're going to have a wonderful experience but for your users that don't have the optimal conditions then they'll get a good experience if that's what you're optimizing for so you minimize that portion of your users that are gonna have to wait a long time for your site to load so this is i think this is a good idea all right so the first thing we have these metrics it shows us what the user sees uh at various points of loading so this is in seconds so two point let me zoom in if i can it's gonna let me zoom no okay uh so just leave it like this so at 2.6 seconds we're still seeing white up until then and then we see text and ui elements but no image it's not until the 5.2 second mark that we see an image on the screen okay so at that point it's not it's not too bad because everything we want a user to see on this part of the screen is visible but still it took 5.2 seconds to get there so don't like that i don't really like that it took 2.6 seconds for them to see anything at all so we'll see what we can do so this this first metric is gonna say first meaningful paint and uh now it's giving it to us in milliseconds but you know uh we're gonna say that's you know what about three and a half seconds here and if if you don't know what these mean they give you an explanation and they even give you a link to learn more so you could definitely you'll go through this even if you don't know that much about it and click on the links read through it and you have a pretty good idea what's going on uh first meaningful paint though is is just when there's enough content on the page that uh you know it's a website you know users can see like what's going on with um uh your content first interactive and saying this is in beta so you know we'll see whether or not this is that accurate or not uh but this is when the page will be interactive so think about like when we would click when a user would click on this uh menu scroll over like on this side now you know it it may not do anything before that eight second mark right so that's that's kind of an issue a user might click on that and think it's broken sorry i thought i was well enough to do the stream i'm so tired um and then consistently interactive we gotta wait for 16 seconds you see it's showing us even with these lines on the on the timeline here where that happens so you know these these i'm not not happy about these these metrics i would be upset if that was my user experience on the website so here's the good part the opportunities because now we figure out what can i do to change these metrics so first thing is off screen images and i love this idea and it's lazy loading the off screen and hidden images to improve your page uh load speed and time interactive and it actually gives us all the images that we could lazy load and then tells us you know our savings which in this case since we'd lazy load the image like the entire image size would be saved right so each one of these images could be lazy loaded and let's go through even on a desktop you can see i only see one image here unless you want to count this which um i think i'm loading this as an svg i don't remember how we did that but i think it is uh but anyway we don't even see any images until we scroll down a bit further this is a video this is the first image so there's no need to have all these images load up right away once the user starts scrolling then we might want to say oh hey you know let's start loading those images because we need them now uh but we could definitely save a bit of time with that normally your images are your your largest elements of your page oh hey i see a few you're saying hi in there hey john how's it going one asked about the links in the description uh yeah the link to my youtube channel is in the description so i have my own uh channel where i do some some tutorial videos and live streams as well in case you're interested so i think that's a great idea and i'm gonna add this i have a uh just a little checklist on my other screen and as we go through i'm gonna add some uh some to do's which will eventually turn into github issues and we'll try to work through some of those to get the site ready and fast you know faster than it is now and i've been working to cut down on the number of issues and fix some things and close them out so if you've been checking out the github repo lately uh you may have seen the the log issues going down but here we're going to say all right so i know you can't see my other screen i'm not going to switch over just so you can see a checklist i don't think that's it's really that exciting but basically i'm just saying lazy load the images especially on the home page the home page really is the most image heavy page that we have so far on the site so and that's the page that most users are going to come to so we want that to be to give we want to give the most attention to that page you know most of our users probably won't even see any of the interior pages and i'm going to make a note to maybe use source set for this which is like an html attribute where you can specify different images uh for different screen sizes okay so that's good so just with these two things i imagine we could bring our score up significantly but let's check out a few of the other things we can do um serve images in nextgen formats and this is interesting i've never used any of these formats so they're saying instead of using your regular paying or jpeg you can use jpeg 2000 jpeg xr and webp i actually have only heard of webp i haven't even heard of these newer forms of jpeg so that's something that i'm going to want to look into so i'm going to put it on the list but i need to do some research before i do that mainly i would need to know is it supported by browsers if it is supported then i need to figure out how to do it larger than it needs to be um so it looks like we can cut down this image significantly and potentially save 91 percent not harrison could still be cut down by 59 so we can definitely save just by resizing our images we could save a lot we're probably going to end up doing is um trying to do some sort of um replacement of images based on screen width so on a very large screen where we would want a bigger image we'll load that image and then on a small this is a large image right now so i probably i took this and didn't do anything to cut it down so you definitely want to do that even these images which are much smaller by control screen like a mobile where it's a waste to have a really large image then we'll only load the small one so i'm going to make a note of that as well to say now again images we can cut down on the size of images so this alumni profile image which is this image here so this one's a maybe um so i'm just going to say look into using uh webp and then we have reduced render blocking style sheets so it looks like we we have um one render blocking style sheet and this is for our font okay so we are loading our font in the head potentially we could load it lower down the page um you know that's something we might maybe we think about doing i will have to experiment with that one because obviously i want the font to be used the correct font but do we really need do we need that font right away if we could give the user something on the screen immediately or you know less than one second even if it's not the right font would that be better and then whenever the font does load it just switches over you know i think that would be a better user experience it would be a little bit of a change but at least they would see something on the screen it would appear that the page is loaded very quickly so i'm going to look into that i i remember seeing a talk where they were talking about doing just that we're loading a backup front first and then loading the other font i don't know if that's something that's supported right now or if that talk was about things that will be possible in the future so i'm gonna have to find that and uh and figure that out so that's gonna be another one where i'm just gonna research um hello nikki's in the chat how's it going um so uh the font thing i recently did on my blog helps a lot thanks for that retweet on the keyboard shortcuts by the way oh yeah no problem oh okay so it looks like we have some options there uh for that font then okay cool so we'll have to um we'll have to do that i'll i'll make an issue out of it and then whatever ideas you all have about the font you know we can discuss it on that github issue so all right so i've made a little note for me to remember to make an issue out of that oh i see and uh john says react image and react visibility sensor are well known image components for handling image cache and loading oh cool very cool awesome i'm definitely have to check that out thank you john all right so we only have one more here on our opportunities for uh our performance and that's to remove unused rules from style sheets so this isn't a huge deal right we're talking about a 10 millisecond improvement so 10 milliseconds is incredibly fast i'm not sure that it's worth it to take out this bit of code so i'm not gonna even worry about this for now you know there is such a thing as like over optimizing right you know we're going to take these things that are going to be huge improvements and do those for sure and then we'll we'll try again and we'll see what score we get we'll see what the user experience is like you know it may not be worth going through our css and removing things and then making sure it hasn't messed something else up just for 10 milliseconds all right and then we have diagnostics and so we can see all of our all the things that are being loaded and we see how long it takes to transfer those total size i mean look at this six and a half seconds for that one image right that's if we fix this thing up i mean we're definitely uh gonna increase the performance and decrease the load times and that's not even to talk about this image here which um i don't think has been sized properly or compressed at all so we definitely can can do some work with that all right uh so our caching policy is no good now this is on these uh images right now these images well the fonts are we don't have any control over the fonts for right now um because they're coming from google phones but this is coming from franciscan.edu so these are actually being served from the university uh from the campus they're one of the some of the servers that that are there on the campus so we've already switched these over uh all these images over to google cloud servers so i haven't switched the url that we're getting these from but i will switch that soon so we may be able to improve through each one of these these are getting down into like more details of what we're gonna do but you can see there's just so much information i mean i lo i prove this without doing anything we'll see what google has set so this could kind of be a freebie that will be better um critical request chains so around like for the last five years or something because you know i used to go to different websites to try to get this information but i could never get all of this information in such detail uh all together at one time uh this is just really amazing uh and then we could see all the things that we passed if you know if we really want to feel happy about it we can look at the things we did really well um so i'm not gonna look at him right now for time but it is kind of cool to look at in case you're feeling down about all the things that are messed up on your site just you know take a look down here and uh you know give yourself a pat on the back all right so we're gonna go we're gonna check out this progressive web app now oh by the way i think i'm i'm just gonna go through this and then that'll be the end for the stream today it's kind of late and you know i'm still not 100 you know better yet um so in future streams we'll definitely go through some of this and actually do the work to make it better and then eventually we'll do another audit to make sure that we've actually improved um but not for today's stream so if anybody was did really want to see some coding stuff probably not going to see any coding today it's just going to be all about going through lighthouse uh how do we interpret the data we get from lighthouse and some ideas for how to act on that okay so if you're not sure what a progressive web app is i'll give you just a quick um overview a progressive web app uses um a cool feature in browsers now in javascript called a service worker so a service worker is a javascript file it runs in the the client side in the user's browser and it can intercept uh network requests so the network request normally would go from the user's browser and to the server with potentially things in between like uh cdns or things like that but um this sits in between that so uh a network request would go to the service worker first right wouldn't even you leave the user's computer wouldn't even leave their browser and then the service worker can determine what it's going to do with that request right so potentially let's say you cache a lot of data already the service worker could take that request and say hey you know what we already have all this data so we're just going to give you the data right away i'm not even going to send this request back to the server uh and imagine how fast that would be to get the response so a progressive web app number one is very fast but also could potentially enable your app to work offline so there's going to be some features of your app that can work without an internet connection and then for those features that need a connection as the connection it comes available and becomes better your app will progressively get more functionality right so that's what we're going for here now right now you can see we only have a score of 55 so we're not doing what we need to do uh so let's let's check out what's happening number one we don't register server workers so service workers so that's a big deal right um so we need to figure out why we're not registering a service worker and obviously we're not responding um properly when we're offline so we're not prompted to install the app so a lot of these are all basically because we don't have that service worker running okay but there's no um no manifest so maybe that's the best place for us to look for this is that if we don't have the correct data in our manifest we're not all of this isn't going to work so um so for my note for this section for this whole section i'm just going to say let's make sure that manifest is correct uh and then we can run it again and see how much of this is is gonna work because the um i i think a lot of these issues will be solved if we have the correct manifest okay if we fix a manifest and we're still having issues then we know it's something else but i don't want to dig too far into these without testing that first so that's going to be our first step you can see we did pass some things right so um we do have some content when javascript's not available uh that's probably because of our server side rendering okay which is uh definitely a good thing not just for seo we use https we redirect https our page load is fast enough on 3g which as slow as it is it's still fast enough um we have uh meta viewport tag and the content is sized correctly for the viewpoint right so all of these have nothing to do with our service workers so that leads me to believe even more that all these problems are due to our service worker not firing up and i think that stems from our manifest as well but we'll check that out uh in future streams or maybe i'll check it out you know on my own and then just let you know what what happened with that on the stream uh we do have things to manually check i suppose so site works cross browser oh interesting okay so it's it's saying you're testing other browsers which is definitely good um make sure page transitions don't feel like they block on the network okay and each page has a url cool we do this definitely each page does feel like it has a url clicking around the site this looks good i tell you truth i haven't tested on a lot of different browsers yet so that's something i'm definitely going to need to do we can have a lot of users test and then we can also use browser stack to test browsers all right from the same computer we can test in a lot of different browsers and operating systems even mobile right through our um our browser really useful it's a monthly service uh but it's definitely it's it's worth it you know for you know my organization to have that it's definitely worth it all right let me check the uh live chat now since we're i've gotten through the first two uh scores i'm gonna check this and just make sure i'm not missing anything uh shoe pum says get well soon thank you thank you i appreciate it i hope i'm getting well soon because i'm i'm taking the family on a vacation on friday so we're gonna i'm gonna leave friday night drive all through the night well hopefully all the kids can sleep and then we're gonna we're gonna end up in uh going to the beach in virginia so anybody in virginia beach area you know let me know if there's any meetups or anything going on um next week i'll be there for a whole week but if i'm still not feeling well it's gonna be rough to drive through the night uh so hopefully i'm better uh let's see oh jeff says glad i caught a little bit of stream today was wondering why i didn't see you last couple of days get well thanks jeff i appreciate it uh john says for anyone who needs to deal with large images on a site image editing uh it's aggressive jpeg compression plus removal of unnecessary file code done with full live image view it's a monster full page image uh cool and i i use for editing uh it's a free um program so i'm definitely gonna check that out uh jacob asks what browser i'm using now i'm using chrome uh which is recently updated so whatever the latest version of chrome is for for mac for the latest mac operating system uh that's what i'm using nikki says this next js have a cookie cutter way to enable service worker uh create rack that react app has it baked in and gatsby makes it super easy yeah it i thought next did have it baked in so i'm not sure what happened with that i'm gonna have to double check and see maybe some of the custom server things we did messed up the automatic stuff or maybe i'm just mistaken and next doesn't have it automatically baked in um and jacob asked how i got the dark mode yeah so if you go into settings uh under theme so preferences and then appearance theme you can switch from dark to light so i always keep it on dark okay um oh nikki says image optim is good for a mac and jacob asks about tinypng.com you know i've used a lot of different things but what i've mainly used is on the command line i've used image magic and i find that's very powerful if you have a lot of images if i only have one image i will open it up in something like and edit it you know by hand but if i have a ton of images like hundreds of images a command line tool is way more powerful you can just set the parameters of exactly how you want the images resized or cropped or compressed and just batch convert all those images so there's a ton of different options with image magic i mean i found with image magic if something's possible to do with an image there's a way to do it it just takes a little bit of research and reading the docs which are extensive um but it's a very cool command line tool and since it runs on the command line you could even make it part of your build process uh you know if you wanted to so i definitely recommend that for for batch image processing all right let's check out our accessibility score now which as i mentioned earlier i was i was pleasantly surprised at this um i i'm definitely i have an uncle who is blind and uh is is still like um very active in terms of learning new things and being on the internet and everything so it's something that because of that i may be a little bit more aware about and i think about it more um but i still think i could do a much better job at making things accessible um so and accessibility isn't just about those who are you know completely blind there's there's a whole different there's a whole range of different accessibility issues but i think this is great that this is included in here um so let's check this out uh we have some iframe issues and the iframe doesn't have a title this is probably in our uh our videos right so the this youtube video is loading in an iframe i don't think i put any iframes on the page other than that so we can definitely fix that by adding uh elements to our iframes what i actually was thinking about doing is setting this up i i love that we can load this these videos right here and have them be so like available but i really would rather like try to lazy load them or do something because we we are loading all the stuff we need to play this video right away and we definitely don't need to so that's another thing that maybe i'll just look um add to our lazy loaded images in all ad and video if possible but then also let's make a note gonna make a note about adding we're gonna add uh say title so we're gonna add a title attribute to those iframes right it actually shows you the elements and uh if we could see the screen over over here when we did that it would it would highlight the area on the screen we can hover over and it'd show us and in fact those are the the two iframes are both the youtube iframes so uh that's that's what's causing the issue so that's nice that's an easy fix so that's it's good when when it's straightforward we know exactly what to do to fix it let's check out this color contrast i was a little bit surprised by this um but it makes sense so i'll show you the failing elements on the other screen but it says that there's a low contrast text it's difficult or impossible for many users to read so let's check this out and what the texts are talking about is this text so i was a little surprised about it but then once i thought about it i remembered you know what i have had people complain about this text before and we actually made it darker at one point but evidently we didn't make it dark enough and it's still hard to read so we're gonna have to think about a different color here either darkening the color even more or replacing it with a different color you know maybe this could be that that green color or our gold color um you know so we can switch it out for a different color uh in the in our color palette uh but you know this this color is not gonna work so not just here probably anywhere we use this throughout the site this is going to have to change and so that's like i said accessibility is not just about people who are blind i mean right it's about people just not everybody has the vision to be able to see this for me i can see it it looks fine other people might look at that and not be able to make out what that is so we're gonna make a note to change that yellow color everywhere okay let's say uh elements are well structured so in this section we're looking at the structure and we say here we we actually have a list so those lists do not contain only li elements and script supporting elements so it says screen readers have a specific way of announcing lists so we need a proper list structure it's going to mess up the screen reader so this is what it's talking about here this section so let's inspect this and see what's going on switch over to our elements here so is this where our list is yeah where does it start okay here's our ul so within our ul we shouldn't have divs these should all be lis so we've messed up something in this component and i expect i suspect that maybe this is not by default immaterial ui i would think they wouldn't do something like this this is probably something custom that that i did at some point uh without realizing the impact that it would have on accessibility so you know we have a component for this we'll need to just go in and check it out so i'm just going to make a note to say um make sure uh list component has proper uli structure okay so i i think basically if we were to just take all these div tags and make sure that they were lis instead of divs that would solve the problem all right let's go back to our audits scroll back down to where we were and really i mean think about if if we fix that then at least our home page potentially could get a 100 score on accessibility uh which is awesome right of course we'd have to look at our other pages and make sure that we're still it's still accessible but you know that's that's pretty good now i'm not sure if this looked at our our menu our side menu or not so that would be something that we would want to make sure was definitely accessible that's important uh and you can see we we passed a lot of audits as well so uh we're using our attributes correctly following best practices for arya um yeah so that's really cool we have some things that aren't applicable so probably elements um that we didn't use and then there's a lot of things to check so need to go through and and either check these myself or have somebody else check these um you know just go through the page and hit the tab button and see like does this even make sense of where the tab is focusing right try to use keyboard stuff a lot of these have to do with the focus on the screen oh this is a good so visual order on the page follows dom order right so uh a screen reader is going to read through your dom tree right and if you have it all out of order and have used let's say like css to change the order on the page it would make sense if you're looking at it looking at the ui but it's not going to make sense of the screen readers going through it so keep that in mind and we'll have to check that out for this project headings don't skip levels that's a good one that's one we're gonna have trouble with for a lot of those interior pages where we've pulled over some badly formatted formatted content so we'll kind of have to slowly go through those and fix that cool all right the last one left is best practices i'm gonna check the chat again before we go into that because i see a little bit more activity in there okay john hanson says take lots of vitamin d3 and a good multi b that will help you get your energy up from being sick okay cool i've been taking a lot of uh b vitamins i'll have to i have to make sure i'm getting d vitamins i just ran out of my multivitamin like two days ago or something so maybe i'll have to get some more hey michael creels here he says sorry i was taking a nap don't worry about it i wish i was taking a nap too john hanson says are you using css variables for your colors easier to tweak globally um yes some of them nikki says they're they're there in the jss theme um yeah so changing those colors will probably fix a lot of it there may be some places where i like manually put the color in in a style sheet somewhere so i'll have to double check that but i mean that that'll be as simple as just doing uh you know find and replace globally throughout the project michael says some of the accessibility rules seem weird until you actually use a screen reader like chromevox then you understand what's lacking yeah actually that's a great idea uh that might not maybe it'll be a good stream to try to do one day where we go through one of our projects with a screen reader and like listen to what it's saying uh just to get that that experience uh nikki says when doing accessibility work use the axe so it's a capital xe devtools plugin uh it's awesome all right i'll have to check that out i've never even heard of that matt dutcher says feel better b vitamins and airborne uh z cam is amazing for clothes all right i'll have to obviously check that out i haven't heard of that i do have airborne i need to take it and uh thank you all right let's get through this last section here um best practices so we got a pretty good score there i mean that's awesome uh but we failed two things so let's check out the manifest short name will be truncated when displayed on home screen so make your app's short name fewer than 12 characters okay um that seems like an easy fix right we just have our name is too long so that doesn't seem like it'll be a big deal and uh we have errors logged to the console they come from network request failures interesting all right it looks like we may have been trying to prefetch some of this i think probably the it was trying to prefetch these pages and then somehow it wasn't working properly um it may actually be tied into our progressive web app stuff not working everyone loading route yeah and these are the same things with the routes and then we also have some stuff with our manifest um so it says it failed to load it but then it also says that there's an unexpected token so i think all of these might be able to be fixed by fixing the our manifest uh json so that's probably gonna solve just fixing that is gonna solve a lot of our issues um so we may be able to get that up to a hundred percent just by that oops i forgot seo sorry i said this was the last one it's definitely not uh we passed a lot of stuff so i'm not gonna go through it all uh but you can just check some of these other things that they consider best practices all right this is actually cool avoid frontend javascript libraries with nonsecurity vulnerabilities that's kind of a big one i know a lot of my older sites were you know you you check them now and it's like this thing is not secure right it's a lot of times we build sites and then we don't maintain them you know they may be maintained by someone else or they may never be maintained again you know your your contracts up with the client and you're done right and the client said you know well hey my site still works it's fine uh so there are a lot of frontend javascript libraries out there that are insecure that are still on sites you know because of that it's cool to see that we don't have that issue okay um so let's check our seo so this is search engine optimization and um oh nikki says is that an antijquery rule yeah i didn't want to go there i didn't want to call out jquery specifically but yeah that's what i was thinking of it seems like there are a lot of versions of jquery that um are considered insecure so yeah that's uh definitely something to watch out for uh but search engine optimization in case you're not familiar with that that has to do with how high you rank on a search page usually everybody worries about google search rightly so they're the largest search engine by far if you're okay on google search you're probably gonna be okay on other search engines uh so we usually want to rank as high as possible we want to be on that first page of the google search as high up as possible and so that's where the seo comes in that's a big part of it uh so let's check out what we're doing wrong so a document does not have a meta description right we we didn't include a meta description okay so not not really hard to fix we just have to make sure we include that links do not have descriptive text so we have one link that does not have descriptive text so we did we did a good job of putting this stuff in but we didn't on about our mission so we'll just have to put that in and you know what i forgot to make a note so let's do another descriptions what was that page our mission all right and let's see this one document doesn't use legible font sizes it says what was that 40 42.3 percent of text is too small and very helpfully it tells us exactly what is too small so we have some stuff at 13 pixels some at 14 everything needs to be greater than or equal to 16. well this is was a bit surprising to me because i'm always about larger font sizes but let's see where we went wrong here so i'm thinking here uh mainly i never fixed this because i had always thought that i would redo this component anyway so i just kind of left it as is i i didn't really like it it looks like this font might be a bit small and this is another component where i didn't think i was going to keep it like this as well but it seems like it seems like everything else is at least 16. so i i expect it's probably almost everything within this card and then maybe this here uh which that's not a big deal because i was already planning on updating or removing some of these uh but i will make a note just to make sure that all fonts are at least 16 pixels all right and let's see the things that we pass all right we get that meta viewport tag uh we have a title element stat good status codes we are not blocking anything from indexing uh believe it or not i've i've had clients websites where they i go in and check out their site and realize that they're actually blocking from their block from being indexed so whoever had built the site previously or worked on the site had stopped it from being indexed so uh you know they wondered why their seo wasn't you know it wasn't doing well and that's that's why uh canonical great so you have those here's some of the things to check out uh paige is mobile friendly right um definitely we could do this mobile friendly test i'm not gonna do it right now um and we know the site's mobile friendly we've been developing with that in mind all along but we'll probably end up doing this test at some point structured data is valid so we can we also use a testing tool to check out our structured data so not bad definitely want to run this again after we've done some more because you know when you have some changes to make on the front page you know definitely with our images and things with our videos our fonts we still have to put content down here you know we have our our bacon ipsum text here so there's going to be content here that will need to be checked that we haven't even done yet and i imagine we're going to have different content here potentially even more content if we set up that lazy loading it shouldn't be an issue though but this gives us a really good look now at this point in the development of what we're doing right so that we should keep doing it and what we need to improve on uh but overall you know i'm i'm pretty confident we can get all of these scores up significantly there's nothing in here that i'm like scratching my head at saying how are we going to do that uh you know everything we've got a plan for everything you know sometimes that plan is just let's do a little research on this uh but i i definitely think we can get that accessibility up to 100 we can get those best practices up to 100. there's no reason why we couldn't get the seo up to 100 as well if we fix that manifest this should be a hundred the performance is the only thing that i'm saying maybe not a hundred the reason being uh we have those youtube embeds and i know every time i've used the youtube in bed it's been impossible to get up to a hundred so in unless we figure out some way to lazy load those i don't think we're gonna have a hundred percent but we'll see so i'm really excited to get to work on these and then rerun this and see it you know it's kind of like a little game to see what you can get i will say this though kind of just as a as a cautionary note uh be careful about getting too caught up into getting hundreds and everything right the first things you do will be really easy and you'll gain a lot but then that difference between like a 95 and 100 is gonna take a lot of work and from a user standpoint they may not even notice the difference so while it'd be really fun to get all hundreds and it'd be cool when i would screenshot it you know uh nobody really cares about that your users don't care what your score is it just needs to be fast to them um and that's all that really matters so the numbers give you a good guide as to what you do to make it faster but at the end of the day like get out your phone test it out uh emulate a slow network test it out if it's fast then it's fast you know whether it's a 95 or 100 it doesn't matter just make sure it's fast all right so i'm just gonna go back and do some questions and uh just talk with y'all for a little bit before we end the stream and uh let me know especially if you have any questions about anything we've gone over with with this audit or with devtools you know definitely let me know but also open any other questions as well all right michael creole says setting up a manifest json file takes a minute or two that's awesome that's good to hear that's that's going to be a huge improvement in our score just setting that up uh shubham says is there any tool which can uh give us a hint about all this while developing i don't know of any tool but that's a great idea like a nice um like editor plugin or extension that that could do that i mean that would be awesome i mean some of it yeah some of it would have to be a browser plugin and then some of it could be done with uh an editor plugin but a lot of it i think could be done that way that's a great idea michael says audits are like a whackamole game for devs yeah for sure uh nikki says hints while developing uh linting setup yeah yeah that's that's definitely true you could set some linting rules to help you make sure a lot of the markup stuff is correct so some of this stuff where uh you're making sure that certain attributes are are on certain elements that could be a linting thing for sure actually now that i think about now that we're talking about it i just want to check and see that manifest json i want to see if we have it so all right let me make this bigger i know that's probably way too small for everyone to see right now which what be in our static no not pages static would we want to put our manifest json in our static files or is that created in our build we have a manifest.js oh yeah that can't be it no that can't be it all right build manifest json that's not what i want pages manifest json so we have other types of manifest files but i don't think we have the the manifest file that we need so that definitely explains a lot i'll have to look up the format and and what all i need for that all right let's see uh shubham says uh can you briefly explain how do we do page indexing for seo and how it works um well the search engine will take care of indexing so you just want to make sure that your page is readable by search engine so if you're using something like react that does you know that could potentially do everything on the client side you want to make sure you have serverside routing as well so that the browser can get html that it can read instead of just some javascript because it won't wait around for your javascript to make api calls and get data back it'll just assume that whatever it sees at first is what your page is and so you basically it'll think you have a blank page or mostly blank page um you know make sure you have title tags um you know descriptions meta tags your descript meta descriptions as well um proper use of heading tags uh is important so there's a lot of factors that go into seo and it's like a whole field all on its own uh so you know definitely you know check into what the latest best practices are but in terms of your web development you just want to make sure that the search engine the search engine you know um bots the the crawlers right that they have going out there and index indexing pages that they can actually see your content and you know mainly through server side rendering that's that's your best way to handle that uh umberto says hi jesse do you have any advice for how to work with a brand whose color palette does not match the product uh specifically it is an employment services site and the palette is lime green do the best you can with your color palette and i would try to make use of white space a lot so you know you can kind of like we've done here if the color palette doesn't look great on uh on a screen which i don't think the franciscan color palette looks great so you know it wasn't designed to look good online it was designed before right there was you know the internet right so um we make use of white space a lot of white space right we have a clean theme and then we just use some of the colors here and there as highlights right um so like that gold color that we see kind of here and on the outline of things it doesn't look great in a huge block it looked kind of dingy if you have a huge block of it um so we only use it as a trim and it looks really nice you sparingly so maybe you might want to think about doing something like that um maybe using you know seeing how far you can play with the the color right and the hues you know that might be a good idea as well so it does kind of depend on how much leeway you you'll have to to work with those colors change them a little bit maybe uh yeah i don't i don't know exactly what that situation is but if you got some colors that aren't great to work with then just use white as much as possible or if you're doing a dark theme use like the black or really dark gray as much as possible oh nikki says use ctrl p in the editor to search for it that's a great idea wonderful no we don't have a manifest json all right cool definitely need to do that then all right michael says if we had one it would be in the root okay good to know on bears is as it looks kind of like a lawn care or recycling color scheme customer wants the colors reflected in the site all right i would if the customer wants the colors in the site then i would i would use plenty of white space or if you want to go dark themed use you know the dark space right but use the colors uh in key areas where they're visible but there's not a ton of the colors uh and definitely you know let let your client know the benefits of having all that white space you know maybe look up some statistics or studies if you if you need to about you know the the user being able to focus on the the text more and on the content of the site uh if you can uh try to have concrete evidence to back up your decisions right so if you if you do go in and say like this color is terrible like that's not gonna work but instead don't even talk about their color explain why white is so awesome and will be helpful right and uh it takes the focus away from something negative about their colors and it spins it as something positive and maybe you could even give examples of other sites that do well that utilize a lot of white even maybe like wellknown brands who have wellknown color schemes and if they still use a lot of white on their site like you know things like that so hopefully the client likes what you do and you don't have to do any of that but just be prepared to explain the benefits of you know a design without a lot of color if you need to and the bottom line is if the client really wants that color all over the place and it turns out ugly you know you can just do it get paid and don't put your name on it leave it out of your portfolio i mean i understand how it is sometimes you got to pay the bills so at the end of the day if the client really demands it even though you tell them it's against your uh you know your suggestions of what's best for the site then you know that's that's what you got to do now if if you don't need the money right now then you could be choosy and say okay find somebody else to do it uh but most people don't have that luxury and i totally understand that you know you you know you gotta get the job uh you gotta get it done and get paid uh let's see michael says i talked to nikki about this but i'm having problems with the lack of motivation so i like watching your streams to try to get it back three weeks and counting now uh maybe why i bugged you earlier oh don't worry about bugging me that was i was cool i'm like i was happy that that you were you know checking in on me so yeah i definitely understand about lack of motivation uh i struggle with that too and the streams help me as well um you know i i don't want to come on a stream every day and have nothing done from the previous stream right i i want to get things done and be able to you know have progress in the project and have new things to talk about with you all so i totally understand that motivation can be hard sometimes i don't know the best thing is you just get a project that you're excited about you know some or you know some new thing you're learning that you're really into uh and that seems to help me get motivated and um you know sometimes exercise helps for me like caffeine helps um sometimes people react differently to caffeine so that might not work for everybody and um you know sometimes sometimes you just you just gotta do it like there are some things that it wouldn't doesn't exactly get you excited or really that motivated but it'll help you to just get the job done like you know i i need to do this because i need to get paid i'm not gonna be able to pay my bills or if i don't do this my boss is gonna be upset with me or you know so anything like that it's not like positive reinforcement but if it if it gets you to get the work done it's still good you know you don't want to always have that you know to rely on but it's a nice backup plan like all right well if i can't get myself motivated all these nice ways at least i'll be afraid to mess up and that'll be my motivation so that can help now i know for some people like giving updates on social media about their progress helps because it's like if i tell people i'm gonna do this and then i don't do it then you know that everybody's gonna know i didn't do it that can help some people as well it could probably hurt some people too i mean if people struggle with anxiety that may not be the best thing to do but uh it does work for some uh nikki says i couldn't help a lot here sadly also in general it's super easy to get overwhelmed yeah it is it is i've yeah there are a couple times recently where i felt overwhelmed with just the amount of work that still needs to be done on this project and i'm working on another project um um so i don't know if y'all have ever been to the site balance.io it's like a crypto wallet site um they're coming out with an app and they're using react native to build it so i've been working on that and uh so you know it's like on top of all the other things i have this which is really fun and i like working on it uh but it's just one other thing to be kind of overwhelmed about so uh the best thing that that i can do when i feel overwhelmed is just like have a todo list and just say i'm gonna do this one thing and then i get focused and i do one thing and i get it done and it feels good to get that done and then i move on and i move on right i get to just chip away it forces me to stop looking at the big picture and focus on something little and manageable and uh usually i can start to get my mind focused where it needs to be and that overwhelming feeling goes away okay all right well i'm done with the questions for the stream also i forgot to mention earlier and maybe i'll bring it up on another stream as well since there's not that many people watching right now but uh i was uh one of the individuals selected as a top contributor for free code cam so i'm really honored about that and um so they're having several like i don't know parties for the top contributors uh so i think around august 18th august or somewhere around august 18th i'll be in new york city so if anybody is in new york um you know maybe i'll get to hang out but just want to throw that out there in case anybody is anybody's interested and and meeting up or anything like that so uh oh thanks john john said congratulations yeah thank you it was really awesome uh to be selected uh all right cool so yeah i'll i'll try to stream tomorrow um i know it's gonna be busy trying to get everything ready to go for vacation and get everything make sure i have everything done that i need to get done at the office before i leave but i'm definitely gonna try to stream because i most likely won't stream during vacation um so in case something happens and i can't stream the rest of the week um i'll see you all the week after next uh and you know i'll be on social media and stuff so if y'all need anything just want to say what's up you know i'll be there but uh won't be around for streams but anyway thanks for uh for coding with me or well doing the audit stuff with me today i had a good time and um yeah hopefully i'll be back soon and uh till then have a great day
