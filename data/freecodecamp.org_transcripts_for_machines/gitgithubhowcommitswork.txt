Let's talk a little bit about what exactly a commit is. Now, we talked about to commit being a snapshot and that's exactly what it is. A commit is represented by a 40 character sha1 hash and I wrote a couple little short versions over here but in that 40 characters there's a lot more than just numbers and letters. There is a blob of the changes, so blobs represent files, so you made changes say to index.html, Git stores a blob of that file which is a reduced version of that code in a very lightweight way. It also includes some metadata. That means who made the commit, what time did they make the commit, and what's the parent commit? Now what's the commit that was made right before this on this working branch. All that information is stored and compressed in that 40 characters sha1 hash, which means that commit ID is very, very important.
