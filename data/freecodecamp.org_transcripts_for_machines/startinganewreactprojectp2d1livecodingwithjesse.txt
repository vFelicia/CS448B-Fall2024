hey everyone its Jesse and today I'm really excited that I get to start a new brand new project as if you've all been watching for the last month or so I've been working on the same project and I'm just so I'm so happy to be be finished with the project and it I'm happy with the way it turned out and I learned a lot on the project and you all helped me so much but it's good to start start something new so I had a lot of people give me feedback that they wanted to see a project from the very beginning so this this is it this is we're gonna start from scratch you can see I have I have nothing this is literally nothing on the screen right now so I'm gonna start you know here even even my terminal is I haven't even typed one command yet and I have a blank Trello board so no no work at all beforehand we're gonna start this up you know from scratch so the first thing that we're gonna do is I'm gonna go over what the project is and what the requirements are and then that's gonna be determined how we set things up alright so since the the point of this dream is to show what you know what it's like for me as a developer I want to show the whole process so I'm not gonna jump right into the code we need to get a little bit of planning in as well so and I hopefully you all can help me in that planning process so it looks like we have a lot of viewers right now I'm gonna try my best to keep up with a live chat but it's going pretty fast right now so let me pull over my timer so we're gonna use the last couple of shows have been using this timer and I'm gonna start this and then that way every time this Pomodoro timer goes off we'll take a fiveminute break and during that break I'll make sure I'd catch up on as much of the live chat as I possibly can and then during the other 25 minutes I'll try to dedicate that mostly to focusing on the task at hand so hey everyone and I see a lot of a lot of people saying hi let me show you so here's what the project is going to be I want I already know ahead of time I want to do this and react and I just said somebody said in the the Instagram feed so I the secondary feed for this dream is on Instagram and it's the view of my face as I'm coding and I just had a question in there it was from some from one of my former students and he asked who is your favorite X student so and that's from from D tribe that was of course his nickname but D trav since no since none of my other students are watching this dream right now I'm gonna say you were one of my favorites now I don't I can say that without lying at all I really did like having you in my classes so you're a good guy so anyway thanks for watching so I hope everything's going well with you but I'm gonna get to work now so anyway I know I want to do this project and react because I've been working in reactants on a course and react right now some future sites are gonna be in react so if you're tired of me doing things in react I'm sorry it's gonna be more react unless there's some really really good reason that you all can come up with why I should do this using something else it's probably going to be a react project so let me explain what's going on so my very first project here at this job almost two years ago my first project was to make what they called a resource center so I work in the marketing department and we do a lot of things for all the departments here on campus at this university so we were constantly getting requests from people lots of people in different departments and we we just didn't keep track of them well and sometimes things would fall through the cracks you know if we're getting at each request sometimes it would be you just happen to pass somebody by when you're you know walking from one building to another and they mentioned something or a phone call or email so you'd see how it easily would get overwhelming and then there's no record of what we you know what we did so my original goal was to come up with some system where we could track everything where people could submit you know what they wanted us to do and also where they could get resources that they were constantly asking us for like logos they could just go on and get it themselves without having to email people or call people so I did that and it worked it was great but now it's time to redo it and update it so let me show you the old one to give you an idea of what we're working with and what we need and so I'm gonna pull this over on the screen let me make it a little bigger and so this this is our current I guess kind of internal site this runs on it's called J ICS so a company called Jenzabar makes this for for higher education for universities so this is the homepage I did not design this I'm not gonna say any more about it but it was not me I'm gonna log in and show you the part of this that I did design and so let me just tell you when I click this basically I do some things with zindex to where the the page that comes up just hides all the stuff that's behind it it goes in front of it so you can see there's definitely some weird stuff going on when it loads but this is it all right so yeah yeah let's take the live chat I'm there so that really was the menu yeah can you believe that yeah so it's I think that's safe to say that the UI for that is terrible I don't think I'm gonna offend anybody here at the University I think it's the there's a general consensus that UI is terrible so the good news is that that UI is gonna change the bad news is I'm gonna have to redo all what I've already done because Jenzabar has finally decided that it's a good idea to have a responsive website so I'm really glad because it's 2017 and they're finally having a responsive site so they're coming down they're coming out with their version 9 which totally will conflict with any custom themes that have been done so far so I've been seeing that the only real way to get information about Jenzabar stuff is on their listserv it's crazy this company is just like I don't know like straight out of the 90s and never changed and I've been seeing over the listserv a lot of people have been having trouble when they've upgraded with their UI just breaking so I'm expecting that to happen so I've decided that I'm not gonna try to develop it within here because let me show you this is how I have to edit it I have to actually go into here let me show you the Javas fits here so I need to go in let me find see it's crazy I can't even find what I'm supposed to find let me refresh literally if I want to make any edit I have to copy and paste into here into these little text boxes so I'll show you again you can see it's it's so frustrating I mean I've spent hours on this and it's still hard to remember the sequence of clicks that I have to go through so let me show you well I don't see I'm not even sure why that well so I can't even I actually can't even click them I can't even show you where the the boxes to edit this because evidently this entire page now has become a link to canva so you can see the frustration and trying to develop this so I am definitely not going to try to make what I made work with whatever a new system they come out with so that's out of the question we're definitely we're doing this it's going to be hosted most likely on a digitalocean server and I'm just gonna link to it from within this they call it my Franciscan but this kind of a university intranet alright so these are the main things that we need this this site to do the some of these are just links so this brand manual this is just a link to PDF super easy so it needs to be able to link to resources we need to be able to let people download different versions of our logos so this is what I have set up this is using I think isotope or masonry yeah so just has two logos you can download different versions of the logos and it does the so anyway that's that's one of the main features I think the poster one is simply some links and some information not a big deal letterhead is also just some some samples some images not a big deal I'm just going to skip ahead the rest is pretty much the same a lot of text the only thing that's gonna be a little bit of a big deal is this form so the form is actually going to change a little bit we want to change this wording but as I said I'm I'm holding off on making any updates to this until we totally redo it because I'm I'm not gonna try to go through the the headache of you know copy and pasting every change so basically we just we need a form we need that form to be to be able to upload files and then we need the data from the form to go directly into our project management system which we use rike for project management so it needs to go into rike and it also needs to send out an email to the person that's submitted saying that hey we your submission went through and then it also needs to send out an email to someone here in my department saying that someone submitted something okay so those are the basic you know just the very basic things that it needs to do so this is not gonna be you know really really difficult project now I'm open to changing anything in this UI so you can see this was early on this was before I kind of refined the brand standards for this university and but it basically adheres to a lot of what we're doing you know you can see material design elements here you can see it has you know some of the proper shadows and things borderradius so it has familiar elements to some things but if i'm going to redo it I may as well update the UI I don't want to make it I don't want to really startle people but if the UI for my franciscan is gonna change completely it shouldn't be that big of a deal if this UI also changes because people will most likely expect it to change if everything else is changing as well I currently do have all the other links to things in my Franciscan here.these I probably won't be able to pull these over and I don't really know that I would I even want to if we're gonna make a new a new site that's not within my Franciscan so anyway that's the that's it I mean that's that's the project requirements I have probably I'm gonna say like three weeks do I want to try to get this done in you know give it give or take a week so I'm gonna go to the live chat I want to see what you all think based on what I said so here's here's what I would like your opinion on I'd like to know well one is there any really good reason why I should not use react I'm I'm like 99% sure I want to use react but just in case there's something I'm overlooking then you know I'm open to that also should I use next j/s like we did for the last project or should I use something else like create react app or should I I really do actually I don't want to attempt to do it completely from scratch and set up a web pack config and everything because I just don't think I have enough time to really learn that properly maybe I'll save that for for a later project but I'm kind of thinking I ought to just use next j/s I'm really familiar with it I could develop quickly with that I don't necessarily need the serverside rendering this is not a site that I need to be indexed by search engines the routing that comes with it would be nice but there's not a whole lot of routing that needs to happen right now this is all just I didn't show any the code for this but this is all jQuery even the routing is with jQuery so these they have hashes for the links and they all work so you can actually go to you know to the URL assuming that you had a login and it would take you the right spot so that was all custom jQuery routing but let me look at let me look at some of your responses I see there's a lot of stuff in here let's see oh I'll see if there's any questions I guess I'll answer them now I wonder what I'm not yeah I'm not not quite to the time yet for questions but since I asked you all so many questions I'm just gonna check the live chat now yes some people were commenting on how many people were waiting they were actually at 10 people waiting at one point for this for the video that was really awesome while we're up to a decent number of years to 163 that's well above what we normally get so I assume there's some new people here watching for the first time so welcome and please feel free to join in a live chat if you can your I really value your opinion and helping to figure out how we're gonna do these projects so I have some questions where are you from I'm from originally I'm from West Virginia in the United States but now I live in Ohio I'm actually right on the border of Ohio so I'm closer to Pittsburgh Pennsylvania you may know that's kind of a bigger city so you may know where that is someone asks do you go live I do stream every weekday unless something comes up where I can't like on Monday I I wasn't working so but I try to stream every weekday at 200 p.m. Eastern Time let's see I'm skipping over some stuff here I will go back through though and at the end and try to answer as many questions as I can Earl asks do you charge for services on your campus no we currently don't charge for the services on the campus although I I am I think as a department we should charge and that would give people a better idea of how much things actually cost and whether or not it's a good idea because I think right now people just think okay we're starting a new thing we want video we want print materials we want an email campaign and a new website and all the stuff because they never see the bill for that necessarily I mean they have to pay for the printing and things but I I think it would people would be more realistic about what's what's possible what's reasonable if they did have to pay someone mentioned that I am salaried yes I am salaried here okay the someone mentioned that the microphone is buzzing it's probably my phone I'll try to move my phone a bit farther away let me know if the mic is is still buzzing I moved it a bit I see yes so people were saying it makes them want to cry when they saw that sight yeah that was the first thing I saw when I came here my very first project and I was just it's amazing that I stayed all right so I'm getting to so there's just so much in the live chat going on I'm I'm trying to find I know I saw some people give me suggestions about what we should build this in here we go Santa said if you need an app why not refactor in react native it would be cool actually to make this an app that would be really cool okay so you have people saying yeah you use react some people said in XJS okay preact create RAC react app don't reinvent the wheel create that okay so we had some people a lot of people saying create react app okay maybe we'll do that then we'll use create react at all right let's do that it looks like we had a lot of people saying use create react app so I'm gonna go with that we're gonna use create react app and then we'll use we don't need anything crazy for routing so we'll just use basic like reactor outer and I think that'll work that should work yeah so I will say this this is going to be a more of a learning experience for me because I do have a lot more experience with next j/s more so than I do with create react app so I'm gonna be learning along with you I am using create react app in my react course that I'm doing right now and that's the one from Udacity so I'm not and I have used it before so I had up on my screen oh here we go I had it ready basically I had the neck next and create react app ready to go so we can kind of walk through some of the installation process let's so let's also start I'm gonna show you how we how at least I plan out my projects so I'm gonna do it to do ready ready for dev in progress testing and done and then wishlist okay so we're just gonna make some basic cards so it's gonna be and whenever I do things I always put an estimate so I'm gonna include some other setup things in there that's what I'm saying it's gonna take I estimate how many Pomodoro cycles everything will take so let's see see what else you want to do I kind of don't want to break down everything right now yeah I'm gonna unless somebody really wants to see this I'm gonna fill out these cards afterwards because I'd like to get pretty detailed and all the steps and that will probably take a long time it won't be that fun to watch so since we are gonna work on this today I'll just fill this one out and I'll move it two in progress but the idea is I take all the tests I know I need to do is tomato how much time it's gonna take and then I move them along the process and when it's done I also say how much time it really took and I don't think this is public now but I'll make this public so y'all can see it as well all right so let's take to make I'm gonna make the font size a bit bigger so y'all can see and this is just the create react app github repo if you want to follow along so let's go through the setup process I want to keep all of my projects in a projects folder and let's say the Resource Center yeah okay so I'm not gonna use NPM I'm gonna use yarn so let's go yarn if you're not familiar with yarn well if you're not familiar with NPM at all this is a way to install node modules so nodejs is a way to use JavaScript serverside and not just in the browser and so NPM is the way that you pull in different little bits of code that people have written and packaged up in these little modules so you pull them in with this command line tool called a node package manager or NPM yarn it basically does everything that NPM does but it adds a few extra features one thing it does is it seems to be a bit faster and it keeps better track of like the exact versions of things so for now if you're new just know that you can use yarn or NPM interchangeably and they'll both they'll work so I'm gonna pull in this create react app NPM package so I'm gonna go yarn add so just a little bit different create react app and I don't think I have I'm not gonna worry about installing this globally right now I'm not really sure how many times I'll use this we'll see how it goes with this project alright so actually let me see if this created I'm going to open this up an atom it should have yep it did okay so we have now a package.json file with this dependency of create react app I didn't fill out anything else from the package.json file but I can always do that later on and now let's create the app so we'll type in create react app and then we're gonna name it I should have done I should have done this one level up oh wow alright it looks like the mic is still buzzing so I'm gonna move I'm gonna move my my phone try to get it farther away I made you soft I had it plugged in charging right now but I may just have to keep it unplugged and move it like really far away all right let me know if that's it yeah okay Sebastian I see your thing so I did realize this so I let me let me just go back because I messed this up I really should have installed this globally and I wasn't thinking when I first did it so dang it and I wasn't thinking then I got sidetracked and typed in so let's let me go back out here oops so I'm gonna remove recursively everything in that Resource Center folder all right so now I am gonna do this properly and they already have this installed nice I think it's on my laptop I don't think I installed it here right now I'm working on an iMac okay so now let's try this again the correct way now's a great time to give my normal disclaimer that this is entirely live and not rehearsed so you will see all of my mistakes I do my best to not make them but as you know like everyone I'm not perfect so we'll make mistakes and you'll see that hopefully you all can learn from my mistakes along with me and maybe you know you won't make them because I've already done it create react and now we're gonna call this center resource sensor today let me make this a bit bigger I just occurred to me that this was still pretty small all right so now this is doing its thing it's installing so if you're gonna if you want to try this out and read all this insulation stuff you can but basically it's just it's installing everything that we need to build a react site all right so while that's running I'm gonna come back and catch up a bit with a live chat I think my timer did go off let me find it here yeah it did and I I didn't click the break so the short break so let me take a few minutes I'm going to go back through and try to answer some questions especially if anyone's new he asked some questions definitely want to get to your questions hey everyone yeah I'm seeing a lot of new people so welcome I really appreciate you watching and feel free to ask any questions I'll try to get to as many questions as I can and don't worry if you're new and you're not sure what's going on I'm happy to explain anything so just let me know let's see rah rah choo says can you please train us with some Java projects I don't do anything with Java at least not for years I haven't done anything with Java so I won't be doing anything with that Carlos asked with terminal I'm using its I term I think it's I turn to so yeah it should say yeah I term to Earl says very cool that you're doing this for everyone thank you thanks for saying that hopefully you all can get something beneficial out of this I know I do from all of your input I get Kaz Kazik I can't pronounce that but if the first part is Kazakh says hey Jesse many thanks for what you're doing you're welcome thank you so much for watching and for saying that Park Ryan says love free code can't live awesome I love that you're watching thank you for saying that Philip said marketing something Philips and marketing as well I I think I remember talking about that before with you I just saw Raunak said from 1995 to 2017 in one click yes so this when I went from the from the one site into what I had done for it yeah everybody was really surprised whenever I built that it kind of caused I don't know if I want to say trouble exactly but it was like it caused trouble in that other departments then immediately wanted similar things for their sections of it and so that kind of caused trouble because people were asking they were asking the people who were in charge of that site to do the same thing that I did and it just so it was a little bit weird I was happy that everybody liked it so much but it was there's a little bit of tension over it okay so this would work so I'm I didn't get through all the all the live chat because there's so much in there right now which is which is awesome I think that's that's so great you all are so active in the chat I just see Umberto's comment it says mumbles dotnet core with react test Hut net so yeah I'm not gonna be doing any done that stuff anytime soon although the we do have some sites that run on dotnet that I'll probably need to be doing something with so it's possible there might be some dotnet stuff happening so I'm gonna go back let's see I guess my 5 minutes isn't up so let me I said I'd give 5 minutes to live chat so as soon as that timer's up I'll go back to it let's see okay so Scottie says Scottie is new so hey welcome welcome Ron access new awesome Mehmet says I don't understand how devs can allow clientside rendering because my first rule was never to trust the client yeah I mean there's benefits to doing clientside rendering so I mean I wouldn't obviously the the best I like to do both to have serverside rendering and clientside then you get the benefits of each so you know that's my preference but I certainly I don't like to render everything clientside unless there's no other way which there's usually another way all right so yeah I didn't get through everything in the chat but I'm gonna go back over to here so we can kind of get through some stuff and I'll I'll come back into the chat I did just want to get through that first part because once we get a lot of messages I won't be able to read the stuff that you all put in the live chat earlier on all right so let's check out the message that has given us here success awesome we created resource center inside that directory okay so it's telling us the commands that we can use and using yarn as well so we can start our dev server which is yarn start we can build our files if we need to which we don't need we won't need to do that for a long time and okay we can run tests and then if we want to I don't know that we're gonna have to do this but we might at some point we might need to do this and we might need to use yarn eject and when we do that then we're going to be able to configure things a lot more than we can now so create react app is it's really nice because it gets you started with things without needing to know anything about webpack or all the build tools that you're using but the you have to give up some of the freedom to customize in order to get that and if you don't eject then you can take advantage of all the updates that come out but once you checked then you have to handle some of that stuff on your own so we'll see we might need to eject at some point I'm thinking possibly to handle some of like the file upload things because what I've used I have you some things in the past that I'll need to do like some custom stuff with so we'll see if we can make it through without having to eject that would be ideal but I'm not opposed to doing it alright so as they say we could start by seeding into resource center so let's do it and then typing in yarn start so let's see what port we're starting the dev server showed up in this little tiny window alright so here we go so here it is as you can see it didn't take that long it would have been really really fast if I hadn't to spend so much time messing it up and then talking but in very you know very small amount of time and effort we now have a react site and it works I love that little animation that's cool we actually we also have this available in the network which I didn't realize that the last time I built that I didn't even know so that's really cool so obviously this is not what we're gonna keep so we're gonna get rid of all of this and everything but it's good to know that at least it's it's working so let's check out what code we have now in that let's see and I think I'm just gonna exit this because I set our old stuff that when I messed it up and I'm gonna duplicate this tab because this is going to stay open with our server but then now I can't do anything on it so I'm gonna duplicate that so now I'm in here and I want to see I'm going to type in atom and then dot and that's gonna open up atom and let's get rid of these welcome guides and let's see what we have let me make the font a bit bigger all right so here's our package JSON file if you're not familiar with this this is the file that it lets us know a little bit about the project and what dependencies that we're using so like what other packages so essentially when we have a package JSON our project is now an NPM module no we're not really worried about most of the time nobody's gonna download our stuff as a module rafe we're just trying to create a site but the official name and everything is you know this is kind of like an NPM module how it would normally be set up so we're not really worried about I I don't worry too much about editing kind of this this up here what we want to worry about more our dependencies and our scripts we're not gonna change anything right now at some point later on we might though we might want to add in some you know some things to process or CSS well we'll see we'll see what we need as we go on and let's see it did make a readme for us right now this readme has a lot of stuff a lot of stuff about create react app so at some point we'll probably do a proper readme for for our project but for now I'm gonna leave this in here and possibly refer to it if necessary and let's see what else do we have the yarn lock is a file you'll probably you'll never want to update this manually and then you have your git ignore so this is gonna so we're gonna use git for this project but this is going to tell get the files that it doesn't need to worry about tracking okay so this is pretty standard you generally don't want to track your node modules and depending on what you're using for your project you might have different things that you're not going going to track so the next step is let's check out our source and so I want to open up some of the pages so this is our index j/s okay so all this is doing is pull import importing some things and then we're rendering the app component so let's check out our app component so we have a tas and this is where we start to see like things that actually look like HTML and this is called JSX so it does look like HTML but it behaves a little bit differently so we use classname instead of class that's kind of a big obvious thing right off the bat and then we can actually put JavaScript inside of brackets so this logo here is actually a JavaScript you know variable we're calling on we've imported logo from the logo dot from logo dot SVG so those are just a few of the different things and we can see we can change change some things so I'm going to add some exclamation points because I'm super excited and I'll show you see now we have the exclamation points so that's the file that we're gonna start editing first and at this point what we want to do is I guess we should set up our argot let's set up get first because I want you all to be able to see all this code normally I'd actually wait a little while to set up get because I do so like some just basic stuff to set up the project but in this case I think it would be better if you all could see and interact with all of the code so let's do that now so we're gonna do get in it and that's gonna make this a git repo all right so now let's do git commit let me let me do status just to show you all right so we have the skit status so we have these files that are untracked right and notice that these aren't all the files in our project so those ones that were in the get ignore aren't listed here so we're gonna do a git add and I'm gonna press just put a period there and that's gonna add everything and now if we look at our status you can see we have green so now we're ready to go to add all of this so I'm gonna go get commit and I'm just gonna do the EM flag which means I can put the message right here in line for this commit and I'm just gonna say and that this is our initial commit and there we go so now this is a git repo let's set up the repo on github so that you all can see what's going on so I want to go into my github actually we should I'm gonna do this in the github for my for my department so let's go just make a new repository Resource Center okay so we're gonna have a new repo called Resource Center and all right so just a quick description we're gonna make this public there's no reason right now that this should be private there I am gonna have some API keys and things later on that I'm going to need to use but I'm gonna use it serverside and I'll use environment variables that won't get shared in the repo and then that way I can still share all the code without worrying about sharing API keys so when we get to that part I'll hopefully I'm able to do that in a stream because I think that's an important step if you've never done that it's good to know so you don't accidentally share you know keys that that should not be shared so we're not we don't need to read me because we already have one the same thing with the gate ignore we don't you know we don't need one license I'm not really worried about a license right now let's see so let's create this repo alright now we have an existing repository so we want to push that from the command line so we're gonna copy this this git remote add origin alright so basically we're setting up our remote here at this address and then we're just gonna push everything up to github so here's our first command and then here's our second there we go and let's check out the repo alright awesome so here's our repo as I said are the readme has like everything from the create react a premie which we're going to take out at some point but for now that's in there it shows our first commit it shows our code so it's just like our App J s so you can even see where we added the three exclamation points so there you go so now you can you can look at this I'm gonna paste this URL for the repo into the live chat and then I will be putting this in the description for the video for every video so that you all can see it so there it is in the live chat and let me I'm gonna check my timer okay let me move let me move this off and let's bring this in since this is where we're gonna be doing you know we want to see the work so we have to we have to come up with our how we want this layout to be how it's designed to be now we have some brand guidelines that we need to follow we already have how it looks now so we just need to kind of determine well how do you really want this to look also we got to make another decision here and I need your help on this one because I'm I know what probably should be done but I don't know if I'm ready to do it and here's the thing I've used materialised framework for all my CSS but it's based off of jQuery and it's not good to modify the Dom with jQuery when you're using react you want to modify it in the react way preferably using state to rerender things so do I use materialize framework again and just just deal with the fact that I'm gonna have some jQuery do I try to use materialized but don't use any of the parts that use jQuery or do I try to just completely do it from scratch doing it from scratch is going to take a long time it would be cool to try to convert maybe use materialized but then convert some of the stuff that it has I'm not really sure or is there another library that I should just try to use instead I haven't seen a material design react library that I would that I really liked they've always been things about the ones that I've seen that we're kind of like deal breakers for me I didn't want to use it so I'm gonna go to the chat I'm gonna see what you all think about that before I make a decision on this because I mean I'm at the point really where I'm going to start countenance oh if I if I'm going to use a framework I need to know because my markup is going to be based off of that framework alright okay I got a lot of suggestions here let me actually bill said you plan on using tests for this project actually I hadn't even thought of it but that's a great idea I have not used tests very often at all so maybe I should I do want to learn how to do tests so maybe now is the time to start maybe this is the project where I finally do all those things that I know are good ideas but I've always put off because of tight deadlines so we'll see all right so we have material UI so these are some suggestions for alternate to materialize CSS so there's a material you I react materialize ok another suggestion for react materialized bootstrap right look at another suggestion for react materialize Wow okay okay so it seems like if I'm gonna go with the framework the most votes in the live chat go to react materialize so let me bring that up right now so everyone can see what we're talking about let's check it out react materialize let me see looks like I've already gone there alright so this is what we see react materialize alright this is at least this would be consistent I suppose if it's based off of materialized it'd be consistent with what we've done before I'm assuming some of the markup and classes would be the same I'm also assuming that for sure they're not using any jQuery I think it's safe to assume that we'll see okay I need to see let's see what the forms okay not bad I'm liking this so far this would have been helpful in our last project if you remember we had some trouble with our selects okay see how the date picker on nice nice great okay and oh my job was good let's see I want to see if it says for sure that it's not using jQuery this has actually come a lot farther along than when I first looked at it so I'm really impressed with this now I mean maybe I just didn't do a very good job of looking at it all but I thought the last time I checked which has been quite a while that it didn't have nearly this this much so I do want to verify that they are not loading Jake hey folks and it looks like alright jQuery is being loaded let me see if let me check that github page does any Canadian does anybody know for sure how do you use this and does react materialize actually use jQuery or is that being loaded for something else on that page oh it does say alright Carlos I see that thank you I think Carlos answered my question before you even ask that so thanks for being so on top of things all right so we're Lee getting started let's see yeah all right well it looks like I was really really excited about this but this is not what we want what we want is this without the jQuery and I know it's got to be possible right I mean there's nothing special about jQuery that that can't be done in react so yeah we're going to it's going to have to be a note for react materialize I feel really really bad about that because it looks so promising I was actually like have been really considering trying to contribute to this too because I I want to do this as well and I didn't want to just start my own thing if they're already doing this but if that I don't know if they intend to try to make do it without jQuery or not if that's their intention and they need help I'd be happy to try to do that but for now I just don't yeah alright so I'm not going to use that what was try material UI let's see and here's material UI let's see some of the components I'm actually I'm really interested in the form components since we will have a form nice to see text fields okay it looks good let's see how the code looks all right that's pretty clean before I go any further I'm gonna check right away and see what is being loaded these are songs for other stacks yes I cool all right that's good let's um let's see date we I think we do use a date picker okay cool that looks good it's select that's what it's crazy I'm looking everywhere and this is an alphabetical order it shouldn't be that difficult okay that's not that I like that okay I'm liking this so far let's see I'm gonna get a lot really quick to see if someone has contributed some important information before I commit to this but I think this is going to be what we go with okay Greg is asking please say if you're going to start doing tests I'm listening the background I really want to start testing myself I always have issues doing a setup well I guess I probably should start doing tests this is going to be a small project so it's probably better to start with something small so I'm gonna try to start doing tests I can't guarantee that it'll be that helpful to you since I am not that familiar with tests but I'm gonna try try my best to do some tests Josh Arnold this video will be available after after I'm done streaming so the the secondary stream on Instagram is over now you can only stream for an hour so just to let let everyone know in case you are wondering so I did have some some viewers in there this time and so that that will be available for 24 hours in case anyone cares what I look like not sure why you would care but maybe Earl Lewis says isn't jQuery dead no it's not dead you might call it a zombie so it's I think it's more undead like it'll always be around it'll note you can never really get rid of it I don't really have that much of a problem with jQuery it's just when you use jQuery with react then you you mess things up with I don't want to get this wrong I always say the wrong thing help me out everyone its virtual dorm right react has a virtual dome I always accidentally call it a shadow Dom and I don't think that's the right term react has a virtual dome which is like a copy of the the Dom and if you change something in the Dom without doing it the react way then reacts it doesn't have an exact copy of the Dom so it messes things up okay um Maxime asks what's the timer it's a Pomodoro timer so for right now I'm using the Pomodoro timer to help me get an idea of like how long I'm doing things through my normal work I time everything I do with this and I it helps me to break up my work and estimate things better but then during the stream this helps me to remember to stop what I'm doing and go to the live chat and then also to stop looking at the live chat and do my work okay and it looks like reacts we have some people talking about react toolbox now what's reacts okay cool it is virtual Dom so I got it right this time all right let me check out react toolbox since I just had a lot of people talk about react toolbox yeah maxime a anyway yeah the timer it's just tomato timer calm so tomato timer calm really simple it works for me there are some some ones out there with different features but I don't need all the other features so that one just works fine for me it's right you know right in the browser what am I looking at material I'm just gonna very quickly look at react toolbox because I don't want to spend too much more time on this I mean it's definitely important thing to spend time on because this is going to determine a lot of you know what we do from here on out but yes your view for materials and components hmm okay I like that it looks nice this looks good but do they have it doesn't look like there's a lot of components though but maybe I'm missing something but I'm not seeing like a select all right okay mobbin says material UI has tests and github so i guess that's better material UI is fine let's see on your i guess what are you making how is react useful i'm making basically a website that needs to users can go on there download PDFs and images and then also they can upload files and send information with an online form actually I've actually been meaning to update this with some other cool things I'm not gonna I'm not gonna commit to anything right now but I do have some ideas to make it a bit more interactive particularly like maybe giving users the ability to check on the status of their submissions and possibly even edit them so not 100% sure if I can do that through the right API that's our project management system but I've I've thought that possibly that would be cool to do Oh Sebastian says look at the drop down in react toolbar oh okay so basically the drop down is like the select I see alright since I can't decide here's gonna be the decider whatever project has more stars on github that's the one I'm gonna go with I don't know if that's the best way but I don't have time to do any more research here on the stream so that's what I'm gonna go with so let's check out the github repos for each one I appreciate everyone giving their input so let's see all right so we got 27,000 stars and this one has only 6,000 all right so I mean I guess I guess it's pretty it's much different here all right so I guess we're going with material you I my reasoning also behind the number of stars is that probably means more people are using this and there's more like there'll be more stuff on Stack Overflow about it if more people are using it so if I need help I can find it so it's not entirely without a foundation there but assuming that the two frameworks are pretty much you know similar and what they offer I'd rather go with the one that's used by more people just to have that kind of that community that I can go to for information so let's do this let's install material UI now to do we want to do the prerelease I don't know maybe I'll just stick with the stable one okay I wish my so let's do this let's go what was it again I think it's just material you uh yep so let's go yarn add material UI my chef seen this react tap event plugin I had issues with this before I think someone who watches the these streams asked me to check out an error they were having and it was related to this react tap event plugin I'm gonna have to go back through maybe like my Twitter messages and see what that was because I don't want this to I don't want this to mess us up as well so I've definitely had this error before and I've figured out some way to fix it I mean it's not an error right now it's just a warning but in the case where I saw it before it was actually messing things up quite a bit so I don't remember who it was though if it's someone watching right now let me know I have otherwise I'll have to look back through so hopefully it won't be an issue it's good good material UI all right so for now everything's going to happen just on the master branch and this isn't even live at all at the point where this goes live then everything will switch over to a development branch if you're doing any like really crazy changes we'll have another branch for that so for now if any of you are interested in submitting any pull requests like you'll want to obviously we only have one branch now so it's I guess it's a nobrainer but just to let you know eventually it'll end up being a dead branch so if anyone's really interested in getting you know some contributions for your github profile I'm definitely open to that right now there's really not much going on but once we get started there'll be some more obvious things ways to contribute so and I don't expect anyone to take time out of their day to contribute to my projects but if you'd like to I do appreciate it all right so let's go to the here's a quick example so I've never used this so I'm gonna have to go through how to use it as well okay here's that react tap event thing okay so we're gonna have to just inject this tap event alright so let me move this over here and we'll look at the code whoops I guess it was I on the break and I've started I can't remember what I was doing alright I guess I'm going to go back to the live chat for five minutes now then since I haven't gone there in a while I don't want to lose all the things at the top of the chat I'm already starting to lose some of it so anyway yeah so for now for the next five minutes I'm gonna be going through live chat stuff get some more new people I see welcome thanks for watching Sushil s are you starting a whole project from scratch yep starting everything from scratch this time ahmad s says first time in here thanks for doing this Jesse you're welcome thanks for watching Shriram says yeah there are lots of new people will be awesome if you can explain from basics if you can okay yeah I'll do I'll do my best to try to explain everything in terms of just the stream in general I think I mentioned this before but I'll mention it again for new people coming in the whole this stream is just me doing my normal work I work at a university I'm a frontend developer so it's not rehearsed beforehand you will see me make a ton of mistakes and together with your input we're gonna build some cool stuff and this is definitely not a tutorial and I'm not claiming that I have the right way to do things either so just realize that I'm learning and learning how to do react and I'm always trying to learn and do new things so it's not going to be like the place to go to get a stepbystep tutorial but it's definitely going to be if you want to know what it's like at least for me daytoday as a frontend developer then this is a good place to go we've built up a nice community here in the chat so people are very helpful if you have questions feel free to ask them I'll try to get to as many questions as I can you can put questions in the comments too and you can direct message me on Twitter if you like as well I try to get to everybody's questions as soon as I can I think that's it hey that's my normal with the normal stuff that I say so if you're new you should be all caught up then and you know what the stream is all about sort of ask any plan for small react project from scratch yeah it would be cool to do some videos and just do a really really basic project from scratch this is going to end up this is going to be a small project so it's kind of gonna be like that it'd be cool to do a video where I do the entire project start to finish including everything maybe one day I'll do that this is not gonna be it there's nothing any stuff that I do that's I don't stream just because I need to work on this you know while I'm at work and I'm not gonna stream the entire day the RAF says I'm new to programming so I wondered what if you have that's the most important honestly I think if you're starting out the most important thing is just keep keep going don't get discouraged always keep learning so yeah that would be the most important thing like just always keep learning and trying new things if you ever get to the point where you feel satisfied like you don't need to learn any new things then that's a bad thing I think that's that's a sign that you stagnated so anyway and if you're new like feel free to ask any questions anything I'll try to help you out however I can we have some people clubs in from Los Angeles Kevin from Trinidad awesome welcome sport Fitness is oh is Ohio not in the United States maybe I don't maybe I don't remember saying it wasn't he wasn't in there but possibly the way I said it made it seem like that so sorry about that definitely unintended I don't even remember how I said it but let's see Arvin says new from India awesome welcome must be pretty late in India what is it in India like 1 o'clock in the morning a little after 1 o'clock in the morning so everyone from from India and from those time zones over there thanks for staying up so late to watch Scotty says retiring vet looking to get into coding will welcome and definitely I'm if you have any questions or anything I'm more than happy to help you there's actually an organization just for veterans that looking to get into coding so if you're interested in that send me a message on twitter the my twitter info is in the description and i can hook you up i met the guy that's in charge of that organization at a conference so if you're interested i can i you know get you hooked up with that organization as well so and yeah i definitely I'd be happy to to help a veteran in any way that I can brownie says new from Israel awesome welcome CRM says can we text you in Facebook for some small tips yeah yeah feel free so you guys feel free to follow me on any social media things if you check if you check my youtube channel I have most of my social media stuff linked from there so if whatever you're comfortable in follow me in that social media channel and then I can you can ask me questions there so I'm on pretty much everything yeah I'm on pretty much everything unless there's some like really new social media stuff that I don't know about yet but otherwise most people ask me questions on Twitter and that's cool but if you're not really into Twitter and you want something else then that's fine as well I'm also frequently on Instagram Facebook so I do have a snapchat but I don't think that's really the place to get coding advice from so not really on the that often alright so let me go back to this and this will probably be the last see what time it is so I'll do one more Pomodoro session of doing some of the work on this site and then then I'll try to get through as many questions in the live chat as I can let me see let me take I'm going to do a few more questions there at the top of the live chat because I'm afraid that they'll they'll get pushed off if I if I don't look at them now so also if if I don't answer your question in the live chat I'm sorry please put it in the comments for this video or message me on some other social media platform and I'll get to your question because I really do and answer all your questions I just don't always have time in in during the stream me ass how did you work through that site Ming knew okay that must have been must be in regard to the that first site that I showed you all this this site yeah it did it took me a long time to work through that when I was new it was crazy I actually didn't even have a computer for the first couple of days that I worked which was insane because like I'm a web developer how what am I going to do without a computer so once I did get a computer then I just I started to look through it all and I just kept looking at the code I just inspected it in dev tools and kept looking and just messing around and seeing how far I could push it and after a lot of trial and error of doing it like that then I finally got to I got it to what it is now so it did it took a long time and you know the it was it was frustrating it was a bit of a mess but I really really wanted to prove myself and so I I did it it worked and my my boss gave me a ton of time to do it so it was really cool about since I was new just really gave me a lot of freedom and time to figure things up but anyway yeah it was it wasn't exactly fun in terms of the workflow but it was kind of cool just to see how far I could take a platform that was obviously outdated alright so I think I got far enough down on the chat that I won't lose too much and now I can I can do some of this so let's see I guess we can just start into a homepage now and let me bring over where'd I put it got a lot of windows open sorry need to find where I put the example oh I see that it logged me out automatically so that's another wonderful thing about this site is that you frequently get logged out you can't use the back button if you try to use the back button it gives you an error sometimes you can use it but a lot of times like it just gives you an error message so anyway alright so this is what we're going off of like I said I don't have to go with this so just for the basic layout that I think I am gonna keep no matter what is you know I definitely want this side panel I may even go with and always open side panel at least for desktop and the top bar I don't think I'm gonna do this that says you know says the name I probably could do it since everyone yeah I'm not I'm not gonna try to do this so it's not gonna say people's name so that was kind of a fun little feature but definitely not you not at all necessary alright so first things first let's just get this base layout of the header nav and then we'll throw in a footer I don't have one here but we may as well throw in a footer and that'll be a nice start alright so let's go to the code here and that's also on my my other screen let me bring it over on this screen so you all can see what I'm seeing I'm gonna close in the side here and my my code editor I just kind of closed off the the file the pain that has all the files in there just to gain us some space alright so I'm gonna kind of scroll through this just to see if there's anything that I really need to worry about so this usage section seems kind of important so let's just check this out before we do anything okay so seem to be provided okay so it looks like I need a theme and for the theme provider it's an app just so hmm all right I'm not if someone has used material UI before let me know about this but this is what I think it's saying it seems like it's basically saying I need to have any time I use one of the components from there I need to import this this Mui theme provider so can I get away with just importing this in my app j/s or do it will I actually need to import this in every like can I just wrap app in this or what I mean potentially like could I go out to the index jas and wrap app inside of this so I'm gonna I actually want to go back to the page that has the examples because that'll be better to get the visual so let's see if it if it explains it more Wow I guess it does all right so that's a while they're getting started page is really like getting started like what is a single page application right is this the one that says a virgin one is coming why don't we just use this version about that as anyone tried the next the new version I mean if if they're about to come out with version 1 why are we building it with the earlier version that's just a rhetorical question for me it's not it's not your father this is my fault well I should have thought about this yeah let's do that let's let's use this version so material UI next let's do that where's my yeah okay so we're gonna do yarn remove I think removers is what you say a material all right that's important actually I'm kind of glad I did this because if you're using yarn you want to do yarn remove it's not a good idea to go in here into your package.json and actually like delete something from this it's better to use yarn the reason being when you do yarn remove it'll update your yarn lock file you don't want to mess with that manually so always remember to do this through either you are an add or remove and it'll just be it'll work out better like that all right so now we want to do yarn add and we're gonna use material you I and next all right so that's cool III really I like the idea of using the latest stuff anyway I think that's better okay all right so now that we're through with that let's hear I con all right let's install the icons as well so yarn add material UI is a oops material you icons okay all right so now this actually this looks like exactly the same thing that was on the github documentation so not really telling me much all right I'm gonna I did look at the chat again I could see you over like hey you gotta read haha alright so let me let me read at least the bottom of this chat again because okay so bill says the Mui theme provider is only a tap j/s awesome ok so just that really cool Aaron s are you familiar with Redux not yet but I am learning it I will be learning it soon and bill so later on I'd wrap it even around the react router ok that's good to know thank you oh man rich buses there are some missing components in material I've e1 ok I think I'm gonna deal with that I think I'm ok with the missing components and work around that if we need to build out some components on our own I'm I'm kind of I'm cool with that this is not read yeah i wasn't reading the chat ok cool sebastian linked up he put in a link in the chat about which components are actually supported so thank you for that i'll check that out that's the best in says this will suck for him haha ok Aaron says he's lying you can remove dependencies from package.json you just need to run yarn again after you do it ok good to know yeah I am that's cool you can run yarn again so if what I was saying about yarn and not editing package.json is not exactly true so it you just have to run yarn again so if you used to I guess it would be the same way if you're using regular NPM like you can remove it from package.json but it's not actually gonna be removed until you run it again so yeah forget what I just said thanks thanks for calling me out on that errand so as long just remember if you don't use yarn remove and you edit the package.json directly run yarn again all of us is not a good idea to use an alpha version of a framework yeah actually Sebastian the link you sent for some reason is coming up with a blank page for me so off to check that out later this is the one all right it doesn't say all right at this point I just want to build something so if I have to switch back to the other one it should be fine because it seems like the the the mark up at least is somewhat similar I mean at least this part is similar so the first part that I need to do will be similar so let's just do that let's look at let make this a bit bigger as you all can see how it would rest I tried to commit this and I didn't add the files first all right cool get committed there we go all right so where's our app there it is let me see I actually don't want this on my I want to put this at the level of the index I'm gonna copy this and put this in here and we're gonna wrap this all right cool so no errors great and then just double check and make sure I didn't miss something great okay good let's layouts yeah I don't really want I just want components there than that of okay that's what I need terminology is a little bit different than than a materialized framework so I've to get used to that but let's check out what we need to do here we need to import quite a bit we're saying it but more astonishing okay I say terrible idea to use alpha version unless your contributor alright so I'm getting a lot of a lot of advice about not using the Alpha in production all right all right you all have convinced me I'll switch it back I'm not going to switch it back right now because you've already seen me switch it back and forth a couple of times so I will switch it back later on today so you guys you will you all that are giving me advice I totally understand what you're saying and you have convinced me but it did it felt a little bit like I don't know like when you're a kid and you're about to do something that's probably pretty dangerous and like maybe your friends or your parents or somebody you're saying like no no you don't want to do that don't do it so I like I guess I was being silly and wanted to live dangerously alright so I guess I should just doublecheck really quickly to make sure that the let's make sure that everything is the same in terms of markup since if I'm going to switch it No all right and then you notice MF okay four minutes before I'm going to stop so let's try to do something that's for when let's import this at bar and let's get rid of some of this stuff and then what we call this pepper probably I'm guessing that some of this isn't going to work since these icons I think are different for the newer version but might be able to at least see something nope Oh see I thought it said that the icons were different I should doublecheck before I remove these icons because it doesn't say anything about the icons so maybe I don't need to worry about it so maybe I can remove it safely oops is it not I thought it was that's what it was called so double check that whoa it's here you okay I guess it's not I didn't have to put that in when I was removing it okay so John says and that says living on the edge Jessie's mantra yeah I'm in a unique position I feel like to where I have like nearly complete freedom to pick what tools I want to use to build sites with and I don't think I'll always have that so I kind of like to take advantage of it to try a lot of new things so that way it's good like a learning opportunity I don't want to build things the same way every single time all right now we're going to add this back in okay wonderful let's see if this work still not working what am I missing Adler okay so we have this header alright it's giving me a header that has a height of zero what did I do wrong okay Aaron says try restarting the server that's a good idea let's give it a restart see what happens it's gonna be kind of rough all right awesome thank you so much Aaron that was great advice it's gonna be a little bit rough starting out because this is a new framework for me I mean I'm I'm really familiar with material design but in terms of this particular framework I have no experience with so I apologize for the slow start here but I'm sure once I get the hang of it it'll be nice it'll be a lot nicer than trying to make all the jQuery stuff work with with react so awesome so that's cool that works and that's probably yep my time is up so anyway if you are just here to watch me do my thing on the screen and set things up then you can you safely leave now because I'm done with that part of it now I'm gonna go through the live chat and try to answer as many questions as I can before I end I would like to end this around 4 and that'll be a 2 hour 2 hour livestream which i think is plenty plenty long in terms of extremes so anyway so if you did watch and you need to go now you're not worried about the you know the question answer session thank you so much for watching and thanks for all your help and as I said earlier feel free to ask me any questions on any social media stuff or in the YouTube comments and I'll be happy to you know get back to you as soon as I can I definitely don't consider myself an expert but if you still want my advice in spite of that I'm happy to give it now for everyone that can stick around I'm going to answer some questions I'm going way up to the the top of the live chat so I a lot of the chat is now not available to me anymore but basically everything from around 230 p.m. Eastern Time on is still available for me right now so I'm gonna just start there and go down if I didn't get to your question cuz let's say I got pushed off the page I'm really sorry please ask me again in some other forum either in another live chat or in any any social media stuff I've actually I've even had people find my email address and email me so that's cool too if you want to do that I no one has yet found my phone number and called me so I'm waiting I'm sure it'll happen one day okay so nag nag Indra asks I am new what kind of project will you do today how long does it take XANA gave a nice explanation saying I'm refactoring a very old static site and it's probably going to take about three weeks so yeah I'm gonna stream probably around two hours every weekday for the next three weeks or so and I I expect that's what it'll take if I decide to add some extra features then you know might take longer than that but I'm thinking just keeping it with the base features that it has right now I'm guessing about three weeks and that's including like I realize there's probably gonna be times when I can't work on this um enough to spend time and meetings and things like that I know I have some I have to do some interviews we're interviewing for a web developer job here I have some interview scheduled coming up and so there's going to be a lot of other stuff I have to do so if I were dedicating all the time to this I probably could do it in less than three weeks and then there's also the additional you know added extra time in that I'm using create react app instead of next which I'm not as familiar with and now I'm using material UI instead of materialized so I'm gonna have to learn some things as I go also going to attempt to use tests and Lucas says what's up what's up Lucas thanks for joining us Emilio asks does anybody know what this site is going to do like general like crud it's it's not really gonna like do a ton in terms of like interactivity right now the it's just gonna have a basic contact form and I'm not a contact form a project submission form that is gonna have a file upload but I'm not creating a database for that information at least I don't plan on it now it might be cool to do but we'll see how it goes but basically that info is going to go to using an API a REST API it's going to go to our project management system which is rike so that's the plan if I have time it would kind of be cool to hook up some sort of database to this just to have like another place to back things up right now we have the problem that occasionally the files won't go to R I can upload files through the API to write but occasionally it won't work and so it'll come through in the email or the file name but the actual file will never make its way into write so it might not be a bad idea to have another place where I store those so we will be going over how to do file uploads and node which that'll be cool Umberto's says I understood it to be like a service desk that's ticketing system yeah actually it's exactly like that umberto that's a good way to explain it abhishek says i just started studying react from fullstack react book is completing the book with examples enough for getting my first job effects as says no dustin says try and see how it goes so I would say it really depends like getting your first job is going to depend on a lot of different things so it's hard to say whether or not completing you know one book or one course is going to be enough basically to get a job all you have to do is convince someone to hire you so that it helps if you have experience in a good portfolio but really you don't you don't necessarily need that so the more you can do to build up your portfolio then the better chance you'll have it getting a job so if if you're learning a lot with this book and you're doing a lot of things then yeah maybe you could get a job with that I'm not really familiar with the book so I can't say I can't speak like to the content of that book specifically but I do get similar questions occasionally and you know my answer is just you know you you can try to get a job at any point you might get it because you know it really all you have to do is convince somebody that you can do the job so for some people you know they take they study for a really long time before they get a job other people a few months and they get a job and then they have to learn a lot on the job but I wouldn't say like don't feel like you have to complete so many things before you can start looking for a job look for a job while you're learning and if you get it wonderful if not keep learning and keep trying in this industry it's not like you need a certain type of certification which i think is really cool so but I would say as you're going through those examples build up your portfolio actually build do side projects do some freelance stuff do wood you can because that's really important to be able to prove that you can do the work the bill says I went back and listened to the first twenty five minutes of the stream I missed that four times speed caught caught up and the speed differs charring at first I must talk slow enough that that's possible to understand me at four times speed I never thought about doing that that's pretty cool max you may ask about the black github so let me show you my github so the background is black so yeah I kind of don't want to go into again how I got this to work because I've done it a few times before in previous videos but basically there's a github dark theme so if you do a search for github dark you should be able to find all the instructions to do it maybe one day I'll do a video like showing how to do it since a lot of people ask me about it but for now like check out github dark it looks like there's there's been some a bit of discussion about women programmers and men programmers and stuff so I don't know that if I want to read out this whole discussion in the live chat yeah I think I'll probably just get a skip it I don't want to like trigger anybody if you know you came here looking for reactant instead you get a debate on you know gender and coding and stuff so so I'm gonna say I'm just letting you know everybody involved in that discussion I'm not gonna read out the comments not that it's not a good thing to talk about I just don't want to I don't want this stream to get into like debatable topics I just would like it to be a calm place I'd be check ass okay so if I complete the free code camp react challenges then so then can you get a job so I mean I think my answer from before or still suffice is to this to just you know you can get a job when you get to the point where you can convince people you can do the work and it convinced them to hire you so yes free code camp will help you get to that point but it's not a guarantee so just you know you got to do whatever you can to increase your skills you know and try to network to there's other things besides just the programming that can help you get a job being able to network you know having a presence online by your social media and your projects your portfolio that all those things are important okay bill says great about a create react app is built in the Jeff slash enzyme support okay so for testing I should probably start looking into jest then is that I think that's which would bill say in here since create react app already has has that so that's good to know I wasn't exactly sure what testing framework I should start with all right okay Santa said John now that would be oh it's John said to make make your own in terms of CSS frameworks make your own less bulk that would be really cool I do really want to do that one day to make my own framework that basically would fit everything that we use at the University for our brand standards and our style guide and make a framework that other like if we hire people to build websites that they can just use that or if other departments end up having developers that they can use that so that that is actually the end goal for me at some point if I can just build off of work other people have done though that would be cool as well I know it would be more lightweight if I did it myself but I mean there's there's a lot of things that I could just build on that other people have done that I don't necessarily need to redo myself and then Jana kind of rightly says that would be ideal but he only gave it three weeks so yeah that's that's kind of the thing I'm not worried about actually building the UI but in terms of then taking what I've built custom from scratch and then testing it in all different browsers and devices and screen sizes like that's the part that I think is the most difficult when you're trying to build like a CSS framework or something from scratch is that these frameworks that are already there so many people are using them that a lot of those issues have already come up you know from their use and so they've you know they've dealt with issues that I wouldn't even you know know about when I so it's just you know yes it is a little bit more you know possibly a little bloated but you get the benefit of having all the basically all these testers you know for free that did you have all their experience and all the issues that they've worked through so I'll probably end up doing some sort of custom framework but it'll definitely be built off of someone else's potentially I might just end up trying to contribute to one of the material design react frameworks out there and that might be better than trying to do my own just in general for the for the entire community it might be better to not make a new one and instead just try to make an existing one even better all right let me look through here let's say I'm going back through there there were a lot of different suggestions for for frame where CSS frameworks and stuff so I really appreciate all the all the suggestions all right so Ryan asks do you use the Pomodoro Technique when you are working or just during livestreams to answer questions so I think I actually mentioned this earlier so maybe you'd asked that question before I said it but yeah I do use the Pomodoro Technique when I'm working and I find it helpful I should actually add that to the list of stuff that I'm going to do videos on because I've gotten some questions on that too I think that would be useful just to go over the Pao is that two tuna on a switch back end are you using I mean this is this is going to be node everything's going to be in node and in terms of like their terms of databases there's going to be no database prop probably no database we'll see we'll see how it goes but yeah this is going to be reacting no jazz okay about about an hour ago cat has I guess how long this is going to be because it was already 9 p.m. in Europe so I guess it's a little late for that question but usually the streams are around 2 hours long like kayo asks will you make the source code available yes it actually is available now on github it's public it'll be there so you can check it out whenever you want okay so I got some comments about the inject tap event plugin and how to initialize that so cool it says the drawer component doesn't work without it so that explains why the drawer component wasn't working I suppose so thank you for that Nathaniel says I do not know how to use react however I'll be learning soon maybe after I'll do some pull requests that sounds awesome yeah definitely let me know if you need any help at everything with with learning react and then that'd be really cool vk3 ask someone from Macedonia smiley with a smiley face anybody from Macedonia around Vitor says it's love from Portugal awesome thanks for thanks for watching Jack Bennett asks what's a good language to learn I would say JavaScript but I'm biased because that's what I mostly use it entirely depends on what you want to do so if you want to do web development then learn JavaScript that's your best you'll you're for sure going to use JavaScript at some point if you're a web developer you may end up using other languages as well but you wouldn't have to you can build pretty much whatever you want on the web with just JavaScript Nathaniel asked any resources you'd recommend for learning react the react documentation like the official documentation is great if you want to spend money you'd acity has a react course right now that I'm doing and I'm pretty impressed with it so far free code campus good free resources code Academy has a free course so I would check those ones out and then there's a lot of YouTube videos about it as well Maximus is from France awesome I love hearing where everybody's from it it does it never gets old to hear everybody's from it's always really cool every time to hear people from all over the world that are joining in michael says hey just starting up a react project for myself project myself creating a ride share app for a university that also records co2 statistics per ride and an aggregate that sounds really really cool so Michael if you're still watching I know that comment was from a while ago if you're still watching I'd love to see that so if you could put either in the live chat or send me a message on Twitter or something like if you have a link to the github github repo for that that would be really cool I'd love to see that Shahriyar from Bangladesh awesome Raunak says it's 100 a.m. here heiped awesome on a new rug says I'm from India awesome things going on cool he's just saying that Gregg says what I would love to see you do Trello board when you're all set up yeah I'm gonna make the Trello board public and then I'll put a link in the video description so I'll have the link in all the descriptions for the videos when I'm working on this so my one of my coworkers is logged into the Franciscan University YouTube channel and he occasionally types in silly things into the chat so this time he's typing once I did get a computer huh Raunak says how do you plan what to do first setting up routing directory structure or go featurewise in a project I have to think about it a little bit to think about how I've done it before because I'm often I usually don't get a chance to have like a nice planning period occasionally like I'm just pulled into projects sometimes that are it's not exactly from scratch so I don't like it kind of does it depends on what the project is sorry I can't my brains just like no not working right now I just can't think of how I normally do that and so I'll have to think more about that and get back to you I would say like in big picture I definitely think about features but then when I actually get down to it I go more by like structure so like you know pages at a time like get the main page layout and then each page so I guess that would be that's kind of how I go about it ah rich rich bob says use angular material I assume your big fun so you're joking they're not sure that would work this pressing amazing says please can you continue this live or maybe record it even if you have to voiceover later I'll probably do some live streaming like in the mornings where I don't really give commentary and I just work when I do those I actually I do them on my own channel so that I don't take up the free code camp channel all day so if you're interested in that if you follow my or subscribe to my channel on YouTube then you'll get a notification when I do that I also usually post on Twitter when I do it too so either way if you see my Twitter notification or whatever you know they know you might be able to see more more of the project alright man there's so much in the live chat I'm really I kind of think there's no way I'm going to get through every question so I'm really sorry about that let's see hey evil that's gone I just saw Eva said hey Jessie what you're doing so and John John B says what are you building so yeah I'm building it react a pretty simple react site you bucha says there's nothing wrong with using a framework that's on the bleeding edge alright thanks you do that I mean yeah it's probably a good idea not to use it in a project that I really need to do for work maybe in a side project I'll try like the really bleeding edge stuff Aaron says programming always starts off slow yeah that's true Luka says if anything you'll be encouraged to contribute to the project yeah that's that's actually good idea so he's saying if you use something that's bleeding edge you know like alpha version or something of a framework then you'll have a lot of encouragement to contribute because you I mean you're likely gonna see a lot of bugs and things so I never thought about that but that is a good point nobody says slow is cool for us beginners even because of you I will start learning react oh that's cool that's really cool ya know d let me let me know how it's going with learning react and if I can help with anything I'm happy to help Aaron says keep on rockin Jesse cool thanks Enoch score says I'm too late again oh sorry sorry you're late you can check the recording I'll probably do tomorrow I'm actually going to do a different time so maybe it might be better for some people I think I'm gonna have to do stream in the morning because I have a meeting at 200 p.m. Eastern tomorrow uhhuh Bobby Marvin did you really try to post my my phone number in the live chat you didn't push the last two that's actually my I think that is my work number I'll have to look it up because I don't remember my work I actually don't know my work phone number yeah Marvin I think that is my work number so I kept thinking people would get my cell phone number cuz that's out there as well but yeah you found it I didn't even think about that that obviously my work number is probably online but my cell number is online as well because when I was freelancing I use that as my business number so anyway if anybody really really wants to call me I just I never answer I let everything go to voicemail so if you leave a message I'll get it I just get so many like calls from like spam calls that I just never answered my phone anymore baby says hello new here just wanted to say thanks for doing this when is the next time you'll be doing this welcome and you're welcome thanks for for watching the next time will be tomorrow probably tomorrow morning augusten says thanks for coding late it was good when is the next session so yeah the same thing probably tomorrow morning John B says how long have you been using react just this year so I probably started building and react in the spring of this year somewhere around there so not not actually that long I think some point last year I tried to do like a hello world app and react but so I don't really count that because that wasn't really seriously trying to learn Aaron says is there a way I could do a stream on free code camp I've been programming for 18 years and love to teach yeah I think that's possible it's not really my call you would need to ask Quincy or or get ahold of Bo so check probably on Twitter it might be the best way to get ahold of Quincy so or you can just tweet at free code camp so he manages both the accounts so check out the free code camp Twitter and maybe send a message and say like hey you know I was checking out Jesse stream I'd like to do something like that and he might be open to it so I can't really guarantee anything but that would be really cool John says is it possible to make the final production JavaScript and CSS assets safe separately for each page in a website even though there are many shared components templating etc yeah I suppose suppose so maybe I'm sure maybe if there's some other people in the watching right now that have more experience with that you could explain it in a better way Martin says is finishing my free code camp friend certificate enough to get first job I'm almost done I have CS degree already but that hasn't been enough honestly Martin if you have a CS degree and you're gonna do the free code camp certificate I mean you're in a good place right there because you know you're gonna have the best of both worlds in terms of you know you have the kind of online and doityourself learning and you have the degree so you're gonna have an advantage in count of those oldschool companies that still really value a degree so I would say yeah go for it and it sometimes it can take a long time to get a job I know when I was looking for work after I finished college it took me a long time and the jobs that I eventually got were not really great jobs and then whenever I quit my I whenever I quit teaching I used to be a teacher I was looking for work it took me a while to find work too and I eventually basically just did freelance work actually hold on my wife is calling so she's about to be on the stream hello hey I was gonna leave maybe around 530 is that is that cool okay okay okay okay sorry about that but I want this to be realistic about how my normal day is and sometimes I get phone calls okay so DJ says it could be enough to just get the certificate from free code camp to get a job from personal experience I was able to get one without a CS degree after doing the frontend certificate so that's really cool so so DJ saying they were able to get a job with without a CS degree with just the frontend free code camp certificate so that's really awesome congratulations on that that's that's great and it looks like you are given some great advice to Martin there in the live chat so thanks for that and yeah Martin as well some people are talking about like LinkedIn and different social media Martin if you want to follow me on some social media stuff and your that might help like expand your network a bit like on LinkedIn and if you want to like put out a tweet or something saying that you're looking for work I'll be happy to retweet you I don't have a ton of followers on Twitter but most of the people that fall in the are in you know in tech so it would be good you know good get those tweets up to get to get it out to people who might actually be able to hire you or pass it along to somebody okay cool bill and Aaron are both saying yes use Jess for the testing framework cool all right Aaron says I made my own CSS framework for hired comm that's really cool Aaron if you're still with us in the chat how how long did it take you to make the CSS framework and was it was it a difficult process I'm really interested in in that you know because as I said earlier I'd like to at some point jonbi says should I apply if an employer wants five plus years experience when I only have two years of experience I would do it I've applied for jobs where I didn't have the experience that they wanted because you never know usually when people put out job descriptions that's like bestcase scenario of what they want but they're willing to take less than that so and if they don't get anybody that meets those requirements sometimes they're more willing to take less than that so it's worth a shot as long as the application process isn't like really difficult then it might be a waste of your time but if it's a pretty simple application process and it only take you in a few minutes or so then I say go for it Martin says I'm already over a year past graduating I should already have a job yeah I mean it can be really tough I would say like I mean finding a job I don't know if I'd say like you know you should or shouldn't already have a job like it just all depends like your location in the job market there there's a lot of factors that go into how easy or difficult it is to get a job so don't get too down on yourself just keep at it keep trying you may have to take a job just that you don't really want just to pay the bills there's no there's nothing wrong with that or like maybe you might want to take a job that is paying you a lot less than you probably you know would want but it'll get you good experience to get the job that you want so I mean there's a lot of you know there's a lot of different factors that go into that but I'd say just keep working keep doing side projects if you can or freelance work do anything you can to build up your portfolio and keep applying you know keep applying to a lot a lot of places and even if you're not exactly qualified you know that's that's the only way I mean at some point it's probably going to work out there's a lot of jobs out there so you just got to keep at it Wesley says try to take advice serious and dare to take risks in life and you will succeed and almost everything you put effort into and thanks for that Wesley yeah I mean definitely uh you know when you're given advice by people especially people that have you know kind of been in they've been there and they've gone through that like yeah I try to learn how you can and yeah taking risk I mean sometimes it does say that it takes going out on a limb like I put my job and ended up on freelance and it was really like I wasn't sure how things were gonna go you know was I gonna be able to pay the bills and stuff and it led me to where I am now you know after it took a couple years you know a couple of years of you know wasn't always easy it was difficult but you know I kept at it and now I'm I'm you know I have a job where I'm happy I'm doing what I really like I make enough to pay the bills so yeah keep at it thanks for that Wesley Martin Martin says actually work Martin said something that's a bit negative towards Wesley's comment I'm not gonna read it out but Martin I will say I mean if you're gonna come on here and ask for advice and people are gonna give you advice like you really probably shouldn't be negative at them you know like they don't owe you any advice they're just kind of trying to do it out of the kindness of their own heart so if you don't think the advice is good just don't take it but I don't think it's really it's really right to be so critical of someone who's just trying to help you out and doesn't really owe you anything also I try to we try to keep the live chat a place where like we're very like non critical of of things like I'm all up for a debate about you know various frameworks and tools and stuff but I don't want any like any like namecalling or like derogatory things being said so you know let's try to keep this a positive place where people can feel free to you know express themselves here give advice ask for advice and things so you know just you know every for everyone you know just keep that in mind yeah I'm gonna read this one out here Martin says here I am getting berated by people who actually got jobs doing the same exact things I've tried when I was unlucky and didn't I mean I would say like I mean I I just read all the comments there Martin so I'm not sure what you mean by being berated everybody's just giving you advice so I know it must be frustrating not to get a job but you know the idea I mean the idea that you're just unlucky and didn't get jobs implies that they got jobs because they were lucky I don't think luck has anything to do with it getting a job is based on you know your skills your effort who you know you know your connections so I mean the people in here you know most likely worked really hard it's not easy so I mean I wouldn't you know don't don't belittle that and don't try to boil it down to like luck or something like you're just gonna get that's not gonna be a helpful outlook you know because then you're like just turn that into something more creative I know it's easier said than done but if you see people around you getting jobs you know you could take it you know two ways or more but you know one way you could take it is you know kind of getting down on yourself saying like what's wrong with me that I can't get a job another way you could take it is like motivation like hey like it's happening for them it's gonna happen for me like I'm gonna work hard I'm gonna ask them for advice see what they did so anyway I'm gonna skip through I'm gonna skip through some of that because the the the debate is kind of getting a little heated there yeah it looks like Martin's kind of still going on with this lucky stuff I will say this like Martin there's no such thing as luck man I mean I'm like therethere is that like Chet it's it's it's not like it's not like these people have some good luck charm to get jobs it's you know there there are steps you take right to do to get job and you keep working at it will some people fail it's possible yes some people will probably fail and not get jobs there are people without jobs it happens but I don't really think it's right to say that all these people in here that have jobs just got lucky I mean that's that's not it's not the case you know you have to do all the work and put in all the effort and even then sometimes it's not enough but that doesn't mean that these people are just lucky and didn't put in the work and it doesn't mean that they didn't you know in a sense earn what they have so I know you're really frustrated on that but yeah just not I'm not like in all the the negativity because once again you know everybody on here is really trying to help and you you ask for the help and they're just only what you asked them to do um let's see Nathaniel said I'd appreciate if you send me some links to react resources on free code camp forums I will moderate on the forums so you should be able to find my profile easily from the team list I'll see I actually want to do a video on that as and so maybe I'll I might do a video on that if I get a chance soon so um I don't know if I'll get a chance to just put them on there if you the best thing to do would would be either put it as a comment on this video or send it to me and unlike Twitter basically that same request so I don't forget about it and then I'll try to do it one asked about the project being in github it is it's in github now but there's not really much to it she vomits how is angular vs. react in terms of performance Co I'm not really sure I can answer that because I'm not nearly as familiar with angular as I am with react all I can say is that I've been very happy with react so far what I'm using it but that's not really enough to answer that question properly so I apologize but I I'm not going to try to you know talk through an answer when I I'm really just not confident in my knowledge of angular to give a good answer Victor us can javascript be used for making simple offline applications I often have the idea an idea for a tiny thing I want to make and from Denmark yeah you can you can build offline applications with JavaScript so if you're like with react you can build web apps but you can also build apps that will work on a desktop you can build apps that will run on on mobile phones so JavaScript is very versatile in terms of what it can do Evos says in regard to the performance issue between react and angular says I think a lot of the performance talks can be skipped the performance only really matters when you need fast rendering application I'm talking over 60 frames per second okay so that's that's cool perspective there yeah and that's probably true I mean really it depends on what you're doing but for most sites and web apps the difference between one framework another in terms of performance probably won't even be noticeable to the average user it like I said depending on what you're doing it may not be noticeable all right I'm kind of trying to skip through okay I miss Santa saying goodbye I always miss her saying goodbyes let's see I'm going to try to skip through a lot of this stuff and just get to some questions Martinez who says it's really be motivating to watch the stream like this where everybody already has a job as jobs or internships why would you be watching this if you are you're a pro right programming job actually there are a lot of people that don't have jobs yet they watch this and I've already had at least two people that started watching when they didn't have a job and then have gotten jobs since then so it's definitely a mix a lot of the people that are actually contributing to the chat do have jobs and that's so that's why probably seems like most people have the jobs but it just so happens the people of jobs usually have the most experience so they're able to contribute the most in the live chat but definitely I definitely do have a mix of people and we have people of a variety of Ages all over the world and are all skill levels I frequently have people come on here and say like hey I just literally I've had people say I just started learning to programming yesterday so definitely different you know all different people for instance Victor just writes thank you guys just getting started with coding and I've heard a lot of good about JavaScript will probably keep going down that route awesome that sounds good Victor and uh you know if you need any help with that or anything you run in any trouble with like just let me know be happy to help if I can oh man she oh I'm said it's a 145 a.m. in India and that was that was a little while ago so getting pretty late so everybody from India over there that's for watching really late thanks for staying up and watching Martin says I have almost nothing on my github but I'm finishing the free code camp certificate right now which is something yeah actually I definitely Martin I definitely recommend trying to fill out your github profile as much as you can because like I know sometimes like when we're hiring people here and I have to look through resumes if someone has a github profile I'm way more interested automatically and then I check their profile and if they have they're actually using and they have stuff on there that's a big plus to me I'm always nervous when somebody applies and they don't give me their github profile I usually try to look it up anyway and if I can't find it I wonder like what but what are they doing you know where's all their code at it doesn't automatically mean that they don't know what they're doing but it's just like I I can't see what they're doing so that's that's a big thing and I've actually heard other people who hire a lot say like if you have a get up profile you're automatically on the top of the pile if you have an active you know github profile and stuff on there so definitely you try to get as much on there as you can and you know side projects if you're doing freelance work you know I would try to put it like in your contracts that that your all your code is yours and you're allowed to put it on github and things like that so that you can get that stuff on there Martin saying all my projects look bad yeah Martin I would say it's better to have something on there than not if a person is hiring they're gonna look at like when I look at somebody's get a profile like if I'm thinking about you know doing an interview or hiring them I don't usually get stuck on like the final product like I want to see the process so even if the end product doesn't look that good if I can go back and see the the process of you know them actually kind of improving things and if I could see like their later projects are actually getting better then that at least shows me that they're teaching themselves and picking up new things and that's really important to me I would rather hire somebody who shows the ability to teach themselves new things you know quickly and improve upon their work then somebody who's like already knows everything right because it even if you know everything now a year from now you know there's gonna be new stuff and it's not going to be you know you're not gonna be at the top of the game anymore but somebody who has that ability to rapidly teach themselves new things and improve they're always going to be on top of things so so I would say I mean you know even if you're not entirely satisfied with the projects it still gives people an idea of your your thought process you know to read your commit messages you know and see what's what's going on now you know and how you work that's that's important Blake says what is Jesse's channel on the link to my channel my youtube channel is in the description to this video is it Jesse it might be Jesse why go Jesse Weigel 29 maybe I don't remember what the the thing is but it's in the description Nathaniel says I'm applying to colleges to get a CS degree in the next four to six years wish me luck yeah good luck Oh Blake asks what is localhost 3000 server yeah so I guess you're talking about like this up here the localhost when I run the server locally to work on my site that's what it is it's just a local server port 3000 Martin's asking about github and like how to do things free code camp actually has a video series on github and then Udacity has a free course on git and github I definitely recommend those those will be a great introduction to using git and contributing on github because that's that's really important a lot of places want people who know how to use git and so that'd be really kind of a plus to be able to put on your resume okay it looks like Martin left so probably Martin didn't hear some of those later suggestions that I gave which that's kind of stinks but maybe he'll watch the the recording alright let me scroll down I gather this videos already going on way longer than I expected so I'm gonna kind of skip a lot of the comments and just try to go to the questions now Dominic asks what's the value of using react versus just HTML CSS and JavaScript I don't know I don't know let me see if somebody else answered okay it looks like bill answered I remembered this time to check component base reloading is a major value not having to refresh the entire Dom when data updates yes yes Dominic gasps is there any value and learning react over the dotnet framework it just depends on I guess what you want to work on I I don't really enjoy working with the dotnet framework when I have had to work on it now usually I've had to work on like really old things that use dotnet so maybe that's why I didn't enjoy it as much so it just depends on what you want to do you know if you want to stick with all JavaScript stuff then learn react if you want to be you know learn other stuff then you learn net you know if you if you really want to work at a place that uses dotnet and then learned on that Scottie says our tutorial projects good for github if you don't have anything then yeah for sure just it's better it's better to have something than nothing I think a tutorial project at the very least shows that you are learning on your own and and that's that's important that's better than not having anything or just not having a lot let's see John B asks Jessie do you think it's important to study up on data structures for interviews I don't really know I guess it kind of depends on where you're interviewing at what the position is and you know try to figure out as much as you can about the interviews I think if you go on glassdoor.com people will post interview questions that they've gotten there so if you can research and see like you'll probably get a good idea about what questions people have been asked and what's most important to study up on Scottie says should the new guys fear the whiteboard questions I don't know don't be afraid to whiteboard question I mean if you if you do your or your you know do your work these studying get ready then you know don't be afraid of any of that you know the worst that can happen if you go in an interview and you don't do good is you don't get the job you know you go to another interview just you know all you can do is just try to prepare as best you can John B says what do you look for specifically on a potential candidates github profile yeah I I personally I want to see what I want to see like what have they worked on it does that relate to the job that I'm actually hiring them for and then I want to look at like how many like how many commits are they how consistent or the commits like have they contribute if they've contributed to other projects and opensource projects that's a big plus if they've gotten accept because that tells me that the people that are in charge of these opensource projects that are maintaining them have thought that their code was good enough to actually pull in so that that's a big plus that's like a vote of confidence from from people who are established in the industry so that's a big thing if you can get that that would be impressive at least to me and then other than that though just seeing like you know what are you working on or the projects good are you showing improvement in which you're working on things like that Joseph says hi Jesse is it necessary to know something about backend or server while you learn to be frontend and by the way I'm overwhelmed I'm sorry you're overwhelmed don't get too discouraged about that just keep at it you'll get less and less overwhelmed as you as you go on and get more confident the if you're learning frontend you you don't have to know a lot about backend it just kind of depends on what you're working on and so I would I would say like if it interests you go ahead and learn backend but if you feel like you have to learn backend stuff to be good with frontend stuff I don't think you necessarily do and then if like if you get a job where there's a backend people and frontend people and stuff and you probably would never have to do very much at all with a backend but like me with my job we don't have backend people here so I do have to do some stuff with backend so I can't say for sure that you'll never need backend because you certainly might but it's not absolutely required one ass or one one says in terms of like the proper talking about free code camp projects in different projects is you can try to build something HTML J's first then try to do the same with react that's actually a really good I've done that I did that with the weather app for free code camp and it was really cool to see the difference in terms of time for development and then the final product so that's really good advice thanks thanks one okay so I am finally at the end of this live chat this was like an epic chat so we had significantly more viewers today than we have and they were really active in the chat so thank you so much I'm like really pumped that so many people were interested in this and and stuck around and contributed in the chat I really appreciate that thanks everyone for watching I'll be back tomorrow like I said tomorrow will probably be an early stream because I have a meeting at my normal stream time so I will I will put it on Twitter at the latest tomorrow morning when I'm going to stream and I will also schedule the stream so you'll get it'll be on the YouTube channel for free code camp so anyway thanks everyone thanks for watching contributing and have a great day I'll see you all tomorrow
