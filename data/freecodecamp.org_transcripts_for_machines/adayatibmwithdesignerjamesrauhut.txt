hi I'm James Rao I'm a designer at IBM design here in Austin Texas and I'm going to be doing A Day in the Life for free code Camp um it's 830 I need to head out so I can stop by the gym before work and sorry about the mess I just got married to awesome person all right let's go and when I say go to the gym I mean go to ChickfilA for the breakfast so I'm walking into the office now now uh it's a giant campus actually IBM's not the only person here but what's really funny is IBM originally built this campus uh either in the 60s or 70s and it's right north of it was on the outskirts of Austin when they built it and there really wasn't anything else here and since then now it's the now the largest outdoor mall and office space is right across the street so all of a sudden it's the place to be in Austin uh usually the family people that work here live uh in a suburb north of here and then the people that want to be where it's at live downtown and this is right in the middle which is nice I'm all about the commute so I live like 5 minutes down the road from here uh but it's a pretty nice campus uh we got basketball court sand volleyball which I don't really use uh but my favorite part is that there's just so many restaurants in that outdoor mall right across the street to take advantage of for lunch so it's 900 a.m. I get into the office eating my ChickfilA but really the first task at hand is checking the email and the slack you think I'd have a lot of emails but rarely anymore cuz all of IBM is on slack now crazy promotion I know right so I just have a million slack channels and messages to check we're celebrating our manager recently becoming a design principal one of our teammates decorated her desk celebrating projects she's worked on and now we're all signing little notes for her okay so I've looked through all my emails not many looked through all my slacks lots and now I'm looking through GitHub Enterprise and public GitHub for whatever issues PRS that I need to look at um the GitHub Enterprise I look for mostly PRS for different projects on my wider team that I need to review and then on public GitHub I look through because one of the house chores in my job is uh maintaining a lot of public repos that really are mostly just assets for the IBM design language so that includes things like icons and colors charting Library we've been trying to get off the ground publicly uh and it's kind of a half developer half designer job because we have these build processes that we develop to automatically generate the assets for every change and then on the design side we have to actually make sure they they're usable for when designers are designing designs you know so that takes about like a half hour usually as long as there's not something crazy to look at so right now I'm backseat coating with Trevor uh one of my teammates on a different project we're just trying to make sure his devops go smoothly for this project he's starting so now I'm going to do an exercise for about a half hour of just exploring um content skeletons for when new data and experiences loading in and and see if any best patterns uh come out of this exercise I'm just going to try to keep going as wide as possible it was something I started yesterday so another Project's running into Blu miix problems but the nice thing about being in the studio in Austin is instead of dealing with tech support for it uh we're just going to go down to the Blu miix floor and start asking friends that work for Blu miix and they'll probably solve it in one minute and of course they figured it out in one minute it was no problem um I want to just share with you the entrance to my floor we have two special guests that are always at the entrance we have two of the robots from the Watson commercial that premiered at the last Super Bowl uh with gri fiser uh and they've been here for like over a year now I guess they're permanent guest at the studio so I got a good amount of time left uh before lunch so I'm going to add a uh some search functionality that some uh that a teammate wanted for one of their experiences uh just so they could search between the different users to find them get to eat lunch across the street Velvet Taco with the buds getting back from lunch saying hi to the robots hi robot hi robot that robot's confused all right so I'm back from lunch uh I've got a little bit of time before my first meeting of the afternoon so I just want to give you a tour of the Austin Studio real quick uh as fast as I can so a lot of the this is the seventh floor I work on the eighth floor but the seventh floor is actually full of these Open Spaces where we do a lot of workshops um these workshops are typically client workshops or IBM teams coming to Austin to do a workshop but we also do them for uh where if you're an entrylevel designer hired for IBM it doesn't matter which studio around the world you're being deployed to you always come here for a 3month design boot camp and so one of those Open Spaces is your home for 3 months where you do a bunch of crazy projects uh we also have this uh media Studio where we're cranking out a lot of digital media for people this is all the colleges represented uh here at the Austin Studio doesn't mean you have to go to to a college but we're very well represented this is our make laab uh we do a lot of screen printing here uh you can and also all sorts of projects you can see some of the examples of the great screen prints that happen here uh back there we got a MakerBot and then this is the eighth floor where I work uh it's a lot more uh actual just product design teams so you'll see a lot more desk down here we've got uh the Power Systems team proud of their Hardware as well as their digital designs this is one of my favorite Corners because we represent Austin with a ACL Music Festival uh with all the posters of every year and then we've got a video game cabinet and then this Feast is H one of those crazy Microsoft hubs I love it we just uh leave a great piece right here for everyone to see and we'll just let whoever the next person is discover that and then this is my little Turf area uh I like to AstroTurf my apartment apartment balconies so I use all the leftover Turf just at my desk uh so I'm back at my computer uh first thing I want to do is we at IBM we have this big uh educational program for frontend developers called petucation where uh we get to present to each other uh new topics across the whole company uh live so right now I want to uh create a proposal for a new one about why CSS and JS is here to stay and uh it's not just a fad it's really exciting work especially uh coming off of a high since styled components version 2.0 just came out and I love it and of course all the submissions for a frontend development education program have to be on a GitHub repo so every submission idea is an issue itself oh so I just finished coding at 400 p.m. today and going to finish the day off by hanging out with my buddy Evan and explaining more about the skeletons we need to design it's getting near the end of the day one last thing I really need to do is clean my desk uh at IBM design we use a lot of sticky notes and my desk is covered in notes from this past week so it's 500 on Memorial Day Friday uh for the nonamericans watching that means we have Monday off so everyone naturally wants to take uh Friday before for vacation time so that means there's nobody here but that's okay because we get to go now so we're headed out going home going to be safe and and do lots and lots of work over weekend not really one last thing I want to share my favorite sign in this whole studio we have an emergency exit door and if you push it alarm goes off so we never like when people push it but this was how we improved stopping people from pushing it
