my name's anna and i'm working for a small company called hiring herb and it's been a topic of conversation for us for a while especially being a very small development team and not necessarily having uh much budget or resources to try and even kind of understand it and then deal with what we needed to do for gdpr so just quickly hiring hub we're building a kind of recruitment marketplace platform which joins kind of uh rated reviews agencies to employers so there's quite a lot of data that's kind of processed within us within our site as well so i joined as cto uh end of last year and um i don't know really what that means yet i guess but i'm a bit of everything from desktop support to product development to wordpress developers my most recent job title and facilities all sorts of different things um and then there's my favorite favorite responsibility which is information security manager as well so i don't know for those of you who remember me from on the beach i've got really bad timing when it comes to compliance issues in this role because i literally got landed this job title as well uh when it was pci dss so all the kind of credit card stuff as well so i just start here and then my boss goes oh i've heard of this thing gdpr do you know what it means i'm like oh no i'll find out and so that's what we've been doing for a while um okay so what does it stand for so it's the general data protection regulation and effectively it's the same as the data protection act of 19 let me just check the date 98 and effectively there's a lot of similar kind of principles in there all the underlying principles are the same now does anybody know what the principles are you want to take a guess how many do you reckon there are six oh not bad not bad now this is a this is cue stolen slide because obviously my slides are just text but this one's a bit more wizzy so i stole this but there's seven principles um and six of them existed previously so making sure that you know the data was fair and lawful that you were holding that you had a real purpose for the data that you were holding you know i want a job so you know it's you know it's reasonable that i'm holding you know i'm giving my cv to somebody and they're storing it um that you'd keep the minimum amount of data that you might need for that purpose that you try and keep it up to date when you're processing it that you'd always keep it confidential and secure and that you'd limit the forms that you'd keep it in that would be identifiable but what's different with the seventh principle is they've really added some accountability and liability across the whole spectrum as well which means that um people are really looking to kind of tighten up on everything you know there's potential fines now and reputational damage as well um that comes from that so that's why you know we're getting all these gdpr emails because people are kind of panicking a little about it and trying to understand what do we do what does it what does it mean so what um what does it apply to so it applies to any personal data that can reasonably identify an individual so all of these are you know perfect examples of things that that could include but one thing that i learned is that it's not just personal data from a consumer perspective it's also personal data from a company or work perspective as well so my work email address and that's held by a supplier of us for example would be in scope for this as well okay so what did this mean for a hiring hub or at least for our small small team so we figured out that there's two main areas where we had data and that we had to look after it so we were controllers of our customer data and that was our agency and supplier user data our supplier data and our employee data so that was data that we actually owned and we had consent from people either you know because they worked for us and to use their na number for um for the purposes of payroll for example or through terms of business that agency had given us their details so that we could contact them and phone them for the purposes of the business of engaging in our kind of services um and mainly that kind of around email phone number address national insurance number bank details those things then we had also figured out that we were a processor for some data so we didn't own it so an agency would put forward a cv within our platform they might put forward some details for a telephone interview on our platform but we effectively didn't own that candidate data at all but we had to ensure that the controller of that data had consent in order to process that data on our system as well so that's our small team we've got four of us um sorry for my cheesy grin and as you could tell it was a bit of a last uh it was taken today i don't wear that tshirt this tshirt ever every day um so yeah what does it really mean for us like i mentioned before we're really small team a really small budget and like with any kind of startup business you really before you invest in kind of shoring up and maturing certain things you probably need to spend some money making sure that you've got a viable business um and security and gdp haven't been budgeted for in our funding at all so um so what did we do so we educated ourselves um pretty cheaply you know we didn't uh although initially i kind of panicked and we were speaking to a few consultants about what did it mean at you know 1200 pounds a day i thought we can we can find out a little bit more about this we don't think that we need a consultant so i have been to most gdpr events in manchester and some other cities especially if they've got free food and and drink and i'm definitely there um you know i've read blogs and we've kind of beg stole and borrowed um lots of kind of resources and things from people as well and really just kind of giving ourselves a basic understanding of of what we need to do and also trying to understand where our risk points were for the business um this maybe comes back to not stolen but kind of we acquired adida gdpr policy pack and that was actually really helpful i mean it was it's pretty pretty thick but actually it helps us understand kind of a benchmark of where we where we needed to get to with all our data so for example it had a secure coding policy it had a patch management policy it had an encryption policy password policy day retention asset management all sorts of things which gave us a basic understanding of how we should deal or deal with some of these things and what the standards were that we needed to work towards so that meant we could do a gap analysis and go right we're kind of here you know and we need to be here what's all the stuff that we need to do and then we kind of work with the business to kind of prioritize what was important or most important so we then decided we need to find where all that data is we knew we had this customer data candidate data cv phone numbers um but i guess with like any small company that's kind of maturing there were you know things in spreadsheets there were things on people's machines there was various um kind of servers our live service test servers staging local machines with copies of databases on potentially um we had cdn s3 storage we had our backups we had printouts maybe lying about the office um i'm making it sound really bad it sounds like data everywhere but these are the things that we had to start looking just to make sure where is the data and then how can we make it more secure as well um also logging and analytics was one as well just to look to make sure that we weren't um holding any data there too okay so we found we kind of mapped out all the data and for us because we're a small company actually a lot of a lot of those kind of places were locations especially from a technical perspective with from third party suppliers so um you know our car hosting our email service um even our devops kind of operations as third party so we um engaged with them to help understand if they were moving to compliance and what they were doing and actually that was fantastic to help us learnt as well learn as well i was like oh what are you doing oh we know maybe we should do that as well so that's really helped then once we'd found it um we really kind of tried to understand did we really need it was it important is it just because you know we haven't had a showed up retention policy that we've got quite a lot of customer data um so we actually deleted a lot of data that we didn't need um or we anonymised what we what we did need to keep um so that was quite that was almost an opportunity as well because i think from a technical perspective that's made it a lot easier to manage costs less than storage and a lot of other things as well okay so then we looked at the data that we had left and we're like who's got access to it um so this back to kind of passwords was called um you know we invite kind of password uh password policies or stronger password policies again being a small company there'd been this kind of oh you know i'll just borrow that password you know a shared password that was written down printed on the wall although that might be a safer place to keep it remember what we're saying here simple things like making sure that people lock in their screen creating a bit of a starter and lever process even though there's only you know there was only kind of nine people when we started the amount of access that could have been given on an ad hoc basis and then someone would leave and it would be like a few weeks later they've you know they potentially still got a password to a live production system it's like ah you know we need to get process in place to make sure and that we don't do that again so that was access to the data and then anything that's left any of the data that's left looking at making sure that we're securing it as much as possible so that's kind of the point we're at at the minute is looking at improving the encryption of our application data but also you know making sure that disk encryption's on on the laptops for for users if they've got anything downloaded um yep um and generally kind of continuing to create processes um and assurances as we kind of grow the code base as well so looking at um we've got it sorry you know ongoing vulnerability scanning regular pen tests um using for example breakman in the release pipeline to make sure that we're continually just checkpointing where we are trying to document a little bit more so that when people are coming in to kind of understanding how things are working what we're using and looking at implementing kind of privacy by design which is something that gdpr talks about which is really where with any kind of new development you're doing kind of really thinking about that data do you need it where are you going to store it who's going to access it so that you can continually make sure that you kind of keep this up so what's next um so really i think we're going to try and work on how do we automate a lot of this stuff as we move forwards i think because we're a small company a lot of it is around kind of process you know it's kind of process driven we can't afford a kind of all singing or dancing gdepr one kind of push solution and a lot of it is kind of workarounds and best endeavors to make sure that we can follow the processes so hopefully as we move forward we'll be able to automate a lot of that for the business and help them um but just generally um it's never it's never going to be done it's kind of it's not a you get to the i think it's the 25th of may where it officially comes in which is why your emails will be hammered i think even more so for the next week apologies if you get one from us um but it's just it's kind of one of those it's those ongoing processes it's really important to kind of bed in and educate people within your teams to make sure they understand what they need to do so thank you you're all still awake so let's start
