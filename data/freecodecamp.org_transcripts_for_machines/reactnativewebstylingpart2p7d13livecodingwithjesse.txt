hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to keep doing some styling as you can see we've got a lot of work to do so not exactly the best ui sorry i was a few minutes late i uh didn't realize how much setup i would need i didn't realize my computer had turned off and things had updated so it just took me a few extra minutes um so let me give you a quick update um you may hear my kids in the background they're about to leave for school so let me give you a quick update before we start with the coding uh just on what's going on so i was recently at the star trek conference so that's in columbus uh it's a tech conference um so i unexpectedly gave a talk on react native web and i used this project as an example i'm gonna give um the same talk next week at ndc minnesota so if i know anybody in minnesota and you want to meet up i'll be there most of next week so let me know and uh one thing i i realized is when i'm using this project to display like to demonstrate what's going on we haven't built for um for mobile yet so i can't demonstrate that now there is there is an issue with that so i really want to use expo but currently expo does not support um the context is it the context api or hooks one of those two i can't remember but basically we're doing stuff right now that is not supported by expo so we have to wait until that support comes out so um we could possibly just build um for react native like build for mobile with just regular react native and not worry about expo i've done that before like that's a possibility so we may do that just wanted to give you an update on where i'm at was coming up and uh what the plans are for this project but no matter what today we're gonna work on styling okay uh let me say hi to everyone and see what's up in the chat before we get started chas white cases why the long face uh no reason i just put they were talking about this picture i put on the thumbnail where i i don't really look that happy i just looked through my photos and picked one that i hadn't used yet and that was the first one i found so um i think i took that last week so that's not not feeling sad today um everybody's saying hello good morning uh benjamin asks how i'm doing uh actually not too bad not too bad i'm uh i think i might be coming down with something i woke up with a sore throat and a stuffy nose but hopefully it's nothing too bad since i gotta travel next week all right okay let me let me get started and anybody that's asking questions in the chat i'll get back to your questions very soon so i'm gonna set this timer and um when this timer goes off i'm gonna go back to the live chat and answer uh as many questions as i can all right so let's see let's get rid of that it's not running um first off let me i'm gonna go to the contributors page just to uh give a shout out to everybody that's contributed so far uh so i like to put this up here you know occasionally just to let everybody know uh you know who's been contributing so thank you to everyone who's contributed so far definitely um welcome any uh any pull requests you may have all right let's let's go to the code first things first always start your day off with a get pool oh looks like oh okay so i did update uh the gh pages so that's the the link in so if we go to the project and click on this link you can actually check out the project here so i'm going to put that link in the description so you just check it out you know right now but that's updated so i i didn't realize that it was still running an older version uh so i updated that over the weekend and it's back to our code okay also usually just run yarn as well or an npm install now i i know that there were no packages pulled down but just in case sometimes i forget maybe i installed a package on another computer like that way we're all set i've already started the development server and so we're good to go so right now a lot of our stuff basically our entire app for the most part is split between this app producer.js and app.js so in terms of our styles we can see most of our styles are here in app.js all right and i apologize in advance i'm gonna yawn a lot i didn't have any caffeine yet so uh it's gonna happen i'm sorry uh so yeah here's our styles right we have it in the form of javascript objects we're using the stylesheet.create that comes with react native okay so let's figure out exactly what we're gonna do what we're gonna try to get done in this stream uh so the last stream we did some work with the submit button basically we made this bigger let me go let's shrink this down to what size the hundred percent size um so that we get a good idea um when you shrink it down to this size it does seem like the proportions are a bit off right but uh what i'd really like to do is make these boxes look different right it's not obvious what these even are right now okay so ideally what i would love to find is an svg an open source svg and it has a little icon that looks like a hero right and enemies so that's what i love to put in here not sure if we're going to find that but let's just do a quick search if we don't find anything in the first like minute or two then we'll just move on to something else but hopefully we can find something suitable for this uh also it might be kind of cool to have different backgrounds show up like i'm thinking depending on what's going on maybe we have different backgrounds so uh instead of just a message that shows up it could be remember this is a kids game right so we want to try to be visual and not rely on textbased things as much so potentially like images or graphics would show up for victory for defeat um getting a question right getting it wrong okay so let's check out um free svg character icons i don't know trying to think of the best way to do this oh that might work all right let's just check out a few of these all right that's that's not bad let's visit that whoa okay all right not bad let's see how this how we would actually go about loading this uh trying to find one i like i guess it doesn't matter let's just pick whatever because i want to see and now see this is coming as not an svg so i don't know about that let's see if we can drop that yeah i don't think that'll work let me see if everybody oh okay here we've got a um comp sci guy says is linked um let me get this link copy link address uh open what is it opengameart.org that seems like exactly what i need oh okay i think i've checked on here before a long time ago for a different game and let's see we what we can trying to see what kind of search we can do 2d yeah if you want 2d there we go my favorites okay this might take some more searching and figuring out how to use this but i actually really like this so i'm going to leave this up for now but i i feel like this is something i would want to look at more because it seems like it has a ton of options and this one doesn't look like it's going to give give us svgs which is what i really want basically the reason i really want to try to find an svg is that we can control the size and the color through code and we can animate as well right so um that's that would be like best case scenario okay so these are available in svg cool um all right these ones oh these ones actually have color let's just click these ones this one first and see eventually i do want to give the kids an option to pick their their character so we may want to bring in more than one of these but let's find somebody with a sword or something uh this person has this oh just they're like really specific it's not just hero character it's actually a spartan character all right there we go a knight with a sword alright let's see that wow and you can even get colored versions very nice all right now here's what i want to see oh is this not free we may have to buy these shoot hmm all right um here we go here's another one svgrepow.com uh comp scott guy says in the meantime you could just give them a border and border radius until we find appropriate svgs um yeah we could yeah i just want to try oops did i not copy that okay this will be the last one we try before we move on looking for like maybe a very like cartoon looking all right let's just grab this one just to see what we get all right so i need to find i want to open this with vs code so i can see what the code looks like where's my downloads there we go all right so let's open this with visual studio code there we are that's what i wanted to see okay so we have an svg all right so let's get rid of some of this stuff i don't want this all right and i'm gonna put this right in let's find our hero there we go so inside our view we already have our view for our hero i'm just going to paste this svg in all right let's see now this will not work for react native yes so and this this probably this might not even work for what we're doing right now um yes we may have to change some of this up just to even get it to to work at all expected corresponding closing tags review what is this i'm getting rid of all of these and let's see we should have there's our view here's our view right something's not getting closed properly what is this let's get rid of that i'm just going to start getting rid of stuff that is giving us problems all right let's see if that fixed yep that fixed it okay all right let's see what happens here i'm going to show okay john hanson dropped some links in here i'm showing them because uh if you put a link in the live chat it doesn't show up by default i have to choose to show them um let's see right click svg inside clean it make sure oh okay uh john has a link here where you could it seems like you can put an svg file in there and it'll clean it up so then you can put it into the site that's cool i usually just clean it up by hand but that seems like um it would be a lot easier just to do it on that site so i'll have to check it out um let's see all right make sure i save that let's see if if this is doing anything for us here it looks like no let's see what our air is style props okay so our styles are messing this up and that's just a warning though right yeah what's our actual error it's like the mapping from style properties okay so it looks like we need to get rid of those i was hoping it would still at least render but stuff phil um why does it say style fill we should just be able to say fill all right that's we're gonna we're gonna fix pretty much all of these right now okay um all right so first thing we'll do is change this to an equals and then add that we'll get rid of that and all of this okay so that should get rid of the air with fills and then let's try to do the same thing with this i'm not sure if it'll work but we'll see yeah let's just get rid of this okay yay okay it's not like uh we we definitely took out some stuff i think that was needed because this does not look like we brought in but we've got something there okay oh nice so john also has a link for a tool to convert uh svgs into jsx um so into stuff that react can use so that's that's awesome okay um comp side guys said maybe turn those styles into objects um i thought about doing that but then i realized that phil is actually a valid attribute for uh paths so that's why i just ended up taking that off um although this one that i just took off here i don't know what that did but it may have been important okay so we have an svg in there uh i think we need to make these bigger i know we made them smaller last time but this is kind of like ridiculously too small i think they need to be just a little bigger and let's see we should probably decide on what color scheme we really want let's just let's do this let's see if we can find some colors like this um colors for children let's see this all right i'm looking at a color palette for kids color palette seven cool colors for kids rooms there we go actually that's kind of cool as long as they can give me hex colors what no i don't all right i don't know what that was oh was this on pinch i didn't realize it was on pinterest okay all right forget that one i like those colors but that's not going to be uh didn't realize i was clicking on pinterest so much you would think when i typed in hex colors it would give me links that actually have x must include okay now i see it says missing hex all right let's say children's website web colors see all right no i wow this is actually really cool though it's like a lift the flap book for all the colors so it's for kids all right i really like that book but that's beside the point all right so let's see you use a chrome extension that gives you colors all right i'm getting a lot of of links for color stuff all right let me just try out one of these i'm just gonna try the last one i got so this is going to generate colors uh okay let's figure this out hit the space bar to generate color schemes click on a color okay cool that's all all right all right this looks cool so let's spacebar get some colors let's just wait till we find one that looks like it's good for kids this is nice and bright all right let's let's pick this one all right so let's just go with this and what do y'all think oh wow i have a lot more links too i'll have to check all these out uh at some point but all right ready what do you think about this color palette i'll give everybody like 10 seconds to put in their opinions on this color palette i have about two minutes left a little over two minutes and then i'm gonna go to the chat and answer some questions so if you have any questions you put them in now all right let's cool it looks cool alright awesome oh okay wow you can do alternative shades you can do lots of cool stuff let's see about this exporting export palette scss wow interesting let's see what this looks like we can get an scss file yeah that's that might not be a bad idea i want to open this with code as well we can find it there it is okay opening code cool now we can just copy and paste these colors um we could probably put these in like an actual theme file if we wanted to and i believe we do have a theme so we created a color theme like down here and this is basically just like our background colors um but we could build out our theme a bit more and we already have it here right so we could say hero oops background color oh how did we do this edition background color trying to remember how i put this in here i might not have done it in a way that will work for what i wanted to do let's see oh okay i did do it the right way i thought since i actually used background color i thought for a second i was like locked into actually using css but all right let's say hero color and let's split this so i can just grab them all right let's give hero color did my oh my timer went off okay when we get back from uh answering some questions we'll just finish filling this out a little bit and then add in our colors and then that way we'll have a pretty easy mechanism for changing all the colors at once and at some point we could potentially give the user the ability to change the theme change the colors i think that would be kind of cool um based like me just observing my own kids they will spend so much time like customizing the colors and stuff um that might be cool for them like i know right now we have it like addition subtraction multiplication but maybe actually giving the user the ability to further customize the colors would would probably be a cool feature all right so let's start my timer over here all right so we'll do a short break and i'm going to scroll up and try to answer as many questions as i can um or alicia says uh make a code that stores students marks please using c plus um i don't really do c plus plus so i mean we could do code like that but um it would be like with javascript and not c plus benjamin says i love free code camp awesome uh comp sci guys so i was talking about building this for um like ios or android comp sci guy says we could just use react native init yeah we actually could maybe i'll try to do that um that might be good to try to do during a stream actually i expect them to run into issues because i just always do so uh that would be a good one for a stream so maybe we'll try to do that on the next stream i'd really love to have that available before i before next week because i want to demo it um at the conference sagemo jesse says uh their name is jesse too awesome i mentioned earlier that i thought i was getting sick imagine it sounds like you got the man flu been there before yeah unfortunately i have too much stuff to do and i can't just lay around which is what i would normally prefer to do when i'm sick um zach says these streams are great by the way thank you i appreciate that uh zach also asked if i work in pomodoro technique so the 25 minute code 5minute break i try to it's a little bit more difficult with my my new so my old job i was working on things mostly solo and i had like stuck to the pomodoro technique almost all the time with my new job i do a lot more pair programming and i'm in like an open office setting so it's harder to stick to that like the i i'm way more likely to just get interrupted in the middle of it or um like if i'm pair programming then it's hard to say like i would have to convince the other person i'm pairing with that like this is how we're gonna do it so i haven't found a great way to consistently use it but i'd really like to start using it again sorry all right sage mode says beginner here need to download python but it's kind of tricky don't think i'm doing it right also i heard you don't have to download javascript that's true yeah you javascript just runs on the browser uh you don't need to download it um i don't even remember how to download python like if i've done it it's been so long ago and i'm not sure there are some like in browser editors that will let you run python so you may want to check that out it might just let you get started faster with python without having to mess with the download benjamin says all the videos jesse records should be in a playlist right yep it is in playwrist so there is a huge playlist of all the live streams and that's just called live coding with jesse and then there are other playlists broken down by project so this particular project which we're on day 13 um has its own playlist with just like these 13 videos a couple you're asking how i am so i already addressed that earlier so i'm not gonna repeat it but uh you can basically i'm good so but you can check out the longer answer uh on the replay all right somebody who i can't pronounce their name it's in different characters keeps asking if i am dj smash i am not dj smash uh and once we do google dj smash so maybe i'll google that after the stream let's see um riyad says i am i'm not able to understand your english i'm sorry about that um yeah i'm not sure i'll try to speak as clearly as i can um but i'm not sure what else i could do about that i'd love to get subtitles for these at some point if anybody's interested in doing subtitles you know please let me know sy a myth says that they unsubscribed i'm sorry to hear that uh if you want to let me know why you unsubscribed i could try to do a better job then um although they not sure they're still stuck around if they already unsubscribe uh all right let me my timer went off so let's make a note of where i stopped at 7 40. let's see 751 in my chat okay all right let's see what's what's this time 809 okay i'm not gonna start another pomodoro timer we're just going to do a little bit more and then i'm going to finish up because if i do a whole nother pomodoro session i'm not going to have time to get through all the questions okay so let me get rid of that yeah don't say that let's just bring over these colors a bit and see if we can get our more reasonable color scheme okay oh background color let's change our background color uh do we want to go with the white background you want to go the colored background just let me know if you if you have an opinion on that i really love dark themes i'm like so tempted to just put this dark color as the background maybe i'll just try it we'll try it out see what happens all right hero color let's go with enemy enemy color and we'll give that the reddish color for now and oh let's do our button background as this yellow that seems cool i think the yellow actually looked really cool on the dark background button color okay i'm not sure what we'll do with the green let me see if we can figure out where that'll where that could go we don't have to use all the colors but yeah we're gonna have to change the color of the text as well so let's just put that in there for now text color let's just make this white for now oops okay that's pretty cool whoops uh comp sci guy mentioned i had an extra semicolon there thank you so much for uh for catching that all right so let's shrink this side up a bit we don't really need it and let's just try to add in these colors and see what it looks like so we need the font is gonna be the hardest thing the font color all right so we need to add uh let's see we need to add an array so we need to make our styles an array so for right now i'm just going to override whatever we have with our styles here so this will be fonts and this is we'll say there we go active theme dot text color and zeros okay and our hero wow so we have styles heroes styles character let's see um will this even matter yeah we have that svg there uh actually i think the background is still showing up so we still have some purple around the outside so let's do this and say background color and active theme the hero color what did i do oops there we go okay so um what we're doing here right is we're bringing in all the styles that we have in our style sheet at the bottom of character and of hero and then we're pulling in background colors so it'll it will cascade and like whatever comes last will override whatever was before it okay so we're already setting the background color for our hero um i believe here but it should be overridden by our background color here at least that's what i think is gonna happen all right now we have our enemies and we can do the same very a similar thing with our enemies background color active themed enemy color there we go we have more text here so we want to do style books equals font color active theme dot text oops text color and oh is our button so our button color is now going to be active theme dot button color and i think we have another button down here so let's oops yeah we're not going to be able to copy that because this one's a touchable opacity so let's make an object here and this will be background color button color nope not how it's supposed to go active theme dot button color and this needs to be in oops this needs to be an object there we go usually a good sign that you've messed up the syntax is when you're not getting your um autocomplete showing up uh okay we do have some more text that needs to be changed to the text color so fortunately these all have the same type of thing going on here so we're gonna use our multiple cursors so for the way my keyboard's set up which i don't know if this is the default for vs code or not i just press ctrl or command d and i can do this and get the multiple cursors right so uh we need to make this an object and then we'll make i'm sorry we need to make it an array first and then add in a style object um what was it font color that's it font color and that's going to be active theme dot text color verify that change for all of them yep all right cool i mean there's got to be a better way to do this at 2 because we're starting to get a lot of stuff happening in here so we'll try to find a better way to do it all right so let's save that and see if it worked oh okay it worked cool i'm not sure that that actually looks better oh you know it didn't work though this um this font color because it's not font color it's color i really did somebody catch that it's just color i don't know what i was thinking that's like basic css right there all right so let's find everywhere where we have font color and change it to color okay there we are okay and this might be uh we need to change it inside there but i don't know if i want to change it because i don't think that looks that good let me know what you think maybe it's just my screen i don't know but this does not look good to me where's our where's our code here it just this looks like it would look better on this screen but then when we actually did it here not not great yeah all right so it's saying colors are drab yeah it does look kind of drab all right well the good thing is this we now have an easy way to change all the colors in our in our app so now if we want to mess with new colors all we have to do is just change these not only that but we already set it up so that we could easily like change themes so what we could do is just have like four different themes or more if we really wanted to but for right now we're set up for four and just flip back and forth and really see which which ones we like better um see them side by side we can even open up a bunch like more than one window at a time sidebyside compare themes so uh although we didn't find a theme we really liked we did set it up so that it'll be easier to find that theme so i'm okay with that we also um tried an svg so probably not gonna use this svg but at least we have the silhouette of a humanlike form so let me um let me go ahead and commit this so you all can check out the code and play what if you want if you want to like mess with themes and stuff and if you find a cool one and want to do a pull request by all means please do that um but as soon as i commit this and push it to the git repo i'm gonna go through some questions and then uh finish up for today and go to my other job this is not really a job this is just a volunteer for fun type of thing so the job i get paid for i'll go to that next all right so let's do a git status oops let's make this bigger yep so we modified app.js git commits i'm going to say we're going to add do the add together with the commit and we're going to put the commit message in and let's just say um scg for hero and new theme and i'll do a git push all right all that code should be there um now i can also do a deploy so that the new code will be in that gh pages but i don't think i'm going to do it yet because i think the theme is actually uglier than the one that's currently out there so so i'm just gonna wait before i i push that to that uh demo link all right let's go to the chat and i believe we left off yeah 751 okay um all right there's a lot of discussion about when we were bringing that svg over so i'm gonna skip some of this because we already went over some of it um let's see all right so see there's a lot of cool links i'm gonna have to go through all those links that you all shared and check them out uh later on thank you for that i really appreciate it oh cool it looks like look good looks good looks good great awesome okay cool um looks like a lot of you thought it it looked alright what is he doing uh hanzo says hey i'm from brazil we're watching you awesome thanks uh muhammad asks if i do python i don't really code much in python i've done a little bit with it years ago but not i would not really consider myself to be good at python hanzo says make a tutorial in javascript um i do have some tutorial videos in on my channel i don't know if i actually have a javascript one a lot of it is more like getting all your dev environments set up using git and things like that void roamer says good morning what's going on where's the music stream uh the music stream should still be going so if you're looking for the music stream um just like get out of my stream and then i think the music stream is usually uh like always going like 24 7 so you may have to like search for it but it should be ups though um t says i don't want to interview for a dev job too early and lose a good opportunity with that company because i'm not ready when do i know i'm ready to start applying for web developer jobs um honestly i i think you're ready when you can convince somebody else that you're ready to to actually have a job right like that's that's all that really matters like if you can convince your interviewer that you can do the work then you'll get the job right so i mean to to convince yourself maybe you could do some practice interviews and see how you do um check out so on my youtube channel i do have some videos on interviewing and on my interview experience and i talk a lot more about um preparing for interviews so there's some good resources on there she might want to check that out i believe there's a link to my channel in the description of this video um lewis says are you from the netherlands i am not from the netherlands i'm from um from the u.s um benjamin asks why it's named p7d13 uh so it's uh project seven day 13. uh it looks like that already got answered in the chat so thank you t says you do kind of look like dj smash but not really all right i definitely have to look up this dj smash person after the stream ernesto says hey i like your videos uh thank you i appreciate that thanks for watching red light bd says i love your tutorial thank you benjamin says keep up the excellent work mate thanks man everybody's being so nice in this stream uh i actually thought i didn't do a great job because we i couldn't make anything look nice but uh i i really appreciate all the the positive uh encouragement there at yeah says i'm just starting to learn some back end development what technology do you do do you think i should be learning at this stage um it really depends like it depends on what you're using so like if you're using node for back end then you definitely want to be familiar with like node package manager like that whole ecosystem uh probably express um i mean of course like no matter what you're doing you want to learn about version control so most likely get um how to how to do stuff with with get um i don't know arguably if it's just you learning then you might want to learn a little bit about like actual deployment um and how to manage manage that manage like servers and stuff maybe some database stuff so it does kind of depend exactly on what you're working on but in general i think those things are pretty good to know at least a little bit about uh md uh is islam says i love your tutorial the wave explanation is nice oh thanks i'm glad you like it uh dead zombie says how do you import scss styles and react i see you always make separate styles object for your components but can i just have a separate sas file for my components um yes you can have a sas file but you got to be careful so like for the web that will work but if you're trying to run run this on mobile so like we're using react native and you can have a separate file for your css or scss scss yeah i said that right but you'll have to make sure that you're only pulling those in for web and you use the object version of css for mobile hopefully that makes sense maybe once we actually do start running mobile at the same time it'll make more sense um but if you're just doing like plane react and you're only going to build a web then yeah you can definitely use scss you just have to make sure your build pack like your your webpack config can handle that so depending on what you're using it might be already available to you to just write sas and it'll work or you may have to set that up on your own with webpack ernesto says soon i'm going to university to study software engineering any tips my only advice would be make sure you keep working on your own side projects and keep learning on your own with the latest stuff is in university just the way that that things work like it's hard for your professors to be on the cutting edge and teach you the latest stuff right because like they prepare all their stuff for class in advance so by the time they're actually teaching it it might be outdated so you'll learn a lot of the fundamentals of computer science but you may not learn what the latest tools and techniques are so just try to keep that up on your own comp side guy says i would make the background color that green color again okay so it's too dark yeah maybe maybe dark theme is not the right way to go for uh for the kids kidzap uh bartek says did anyone have such a problem with the github collaborators that they could not make any commits i'm not sure uh i haven't had any issues with that so i'm not sure what exactly issues you're facing maybe if you could explain a little bit more i could be more helpful to you um fanduel says what language do you do for your job um react native mostly and also um dotnet so it's like csharp.net core comp side guy says jesse i think your stream is awesome i like how you show true development it involves a bunch of trial and error and developers aren't super humans and we make mistakes yeah for sure i definitely make a lot of mistakes it says i'm working on a production production reactor a little bit of react native and we make mistakes all the time but we keep working till we get a solid product thanks i appreciate you saying that and yeah that's like kind of the whole idea behind the stream is just like this isn't going to be a perfect tutorial like this is just going to be working through things and i don't know how i'm gonna solve problems when i start the stream like we we figure it out together um yeah and we do make a lot of mistakes which is exactly how it goes for me at my real job as well um catalin says how do you make holy water um oh and it's the joke it's a joke okay how do you make holy water and the punch line is you boil the hell out of it i that's i thought you were serious for a second i was going to be like um i guess you need to find a priest but it was a joke um comp sci guy says does react native web ignore the gradle ios uh android files for the yarn start yes yes so actually we we built this with create react app and so it just runs the normal create react app start so it's gonna run like react script start yeah and then all those other normal files for like ios and android those only get get used when we um when we build for mobile okay all right i've gotten to the end of the chat thank you all so much for watching um i'm going to try to do another stream on friday i'd love to get another one in before next week because next week i'll be gone so i probably won't be able to
