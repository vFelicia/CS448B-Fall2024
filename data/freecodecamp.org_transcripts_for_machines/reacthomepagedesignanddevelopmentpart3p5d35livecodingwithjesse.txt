hey everybody welcome to live coding with Jesse I'm Jesse and today we're gonna do some design and dev work on a home page for our react site and we're using material design and we have a framework called material UI that we're using to build things out so we're gonna be working with that and all the codes available there's a link in the description and I thought I'd start out today by giving a very brief overview of the project since we haven't done an overview for a while or on this is the thirtyfifth stream I believe so we're pretty far into this project and I know some of you are kind of jumping in in the middle so let me give just a really quick breakdown and that'll give everybody a chance to join in as well if they're just getting their notifications that we've gone live so we have a react site that we build with next j/s primarily we went with next j/s because it offers very easy serverside rendering we have all our content housed in a wordpress installation so that means it's a my sequel database on WordPress we have the WP graph QL plugin and that allows us to pull data from that my sequel database with graph QL and bring it into our react application so whenever we grab data we're almost exclusively using graph QL the reason we went with WordPress is because it's very easy for people who don't really know a lot about code to input content so that's why we went with that it's also very stable and has a large user base so we made a custom plugin to of us a lot of different post types and taxonomies if you're not familiar with WordPress you know terminology and things it's just you know different ways for us to house our data and to make it very simple for people who are managing content to know where to put the data and that's that's it I mean that that's pretty much the overview of where we're at we've had some other steps along the way we've had to migrate some data but overall that's the structure of of the project so far so right now I'm at the point in the project where I need to make it look nice enough to present it to some people here at the university that I work for so I'd like to have that presentable looking by tomorrow morning and then I'll have a meeting my first of several meetings where I get to display this so that's where we're at right now if anyone has any questions about how we set anything up let me know I could at least point you to the stream where we set that up so you can watch the setup process yourself or I can you know take a few minutes and explain it let's see just want to say hi and read through a little bit in the live chat now before we start to see if there's anything I should address now okay great so Niki has some advice for my presentations about is just to talk about its value to the visitors not only its features alright that's that's really good advice if anyone has any advice for me when I go to present the site please let me know I'm gonna be talking to different groups so one group is going to be people that are like in charge of the university and another group is gonna be people who are primarily they interact with the students they're in charge of the student life Department I think I might do I don't think I'm gonna meet with faculty members I think I'm gonna do like a live stream for faculty members we're gonna call it a webinar because that's more like with their terminology that they're used to so that's depending on the group I may focus a little bit more on different features I even thought about kind of changing some of the content we have on the homepage for different groups but I don't want to get too far ahead of myself we still have some work to do right now so let me switch over so that you all can see what I'm saying on on one of my screens here so here's the code let me just catch you up on what I've done I've created this list card component which we we did a lot of the styling for that yesterday but I've split it out into a component yeah this is too small make it a little bigger okay and let me try to get as much out of the way as we can so here's the new component and all the code is up to date in in github so if you click the link below you'll be able to see it and you can also see the website if I start this and Rock server you'll be able to check out the website on your own computer there it is so if you can view the live chat there's a link now in the live chat to check out this site unfortunately if you're watching later on this and Rock server probably won't be running so you won't have access to it otherwise I would put the link in the description as well and I can for those of you who can't see the site right now I'm gonna pull this over and I we're primarily doing the mobile view of the site right now so I've been kind of showing it at this view and this is a very small phone so the odds of somebody having a phone like this are low but I really want to make sure it looks all right on all different devices so you may notice some differences I'll try to point them out as I go through so we still have the the cute little dog as our background picture which we need to get rid of that I keep putting it off because I'm hoping that someone else in my department will send me a picture that they really think would work it hasn't happened yet but I'd rather not spend a lot of time going through pictures because they I can spend a lot of time on that so one thing that I did do is I changed the way we're bringing in YouTube embeds so before material.you I already has a media card component where you could put in the URL that you want to use and what component you want to use in our case we were passing in as a prop iframe and we were also passing in the source so that was okay but the problem was it was acting like we were hovering the entire time so if you see it's not letting me do it here for some reason when I inspect this with dev tools it doesn't have the same hover effect but anyway when you hover the YouTube button is entirely red whereas normally it's let me refresh can see this normally again so oh well now it's doing it for some reason I keep getting this always red button maybe it's because it's mobile sorry I think that's the issue yeah okay so on mobile we can't really do anything about it but when we have more of a desktop view we have this semitransparent button and then it only goes red when you hover so for some reason when we use the material UI component like it was always red I couldn't get it to change so now I just have a card where I directly put an iframe in it works and it doesn't really add anything to the code so I think it's fine but you may see a difference in the code I would switch it back here I've changed out so a lot of the silly filler content that I had in there I'm gonna have to take out so I'm starting to put in like real facts we built this card out before so here's what I came up with for that list component now I know this all probably looks really small on your screen so I encourage you to use that anger out link if you can but anyway so we have the events list here we have some data and we have some options so if you don't pass in an image then it goes full width like this which I think works better when you have more content also you don't have to pass in the secondary text if you don't want to so you just have you should kind of show on a few of the options that we have here I'm still thinking that I'd like to display the date of these events somewhere but I also think it's time for me to move on and get this page looking like it's completed and then if I have time I can go back and add in some details so the rest I do still have some of those that filler content in here so today what I'd like to do is go and maybe make some real content for some of these pieces and also work on see some of the details so as we go through I'll point out some of the details that I still don't like about how this looks and and we'll fix those all right okay so that's what we started I'm going to start with Pomodoro clock so I may reset this so I'd like to break up the work in Pomodoro sessions so we're going to do 25 minutes of code and then I'll take a fiveminute break I'll go back to the live chat oh I got to say this out loud though Ruben says how is it possible to be so handsome I I'm gonna assume that that was directed towards me and that I am the one that is so handsome so I don't know I you could thank the person that cuts my hair also my mom and dad they probably had something to do with the handsomeness I'm just I'm just messing around I'm sure that was probably a joke but it still feels good to get comments like that so thank you okay so let's get into some of the code first off let's put in a little bit more content and I'm gonna run some ideas by you about you know kind of what I'm thinking we have right now especially in this view it's just a lot of content you know like right in a row it kind of works but I'm I don't know if my boss will like this idea or not but I'm thinking about maybe we can split up the content into some sections I'm I don't know I'm on the fence about that one and I'm not sure that's something I can get done before a presentation but it seems to me like sections might help break things up a little bit and make more sense of this content so as we're going through if you see some I don't know some pattern to things where you think a section of it might be good let me know I know that's pretty vague I just had the idea you know an hour or two ago so I'm still kind of thinking about it as well but all right one detail that I really like to change that keeps bothering me so let's just change it right now is I really want this logo to be centered I don't know that bothers anybody else but on a larger screen I think it looks fine to be over here but when it's this small it it's close enough to the center that it looks weird let me know if you disagree with that but I just think it it looks like it's supposed to be centered but it's offcenter to me only when it's this small though so first thing I'm going to do is just inspect this in dev tools which if you are viewing this through that and Rock link you should be able to do this as well and so let's see what the container is this will help to figure out mmhmm all right I don't like that so the container that's large enough to actually you make this go to the middle is this container here this div but the div also contains this button I don't want the button to be centered so let's see what we can do alright let's check out how this really is in the component right because material UI is changing these into some dips but let's see what the the component actually looks like so this is probably going to be in our app bar let's see the app over here Wow the app bar is quite a large component I haven't done anything with the app bar in a while so here's our logo and let's see is this the making sure we should have two places with a logo one of them is going to be the drawer so but I think we have that in a separate component interesting that's really interesting how we did that hmm I can i I'm looking at this I you you all can probably see already but I'm kind of puzzled looking at this that I did it this way so I probably copied over an example from the material UI documentation which had typography as an element in the app bar and it was probably just some text and then what I did instead of replacing typography with another element I just added this image element inside of the typography element I don't know that that's this may be a waste of of this element here so I'm gonna try to do a little bit let's let's say refactoring here and maybe clean this up and see what happens so what I'd like to do is let's see what with this classes flex is going right now to see if we should keep it or we can get rid of it so let's find flex okay so it's just saying flex one for that all right let's and then you button this is classes two column one class I wonder if we should have two different structures one for small screen and one for a large screen I see some more of you saying hi in the live chat hey thanks for watching thanks for joining in okay so here was my thought if I go changing this it's not only going to change for the mobile view it's going to change for the desktop view I don't want the desktop view to change so I need to not just start deleting things ideally what I would be able to do is just take one of these classes like let's take a look at the header image class for an example and use a media query or the the mature UI version of a media query which I'll show you an example in just a second and just change the style like that so I I think that'll be the best way to go for now even though I really don't like that to typography element maybe now when is this close to the presentation isn't the time for me to be going in and just trying things and hoping they don't break and I can't find that header image there we are okay that's it huh and they see where where that was that okay so that actually is on the image that's iPod Rafi alright let's go back to dev tools play around just a little bit I I kind of think we're gonna have to change the structure of this if it was just structured slightly different this wouldn't be as big of a deal all right so with so this is the yeah all right let's try this with so okay so the problem was these containers weren't yeah this isn't going to work with this structure so we can we can set the alignment to be centered but you see the the container here is is already offcenter so we're not gonna get it to be centered exactly with the element like that if we took it out of the flow though and it's just sticky no the snap isn't sticky and maybe it should be all right I have an idea here's my idea and I'm gonna say before I do it so that you all can stop me if it's a silly idea alright so number one I think it makes sense for this knife to be sticky on mobile because there's a lot of scrolling going on here it would be nice to be able to just get to the menu without having to scroll back up I I would appreciate that so I think at the very least on mobile that we should have a sticky navigation or fixed navigation whatever you prefer maybe even on desktop that might be the way to go but at least on mobile we should do that secondly if we're going to do a fixed navigation we could just position this thing differently so that all right like potentially we might be able to just take it out of the flow right now so we'll see how this works but let's alright good so I'm getting some feedback so Nikki says make it thinner while scrolling it's a personal preference I dislike all the space that it consumes okay yeah I I agree with that I agree so first things first let's make it sticky and then we can try to shrink it a little bit I I definitely think we can shrink it it's there's a lot of white space happening this logo could be smaller and still be perfectly readable so let's do that a new Java version I would remind me later I don't even know why I have job on here I I'm not sure if I actually use anything that needs it I suspect the material I probably already has a class that will make this fixed so let's just see if we can add that class before I try to do it on my own or is I know I have the material ID documentation already open air we are in at least one place I probably have it open multiple places do you ever get to that point on your desktop that it's faster just to search just to open a new tab and go to a website than to try to find what website what tab like you already have open with that website in there I said that really awkwardly hopefully made sense but that's where I'm at right now is that I know I have certain websites open but I just don't know where so I end up just opening up opening them up again let's check out the app bar and let's see fixed awesome so we can do position what's the difference between sticky note sticky is not universally supported and we'll fullback the static little bit different options just going to be all right yeah I want to see what the options are okay so stickies experimental all right I remember seeing this before so stickies for everything you know interesting and it falls back to static otherwise let's see what sticky is supported by so position sticky so edge supports it Firefox partially supports it okay not supported on table supported on thn us safari supports it all right let's use to this and sticky because we have pretty good support yeah I like the support on this all right cool if you've never been to can I use calm before it's very very useful supereasy one thing I really like is as soon as you go there your cursors automatically put right here so you soon as it loads you can just start typing and you don't even you know it just searches as you as you go so really simple and fast and you would just immediately know whether or not you know a specific thing in CSS or JavaScript or HTML will work also if you're not using mdn so Mozilla developer Network you should definitely check it out usually as way more information than I need but the examples are super useful so those are if you only take away two things from this stream those two things will be more helpful to you probably than anything else that I do okay and I know I'm not keeping up with the live chat right now in about ten minutes or so I'm gonna check back in the live chat and see what what I've been missing and respond to any questions all right so let's add that in this app bar it's a position yeah it was position so instead of static we're gonna type in sticky give that a save and see what happens alright nothing so far maybe I need to put in some more information what happened to that did I seriously close material UI mister now you can see all my browsing history right temp is from I did I not close it Wow ok I don't know what I did with it easy to get back to the app let's look at the API sticky all right maybe we will go to the demos because it doesn't explain what else I'm it seems to me like there needs to be some other indicator of like when is it supposed to go sticky simply button mmm alright it looks like none of these are sticky yeah these are all position static let me check you're looking for position fig stickies useful phone and bars that are down a bit and stick to the top after you scroll oh that's what the sticky is then nevermind I feel silly now okay I was thinking that sticky would give us something at an option like the app bar would just yeah I don't know what I was thinking thanks sneaky all right let's go to a position fixed I was just excited to use something new I know okay we got to do unexpected but I should have expected it so our content now since the app bar is gone has gone to a fixed position all of our content has now gone up to the top of the page so we need you you think material you I would have already had something to take that into account let's see oh whoa let's check out the layout what's this portal uhhuh that's I haven't seen that component before all right let's let's take a bar and where's our main let's go back to our layout component and this is where we bring in the app bar and then we have everything else falls in this main component here so if we go up to classes main right now it's the only thing we have on there is this flex so what we want to do then is set a margin top yeah I guess margin to work and we want the margin top to be the same height as the a bar but I'd like them to always be I want them to always be the same let's check our app bar component I'm checking to see if we have a height set already I guess we don't it's kind of odd I would have expected that let's go back here and see okay we do have this is that root component which basically is is just a container component here see what we're getting our height from so from somewhere in here then okay so some of our height at least is is set here by this icon to 48 pixels are that makes sense let's see where we can put height at if I'm confusing you right now then hold on just it's going to make a lot of sense once I actually do it assuming that it works and I think it'll be easier to see it then for me to explain it that's interesting okay that's pretty cool and interesting let's see header okay the way this is set up is not gonna make it easy to do to change the height all right let's see you're searching for a component that when I add a height it would actually make make a change all right maybe this is not gonna work out like the way I wanted to work out all right so basically we can have it be fixed and have everything work if we just put a height of 65 on our root component right and what do we do on layout whatever I did on layout I need to change okay all right my timer went off so it's time for me to go to the live chat but we can see we now have our fixed app bar and yeah that definitely needs to be smaller but in any case we have it fixed now okay we've gotten deeper and deeper into this whole of like all I wanted to do is make this centered and it's now become so much more complicated all right let me set a fiveminute timer then and I'm gonna scroll up to the top of the live chat go down I'm gonna try to get to as many comments and questions as I can see Gander 7 says have you seen visual studio live sharing you can code collaboratively between visual studio code and visual studio even even sharing a session code visual studio comm alright as the rest of the URL there okay cool I'll have to check that up I have not used it yet John says I got p.m. today a painting question I answered honestly then I was destroyed with a horrible lashing out so Jessie it's nice to come here where people are civilized oh I'm really sorry that happened to you but yeah I'm never gonna lash out at anyone in Chad even if you said something that made me really mad I would I would still try my best to just be chill about it and I probably just blocked you if I thought that it was harming the the experience in the live chat but anyway I've been trying to be really chill about everything lately not in a live chat in particular obviously in the live chat but just in general especially with my kids because they're all little and so been trying to just be really calm and keep it like a nice tone of voice with you know even if I'm mad so anyway this is definitely a nice calm place to be in so if you're joining us for the first time you might not know that but feel free to ask any questions even no matter how basic you know you think they are nobody's going to get mad at you for it or be mean about it and if they are then if they're really really mean and they won't stop I block them if they're mean though I usually say something you know kind of politely you know tell people to be nice let's see Grimlock er says can I ask which is better for me to study bootstrap or angular I'm still new okay well it looks like you did get some answers already and the answers are pretty good so Joey says bootstrap and angular 2 different types of tools and yeah that's that's a hundred percent correct so bootstrap is for user interface so like design it's basically like a prebuilt design framework that you can use you know they're their components angular is that's hard to explain especially I guess if you're just starting out yeah but basically the the easy answer the quick answer is you can certainly study both at the same time because they do two different things you can use bootstrap with angular you could use it on its own and the same thing you can use angular on its own they do different things so if you'd like to learn them both go ahead if you want to they're learn one or the other that's fine but you you don't use them for the same thing if you want me to go more indepth into the differences please let me know I can do that but I don't want to spend too much time going to the question if if no one's interested in it ah no says I agree with the fixed navigation or a button you can click and it will send you the top that's another good option that's a good option as well if a wonderful interior you I have something like that builtin I know I've done that on other sites I'm not sure I've done it with the react site yet but so I have some code that's probably jQuery that we could maybe adapt to do that or hopefully material I have something like that left to see let me know what y'all think is it better to just have a button that sends you to the top like a very small you know button that would maybe pop up after you scroll so far you know just just maybe in the bottom righthand corner it would pop up or is it better to have that fixed navbar that follows you all the way down let's see John Henson says where make just the hamburger fixed okay just the hamburger icon that's interesting I wonder how that would look Stewart says just close the tabs okay a noble and Savage is all right so if you all remember whenever I was talking about how I had all my tabs open and it's easier just to search for something like in my browser then they have to find the tab that's open a noble site and savage says inspects memory footprint of browser your browsers using 5.3 gigabytes of RAM you laugh at that but if I saw that I wouldn't be surprised at all I think my browser is always the using the most RAM out of anything all right I'm gonna check I only have a few more comments here in the live chat so let me check out a few of these comments before we go back to the code Michael D or G I'm not sure I pronounce the last name there if you let me know I'll try to pronounce it correctly but anyway the question is I just started using material UI version 1 I notice the button element doesn't have an onclick attribute so how do you trigger on click events with a with buttons for Redux actions etc how do i sorry I'm always yawning on these streams I really sorry you know what I'm not I'm not really sure how I handle buttons it's usually they got it you got to be able to use one click with a button right we had to have done this before with something let me think about that we may actually come across a button in the stream today if anybody remembers how we've handled buttons in previous projects please put it in the live chat because I know we've done stuff like that before and we have use on click things so I just can't remember right now if we had any issues with that uhuh Ruben says the handsome comment wasn't a joke you've got a good phenotype I envy that beard alright cool well thank you I appreciate it and yeah well I just I got my beard trimmed yesterday and I got a haircut so it probably looks okay right now normally it I let it go and it gets rid of bushy and wild but right now it's like looks slightly less wild but I said I appreciate the comment though alright so we do have some some other opinions on this navbar so hmm it was the sticky never would look a little nicer small button fading as usuals down alright so maybe we don't go with the fixed navbar I'm getting getting some some opinions against the the fixed navbar here I wanted to see how this looks oh okay so the fix and a bar also messed up some stuff for us here so that was unexpected all right let's go back here and resort layout I don't know where yet yeah this is what we did it let's go back to static save that and verify that this now works no what the heck oh you know we changed some other stuff so that's probably why it's not it's not gonna work all right what else do we change oh yeah so we're getting some there's some more opinions about fixed nav bars being annoying if they're too thick yeah so we could make it thinner or I'm I don't know I'm thinking now maybe we could just avoid having to like deal with this like cascade of issues that we're seeing here if we just go with that button that scroll to top button this also seems like something that could wait until after the presentation so it's probably something that doesn't need to be done right now so I'll just keep in mind to try to find a component that that'll give us that scroll to top or some other solution but I think I've got myself into like too much stuff considering I have a presentation tomorrow I think it's at 1100 a.m. tomorrow what the heck is this healing from why are we importing healing that that stuff my mistake when did that change alright let me just go back hidden there we go I accidentally changed that so alright good okay this is back to normal alright so we're back to normal here we are whoops switch it to here we're right back where we started and that is how do we make this centered all right let me take a drink and let's start over for all of you that are new to the stream one of the biggest features of this stream that makes it stand out from other streams is that I don't rehearse anything so mistakes can and do happen often and this is my everyday work so we worked through the mistakes together I just realized that I also forgot to start my timer again so let's start the timer all right now let's go back to this all right so our mission is get this logo centered on small screens what we're not gonna do is change the we're not we're doing to try to change as little as possible in this app bar okay ha ha Ruben says I heard centering things is half the job of a frontend dev it certainly seems like that today doesn't it all right so let's go back to our app bar component where we actually have this and let's see what we can do let's see if let's see if we can add a set of media queries to the classes that we're already using that that change some of the values that may work so here's what we're gonna do the image itself that's interesting it looks like the link is only on the bottom half of this let's see if that's correct hmm let's let's open this up so I can actually see all right yeah let's go to a new page oh no that did work cool all right I'm not worried about that anymore as I was scrolling through here it looked like the link tag would not work but it did all right so let's start here and let's see we probably already did this I don't think ever actually went through completely with what I was trying to do all right let's see Grimm says isn't center X s /sm MMD large going to work on react alright let's see this button okay all right maybe this will work fishin flex a lineitem Center let's try this justify Content Center awesome okay so if we justify content Center and then we take this and we could probably justify content left didn't take us out far enough you also need to make display flex what is this that we're still off we're slightly off hmm all right let me have some suggestions here in the live chat so Nikki saying instead of justify content use justify item on the thing itself that's what I was looking for just try item okay button justify item Grimm says I love this channel awesome I'm glad to hear it we had a question if I'm using bootstrap reflects Bach flexbox Center works as Center on the logo John says you need to make 100% width or stretch the content yeah now we need Oh all right this is where okay so I don't need that justify items that's what I thought it's not doing anything anymore okay all right Nikki says okay I think I got I got it I think all right awesome let's see what's what's happening here uhhuh yes my boss just sent me an image to use instead of that cute little puppy cool it's a cool image all right awesome so after we fix this I'm gonna put that image in alright do you justify items flex start on the hamburger container okay uh neighbor container and then on the locator this fan okay so on this one will do justify items center all right dad that didn't do anything for me but it's possible that I've changed too much other stuff let me give it a refresh to clear out anything else that I've done oh wait sorry justify self okay I'm glad that I caught that before I refreshed it alright so just for self on Center all right still not all right I am gonna refresh cuz I think I've changed too much stuff and I can't remember what I changed which is the danger of dev tools for me it's actually it's good practice for me to frequently put in what I've done in dev tools into the actual code and let's try this again sorry Phoenix Abhishek the bot got you I think for all those emoji so don't worry about it just I guess I guess the butt doesn't like when you put that many emoji in alright it's alright so Nikki let me try to put in what you said before so on the container which I'm assuming is the the button then maybe I'm putting this in the wrong in the wrong part but let's do justify items like start and then on this band justify self Center alright yes so this is not working for me it's possible that I'm putting it in the wrong place though so is it supposed to be both of them self oops all right so on the button now I have justified self flex start and then I also on this pan I have justify self Center and column one needs to be display flex all right so it looks like yeah we have well if you mean this div on iki said it doesn't work sorry for wasting time don't worry about it it's not a waste of time to try out different things alright cool so let's keep trying I apologize if this is getting boring or something but I mean this is there's probably there's using this just to see how how frustrating it can be sometimes to try to get something seemingly so simple to work alright I'm gonna give it one more shot with these different flex properties before we go to actually adjusting the markup all right so jelly has a solution that says it worked so let's if you try my solution on the logos parents pan positionabsolute left 50% transform Saturday okay so the logos parent so let's here let me refresh to get rid of everything we just did all right so here's our logos parent and that's this this I'm assuming what you mean the span and not this 8x I'm gonna go with the span and let's go with positionabsolute and left 50% and then transform translate or translate negative 50% oh it works nice alright let's check it out here let's check out what it's done to us on the larger view yeah so it's done this so we're definitely gonna have to put that into a media query but so we'll figure out at what point we're dropping this stuff so whatever point we're dropping that stuff maybe we could do it or even yeah maybe somewhere around there so I'm guessing that's maybe like the small media query all right cool I like that it almost like it seems a little weird you know that we're doing this to Center it but my viewpoint is this if it works then it's okay as long as it's not causing some weird like performance thing that's that's messed up then I'm fine with that if later on we find a solution that seems like it's a little cleaner great but right now I really like that it works so let's go with that so let me go over here and we'll find that space which I believe that this is our class's flex so let me all right good so we're only using that once so I just want to make sure you aren't gonna mess anything else up so on our classes flex that's where we're gonna put this this media query and what did we do the other one we use the media query somewhere else already did we do it in the app bar a bar menu item maybe we did it here no that wasn't it we didn't do it here did we maybe we used it down here because we are hiding some things down here okay that hidden small and down that's it okay so we use that but there is another place where we use the media query let's see okay you know what there's some sandy keys asking how exactly that works that it would probably a good idea to describe what's going on here so alright so we have this positionabsolute so it's it's taking it out of the flow of you know this is a span that's coming after this element right so we're having trouble centering things like that because it was always trying to center within this area which always would be off this is not taking into account the whole area so when we do positionabsolute that takes it out of the normal flow so now we're you know the whole area is is being you know considered here so within and once we do that we can do this left 50% so let me let me take off transform we've got one at a time alright so positionabsolute gets us now out of the flow then we go left 50% which actually doesn't look too bad let's shrink it down so it can we can see more so that means we're going 50% to the left but it's from this point so this point is 50% over but that's not taking to account the width of this element right because we want the center of this element to be 50% over that's why we do transform translate 50% that pushes the element over this way so negative 50% right that pushes it over half the width of this element which then makes the center the very center of this element if we can imagine a line going right in the center of this logo that centerline would line up exactly with the center line of this whole app bar right so if the site itself had a center line now the logo center line matches up so that's why we did that translate negative 50 so jillee correct me if I'm wrong on any of that but that's that's basically how this works so I really like I mean I know everybody's using flexbox and grid now but this solution is is really nice I think like it makes sense I've definitely used some stuff like that before you know compared to a lot of which you can do now with grid and flexbox it seems like we shouldn't have to go through all that but like the logic is you know it does make sense and and it definitely works so thanks again Joey all right so where was okay we need to actually do this but only for small screens so I need to see let me check in material UI documentation since I can't find it in our code we need let's go to CSS and J s and let's use there we are theme breakpoints great let's pull this out and we'll do let's go to that flex element and we're gonna add in a theme break point and let's try small I'm assuming small as SM seems reasonable and let's go now to display wow it's given me display absolute and then we're gonna go left 50% and transform translate and it's going to be negative 50% alright let's save that see what we have mm all right not exactly working out you know because we still had that in dev tools let's refresh in Syria okay not working I messed up something display what did I mess up what did I mess up make points down did I set that opposite no it's work working uh maybe this is something wrong display no I put display instead of position right position there we are Oh John I see you you had that too and Michael so hey Joey haha everybody got that good job alright so let's see where that breakpoint is gonna hit great that's perfect we it's not so flike fast so you're gonna have some like a second where it it goes over I'm not worried about that I mean if anybody is doing this stuff like I am then they're probably a developer so they will understand awesome oh that's so cool it works very cool a hover height Joey tags in caps and got banned for five seconds from the from the but it's fun that we have a bot in here now all right so my timer just went up and that's awesome just in time to get that centered I'm gonna be honest I really expected that we would get more done today than just this Oh woah it happens all right so let me look in the latch at answer some questions and we'll see what time it is after that maybe I'll put in the new image maybe not we'll see see how it goes all right where did I leave off okay maybe there's not a lot of question I'm not finding a lot of questions here so it might not be be too much more to talk about in this train all right here's a question so Pruthvi p or you d hv i not sure to pronounce that please correct me if i was wrong but anyway the question is why is reacts so useful i know what reuses components like recyclerview and java i mean we can simply copy and paste component code again yeah you're right we can copy and paste again but I think like in a bigger like in a bigger app you don't want to be copy and pasting a lot of stuff right it saves you a lot of time and then you know when you have everything split out into components it's really nice to be able to reuse them and it's not just about copy and pasting I mean you can do things like this where you know when we do this list this is the list card component we pass in an array right and we map over the array items and we could have you know 500 you know items and all being being rendered and we only did this one time so right now I have this list data component so all the data lives here you know in a JavaScript array but we could this is just some kind of test data for the presentation tomorrow but we could be pulling this from a database somewhere and send it right in here and now from one component we could have just rendered you know as I said before 500 or whatever however many you want so I think that's that that makes it more clear about the benefit of using components so maybe I'm misunderstanding the question but hopefully that makes it a bit more clear you know you definitely wouldn't want to actually put all of this data in and then copy and paste this 500 times right that would be it would be a lot of code and it would take a long time and then if somebody you needed to come in here and make an edit you know that'd be kind of a mess anyway so that's as I see it that's one of the benefits of using react and it's not like other systems don't do this in their own way it's not unique to react but it's definitely ate a benefit let's see the Johnny plays asks what programming language is this this is JavaScript in particular though we're using react which is a JavaScript library that it looks like a mix of HTML and JavaScript it's not really this is like some syntactic sugar really it's JSX right I believe it's called JSX when you it looks like the HTML tags when reality all this is or you know this is JavaScript functions so each time you see a tag like this really what's happening is it's creating a new element like you could do normally in JavaScript San Bay says I like your radio do you mean the the free coke amp radio that's going on 24/7 now yeah it's pretty cool if you all haven't checked it out yet I mean I'm sure you've seen it on the channel now we have this this radio station and all the songs are created by free code camp members I don't release it members like it's not like we pay a membership fee or anything but created by by people who are in you know free code camp so it's pretty cool check it out and then there's a live chat going on every time I've been in there there's been at least like 20 people so it's pretty cool like Quincy was in there for a while talking so you never know who's gonna pop in and talk so it's kind of cool just to listen to while you're doing other things throughout the day Emerson says it's cool to know I'm not alone when working with CSS yeah I mean I personally like CSS but it can definitely be tricky sometimes almost to the end here Gander 7 says I hate data import from system with no validation were you talking about the data I was just saying when I was talking about bringing data in yeah I mean right now I'm not worried about it because this is just test stuff but in general you would want to have some validation I'm a little bit more lenient with that when I have control over all the data where it's coming from so it's way less likely that we're gonna get we use the OK gander 7 says notice what I'm working on ok cool cool all right for some reason Google and my phone keeps thinking that I'm talking to it keeps like popping up saying it doesn't recognize my voice it's just weird but anyway all right I've gotten to the end of the live chat I think I'm gonna take a break now because I feel like I need a break and so I'm not gonna put in the the new image so maybe that'll be a surprise for tomorrow that will unveil the the new header image that are the hero image so I have to say goodbye to the cute puppy and and we'll have an actual image of campus let's see oh ok Jeff Miller says I know you're working on the mobile look now but on a desktop the navbar text is compacted together all right let's take a look at that you know what Jeff I'm not seeing it here could you let me know what browser and device you're looking at that with and also the like the browser version if you could so you can just put it here in the in the chat even if it's after the stream ends they'll still be like a minute or two where you can put it in the chat so maybe it's maybe I'm we're using something that doesn't work in all browsers Nietzsche says put the puppy somewhere as an easter egg he's like a mascot by now I was just thinking that as I was saying we're gonna get rid of it I'm thinking like is there a way to put images in the console so that if somebody opens dev tools will see it if there is I think I should definitely do it all right Jeff's astride an edge and Firefox okay I'll have to test it we're definitely gonna have to do some thorough testing before this goes live I'm okay with not testing it that much before the presentation because I'm gonna be displaying it from you know from my computer and so it should be alright I can control the environment but yeah maybe we'll definitely have to figure out what's going on there all right thanks Jeff for pointing that out and for testing it out and you know various ways all right but anyway I think we had a good stream it took longer to do a little thing that I thought it would but we worked through it and that's always I mean that's a win right even if it took longer that's a win we got it to work it looks awesome and you all helped a lot and 2008 yeah happy Valentine's Day for everybody out there also a happy beginning of Lent its Ash Wednesday so for anybody that I guess it's Catholic or even their non Catholics I think that celebrate Lent I think anyway so in our day that we have both happening on the same day but anyway whatever you're celebrating today I hope you have a great day and I'll see you all back tomorrow hopefully hopefully my meetings gonna don't go too long but I should be back maybe around the same time maybe out 1 p.m. Eastern time tomorrow so I'll see you then
