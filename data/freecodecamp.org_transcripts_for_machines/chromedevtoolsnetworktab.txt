all right I am on the free code Camp homepage and I have opened up the developer tools I did it this time by going to view developer and developer tools came right up and I went to the network tab um so here some stuff was already loaded based on when I opened um when I opened the developer tools and when I refreshed the page if I refresh again you'll notice a whole lot of information what we're most interested in is this network tab here there are all of these different colorcoded things each one of them represents a different item on the page so here on the lower side it actually lists them out like this image which if we right click or if we double click pardon me it comes up and this is the GIF the Googling GIF that it shows so here it shows the timing of everything the content download took the longest it was almost 67 milliseconds um basically this is useful it's colorcoded so once you're comfortable with the colors mean you can really at a quick glance look through and say okay well this item took a really long time what is that and this gift took a lot longer to load than anything else so if your page or your app was taking a really long time to load or to get a request something was taking a long time the network tab could kind of help you figure out exactly what it was if it was the request getting sent out if it was waiting like this one was the reest sent out really fast it was just waiting the content download was quick too so it helps you figure out exactly where the problem is and pinpoint it so you can fix it really quickly just like all my other videos I'm going to tell you go look at the documentation it is awesome it is super helpful and very easy to read and indepth at the same time but what I want you to take away from this video is the network tab is where you can look at how long each part of a request is taking for every single aspect in your web page
