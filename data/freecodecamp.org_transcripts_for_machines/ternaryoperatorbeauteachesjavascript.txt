the ternary operator the ternary or conditional operator is the only javascript operator that takes three operands this operator is basically a shortcut for the if statement it tests the condition and returns one value or expression if it is true and another if it is false so this is the the example so first there's a condition here and then you put a question mark and then you put if this condition is true it's going to return this first expression if it's a false after the colon here you're going to return the second thing let me just give you an example first i'll show you what it would look like with an if statement so we have var h equals 19 if the age is more than or equal to 18 console.log you are an adult else console.log you are a kid so let's run that and we'll see in the console it's saying you're an adult if we change that to 15 and we run that it's going to say you are a kid but there is a different way to do this with a ternary operator so this whole thing right here is the ternary operator first up here you can see the condition this part is the condition if age is more than equal to 18 then you always put the question mark if this is true it's going to print this you're an adult if it's false it's going to print you are a kid so um i'm going to clear the console and then run that again and you were a kid you were a kid so it prince that you were the kid from up here and then down here at princeton you are a kid so this is just a more succinct way of doing something if you just have a simple if else statement but you can also do more than one single operation per case separating them with a comma let me show you an example okay i just pasted this in here if we put another variable stop if the age is more than 18 here's the question mark so this part right here is the condition we have the question mark now this is this whole thing is the first expression after the question mark and you can see we have two statements we have console.log okay you can go and then there's the comma and then we assign stop stop equals false then you have the colon then you have the whole second expression here so before just one line but now it takes multiple lines and you can put the comma here to run two commands in there and the last thing i want to show you was that a ternary operation can be inside another ternary operation so let's scroll up here okay i'm just going to paste this right in there let me adjust this really quick so you can see this all so let's look through this we have a variable a var our first check equals false and then this is the second var second check equals false and then there's of our access now let's look through that we use a ternary operator to to show what access is so this is the condition first check so we're going to try to figure out what this access is going to equal so it first is going to check this first check equals false remember if it's true it goes to the first thing before the colon which is access denied if it's false it goes right after the colon which is this whole statement see after the colon there's a whole nother ternary operator because you can have more than one ternary operator together so now it's going to do this ternary operator it's going to do the second check well we can see that second check is false so if it was if this second check was true it would say access denied because but since it's false when we go after the colon again and it's going to be access granted now let's just check that by doing a console.log and you can see right at the bottom of the console we have access granted also from our previous thing we have sorry you are much too young with the much kind of cut off well thanks for watching my name is beau carnes check the description for a link to the code from this video and remember use your code for good
