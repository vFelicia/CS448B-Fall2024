in this video i will be using vent diagrams to give a graphical representation of the set operators we learned in the previous video so if you recall the definition of a union b you know that a union b equals the set containing elements x such that x is an element of a or x is an element of b so if we let this circle represent the set a and we let this circle represent the set b then that means that x can land anywhere in any of these circles which is why this right the entire region is shaded red we're saying that this red region represents all possible values of x and if we recall the definition of a of a intersection b that equals the set containing elements x such that x is an element of a and x is an element of b which is why the overlap where a and b overlap is is shaded red we're saying all possible values of x are this red region now the set difference of a and b equals the set containing elements x such that x is an element of a and x is also not an element of b which is why it's just this region here none of the elements are within b the set difference of b and a is the set containing elements x such that x is an element of b and x is not an element of a and finally the symmetric difference of a and b i defined as the union of a minus b and b minus a so we take this region in this region and we take the union of it which is why this is the resulting region there's no overlap between the two now this is a really good way to familiarize yourself with the concept of set operators however don't rely on it you should really focus on the definitions as it will help you out in the long term
