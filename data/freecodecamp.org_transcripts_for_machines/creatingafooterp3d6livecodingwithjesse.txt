hey everybody sorry for the delay I didn't I need to see that it is started today I have a different camera so it's still a builtin camera but it's on my second day monitors so the angles a little bit different so I'm gonna have to get used to looking over here but it'll probably work out because this is the monitor that I have the code on so I'm normally looking over here anyway so we'll give it a shot and see if this one works better so now you get to see the other side of my office you see there's my whiteboard that I never use and there's my door I can finally see people walking by and today we're gonna work on the footer which is I think I said that yesterday so not too much of a surprise but I want to work on the footer because that's the next part in the in the structure so yesterday we had said we're using materialised framework and that framework you have within your body you have a a header and then as a sibling component a sibling element you have main and then as the final sibling you have footer so we've already done the header we have main there but there's nothing really in it yet at least nothing visible there's some structure so just some add some elements and there's some divs and things and then we have a footer already but it's not it's not implemented the way we want it so I want to get that finished so the footer looks like it's going to look and then we can start like piece by piece adding things and two main all right let me check the live chat just to say hi before we start okay we do have a question about the what is p3 b6 and I'm Barry to answer that but I want to say that just in case there's anybody else wondering about it they can't see the live shot at the end of the titles of the videos I've been putting like for instance today p3 d6 that just means project three day six just wanted to make it a little bit shorter so that the title of the video wasn't really long in the description I actually write out the whole thing project three day six so if you see that that's what it means it's just kind of way to keep things organized for everyone let me get this off of the screen this was still for the other project so for project two today I added yesterday I added in analytics with react GA and then today I added in some some click some event tracking to track all of our downloads all the logo downloads and the letterhead downloads so that that'll show up as events in Google Analytics occasionally I need to report the stats on how many people are actually downloading things from that resource center so that the head of my department can go and to people higher up and justify the time spent on on the Resource Center see so let's move I make sure I get my windows I think my windows are still the same as they were to the a so we'll be working in here and you saw our dev tools for that and then here's our here's our cup alright great so let me see I said I was gonna check the live shot and I didn't get very far hey everyone a lot of people saying hi okay so we have a question I'll take this question first and then we'll get started on the code code Chandra says hi Jessie I'm unable to create a footer which will be always placed on the bottom of the page why is it happening so you could let me see there are already some responses so let me see what let's see whatever response getting resized okay it looks like I'm not sure how to pronounce it but it's a okole let me know if that's the wrong pronunciation but okole is gonna send a code snippet so so Shandra let me know if that code snippet doesn't work and maybe I can help or maybe at the end during the question and answer I could try to help a little bit or if you need more help maybe message me on Twitter we're gonna see with the footer today it is always gonna stay on the bottom but I'm gonna use materialized framework and it's gonna do that automatically we could take a look though at the CSS when we do it and then you know maybe you'll get an idea about how they do it and that framework and maybe you can apply that so you know it's is the is the video synced up to my to my face I there's like a slight delay and it's weird and I wonder that is really weird to see that I'm gonna try my best not to look at myself so I'm gonna move this over to the other screen that I don't normally look at because it's freaking me out I'm talking and then afterwards I see my my mouth move Darrow asked if I'm using csharp yeah we are using some csharp so we'll see what we don't basically we're editing these these templates so we're not really getting in a lot into directly into the csharp stuff but occasionally we are gonna edit some some of the csharp thing so you can see like you know we have some stuff here that we will be working with but for right now we're gonna go to we're here at the bottom of this main test master let me okay so for some reason Google thought that I was talking to it on my phone I just looked over and I've been having a conversation with the Google assistant inadvertently uhhuh okay so here's our footer section so it's it's not bad we already have it you know as a footer element which is good that's that's what we want for materialized so it's likely that we do have some C where did our main go okay so right now the footer is inside of main so it may be that some of the styles for materialized are getting applied because we have this this footer element but since it's within main I doubt it's it's knowing exactly what it's supposed to do so I'm gonna take this out and I'm gonna take this out as well this comment and then let's put in our footer here and I'm gonna just save that and quickly check before we get started I want to see if that did anything it shouldn't I don't expect it to have any big impact okay great I do want to check to see if any of the materialized styles are already being applied and you know what's if anything's getting overridden let's see so we do have materialized basically the only thing that's supplied now is displayblock and then these are some of the custom styles that's making that border okay so far it doesn't look like we have anything anything that is being overridden I think it's your lives the font size the font size may be different trying to find where the original is it's probably up somewhere and I just missed it but it looks it looks pretty good so so far so good hopefully we don't have a lot of conflicts between the styles but not bad we do have some weird stuff going on down here and hopefully this will work itself out as we we take out this content or at least reformat this content with our are calling classes that we're going to use and materialize so I'm not gonna worry about this yet if we reformat everything and we're still having this problem then we'll dig a little bit deeper and try to figure it out okay so right now we have which is actually it's nice that it's commented like this are left call and it'll call them right but what we need to do is we need to keep these because this the contents being brought in here but we need to remove this article and I'm actually not sure why they chose to use article for that I mean can you all think of any reason why article would be the proper element for for these sections in the footer I don't know that seems it seems a little little odd I just looked at the live chat and john b says without my glasses I don't see sharp so like get it it's because we're doing csharp because I thought it was funny okay so let's do that let's get rid of these articles or at least change them oh well I'm yawning already sorry about that okay so I like this is in the section I might actually get rid of the section I don't think we really need a section inside I know that they're doing it they're splitting out that bottom part of the footer but that's not really how I do the the footers with materialised so let's take a look let's take a look at how we're doing the footer here and we can just copy it and bring it over that that'll probably be the easiest way to do it whoa okay I actually don't want I don't want the social media icons in the footer because we have them in the header and that's in that sticky so the user will always have it there we don't need them down there so I'm gonna take that up and that's gonna make things a lot easier well we'll copy it all first and then then we'll take it out all right let's copy that and let's put it below for now and we'll take we don't need we have the copyright for the icons in the top nav already so we don't need that where's our social okay so everything here in our social div will get rid of aand I was using inline SVG's for that see that's why there's all these these numbers if you haven't used those before I really like them for things like social media icons because you can see that the path for the SVG is not really that long I mean if you there are some SPG's that are like pages long but in this case it's not it's not really a big deal to just pop that in there you don't have to load something else into the page so I like to use them whenever I can alright so you can see now instead of having a section I just have this this class footer copyright container so what we're gonna do for the copyright date I am gonna change it to 2017 but if you remember in our our JavaScript file our custom javascript file that we brought over from our demo site it had a little function in there that kept this up to date so we don't have to worry about bringing that in so I'm gonna leave that there I like this so I'm not gonna worry if we look here about this part I don't think I'm gonna worry about that we might try to bring some of that in but the things that are gonna go down there are not likely to change you know this is is probably never going to change so we do need to worry about you know some of these links but I'm not exactly sure where I want them because these are a lot of links we'll see I haven't decided yet exactly what I want to do with that so for now I'm gonna leave it out to relieve that just as is the universities address and phone number and email it's not likely to change so I'm gonna keep it how I have it because I'm using you know this the schema so I doubt that that's in use right now we can double check it no these are just P tags so I mean it actually they do have it in an address so it's not it's not too bad but we could I guess we could add the slogan if we really want to so for now we're not going to bring in this what is it the left we're not gonna bring that in either but we are gonna bring in these two it's possible that the wording and the links in here would change we are working on a new application so I'm doing the frontend for that in terms of basically just making it look nicer so when that launches we will need to change this link so I'd like this to be changeable from the CMS okay all right so let's pull that in going the wrong way all right I forgot to start my timer again this is two days in a row all right I'm just gonna keep a look let's see what time it is on the floor all right I'm gonna set a 10minute timer then and I have this let's throw this in here so we can see it when we go to check that okay after the 10 minutes is up then I'll take a fiveminute break and I'll answer some questions let's see let's grab this like to see the structure so this is what comes out so we have an H to a P tag and then a class that's about I don't like that I I would really love to find the template for the buttons so that we could just automatically have the materialized style buttons apply we could put in the right classes for now I'm not going to worry about it but I think that would be nice we you know we could always add some classes to our CSS and just use whatever whatever they have here in terms of classes but I think it would be it would be nicer if we could just find this template and then have it apply you know throughout and not not have to you know mess with modifying the classes in materialise okay not really sure I would go with h2s here but we'll just we'll leave it at that for now okay so we're keeping that address see why am i I guess I only had alright I see I had the logo of large size and then the address here okay how are the make sense alright so let's keep maybe we can change this structure a bit let's I get I guess we'll keep this structure for now in terms of just three columns logo and address over here okay so we're gonna change this to and now this logo is not gonna show up immediately I didn't bring this over yet so we're definitely getting an error on this at first or so changes to an M for the column classes and materialise are based on 12 so you can see on small screen so as 12 this means it'll be full width on 12 or on small screens on medium screens and up it will take up four of the twelve columns which means they'll end up being three columns right so 12 divided by 4 is 3 so that's how we handle our columns let's grab this let's try to put this on top of here and just see how how large that becomes and I may have to change this too to match the h2s that are gonna come in I may be able I'm not sure how those h2s are getting in there if there's like a WYSIWYG editor and there's manually been h2s put in there or if it's a template that pulls the title and of that piece of content and puts it in h2 so we may be able to change that and just make them all h5 we'll see all right so now that that's out I'm gonna take this and all within the same row this is not giving me the corresponding div I don't like all right okay so let's put two more columns there and now we can take our content so use this content and put this in here and we'll take a right column content and put it in here in our last call on and I want to completely get rid of everything in this footer actually I want to see I can't want to see what's in there right now so let's let's put this in here it's gonna look really weird at first but I just want to see how it how it comes out I see what we can do with it save that and then let's let's check it out there we go I'm gonna keep an eye on that timer whoa okay so it's looking for this content block this footer Left content block that we got rid of so let's go into that csharp file and see if see if it's in there yeah footer left okay let's get rid of that so we'll just comment it out for now and see if that fixes it mmm okay not yet there we go that should be it I don't think it's referenced anywhere else all right whoahaha very different okay so this is the default color I wonder what size image I'm loading in there that keeps taking quite a while off to doublecheck on that okay so definitely need some need some work right we don't want the shadows here or this font so definitely don't want this color these buttons don't aren't how we want then let's check out down here down here we didn't have any of the any of these other links that I thought we would get you can see here we're getting all of this but that did not show up let's see interesting okay well that explains why it was getting styled differently before is that it's inside of an Ave okay still not sure why it's not okay so the timer's probably almost you can see things are looking a little bit weird right now we'll just have to fix up the Styles a bit and figure out what where those links were coming in at the ones way at the bottom of the footer and see if we can get them back preferably in a format that's not in a nav I'm gonna take a five minute break to answer questions check out the live chat and then we'll do another Pomodoro session we do at least one more session and then we'll see what time it is if yeah we'll do one more session for sure and we'll just see how it's going I kind of think what we can get this to the point where it looks pretty good with one more okay a spar spar willsez so that's a copy and paste SVG yes yeah for sure yeah you just copy it the SVG's put them right in there in that case for those social media icons I got them from someone's code pen which I did a tribute where I got them that it's not in this file it's in the other file so I have the big they had a big thing in their code pen saying if you use these icons make sure you include this you know in your in your code so I did andreas Larsen and I think thank you that's who did it so anyway they're really nice very small SVG's for other icons for my material icons I just go to the material icon website look up the one I want and then you can get them either as a ping or an SVG or a font icon and I just grabbed the SVG it's a it's a similar thing really small SVG snippet you just put them right in the project all right Blake Thomas says does anybody here know PHP I know a little bit of PHP so I'm not really sure if you have a question about it about something specific in PHP you could let me know I'll do my best but I'm not really confident that I could give you a great answer because I don't use PHP frequently how Rowan says was busy last week looks like things have changed says whoa vs code live cam view asp.net yeah it's very deep if you've been gone for two weeks things have changed so to two weeks ago we were using atom and react and we had no live live video so I know they're gone so we had no live video of my face definitely a little bit different now hopefully the next project is back to react I'd like to get back to react this is cool it's kind of fun to do something different but I don't know that this is really expanding my my skills and in a way that is the most efficient way to get better you know trying to learn some legacy stuff that I don't know yeah the odds of me having to use this even at this job in the future a really small let alone at another job but a lot of the basic stuff like the HTML CSS that's the same everywhere so it's not like I'm not you're practicing my skills at all cool John Hansen says SVG SVG Oh on github is a great node tool that will make an SVG SVG files small enough to paste in line awesome I'm just looking for questions here okay so blank who asked about PHP earlier says I'm trying to set up a wordpress website for a nonprofit but the WP style guide slash template they have has an error I can't figure it out okay okay so it looks like John B's gonna work on that error let us know okay it looks it looks like Blake just pulled it up the website and now it works so it didn't work this morning and not work so that's cool when that happens I mean you always wish you knew what the problem was but if it works and it keeps working then that's that's awesome okay so I got to the bottom of the live chat and the timer just went off so let's start this up again let's see if we can get this footer finished and one more Pomodoro session alright first things first I want to find out where these links are the styling stuff is gonna be no problem the links I'm not really sure what's going on with that so let's tackle that one first so I think I'll bring up so this is our main test master I'm going to bring up the normal main dot master and go down to the footer since we took out a lot of stuff from the footer I want to see how it was initially oh I see now it looks like did we have it looks like we had multiple things here in this this copyright section and I did not grab them I just took them all out so which one did I grab let's see I grabbed this one and I don't think this has anything we need so I'm gonna take that out and instead I'm gonna bring in alright we don't need the social icons this looks like what we need this footer menu so like I said already I don't like that this is a nav we'll see what it looks like I don't think it's gonna look good we may just have to hard code those links in and if they need changed I'll just have to do it I don't think that's really a big deal those links if they're changed at all it's once a year I'm fine with taking five minutes once a year to come in here and change that oh my god all right so let's see hey Kix I expect this to look terrible whoa okay I took out the footer copyright so that's why we're getting that error again let's take this outside accidentally edit it because that's that was the live site so let's take out this footer copyright and I'm just gonna remove it up here yeah we should be good okay All Right see ya we're getting we're getting this in here we're also getting no we're getting that did I leave something in that I should not have maybe I need to put in the the HTML code for copyright so I'm looking that up on looking that up on my other screen it's actually really really nice it came up right in Google search I don't even have to click anything it was just right at the top so let's make sure that that was the problem and that it fixed it yep that fixed it okay cool so we have the correct copyright symbol now we have these I guess we have two options option one is we just add in some really specific styles to make this look how we want it to look option two we hardcode them let's just check out what's going on with the styles quickly in dev tools see how hard it would be I think the fastest thing at this point would be to hardcode them but we'll need our nav let's take out some of the stuff from the nav it's gonna mess up our top nav briefly but okay yeah I guess we could take all that out now I'm just I'm gonna hard coat it they said it's only for links you know directions won't change privacy policy probably won't change contact us won't change the nondiscrimination statement I don't the privacy policy and nondiscrimination statement are the only things that might change I'm not really sure if these have to change here to here or not so let's see how we want to do this probably I think what I'd like to do is have the copyright on this side and then have the links over here at the bottom then when the screen gets smaller we may we just maybe stack them on small screens yeah yeah we'll stack them yeah it's really think I will do this I'd rather have the links on top let's see here so here so I want to do this we're gonna take this out and we'll add inside this container we're gonna put this inside I'm gonna make a row did first then class and then row so this is this is how you set things up and materialize and I really need to get some plugins here for Visual Studio code how's it look used to Adam just like automatically writing most of my code for me then we need two columns it's going to be s12 m6 so two columns let's take this and we'll put that in the first column and then within our second column we're going to need we'll just do a ul that'd be the best way yeah we'll do a ul and we had four lengths only for allies okay so for now I'm just gonna put the names I don't remember what they were contact us privacy policy directions I mean it's moving it okay now let's say that see what it looks like definitely gonna have you know work on this this ul but at least we'll get an idea of what what we have oops I'm gonna do it over to the other screen okay all right so we want want that's our okay I didn't realize this until now so Rho is some you know we get that class with materialized but it looks like the site had already had some styles that were on row here so was giving it a width of 100% and a max width of 960 pixels so I do not want that you see that was our problem here so this is closer to what we're gonna want and so you don't really need that let's let's make sure we we override these in our and a new new design so let's just I guess we can set with two Auto and Max with we do max with none is that valid yeah it looks like that works okay so let's find that now and make those changes so Jess and up here for right now we don't I'm not very organized all right see you just want to try to cancel out what was already being done let's refresh oops let's see what we have going on with a row okay great so that's their awesome so now we can we can put our our styles here we already have some footer styles down here so let's just put it put it down here with that what do we have this in footer I guess we don't I want to be really specific so let's go I want to be specific just in case we put we ever put a list up in that top portion of the footer I want it I don't want to have to worry about that list being horizontal instead of vertical which is what you would normally think when you did a list so that's why I want to be specific and make sure this is in footer copyright so what do we have we just put a float on it for now float and I think I had said float left but I think we should float it right okay all right great actually this is in a different order that okay if I float it left we do get it in the right order at least let's see how that looks all right let's see what right looks like again I don't know that I could even sell the difference oh yeah it looks like it really would have only moved slightly over one way to the other so if we had it to the right or to the left so I think it doesn't matter here if it would have been a more significant shift over to the right I would have floated right and then just changed the order so it ended up being in the right order but for now I think left will be fine and that will save us from having to change the order and right we don't really have see that much of a shift you can see here you know it really hasn't shifted too much just a few pick I mean that's maybe 10 pixels of a difference okay we didn't need to add some padding here so let's add padding will add the padding to the left and that'll that'll help at least not shift it even more over than we needed to otherwise I probably would have added it right whoops we go eight pixels and mmhm let's see how this look we definitely need this to be white there we go now we can see it better all right I'd like that maybe a little bit more space in here but I'm not I think it's fine all right for these links at the footer that most people will never even see I don't think it's I don't think it's expected to have you know a lot of space around here so but looks okay for now I didn't like the fact that you know very early on it goes down like this so what I think I may do and I want to doublecheck this now what I think I may do is change the column widths so that this has more space so let's do that now and let's make this let's see how wide we can get away with so let's make that a nine we'll make this a three this might be too much but we'll give it a shot yeah yeah I think that's too much as you could see with you know automatically this goes on to two lines all right so let's go for should be fine then we also want to make sure that we we put in the rest of that CSS that we had just put in here so we need a color and then padding left at 10 pixels okay I want to check my timer all right just under four minutes and whoops and I never changed this back this needs to be left oh that actually that that's interesting so since I changed the column classes this actually is a much larger shift so we may have to end up going back to our padding right or our float right but what this does give us is that you know we can come to a much smaller size without having these wrap you know I don't we're not gonna be able to have it so that you know either one rats unless we go you know that's we stack them really early on as you can see the other alternative to is right now these are in a container we could potentially expand this out and give them the full width of the page normally I don't like to do that I think it looks nicer if we keep that in line here but in this case we have a lot to go in here so that's that's also an option you see see what we can do in two minutes here let's at least get let's get this this background the right color at the very least I want to see what div that is applied to okay the page page footer okay so it's on the footer so and put it right here this should work background color you know to 1/4 1/2 a that's the green color okay definitely don't want this text to be black and we want to change these fonts and you know we would normally have the logo here as well so this contact would be down a bit farther and then we'd have the logo and this now that I look at this it might make more sense to flip this around a bit this section looks shorter than this section we'll have to see I guess that's not really important right now you know this could potentially change also I don't think I want this centered like I'd rather have it aligned differently so just some little things for the most part everything's working fine now with this footer we're pulling in this data here from the CMS and this data here as well we've hardcoded this and it just needs a bit of adjustment we do need to make some decisions about how these what we want to do whether or not we want them to wrap onto another line or whether we just want to have them stack you know kind of early on I don't know I don't like to have a really tall copyright area here but in this case in this case we might it might actually look better to just stack them right off the bat you know we got a lot going on here and then then we'd be able to give this a little bit more space yeah maybe I'll do that so I've got some decisions to make on this and maybe we'll make them together tomorrow we'll see how far I get between now and then okay so my timer went off and I think Thomas yeah I think I'm going to do questions now and and then we'll finish up after questions so if anybody is not interested in sticking around for the questions thank you for watching and please join us again sometime if you can't stick around that would be awesome if you have a question please put it in the live chat now and even if you don't have a question please stick around if you can and hope to answer some of these questions alright so I'm gonna try to scroll up and find where I left off and I'm just gonna keep going down from there and I'll get to I'll get to all the questions today definitely have time for that okay I think I found it here oh okay so John B says if you type in dot row Visual Studio code will automatically make it a div for you by default the s code has Emmet installed by default oh I did not know that that's really cool also can do the same for ID I want to try that out right now and that'll help me remember it better as well but let's let's try it out so and then oh that's so cool John B that's the that's the tip of the day okay so if if you use Visual Studio code try that out I'm trying to think what else you can do with Emmet can't you do stuff like with L eyes oh yes you can oh man let's try this you know that didn't work how do you do the u.s. shoot I thought there was some way that you could just do you could do it like a string but anyway that's really cool and then with the ID so cool now that now I'm just playing around here let's see if I can do okay let's try this again in the house very nice that's really cool thank you thank you for that that's that's awesome now I'm gonna have to look I haven't done anything with Emmet I remember I did some tutorials with it a long time ago like the years ago and I don't remember much now I'm gonna have to check it out again okay John B says waited that's where HTML files may not work for master well actually so this isn't really an HTML file but I set it to treat it like an HTML file so I think that's why it ends up working okay and he mentioned you have to press tab right so when I was doing that I pressed tab when I was done typing and that's then it then it did that John Hanson said don't bring that footer up on the screen too often the colors are burning my eyes yeah that was pretty bad for her little Wow okay rowan says there's an asp net helper package cool I will have to try that oh is lint I'm not sure I pronounces so this means I don't know I'm really sorry zi z Li and I and the za so sorry I was having trouble pronouncing that but anyway says to use flexbox instead of floats john hanson commented that flexbox won't do much here since there's a column framework set up yeah so the column framework would do what we wanted here pretty much otherwise I probably would try to use flexbox in particular I would it would be cool to use being able to reorder things on different screen sizes would be good because I want right I want the copyright to be on the left in the menu to be on the right but then on a small screen size I want him to flip positions so that the copyright goes on the bottom right in the second place which normally is in the first so you can do that easily with flexbox anyway we'll see I'm undecided exactly how I'm going to do that nobody says thanks for the streaming you're welcome I appreciate you saying that okay Shay says any specific design inspiration for this project beyond the university style guides style guidelines no I don't really have I mean it's gonna be just basically along the style guidelines but uh so I'll talk a little bit about kind of what I'm going for I would like it to be for this middle section to have large full width sections of of content I mean pizza there's gonna be some space on the sides on on really large screens you know obviously but right now you can see it has kind of this split nice there's all these sections and it split up into three columns excuse me I just can't quit yawning sorry to everyone if I'm making you yawn out there I know it's contagious but we have this occasionally it's broken up by things like this but I want to get rid of all that and just have you know sections no no big columns like this so within one section maybe I'll have some columns depending on if the content makes sense to be in columns but I would I would rather have kind of a progression of ideas you know some web pages it's almost like it tells a story about something as you scroll down right now I just don't feel that we're we're telling a story I think that these you know the sections are in here and could be flipped around you know the about could definitely be elsewhere right academics admissions I mean these these don't have to be in this order they could be flipped around I think and still be be fine these could be in any order so I'd like to try to have it in some you know more of an order you know right here it's gonna probably say apply and then we have donate here so if somebody who knows what they want to do already they're gonna be able to do it but otherwise once they scroll we're gonna tell them the story about the University and once they get to the bottom then we can give them another call to action to either apply or donate or learn more but I want it to be less words and more targeted more intentional about what we want users to know right now there's just so much going on here if someone just came here for the first time and knew almost nothing about the University I think it would just be an overload of you know what what's this you know what is it really about on this page it just seems like there's just so much so much information it's hard to pick out what the most important information is so that's kind of my you know beyond just the basic design that's that's my inspiration for just kind of the flow I wonder if this might be I guess somewhat of a good visual example I don't know I think I've shown this before but this is a sight I did last year at some point it has it's it's a little bit different right it's not it hasn't some of the same elements to it but this is a like a building development that the University is doing so that it's gonna have a hotel with restaurants and things so thanks for the students to do things for visitors to the University to be able to stay there you know close to the school but in in this it's there's way less text right a lot less text it's clear for each section what you can do this is kind of what I'm going for something more clean it's not gonna be like this where we just switch back and forth there is actually not really a lot of content when I made this the the hotel wasn't even open yet and there were no restaurants there so there wasn't a lot going on so like we don't even have a tab for dining right now it was built but we didn't have any restaurants yet so I'll add that in we may be actually working on this project at some point to update it the restaurant the first restaurants are supposed to open in October but you know for instance like the hotel page kind of a similar thing you can book right away you know or we can tell you what you want to see so obviously we want to sell the Suites right and it's not it the hotel's run by another company in the university doesn't directly run it but we want to showcase the Suites right off the bat right they're the most expensive thing we want to sell that then we drop down to the rooms and at that point we say hey do you want to you want to book online now right so you give another chance and then we show you know even more stuff so that's kind of the flow that I'm going for just kind of like a a more thoughtout approach to if somebody's coming here what do we want to tell them and what order do we want to tell them and then what actions do we want it to be very easy for them to take you know what information should be really easy for them to get to so anyway I know I went on a lot for that but that's kind of my my goal for this site now I don't have full reign over this site you know being the main site for the university obviously there's a lot of people that want to have a say and what goes on here so I'm gonna try my best and inflate as much as I can to try to just strip as much content out of that homepage as I possibly can I don't care if interior pages are loaded with content if somebody clicks to learn more I'll give them pages of content right because they've already the desire they want to learn more so I'll give them what they want to give you know a ton of text content but on the homepage I don't want to flood it with content you know to everything so we'll see how much I can I can do here we'll see I actually just had a meeting with my boss earlier it was kind of just not really planned but I showed him what was going on so far and he shared with me his vision for the complete redesign when we completely redo the site you know hopefully sometime you know next year or so and it's gonna be very very different so that's going to be cool I guess just to give you a small heads up it's gonna be it's gonna look almost more like a social media platform than a university like website users gonna have a lot of control over what content they see right off the bat which i think is always good it's gonna be a lot of base based on cards and being able to sift through category content having a really good search function so it's going to be very different I'm excited about it it's definitely going to be react the CMS will maybe be WordPress unless I can find something else that I like better and we'll pull it in through the API I'd actually really much rather have a graph QL instead of just a regular REST API but anyway it'll be really different so that's the cool project that be looking forward to and if if Quincy from you know free cook camp wants me to still stream at that point when I'm doing this project then I'll definitely be streaming it otherwise if I get kicked off of this channel which I have no reason to believe that I would but just in case I think I can always stream it on my own channel because that'll be a really cool project alright let me get an X next question anyway that was a cool question Shay thanks thanks for asking that I it was kind of wide open it allowed me to talk a lot but I have thought quite a bit about what I do with this site I had the chance okay cool so alright check this out I'm getting some stuff in the live chat about how to use Emmet and let's see oops dang it I messed it up Wow check that out that's awesome so it's just made a ul with five allies and then nested inside are a tags with the href very cool very cool so I think basically if you if you do this whoops then you can you can nest things so it's this symbol that's the one is that the greater than symbol does it that's really cool wrong it says it's like a baby getting a new to it yeah for sure I'm really excited enough Oh shaeeah says someone made a simple Emmett cheat sheet it's got somebody had to it mate it's got to be out there somewhere and John Hanson said if you use pug it's even easier than those HTML shortcuts yeah I haven't you well I use try think well last time I use I did attempt to use pod but at one point back in the day it might have still been called Jade at that point so if you're familiar with Jade templates plug it plug is Jade they they just had to change their name because some company owns the rights to use the word Jade as their company name so so they had to change the pug okay so these so I'm gonna say Zn 4zo I and IND za since I can't figure out how to pronounce that so zns can you explain the master thing alright so these files that's that r dot master I think now correct me if I'm wrong for you all that they know more about this I think these are like the the asp.net template files so yes let's see but they are this is like the top level so anything that's dot master is like this is the top level so you can see it has you know the HTML tag right so everything else all these other template files these dot aspx templates they all feed into this one right so there are actually several masters but a page can only have one master file so that's this the top level little template that would be like the index dot JSP is or something we get that would be the page write that in your page component so that's that's what master that dot master means in this context I have no idea if that's just specific to this content management system the Ektron CMS or if that's something that is in all asp.net things i don't know enough about it to know whether or not that's the case but that's basically what the dot master means as far as I know Theo says I can't quite understand what you use a CMS system for in which situations is it necessary to take advantage of one is having a database with the REST API not enough or is it a totally different thing okay so when I if I'm developing a small website where I'm going to be the only one editing it I don't bother with a CMS I usually only even bought it with with a database if I don't need one I just edit you know the the HTML directly if someone else needs to edit it I almost always use a CMS of some sort usually WordPress because it's it's pretty user friendly there's a lot of documentation and tutorials out there for people learn how to use it because I can't always be the person that changes things my day would just be filled up with changing things on all the different websites that we have or it's if it's for a client and it's just a contract thing and then I won't really see or talk to them ever again they need to be able to edit it on their own so that's why I like a CMS because it allows them to go in and with the WYSIWYG editor just kind of be able to have some control over the content on their website now if there are situations where website would be bigger and I might still be the person that's going to be doing most of the editing or other people who maybe know a little bit more who don't need the WYSIWYG editor at that point potentially I would want to maybe just do a database with the REST API or graph QL or something and not bother about a fullon CMS maybe just something really lightweight maybe even something and just make you know make myself so that's kind of it just really depends on who is going to be doing the updating of the content and what is their skill level that's how I determine whether or not I need a CMS okay so no beer is giving me some help in pronouncing ice let me try this Zillah ninda nimza some saline ins I feel so silly alright I'll work on it okay John B says on the point of the colors for the footer like the greens and such why not save them into CSS variables instead of constantly remembering the hex values you define the variables in root then define the colors with two dashes so main color you want to call it okay yeah actually I haven't used the the CSS variable is yet what's the support for those can I use them in a in a browser yet so I don't know if I can then I'll learn how to use them normally I use sass and I do say things as sass variables in this case I I have that green hex color memorized so I almost always just type it in because I'm I remember it because I've used it so often with the other colors though it would be helpful to just have them saved in variables so assuming that I can use the CSS variables and it if it has good browser coverage then all you know I'll use them okay cool so che che says this is a follow up when che asked earlier about my plan for the website so here's a follow up to that Shay says I like the website plan is the site more for potential students or maybe alumni rather than current students or are you thinking that they will know to use the menu to navigate to a student page yeah okay so this is the really tricky thing the so I mentioned several times before that I was not working here when the current website was designed and developed but I have heard a lot about the process and one of the things that happen in the process which it makes sense that this would happen is that everybody wanted in on the website so like the people from student life wanted a lot of things on the websites for current students right certainly the people who are in charge of getting donations wanted a lot of stuff on there geared towards donors people in admissions wanted a lot of things on there geared towards potential students and we have other things too like we put on a lot of conferences for adults and for youth certainly conferences one of their stuff on there and we have like pilgrimages that we sponsors so people go like you know like to the holy land or to Rome or something like that you know different places and we help organize those trips they certainly want so everybody wanted something on there that's why the current site has so much on there right every department within you know that the academic side of things every department wanted to be on there so that was really difficult so what since I since I've got here I've frequently brought up you know as often as I can in meetings that we need to focus on like what is our target audience I realize we're gonna have a lot of different people coming to the site but what do we really want to focus on and I think we've narrowed it down to prospective students as our number one focus and then as our number two focus close close behind our donors everything else is is secondary right so we want to still provide information about all the other stuff but that's gonna be secondary so that's going to be the main focus of the site so that's why it's it's somewhat reflected already and I didn't put it in here but I think I mentioned earlier this is going to say apply and this is donate so wait so what happens the main calltoaction apply and then up here we have the donate button and then down farther in the page maybe at the bottom maybe somewhere in the middle we'll probably have another at least one other spot where students can apply or fill out maybe an inquiry form and let us know that they're they're thinking about coming to school here and then you know throughout we can mention other things as it comes in I'm you know we'll certainly probably mentioned some of the awesome academic programs that we have going on or like we have a really cool study abroad program where students go to Austria and they live in like this I don't think I think I have a picture right right here like this isn't a stock photo these are our students in Austria and they live back here in this big building so it's some really old church with like a monastery type of thing in the same way with all these mission trips they take this is actually our student I assume she's in the nursing program she has the stethoscope but there's lots of cool stuff going on that we're definitely gonna want to put in there but we don't need to tell the entire story of what's going on we'll save that for interior pages so I think the goal the main goal is gonna be and this isn't really gonna be fall on me my boss is probably going to have to do a lot of the work of convincing people why we need to build a site this way and then I'll just provide support as much as I can probably in the form of a lot of data that as much data as I can to show that this will result in you know more students and more donations but the main thing is just going to be fencing you know convincing people to be on board with this and to not be too upset about stripping out content because I imagine there's going to be people that will be upset you know for instance you know look at all this content some people are going to be upset if they're no longer mentioned right we have a lot of text here and it mentions a lot of different programs we can't keep all of these in here right so yes whoever's in charge of you know this particular program are they going to be upset I maybe I don't know so anyway if there's going to be a lot of stuff that's not even necessarily as anything to do with web development that's just gonna have to be dealt with so to answer your question I know I went you know above and beyond what your original question was to answer the question potential students are the main audience but we're gonna keep in mind that they're gonna be alumni and and other donors that are going to be coming here and we want to give them something too so we'll definitely want to highlight for the students in for the donors we want to highlight some really awesome stuff that's going on here at the University so that it would appeal to both audiences as much as possible and we already have a site for our donors a separate site that we can send them to as well so we don't need to say everything on this page but maybe just a little bit and be able to send people to the right place let's see and we do already have some like some web sites that are just like onepage websites that have information about a specific program that we send people to from like Facebook ads and things like that they go to that one page thing and it really focuses just on that particular academic program just for students who are really interested in that you know sometimes we'll email students who said they're interested in let's say nursing or let's say counseling because I did a site for the counseling they can go right to that site they have a whole website dedicated just to that program and then if they want more info they can come to this site and get pages and pages of info but we're still gonna be doing things like that as well and that takes some of the pressure off of this main page to not have to cover everything but yet quite a lot of discussion and thought has gone into this already and we're it's been I've been wanting to redesign this since before I even got the job here John Henson says the original homepage has a 90 style bombardment of too much content yeah oh yeah I agree I it is is just way too much I mean I've I've looked at this web page for probably hours working here and I don't think I've ever read everything on here you know like I don't have any data on this would probably be cool to get the data and get a heat map but I would guess that the percentage of people that get to this point and the site is probably in the in the single digits of you know people that actually scroll all the way down there I mean especially can you imagine on a phone how long of a scroll this is you know we'll shrink this up I mean this is quite a scroll and really it's because this text is just so so tiny it makes it a little bit better scroll wise but you can't read that I mean that's that's extremely small I'm sure it's small for you all trying to watch on YouTube but even for me trying to look at it I got to put my face close to the screen to see that so I mean I I kind of feel like there's some shortcuts here in terms of font size that it shouldn't be like this font should be at least double the size which would make this page quite a bit longer so not only do we need to get rid of text but we need to increase the font size for readability like nobody's gonna you know try to read that I have to try to zoom in just to see it alright let me go let me get through some more of these questions oh cool Patrick hey Patrick how's it going I don't think Patrick did you get here later what I don't think I've seen you say anything the whole time but Patrick came through with a Emmett cheat sheet so Doc's Emmett do too EMM i ET EMM ET so Doc's Emmett I owe slash cheat sheet that's cheat sheet so check that out no beer says can anyone suggest to me how to edit blogger website says please thanks in advance I've never used blogger so I don't know I don't really know how how to edit that if they give you access to be able to edit the HTML and CSS and JavaScript I would assume that would work you know just like any page but I'm not sure I guess it depends on what you wish you have access to okay so Rohan says the next edge release will have full support for CSS variables iOS already has it wow that's interesting I've always had trouble with with iOS with different things not being supported so that's that's really interesting okay I'll have to check check that out more let's see actually try right now can I use see if they have anything all right so CSS variables obviously in our Explorer 11 doesn't have that edge has partial support but it will be nice chromis I had no idea that they were this well supported the last time I last time I even thought about him I was watching a talk about them in I guess the talk was maybe it was a little bit older because the way they were talking about it was like no one supports them yet that's really cool though maybe I have to try it out okay hamed says so I'm like a fool beginner learning Python but I also want to learn the ropes of web development what resource should I go to I would say check out free code camp you know certainly the the YouTube channel but also you know free code camp what is it dot org or we don't word now I think we are I should know I'm sure there's a redirect in place as well but I think it's free code camp org and just try to go through some of the some of the lessons probably if you're learning Python you know a lot of the earliest stuff will be really easy you'll probably fly through it but that's a really good resource it kind of ramps up gradually unless you know some of the basics beyond that Udacity has a lot of free courses for web development most of them are a little bit get an in depth more into web development in particular areas more so than you'd get from free code camp you know unless you went all the way through and did some of the later things in free code camp so if there's a particular area you really want to focus on you could just take that course in Udacity so those those two resources have been very helpful to me and I mean there's a lot of other places for you can do courses code Academy is I've done a lot of things from there as well let's see Jambi says on browser support of CSS variables okay so basically just explaining it basically explaining this so I didn't see that before I brought this up so sorry John bbut I mean I guess this is a decent visual as well so not bad J says that was a good answer Jessie Thanks oh you're welcome I'm glad you thought was a good answer thanks for asking the question and let me gave me an excuse to explain the grand scheme for the site no beer says in response to Hamas question about learning web development it says one for frontend development learn HTML CSS JavaScript to build websites to perfect your skills 3 choose one server based language for example PHP Python Ruby for learned a database language like my sequel or MongoDB yeah I mean that I mean a very broad plan but that's basically I mean that's kind of pretty much how I've been going with that will yeah if you follow that you I mean you could be full stack that's you know if you get through all that Patrick all Patrick's is without the JavaScript happy react side I don't have much to contribute oh I'm sorry sorry faster I don't you know I kind of wondered when I would do this if there would be a shift in the people that wanted to watch so um there were probably people who watch because they're very interested in react or you know at least just JavaScript in general and then when they saw that I was doing dotnet stuff they might be less interested but then there may have been people who are interested in dotnet and csharp who started watching that didn't so I've seen I've seen some new faces and I've seen some people that I used to see I haven't is often so that's to be expected and you know it's not bad I think a lot of the stuff we're doing now is more friendly for beginners because we're really just doing a lot of basic HTML and CSS at this point and then we're spending a little bit of time trying to tie everything into these templates so it's not bad because you know with the react stuff sometimes we get in like really indepth into things and you know a lot of the people say wow this is over my head you know I can't understand it and so I think it's a good it's a good mix so we'll be back to react actually in October so first week of October will be doing react stuff again we're going to go back to project one and we're gonna update it so I'm gonna get a list of requested updates right at the beginning of October we're gonna work on those while we're working on those I think it's definitely going to be a good idea to go in try to update our NPM packages if hopefully we can update and not mess things up same thing like new updates on our server it'd be great to try to refactor things maybe more testing so we're going to be back to it but for the rest of September at least we're probably going to be working on this site and unless something else comes up I mean you never know project one came up out of nowhere and I had to stop working on this this site this University site and then flip right to that project one and I haven't gotten back to it you know really in months so anyway we'll get back to it but Patrick I appreciate all the help that you've given before I mean you've given so much help you deserve a rest I think okay Jambi confirms it is free code camp dot org now i dial a I said I'm assuming that if you took do typing comm it would just redirect that I mean that seems like that would be a basic thing so but I think it's officially dot Ward and not I don't just think I know it is John B said it is so it is let's see okay John Hanson says Google tag manager is a simple interface to see what visitors actually click on scroll past or down how much time or any other interactions you want to check on okay cool I actually haven't used Google tag manager I took a like a course on it and then I never implemented it on anything so maybe I'll start using Google tag manager on some of the newer stuff I have used hot jar before I think it's hot jar and they have heat maps of things so I think that it's I use the free version I forget what their limits are so I'm not even sure if it would be that useful for the amount of traffic their sites get gets I would probably hit the limits from really quickly well Orleans says Firefox as has fonts since 2014 Chrome has since 2016 cool okay Theo says Theo says in response to the CMS answer that I gave to to the question thank you very much for clearing things up for me for some reason I thought that WordPress is just for websites that are made with no coding but just the visual editor oh yeah yeah I'm sorry I didn't really mention that that's like kind of a key a key thing so I guess most people use WordPress for that very reason it's just websites you can get a website up and you don't have to know code what we've been using WordPress for and our projects has been I guess what would some people call a headless CMS so I don't worry about any of the templates that come with WordPress we don't use them at all instead I pull all the data that's entered in through WordPress I pull it all with an API into a react project you can pull it into anything I actually have other sites where I'm pulling it into just a site that uses some jQuery and Ajax to to bring in the data but that's how I've been using WordPress and that's how I generally do use content management systems for projects I'm doing I do have some clients that use just a basic WordPress site which is fine for a lot of clients I don't think they really need a react site I like to do it I think they end up being a lot faster if you do it right but I think WordPress as it normally is used is still very useful for a lot of for a lot of people and it can be a very inexpensive way to get a website up okay and Theo says I've been using firebase for my projects lately and that kind of falls in the middle since it doesn't require any serverside programming cool I keep hearing about firebase I've had people ask me if I use firebase and think I'm gonna have to check out firebase more I did I remember checking it out a while back just kind of looking at you know what it all what it was about and I didn't have time to really practice it using it but I've so many people were talking about it to me lately III definitely need to try it out okay all right cool so I've gotten to the bottom of the live chat so that was a much longer question answer session than normal but that was it was really cool it's worth it got some good questions and hopefully helped helped you out for those either ask questions also got to explain my vision for this website okay I just got another question pop up here Baaraat says Jesse can you give some pointers on pulling data from WordPress yeah so WordPress core now comes with the API built in so you don't need you used to need to get a separate plugin you don't need that anymore so it's really easy when you're using the API I I recommend getting some plugins so check out on the API documentation page they actually have a list of plugins that work with the API run through that list see what things might be useful for you it really makes working with the API a lot easier there are some things that are just they're just inconvenient to work with so try out some of the plugins trying to think what I use now I'm drawing a blank off and you can check out like project one has some videos if you see my project one videos if any of them have that's WordPress in the title even time you may be able to see some of the plug I'm using and how I have it set up but it'll make getting the data easier and getting just the data that you want easier sometimes you may want to get posts from multiple post types and there's not an easy way to do that right off the bat but you can get a plugin that lets you get multiple post types you can pull it all in in one API call and not have to make multiple calls so that's really useful if you only need like one piece of data and you don't want to pull in all this other data that comes by default there's a plugin that'll let you just filter out exactly what you need so you can make that the data just really small which doesn't really make a difference if you're getting just a few posts but if you're getting a lot of posts you just pull in the data you know just that you need so things like that or be really nice just make using it a lot easier yeah so just from memory there's kind of things that I that have helped me but check out I'm almost positive that I have some videos that have WordPress API in the title so if you can find those hopefully though they'll help you out as well and if you have any like specific questions when you're working with it feel free to ask them in the live chat or send me a message on Twitter or some other social media platform and I'll try to help you out if I can okay now I'm at the end of the live chat here again so I'm gonna finish things up here and I will be back tomorrow what's what is today alright tomorrow is Wednesday yeah I'll be back Wednesday so actually I probably won't get very much done because my wife has a doctor's appointment tomorrow morning I will be home with the kids I'll come in though into work in the afternoon most likely unless for some reason the appointment takes a really long time but I'll let every no probably be scheduling the event a little bit later than normal so I won't be in so you may not get the alert until later on or the tweet until later on but I think I should still be should still be here and as always if for some reason I can't stream I put that out on Twitter just to let you all know but anyway I will be back tomorrow most likely around 2 p.m. and I hope you all have a great day thank you so much for watching for contributing in the live chat I really appreciate it and I'll see everyone tomorrow
