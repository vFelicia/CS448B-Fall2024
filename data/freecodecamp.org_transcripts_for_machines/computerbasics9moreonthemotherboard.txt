hi today we're going to be talking a little bit more about the motherboard now the motherboard we mentioned briefly in the video about basic hardware but we're going to go into a little bit more detail today so what makes a motherboard is the connection between the cpu and the memory if there's no connection between the central processing unit and the memory we can't call it a motherboard but most motherboards do a lot more than that primarily they have expansion slots and ports now expansion slots are where you put anything that can increase the performance of the computer without putting more load on the cpu for example a graphics or a sound card would up your user experience by giving you better video or better sound quality but it wouldn't slow down anything that the cpu had to do a network interface card could also go in an expansion slot this would help your computer connect with the networks around it we'll talk about networks a little bit more in videos coming up now pc card which has really been turned mostly over to express cards are found primarily in laptops because of the size express card is better it's just much smaller in addition to expansion slots motherboards have ports now on your computer i'm sure you know there's a place where you can plug in a usb cord firewire sd card ethernet even an audio plugin so you can listen through headphones now these are all considered ports a place on the motherboard where you can connect the cpu to some outside source either to get or give information so just a quick review the motherboard at its very minimum connects the cpu and the memory but it also has expansion slots and ports
