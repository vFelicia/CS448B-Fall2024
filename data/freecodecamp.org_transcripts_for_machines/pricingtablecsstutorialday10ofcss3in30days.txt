hey everybody welcome back to css3 in 30 days today is day number 10 and we are going to be creating a pricing table you know when you download software or purchase a product and there are different tiers of options that you can purchase of that specific product or service well we're going to create one of those pricing tables in css3 so let's jump in here and see what the final result looks like so here we have a basic pricing table we have two options we have basic and awesome we have the title of the the card here and then we have the price and then we have the you could see uh alternating backgrounds we got a darker gray and then the basic color darker gray and then the call to action button so these outline the features and the benefits of the specific product and then we have the awesome package which includes more and it's just the reason why this one is bigger and has a larger card and it stands out more is because you kind of want your customers to lean towards that option make it so that both options are available but one of them stands out you'll see it often when you purchase a product and it says this is the most popular option so they want to highlight it so that all three options aren't just monotonous and there's a little bit of difference in the pattern so it's a pattern disrupt and it lets you focus on one or the other specifically the one that is um better so we're going to create that up here in the sandbox you can see it's just some basic text so we're going to turn this basic text into something really pretty with css3 so if we jump over into our sandbox you can see here we have 10 pricing table if the code editor looks different to you i'm using brackets right now adam wasn't playing atom atom wasn't playing very nicely with me when i was recording this lesson so i'm switching over to my second favorite code editor which is brackets and it's also free you can download brackets if you like brackets so 10 pricing table make sure you download that in the lesson folder that will be available to go ahead and download that 10 pricing table and then open up your sandbox.css for your styling if you want to look at your index.html you can see how the pricing table works out it's just a series of divs uh wrapping within each other nested within each other the naming convention pricing table we have pricing block header pricing heading the pricing price and then the currency value duration if i were to scroll down to the final version this might help you see it a little bit better so for example we have the pricing price the the currency the value the duration right here the pricing body the un unordered list and then we have the pricing footer which includes the select button and and that's all that's how that works so that's the html very straightforward jump into your sandbox and we're going to start coding this up right away so let's start with the class of pricing dash table and that's going to be margin 60 pixels auto let's go ahead and select pricing dash table excuse me after pseudo class pseudoelement display table content and empty string and clear both okay let's continue on we're going to select the pricing dash table and here we're going to use a child selector so this basically selects divs where the parent is all divs where the parent is the pricing table so that is that selector and we're going to say display block we're going to float that left we're going to give it a width of 48 minimum height of one pixel so it doesn't collapse on itself uh background color whoops white that's triple f and then color triple five save that in your browser here you'll see that it's starting to look a little bit like something uh it's everything's floating each of these tables or these divs within the pricing table are floated and the background here is that is white so it stands out in contrast on everything else here let's carry on pricing dash table child selector div and then the colon not selector so basically this means a div that is not and then you can give uh you can pass in some information here to let it know what it is not so let's let's break this down we're going to say not last child so this says select the pricing table uh any children that are a div of the pricing table but not the last child this could be an id or a class but we're going to specifically choose not last child because we don't want the last child to have this style a nice little css3 trick there margin right is going to be two percent so on all those divs but not the last child so really not the second element now we're going to say pricing dash block we're selecting that specifically and we're going to say text align center border radius let's do five and then overflow hidden now let's save this you can see it's starting to come together we're starting to get some basic shapes here excuse me if i do this random little cough here and there just getting over a cold so i'm trying my best to suppress it anyway uh basic and awesome you can see that the white and they got the the margin here and the round border radius looking pretty good let's go back here and now we're going to select the pricing dash header the height will be auto padding 30 pixels 20 pixels 40 pixels text transform will be uppercase and save that let's keep going there's nothing really that nice to look at quite yet now we're going to select the pricing header and then a descendant will be pricing dash heading so in that we're specifically selecting if you look here in the browser we're specifically selecting the pricing header pricing heading so this is the header itself as you can see but then we're specifically selecting the header within that heading so basic and awesome is what we're selecting and we're going to say font size let's do 1.4 rem relative to the root font size and then font weight is going to be let's say bolt okay let's carry on let's select the pricing price and that is going to be the color of triple seven and then we're going to select pricing price child selector span we're going to say display inline block if you go over here to the browser pricing price is the entire element itself pricing price span is each of the elements within that so the dollar sign the the the dollar value and the slash month text we want that to be inline block so we can specifically uh manipulate those items those elements so now we're going to go pricing dash price double underscore currency now we're going to say margin top 10 pixels and below that we're going to say vertical align top font size to rim font weight bold line heights just one so we can keep everything nice and lined up nice and tight opacity 0.6 0.6 okay let's move on we don't need to look over at that right now after currency let's do the pricing dash price double underscore value so that is the numeric value font size nice and big five ram font weight um let's do bold i like bold really highlight that price and line height one there we go so now head over to the browser and check this out i'm going to remove line height and show you what just happened this is what it was before uh without the line height just the basic default uh baked in line height for the browser but if i add line height one it's lining that up nice and that's what we want okay now head back here into your code editor i'm going to code up pricing dash price double underscore duration so this is the duration of that price because it's a monthly payment plan or a subscription in this ma in this example we're going to say margin top i'm going to go 10 pixels as well vertical align top now head over to your browser i'm going to show you what just happened there this is vertical align top if i remove vertical align top that's what happened but if i add vertical line top it pops up there and that's what we want we want that to be up at the top near the currency just looks nice font size 1.4 rim line height again one to make everything nice and lined up and opacity for this one as well 0.6 cool so that is the price head over to your browser and check it out that looks nice and tidy the pricing and the title so let's move down to the benefits and the features here the body of the actual price pricing table so now we're going to say pricing dash body and the unordered list and that's going to be a list style of none just to remove that option margin 0 padding 0 save that keep going down we're going to say pricing dash body uli we're gonna go display block padding 10 on the top and bottom 20 on the left and right beauty and then margin zero okay now we still got more to do let's go down below that and we're going to say pricing dash body uli and then we're going to select the nth child and then 2 n that means every second child element and we're going to style every second one like so now check this out head over to the browser this is what's nice about brackets when you're doing the live preview you click on the selector and it actually highlights what you're selecting so you can see in real time what's happening and i like this so i can show you how this actually affects the nth child 2n selector look how it's selecting every second child so in the basic element there's only one second child whereas in the awesome pricing table there are two so it does the every second element and if there were more it would keep going so it's a nice way of dynamically selecting something a nice css3 trick background color we're going to make that white every second one and then what we're going to do check this out pricing dash body we're going to select uli and child again but what we're going to add here is 2n plus 1. now watch this if we head over to our browser watch what this does so now watch what this is doing it's now it's selecting essentially 1 3 five so it's selecting the you know instead of every second it's doing every second plus one so that includes the first one the third one the fifth one the seven and so on and so forth now we wanna do is give that a background color of we're going to say f8f8f8 just slightly darker a little bit more shading now if we save that check it out in the browser it's very subtle but it's a nice way of giving some visual reference to each line especially if you want to compare primary feature primary feature these benefits these bonuses you know and then so on and so forth it's a nice way of outlining that okay now we're almost done we're going to jump down into our pricing footer nice and simple we're going to say padding 40 pixels 0 0 give it some space let's move on we're gonna style up our pricing button uh comma that we're gonna say pricing button and then the link and then another comma we're gonna say pricing dash button and then visited okay and in there let's style it up like so display block padding 20 pixels all around text decoration none because it's a link and we don't want that that style text transform uppercase make that nice and uppercase background color we're going to say triple three kind of that dark gray and then color white all right so check that out in the browser both of them look the same now we've got our basic style but now what we need to do is uh style that popular version the more popular one the the awesome one as we called it so it's the class in html is pricing dash popular so the popular option and we're going to say this one has margin top negative 20 pixels we're going to bump it up a little bit to give a little bit of an offset and now we're going to say pricing dash popular and then we're going to do descendant selector and say pricing dash header and we're going to style that by saying padding top 50 pixels we're going to give that more breathing room the reason why we're doing that is check this out pop over into the browser if i remove this padding top because we have this offset it's up here 10 pixels now we can't compare and contrast each of the benefits they're actually offset but if i give this some more space i want this primary feature to line up with this primary feature so by adding our padding top do you see what happens now it's perfectly lined up so now if we keep adding benefits on either of these packages those are going to line up and so that's a little trick to do that just some basic measurements and basic math all right back in our code editor here we're going to go pricing dash popular we're selecting that the whole time here now and then pricing dash footer now we're just doing things to make it look a little different padding top 60 pixels on this one as well just more breathing room and then now we're going to do is we're going to go pricing popular pricing dash price the color of that price i want it to be something that stands out ff 888 so it's gonna be like a salmon color and the uh we're gonna jump down below that we're going to say pricing popular pricing dash button and that's going to be background color we're going to use that salmon color again ff8888 and the color we're going to say white is the text of that button itself and now we want to be able to have a hover state for that button so pricing dash popular and then pricing button and the hover state and that's going to be color we're going to go ff 8888 and then the background so that's the text color will be that but the background let's use the same order background will be triple three the same as the default button state but the color will flip of the text color okay now save this check it out both of them now essentially are done but if i change if i try and make these responsive they don't look very good as you can see especially as you start to get into like a iphone size so we want to fix that by doing some basic media queries here what we're going to do is i'm going to say media screen and max width uh 1023 kind of like a tablet and i'm going to style this up by saying pricing table is going to be margin auto let's keep going pricing table child selector div so all divs that have a parent of pricing table float none we want to remove that float and we want the width to span the entire container so 100 percent below that we got pricing dash table child selector div not last child so we're just going through and reselecting what we just styled up in our css3 i'm going to say margin right and we're going to remove that and the margin bottom we're going to say 20 pixels because now they're going to stack and we want 20 pixels of space in between the two so that is going to be good let's keep going we're going to say pricing body we're going to say max dash width 100 overflow hidden sorry white space no wrap so let's see what this looks like so far let's make this 10 23 roughly here there we go so you can see now it stacks and now looking here at the basic one there's supposed to be some space here there's 20 pixels of margin at the bottom of this top pricing table but it's not actually pushing it down and that's because this awesome element it has negative top margin so we're going to solve that here go back to our code editor and we're just going to say margin bottom 40 pixels and that's basically just going to give it another 20 pixels we could have also said that the the popular option doesn't have a margin top and in fact why don't we just do that we'll say margin bottom 20 pixels but we're going to specifically select it's going to come up here but we'll just jump in and add that style it's going to be pricing dash popular and that's going to be margin top 0. that'll solve the problem there we go let's get back to what we're doing here with the pricing body so after pricing body we're going to do a couple do a couple more things really quick and then we're going to call that a lesson so pricing body uli display inline block and then we're going to say vertical align middle and then we're going to go pricing dash body ul li not first child and that is going to allow us to say margin left negative 5 pixels what we're trying to do here is you might be wondering why are these stacking sideways like that we want them to be a really short element here but check this out in the final version i actually wanted to scroll like this so that means we need to give this an overflow x scroll so let's go back to pricing body and we're going to say under overflow hidden we're going to say overflow x and auto that should give us the option of when we are scrolling of scrolling those features it's kind of a thing that like apple does and you know it's kind of a neat mobile convention so just to wrap up here uh let's find our spot again so we did the first child just a couple more things we're gonna go pricing body ul li nth child two n so every second one what's happening background color it's gonna be e eighty eight e eight just darken it a little bit more just to stand out we're going to go pricing footer the padding top will be zero to remove that padding and then we've already did the margin top for the pricing popular last not but not least pricing popular and then pricing header we're gonna copy that and within that we're going to go pricing footer so we're going to select the header and footer in the popular element and say padding top 30 pixels done that's all the styles check it out in our browser the final result we have their basic and our awesome and every new elements here every new feature gets added so that when you're on your mobile device you can scroll that left and right we got them looking good here and uh they're responsive beautifully just like so bam that is super nice thanks for hanging in with me that was a really really big lesson hopefully you learned something and maybe got some ideas to make your own pricing tables thanks for tuning in uh stay tuned for tomorrow we're gonna be playing around with some internet explorer hacks with css3
