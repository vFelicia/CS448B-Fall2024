hello and welcome to live coding with Jessie alright today we're not gonna do a whole lot of new coding we're gonna check out some some pull requests because the pool requests are adding up and I've been really busy so I haven't really had a chance to review them so today we're gonna review them I figure this would be cool to do live we've got a little bit of this before but some some of you maybe have never been in a position to review a pool request or try to work on merging them so I'm gonna try to do the whole process here on the stream this is gonna have to be a shorter stream so we're gonna go maybe about an hour long at most and it's early because I have meetings later on so I can't I can't stream my normal time so well I have one meeting that's going to be really long this afternoon and I'm gonna go get a haircut in about an hour and a half so I didn't realize that I had the other meeting in the afternoon until this morning otherwise I would have given you a heads up yesterday about the early stream alright so hey everybody I see some of you are here yeah hopefully the notifications worked for you all so let's get started let me share my screen and I'm just going to go through some of the new stuff before we get to the pull requests I just want to show you all the JavaScript AF website so yesterday I let you all know that I am now the owner of JavaScript on AF so I'm not sure exactly what I want to do with it long term but her should had an idea to make a like a discord server so her should set up a discourse server or digitalocean and so right now javascript RAF is pointed here so if you have any questions that we don't address in the live chat or maybe you'd like to have some ongoing discussion you can join go to JavaScript AF and join and it's basically like a forum like an online forum so that's there for now I'm thinking if I decide to do something else with JavaScript on AF then I can always move this to a subdomain and so we can keep it going but for right now I think this is a pretty cool thing to do and it will at least be useful I just wanted whatever we did with it to be useful so I think this this will be useful I know we have several other channels like we have a slack channel and we had something with like oh I think we have like three different things going on right now in terms of being able to chat so this is adding another thing but it's central location anybody can join so hopefully this will be you know it's not exactly that a chat room like slack is but hopefully it'll be useful so check that out javascript dot AF and if you have any other ideas for what I should do with that domain let me know like I said we can always do we can always just move this to a subdomain if we want to do something else with the main domain alright it looks like the notification didn't work for some of you it's because I scheduled the stream so late and I'm I'm sorry about that if I schedule it less than an hour before I'm actually going to stream then it seems like notifications don't work so we'll switch it oh yeah Harsha said that server is still on harshest insulation partially we can get it switched over to mine I don't want you to have to pay for that for that server so I actually have credit on digitalocean that I need to use up anyway it's going to expire I think in April so we'll get that switched over let me think I don't know what all the info you need to switch it but it's I think the account my main account the email is just Jessie Weigel at gmail.com let me know what other info you need to transfer that and then I'll just I'll take care of I don't know how much credit I have but it's it's cool I'll just take care of the cost of it ok cool her shoots gonna send me the snapshot then then all I'll take over but thank you for setting that up our shoot it was that was really fast setup alright so we've had a lot going on in in the pool requests and different things on a lot of different projects so we're gonna we're gonna catch up with things now so just to give you a little overview so we've been working on mainly these three projects so actually there's four projects that we've had progress on but I told you all about the electron app yesterday and I showed you so we have the Resource Center as an electron hat and I still want to do a little bit more testing with it especially on on a Windows machine and make sure everything works right but so far on a Mac everything is perfect so so I just lost my train of thought I got a slack message and it derailed me that's the only way the the Resource Center is taken care of I really want to get a repo up for the bulletin to turn that into an electron app but we actually haven't finished the bulletin the react version of it so we were harsh it was doing some work on it so hard [ __ ] I had asked about implementing a Microsoft login so you knew course you all can follow along with this on github if you want all these repos Republic make it bigger so you can see so I had asked about using a Microsoft login for the bulletin since the university I worked for switched over to office 365 about a month ago so I thought hey let's try that and I specifically asked hardship for help because he had set up the password 'less login system that we currently have running on this project so he went ahead and just set it up and I tested it unfortunately the problem is when you have like I work Microsoft account it doesn't automatically become a Microsoft account it doesn't I don't have that makes sense but like if I tried to log in to like Outlook calm or if I tried to use Microsoft to authenticate into something else and I put in my work email it would say that account doesn't exist so there are some other steps we can take to make it work but I think a simpler solution and one that will be more user friendly is that we're just going to check so we're going to keep the password this login and only allow logins from Franciscan GDU addresses and we're also going to accept any user that is coming from our single signon page because if they're there at that page it means that they've already signed into that page so we can trust that you know they've got there and if they got here there are somehow some other way I'm not worried about it really then we have bigger problems just somebody reading the bulletin so we're just going to use document dot refer which is just in JavaScript and it lets us get the URL of whatever site the user was on last before they came to this site you know whatever say it linked from so that's what we're gonna do still need to implement that I'm actually working on implementing that on the current version which is just a jQuery single page app that is a private repo right now I I don't know maybe I'll make it a public repo at some point but it's really kind of a mess of jQuery and custom routing with that it's using the WordPress REST API so I don't know for right now it's gonna stay private but I'm gonna try to implement the referrer thing I was doing that yesterday and then I got I had to go to a meeting and I couldn't finish it so it will be tested out before we even launched this react version of it so that's it for the react Billiton and well maybe I'll put a note and enclose this but I want to leave a note as to why we're closing that so we just have some basic stuff so Franciscan react this is the main Franciscan ddu website that we're working on and you have a bunch of stuff let's check on some of these issues first and then we'll get to this pull request so if you don't know why I am on github these are just my notifications so you wouldn't be able to see this page because these are notifications for all of my repositories you'd have to go to these repositories individually but material UI has gone to beta 30 so yeah it is our she mentions they're updating it quite a lot they are for sure I just noticed that on Twitter yesterday at some point and yeah it's crazy we're updating material ID very frequently which is fine it's cool as long as there's not a lot of breaking changes just have to have to check for that so right now this is just an issue if anybody wants to try to update and then double check the things are still working you know feel free to do that otherwise I'll get to it you know at some point in the near future but thanks our [ __ ] for for bringing that up in an issue I would I wanted to but it's possible I may have forgotten to do it anyway alright so I created this issue well 13 days ago and we wanted to add a search bar to the top map on that Franciscan site so Nikki took a shot at this and let's check out what's going on let me make sure that this isn't what that pool request was no it's not okay all right so let's take it [ __ ] take a look at what's going on here and see if we can sort this out I see there's there's a lot more activity here in the in the live chat I'm gonna get to that in just just a few minutes all right so I'll read this out in case you can't read this if the quality is bad or if you're just listening since I got stuck trying to implement this one everything would find until I wanted to add the open/close animation I added an is search open boolean to the state and wanted to change the value assigned to the search field class based based on that that boolean got flipped on the search icon clicked something like with okay changing the width with the transition all right the function with the style rules is not inside the component so you can't access the state like that there I'm attempting to add this animation wrong way how should I go about it all right I guess don't you what the style rules is not inside the component okay so the problem is the style rules what if if you can't change the style rules because of the function there what if you just added a class to the the element and that changed it like a class like open or closed and then you set instead of having the class be search field you can have a class that's open and a class that's closed then you should be able to access state and it'll switch back and forth between the two if if anyone else has another way to do that let me know otherwise I'm going to type this in mr. States okay let me okay comment on that and see and this one is we're gonna change color of the search field underlined alright so we had in the sidebar we have another search field and the color was some like neon green color that didn't match our palette so alright it looks like so Nikki had asked about the color but then when I had I think it implemented no maybe not or maybe I just already checked it out yeah it is there's an open for requests alright so change color search label winning port focus all right let's check so this is a good pool request here so the pull request is directly referring to one of the issues that I open and it's it's short it's focused it explains clearly what's changed including code samples even as a suggestion for potentially improving it now usually when I go to check a pool request on github I read this first and then I go to the the files changed and then I see what has actually changed so we can see really dealing this change is just a two additional classes with some CSS and it looks like yeah so we actually have the classes here now yes we've added the classes so those are all the changes when the changes are very small like this and the effect is obvious I don't bother to actually pull in the changes on a separate branch and test it so what I'm going to do is I'm gonna merge the pool request right here and I like I said I only merge like this if the changes are small and very obvious what they do so I don't recommend merging like this without testing unless you're absolutely sure of what's going on a very minor CSS change like this is fine but especially if somebody's bringing in like other NPM packages and doing things like test it first on a separate branch I always like to write a thank you message if you maintain something I'd recommend like always writing a thank you message it only takes a second and I think it's polite I like to get thankyou messages all right great so we have one full request merged and let's check this one out and also this one so this one is add links in the drawer so we have that side drawer let me see I should probably bring the site up let me get this site running so that we can all see man and I just showed my dot end file on on YouTube live so I'm definitely gonna have to change that now we weren't gonna end up we're gonna take out that functionality anyway so I can't believe I just did that let's see looking for my there it is okay I need to get into I'm gonna cancel this and grot I'm not even sure what was on there and let's start up this Franciscan site all right wonderful so let's bring this here we are so this is what we're talking about this sidebar and with our links we wanted to have some leg external links under here so that's what this pull request is talking about and since we did merge something in on github it's a good idea to pull in those changes let me find area Franciscan site let's move this over and have a change in the yarn file no all right I think yeah that's it it's just the yarn the unlock all right all right so I'm pulling the changes that we just had but it's working once we had emerged since I had a change in the lock file that I did not commit and it it opened automatically an atom on my other screen it's close all right great so that works okay great so now everything is up to date and I've already showed this so many times let me just I may as well show this we're gonna have to change all of this stuff which is fine because those are all testing things anyway I know I already accidentally showed it so that's why I just left it on anyway that way anybody is trying to take my API keys save you time from having to try to pause it and right at the right second alright I'm worried that right no no anyway here's what I wanted to show so here's what we have with the color change we see I said that's not bad I was thinking of using like this yellow color that we're using for this button but it's not too bad with the gold color especially since it's right up against this what do you what do you everybody think about this let me turn on an grukk so you all can contest it out as well all right we're almost coming up to about the halfway point the stream so I'm gonna take a little break and go back to the live chat now but I do want to did want to get that end grukk server up and running so if you can click on the link in the live chat now you'll be able to check out the site stellt let me know what you think about the color of the search bar do you think it should be the yellow color that we have on the the buttons in the that are over top the hero image do you think it should be a different color in the color palette like maybe the grain let me know I'm open to anything all right and yeah so let me go to the live chat now I'm gonna answer some questions and then we'll come back and we'll try to pull in the rest of our pull request handle any merge conflicts we have so we may end up having some conflicts here which I was I was kind of hoping that we had conflicts just to show that process so awesome so we will have some here it's it's only gonna be just within one of the components which shouldn't be too difficult but at least we'll get to see the process we can actually maybe we'll try to resolve conflicts here I don't think we've ever tried to do it right in github on the stream before we have done it through the command line but let's try to do it and github so that's what we'll work on next see Siberian says a F stands for Afghanistan or what yes a F does stand for Afghanistan so you know there's the country domains so I think every I believe every country has their own domain I'm not sure that I mean countries that are really new newly foreign may not have it but yeah dot AF is for Afghanistan so I actually had to like go on and fill out some information an Afghanistan like government website which it was kind of odd Candice Gander 7 says forum equals oldschool yeah forums are kind of old school but I mean there's they're useful they still work ah let's see Aleksey says Jessie can you order your videos and playlists by each project yeah I definitely can I know I've been talking about it for a while I just haven't gotten around to do it for every project I think I do have it done for some projects maybe like project one and two and at least one of the projects I think I did I just need to get around to doing it for the other project so sorry about that that's one of those those things that's been on my mind for a while it's just easy to put off you know satya says digitalocean change the pricing it's cheaper now yeah yeah that's true so if you use digitalocean check it out i'm sure you've got an email about it but the pricing structures change so you get more powerful droplets for the same amount of money that you've been paying which is awesome and if you haven't tried out digitalocean now you know might be a good time to check it out because the prices are better now John John Hanson says that site it's not written in react needs a better logo with a winking face yeah maybe we should write a react site for that since we're always working with with react Harshit said we'll change it with Jessie's face haha no you don't have to put my face on it's the logo I hope those a joke oh I gotta check is it really gonna be my face on here I don't know where it went I thought I brought it over to show it but I guess I moved it back over all here it is it's on my other screen oh no it's not work you know I guess maybe arch is doing something on it let's see Harshit says document.referrer can't be trusted as someone can map that single signon link to their host file and can refer to your bulletin I I know the document dot refer is not secure right my goal is a very like moderate level of security for the bulletin so let me let me give you some background to explain the bulletin used to be a word document that was emailed out to everyone and then what happened is everyone would just email that out to whoever else wanted it so their spouses or anybody else in the community people who didn't even work here or on the email list and got the bulletin when I early on when I got here one of my first tasks was redoing the bulletin to make it a website or at least make it it was very vague it we just needed to make it you know more more interactive updated a bit so my guidelines were my idea was well there doesn't there's no reason we really need to make a password because there's not really any sensitive information in the bulletin and if we did have sensitive information we usually send separate special emails with like important in the tagline so I didn't think we'd need it but then we basically I had to so I was told I had to make it passwordprotected but there couldn't be any new passwords so that's why I came up I mean it's not like I invented pass for this login but that's why I decided on password this login right so I'm not worried it's not like we're guarding some some secrets here essentially we just need to have some semblance of this being somewhat protected just to let you know like the level that we're at here is that there are other documents that are supposed to be like passwordprotected and literally it is just one password that everybody in the whole University just has the same password so like you log in to an area and it's just in plain text on the page here's the password to get to this place so we're not like anyway well I would it be nice to have it be secure like that but to be honest with you the next time that I have a meeting about it which should be on Thursday morning I'm gonna really try to get it so that we don't even need a password at all because I I don't think it's necessary and I know I mentioned this before but like 95% of the emails and phone calls and visits that I get where people are having problems with things that I built are all about the password this login system for the bulletin because there are various things older browsers don't work some people will clear out their local storage or they have some sort of new program that clears out their local storage so things it's always the problem so anyway my plan is to just not have any password protection at all on this thing if possible if I can't do that then my backup plan is just to use this referrer thing that was actually what IT recommended to me to do when I asked them about integrating this with their single signon system they said do the refer thing my response was that's not really secure just like harsh it was saying but the more I thought about it more I thought well what's really the big deal my other plan is we're gonna turn the bulletin into a desktop app and a mobile app at some point just like we're doing with the Resource Center so potentially I could have that only available for people to download from behind to login so if you have that you'll just get access and then if other people want to share that file to download I mean that's that's out of my hands at that point but it'll basically be the same level of security we had back when it was a Word document being email so let me know what you think about that if anybody thinks I'm crazy or there's some other way to do this but that's kind of the situation that I have gone on with with that particular project sorry ego says we'll just see early by the way hello hey ebo yeah i'm really early I just have my normal during my normal stream time well what has become the normal which is 12 p.m. my time I have a haircut I made the appointment like before I started streaming at that time so that was unintentional that it would overlap with a stream and then I have another meeting in the afternoon that's supposed to be a long meeting and see david says remember Jesse triumphant pride precipitates a dizzying fall I think I think this is the third time that David has typed that and as always that is definitely true and good advice so thank you although usually I hear that same phrase quoted as pride goeth before the fall either way same meaning so anyway basically try to stay humble stay humble that's good advice let's see Gander seven said when we were talking about what was the issue it was with all with that toggle that search toggle the issue about how to get that animation to happen Gander seven says couldn't you pass the open closed status as a prop well essentially the the problem at some point you want it to be instincts you get a rerender right so I guess if it's as long as it exists in the state and some component it could be pressed down as a prop but I think either way the way that I said will work the way that you said could probably work as well let's see John Henson says the state for class can be a string that toggles okay Dacron says what does the end after thing do I'm a noob and rook said it changes the color of the bar underneath the search bar yeah yeah that's basically what it does Rick says like the blue color underneath the bar when you type a comment here in the YouTube chat doctrine says el hello all the API keys yeah yeah all the API keys look says oh the those changes are in the same file as the previous full requests or the conflicts now dacron says I think it would not offer to merge now if they're conflicts what we'll just you have to deal with the conflicts no life says hi can you tell me what's wrong with my tribute page of code pen do you do such things no life send me send me the link oh here it is let's check this uh I let's check this tribute page out real quick so you want to know what's wrong with your tribute page I don't remember what all the user stories are for this particular free code camp thing so it looks okay to me I mean you have a time line you have an image title I mean like in terms of fulfilling user stories I think this is fine in case you're wondering this is one of the free code camp exercises that you have to do is I think this one's pretty early on so yeah I don't yeah I think it's fun let me know if anybody else wants to to check that out and give some feedback in the live chat you know please feel free Harshit says discord theme should I switch the light theme the dark theme seems too dark I don't know I kind of like the dark theme you know me though I like all the dark themed stuff but if you all like the light theme keep it light I can always just run like a custom script to change it dark you know or even maybe they'll have the option to do that I don't know I haven't checked out all the settings yet and see Eva Sisters tests take a while yeah the test sometimes take a lot for a minor change like we had when we were running it it does take a while but I mean that's it's okay tests are good to have so I'm willing to go through it sometimes they're faster than other Suns even if there's a field of social media icons are a bit too heavy on the eyes and the top right of the screen maybe spaced them out a little more alright let's check it out we're talking about these social icons yeah maybe we can adjust it but yeah there needs to be some adjustment here I think because we need to pull this button down off the top you know we don't we want to add a little padding up here and we could kind of play around with different different spaces between these I'd like them to be kind of have like a minimum size so that they're still clickable like reasonably clickable but we can kind of mess around with this and see what what works and also I had a thought I don't know why I didn't think about this earlier like I mean look at what we have right now on a small screen it looks terrible like really terrible we've basically been ignoring the mobile view when what we should have been going all along is working on the mobile view primarily and then occasionally expanding out to make sure it still works all right all right if we think about this this website is targeted at teenagers or is a teenager more likely to view this on their phone or just sit down at a desktop or laptop computer and view this I mean I I can look up the statistics but if I had to bet I'd say that a teenager is more likely to be on the their phone so we should do is as we continue to develop this we should do all development like this and then the desktop view should be secondary to this view I don't know what do y'all think about that I used to do all my development like that and I don't know why I got away from it probably because I worked on some internal projects where it was going to be over overwhelmingly viewed on a desktop and I just got used to that but for this project I think it really makes sense to do the the mobile view first so that's what I'm gonna start doing so in future streams this will be the default Aleksey says I like the golden color but not the yellow of the buttons eyesore talkin here alright so the golden color is good but that yellow color not good okay thank you for the feedback I appreciate that okay I just saw ours its message that Harsha was upgrading to discourse divergent version two so it might not might be unavailable so that's that's why it was unavailable briefly for me Devin says every tech startup uses dot IO and that's Indian Ocean domain yeah yeah you could so the dot eight using dot AF for something other than a website in Afghanistan is not it's not uncommon for people to use country code domains for other things right and I'm sure we've all been to a dot IO web site because it seems like every tech website now is dot IO like we were on code pen right now it's code pentaiah gander seven says if you click a menu option like academics click the grade Jumbotron and click the same menu item again it opens the sidebar with the submenu close yes excuse me I am aware of that issue and I did come up with a solution for it I just did not code it yet so I don't know what happened but I remember I was about to put to implement that and then I got pulled into something else so I needed to do that but thank you thank you for bringing that up and I'm really glad you reminded me because I've completely forgotten about it John Henson says I like the look of the search when clicked awesome awesome cool I will probably like right now this isn't centered so I want to make sure that that centered but other than that I mean that that's pretty much good to go Dacron says have you ever considered starting your own group on the side to take small take on small projects with volunteer developers I finished a boot camp recently I've been trying to improve hard time finding projects that's a good idea oh yeah I want to talk about that more let me know in the live chat what you all think so let me know number one would anybody be interested in something like that and if we were to do something like that how would it work would we do like free projects for nonprofits would we want to do paid projects yeah how would I mean I guess if we did that it to be almost like we were an agency but so I think it would be a lot easier to take on free projects because we wouldn't have to deal with all like the taxes and paperwork and stuff but let me know what you all think I'm I'm not entirely opposed to the idea I mean I guess it could operate a lot like we do now we could potentially have like live coding sessions so that everybody can be there checking it out explaining it and then have different people coding things and then we could maintain our repositories on github all right let me know what you all think though I do think that's kind of a cool idea and I actually already have a project in mind I don't I have one organization that could potentially be interested and it could eventually turn into something that we we would either sell or we could just keep it open source and make it available I guess let me know I guess I can just tell you what it is I don't care if anybody else tries it and if I think it's something that needs to be made by somebody doesn't have to be me but I I see a very big need for a learning management system that's open source that's reliable and fits all the criteria to be able to be actually used by schools you know there's a lot of there are stricter data rules about students especially students like under 18 at least in the United States so whatever we would do in terms of you know collecting data having a database we need to make sure that that's all in shape to be able you know to meet whatever standards it needs to but basically I wanted to be a more modern like fullstack JavaScript build it out with react I want it to be very fast I want it to be able to be have a UI for web mobile and desktop and so the user can use it wherever they feel most comfortable it definitely obviously needs to work Mobile on one so there are a lot of parts of the world where people only have access to a phone and not a desktop and their internet is not great so it needs to be a progressive web app that works well on a phone so I would say it needs to be like mobile first so like we designed the whole LMS to be able to work on a phone and then when you expand it to a desktop it basically just gives you more space we might be able to display more things but we do it always with a phone in mind and always in mind that the user doesn't have a good connection or is losing connection so this would I I'm envisioning that this could be used by big organizations that have lots of resources but it could also be used by small nonprofits that are trying to go into a country where they said that the internet access isn't good and users might have very old smartphones so it just needs to be really light weight and work offline as much as possible you know so user could take quizzes and do stuff offline as soon as they get any type of connection it'll send the data that's that's my thought I'd like the UI to be you know kind of really modern think like Udacity is UI or something like that Udacity use UI is built with react and it looks really nice I like it is it perfect no I mean it's not perfect but yeah I'm kind of thinking along those lines if anybody's interested in a project like that let me know that doesn't have to be a project that we do but I just thought you know I throw that idea out there I know we talked about it in the past but if you're it if anyone's interested in that I can't create a repo for it just using probably just use create react app and just start working on it guys so I took a long time to explain that let me try to get through alright I'm almost all the way through the live chat so let me get through that and then we'll see how much time I have left and in terms of getting the rest of this stuff merged no life says on how I want to know why the name under the quote isn't the same like in the example I'd have to take more of a closer look at it oh oh sauce old sauce says what is this lotion digitalocean is a it's like a web host so you can purchase they call them droplet droplets they're like little servers okay and you can host whatever you want on there so usually like they run some version of Linux so you have your own kind of Linux machine there to do whatever you want with when we use it to host a lot of our websites actually if anyone is interested in digitalocean I can give you my code if you want and I think you will get some free credit for digitalocean and I will get free credit I know there are other codes out there that'll get you more free credit so you don't have to use my code but if anyone's issue let me know send it to you I mean if I'm going to start hosting this disk or form it would be cool to have some X somewhere free credit Michael criolla us is early stars in it yeah for sure it's definitely an early start this won't be the normal time I'm not normally going to start at 10 a.m. my time Chris Amir asks about the github dark theme okay rook said he uses github dark first result when you google when you google it yeah that's exactly right thanks root rook says do you have white space on the right on this project on my machine I have a horizontal scrollbar in some empty space on the right side that's entirely possible that we have something like that happening let me see oh yeah for sure what do we have Oh up here so yeah yeah we've really been in my I mean I I've been ignoring the the mobile view and like I said I don't know what I was thinking this is obviously a project that needs to be made primarily with mobile view in mind alright doctrine says I'm totally interested we can do free projects we can do X projects I mean like experience projects I'm not sure with the expertise of radiating his experience we can do group freelance important part is having someone experienced as a lead we could meet on a few a week online Gander census I would be interested in side projects could start with nonprofits but it could be a good move get paid at some point a future a lot more complexity and paid yeah I mean I'm okay with the paid thing as well so I did I did do freelancing in the past I'm familiar with the contracts and billing and all that I I have been involved with having partners on freelance so I I do that I mean I obviously have experience with having projects with multiple volunteer contributors and in that so yeah so I'd be open to it if we were going to do it like I said I think it would be cool to start with some nonprofit stuff a little bit less pressure or maybe just some like side projects that are ideas for us maybe the less the least amount of pressure just to kind of get a feel for working with each other and then after that point we could do some some projects that might be good because then we actually have projects to show like as our portfolio if we were going to do that I want to make sure that we get like solid clients who can afford to pay us what we're worth right I don't I don't want you all getting paid nothing you know good projects right so we'll be able to use the technology that we want so I'm ok with that I dunno I know some other coders I know some people that can help us with the business end of things as well in terms of like handling taxes and payroll and all that if we wanted to I don't know if it should be based primarily like in the United States and everything goes out we could try to see like what's the the best way to set that up but I think about it yeah well um cool Blake says I'd be interested in coordinating the business side of things okay cool let's alright let's do this so first thing is let's just get together instead of talking about things and not worry about the the business side right away I don't think it'd be a good idea to just jump right into paying projects without having worked with each other at all old sauce is interested nick is interested about to finish Flatiron bootcamping looking to keep it free advice my skills cool Nick my wife just finished a flat iron boot camp and she might enroll in another one of their boot camps soon as well let's see Baccarin says react with rails backend sounds like a good start okay cool yeah I don't have any experience at all with rails but I'm open to it Lee says Louie's sorry from pronounce aces lose Lu eyes II feel I see a frat loot this is it just Louis anyway let me know how to pronounce it I'm gonna stop messing it up I apologize but anyway they're interested in as well and it says Jesse do you have any course on udemy for example on a full development system using react node you know all that stuff um I don't have any courses I don't know if anybody honestly thinks that I should do a course let me know I'd be interested in doing that it'd probably take me a lot to get it together but I really I never really thought about doing it that question could you explain what you're teaching I was watching for two days but I can't understand okay yeah it's probably been a bit confusing for the last couple of days because we jumping into like different projects and things right in the middle of it so mostly so what I do on this stream is i stream my daytoday work as a frontend developer I work for a small University and so whatever I need to be working on that day that's what I stream so it's not exactly tutorial and it's not always in in order I jump around for project projects sometimes some emergency thing comes up that I need to fix but when I am streaming I try to explain what I'm doing as best I can in particular right now most of our projects are JavaScript based we're using react and the design of it is usually based on material design and if you have any questions about anything let me know more than happy to explain what I'm doing go back over something so let me know and I'll try to help help you understand as much as possible but that's kind of like the short version of what we do here all right Harshit hat now has HTTP up and working for javascript AF well rook says the white space is there even when it's full screen let's check that out all right so you're right we do have a bit of white space so somewhere I have something producing some white space off to fix that I'll off hand I don't know what it could be but I'm sure once I start if I check it on dev tools it shouldn't be too hard to find doctor says let's see if this going how do I get in touch with you probably the best way dacron if you're on twitter just DM me on Twitter you can email me at Jesse waggle gmail.com if you want to but I like kind of prefer Twitter DM z once we get into like maybe more like business whatever you need to talk more email or something else might be better but those two days are probably going to be the easiest ways to talk to me Michael Chris's wait what did I miss are you getting paid what you stream now not yet Michael not yet maybe one day if we were to do a project especially if it was paid the streams would move to probably my channel and we may not be able to do public streams if it's our own side projects I'm totally fine with us doing everything public but if it's for a paying client we definitely have to get them to agree to it first and I wouldn't want to do it on free code camp because free code camp does work kind of exclusively with volunteer stuff for nonprofits I could check with Quincy and see what he thinks but just to be safe I'm saying now that those streams would probably have to be on on my channel doctrine says I don't care about pay at the moment I'm just saying it for a learning experience and becoming a better developer that's cool school is see Harsha says now you can ask questions on discourse so that I will be personally answering them alright cool so hard she'll be answering questions on this course I'm gonna check in on discourse too and I can answer stuff anything backend related for sure I think harsh it's better to ask questions about but I'm also gonna be there to answer questions Louise okay is that how it's pronounced Louise all right Thank You Fabio sorry I was mispronouncing that let's see Christ centered EV says any time I inquire about the beta curriculum seems like people ignore the issue it'll be awesome if someone would do an update since Quincy inform people about the Xmas due date yes so I don't I don't know for sure what happened with the Christmas dates I never like really looked into that so I personally have no I have the same amount information as you all have in terms of when the beta curriculum is going to be out so I'm not involved in that project so I don't know why you're not getting an answer to the issue I think you can work on a beta curriculum if you want to so it is available trying to think you would usually anytime anyone ask Quincy the answer is always soon so I don't I think you probably get the same answer which is soon which is true I mean it's Quincy wants it to be good before it's released and you can't really put a date on that but I know I don't know how but I know it's possible to start knowing the curriculum now even though it's it's not officially like release yet does anybody know how to do that alright Blake's it gotta go watch the rest later see you later Blake thanks for watching Michael says if you'll take me I'm in I'm trying to build up a CV and anything would help okay cool for sure John Hanson said your wife is soon going to be getting a dev job at Google yeah I was joking I like my wife I had joke with my wife earlier and said she's gonna end up being my boss one day she's gonna be a project manager or something and but it's crazy she's she's been working so hard and learning so much Andrews interested in what as well awesome let's see a harsh said I put your face in the logo oh I am my face is there now let's see John Hanson said usually that whitespace is a margin or overflow issue yeah I often show usually when I have white space issues I just go into dev tools which that's that's great is too big whoops and I just go through and see like which box goes over into that white space and sometimes that'll do it it doesn't always work I assumed it would be something here with the header layout they were is that it no it's not it I'm not gonna have time to go through all this because then I won't be able to finish the live chat but this is like my my normal method of troubleshooting stuff like this usually I can find it it was a button I thought it would be that about this I don't know we'll see no life says I don't understand most of the time because I'm a newbie but I know you definitely should make some courses do you have some personal channel or only air free code camp I do have a personal channel so if you look in the description for this video there should be a link from my personal YouTube channel I only have a few videos on there now but I really would like to put some more tutorials and hopefully I started to put out some more videos recently maybe I'd like to stick to like one a week so if I could try to make a new video once a week I think that would be fine maybe just some short really focused tutorials I think my channel is just Jesse or Weigel I should just look it up with thanks I have it here I'll paste the link in for you all oh it's Jesse like a twenty nine company alright there we are so I pasted the link to my youtube channel oh okay sorry Brooke so the name is Sony key so I was saying Nicki I'm realize for that it's Nicki is that correct Nicki off to do I'll really try to remember that I'm sorry in the United States lifts how we always pronounce it so I apologize no life says sorry for my English oh don't worry about it your English is great okay so rook says beta free code camp org rook would you prefer on the streams if I say Nicki or if I just say rook because it doesn't matter to me either way but I'd rather call you what you like to be called our Andrew said Quincy said they're still cleaning it up no release date yet Louise says thanks for the answer no problem in pronunciation it's a Brazilian name I suggest you creating a udemy course on developing some system from scratch it would be great all right cool I'll definitely think about that I'll look into like the process I'd have to go through to do that let's see so but yeah beta dot free code camp tour check that out for the beta curriculum Michael says today's a live chat is kind of cool it's almost a group chat yeah it is it is so I apologize for anybody to tune in the stream that was expecting something a little different it just kind of turned into a chat like this which I mean it's fine honestly we sometimes we just don't stick to the topic I mean that's that's how it is I guess we need to do some something live like this but I think this was a a definitely good chat brooke says yep that's right but pronouncing it the American Way is also fine I just wanted hear you say ah no rogue for sure I'll pronounce it the way that you prefer to pronounce it I'm yeah I don't want to mispronounce your name also it works is I have I don't have a preference in you sing my real nickname alright maybe I'm gonna try to say your real name and then that way for me I like I'd like to remember it so if I keep saying it I'll remember it so if it's cool with you I'll try to say it so from now on when I see rook I'm gonna say Nikki and hopefully there won't be too much confusion with people in the live chat on he'll said I'm back I see I lost a lot of fun I guess so yeah glad you're back though no life says thanks I will look at it after I get a little better so I can fully understand that let's see Brooks's or I was already read that one I should Irish this is thinking for a new blog post any ideas spooks is hyoe you creating a tribute page for free code camp challenge no I'm not creating a tribute page but when we're kind of reviewing someone else's tribute page and actually alright I gotta wrap things up because I need to leave like right now so I can get to my appointment on time so thank you all so much for I was like just just talking with me in this dream today it was awesome I mean we did get some things merged in sorry we didn't get back to fixing the merge conflicts if anyone really wants to know about this maybe I can do a video about it or something maybe maybe I'll try to do it later and just record it and I'll throw it on my channel now we'll see let me know if you're interested in that but anyway I'll be back tomorrow and I don't know what we'll be working on tomorrow we'll see but thanks again and until tomorrow have a great day
