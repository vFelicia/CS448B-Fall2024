i'm basically going to speak about relationship building in the iit community so the first thing i'll say is a lot of us can be really shy or introverts here in the community i took the myersbriggs test in college and i came back about as introvert as you can possibly come back and i have lots and lots of friends in the tecla homa community my husband who's actually at my desk right now at star space 46 he's actually really shy he also has relationships in the i.t community so you can be shy you can be an introvert you can still build lots of relationships and part of the thing about building relationships in the tecla home and community it's about building real genuine relationships sometimes you go to events that aren't for it and it's about networking it's kind of awkward and you don't know who to talk to it's a lot of really great people here in the community that you can build relationships with so real quick why would you want to build relationships one it can be really fun you can also learn your skills faster and then it might also help you find a job later so just for fun we've got a lot of people here for example that are trying to learn web development they either want to become a developer or you're already a developer you've kind of got something already built in but you might find someone that also likes stargate or star trek discovery or some kind of other interest that you have another thing it can help you learn your skills faster so for example jesse harland teclahoma foundation president he's really amazing with javascript we first met actually at a sql event actually we started chatting and he actually helped me out with some javascript with jquery when jquery was really popular so you can also like learn your skills faster and then also it can help you in your job search so you're looking for a new job or you're looking for that first job you can start asking people hey you know i'm looking for a job what are some of the really awesome companies to work for in oklahoma city or tulsa or wherever you're looking or if it's someone that knows you pretty well hey what places do you think would be a great fit for me we're going to hear a presentation later talking about the right company for you there are so many different size companies there are different cultures and different size companies that are right fits for people so that's a conversation that you can get going now one thing i would say with respect to resumes i would typically let someone offer to take your resume and pass it around it can be kind of an awkward conversation if someone is like hey kristen um i know you work at such and such company and could you pass my resume along i've actually had that happen like at a sunday school before was someone that i had never met before and they were wanting me to pass their resume along and the first impression i got from them is they might not be a right culture fit for the company i was at so it was kind of an awkward conversation you also may have someone hey they work at company a you want to work at company a they may be thinking company is horrible they want to leave company a and they may not want to pass your resume along because they don't think you're a good fit there because they don't like the company so that's one thing i would say with resumes is you you potentially will have people offer to pass your resume along but i would say that's kind of the one thing let someone volunteer to do that for you now on the note for job search my last three corporate jobs that i have had all came through people i knew one of them was people i knew from a previous employer they loved where they were at they were trying to recruit me when i was looking to to leave where i was at gave them a call when they had an opening they gave me a call like the position was pretty much mine to lose at that point the second case was a case where it was actually a recruiter from a staffing firm that you'll see that will sponsor some events in this case she went on to work to devon energy i was interested in working at devon energy gave her a call and she pretty much took my resume went past the first screen immediately to the hiring manager and then my most recent corporate job that i was at because now i have my own consultancy was someone i'd known in the community for more than 10 years like before it was even the tecla home and committee he took my resume and passed it along so the people that you know can be great resources for helping find a job even though that's not why we're really building the relationships long term you can have those conversations so how can you build relationships if you're new one of the things that meetups is that i oftentimes try to do is sit next to people that i've never met before so i sat next to marcus in the back had a great conversation with him hadn't met him before that was really great i could have sat next to kimberly who i've known for several years but i wouldn't have met anyone else new and kimberly and i can talk on slack whenever we want to so that's one of the things i try to do at conferences which can be a little bit bigger also sitting people next to you that you don't know can be really beneficial now one thing for people that are new or not new that's kind of starting to take hold at conferences is people are coming up with the idea of basically forming a use so if you've got like kimberly and i and carson i believe like if we were having a conversation and we wanted like other people to join our conversation we would like i guess in our case form a triangle but kind of like a you that would show hey we've got space in our group so you can come up and join that conversation if two more people joined that conversation then we'd form a u make sure we don't have a circle so that new people can come up so i'd say if here at a conference definitely look for people that are in that you format and if you're someone that's not new to conferences and you want people to come up and join your group i'd highly recommend forming that use you can have more people come up and talk to you so that's basically my talk on building relationships
