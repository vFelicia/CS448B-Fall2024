Tinh common array methods I'm gonna go over some of the most commonly used array methods in JavaScript the first one is going to be a raid is pushed the push method this just adds a new element into the end of an array and if I console that lock that you can see now it's ABCD and you can see that started off as just ABC the next one I want to show you is a pop pop removes the last element in an array and returns that element now run that we're gonna see that we have the D and then if I just cancel that log the array again you will see that now the array doesn't have that the D on there because it's been popped off the push and pop changes the original array now next one is concat which concatenates two arrays first I have to make a new new array so I have the first array okay all right if I run that we're gonna see ABC v/q one thing interesting about that is that it does not affect the original array so if I just console dot log the second array we'll see that it's still GQ the next one I'm gonna go over is its join this joins all the elements in an array to create a string and also does not modify the original array Sofia run that you can see at the end we just have the string ABC and if we put something I joined this with just a empty string but I can also put something in here like an exclamation point I can run them and you can see now there's an exclamation point between each item in the array and that that string and the original array stays the same next up is reverse which just reverses the elements in an array if I run that you can see at the bottom CBA and that does change the change their array so if I console dot log the array now you can see at the NCBA CBA the shift function is going to remove the first element in the array in return that element so the first Elm is C because we reversed an earlier before we reverse that array to see ba now it's returning that first element C and if we just console dot log that array again we will see that it is the C is removed so if you look at the bottom just gonna be be a for the array I'm shift adds a new element to the beginning of your right and returns the length of the modified array so at the end is just gonna say 3 because remember before the array was ba so this is or added the P to end to make three elements in the array so if we just log that array we'll see P be a and the P at the beginning of the array slice is going to select part of an array in return that new already you've selected in the original array remains unchanged slice is going to accept two arguments the start and the end minus one let me give you an example so it's going to start at the index one and then the second argument is the end one two one is me one so this is only gonna be one character of the array because you always because this it's this minus one for the end character let me get console that log date so you can see that this is the original rate pba and we're gonna start at index 1 starts index 0 then we have index 1 and then we're going to end at the index 2 minus 1 0 1 2 minus 1 so we can end at the same character that we started at so it's only going to return B if we change the second argument to 3 then it's going to be PA instead of a and slice does not change the original ready so the original array is still gonna be PBA now I'm gonna show you sort was just sorting array so first I'm gonna push a few more letters onto the array you see at the end a BF IP so that's all sort of even though you can see that I add F at the end it ended up sorting everybody it was PBA this is what the array started off as because this Mike Winston slice is something it's not going to change the original array so it we had this and we added a F and then it's sorted to be like that and you can see that sort does change the original array the last one I want to tell you about is splice splice is very similar to slice but it's going to modify the original array instead of just returning a new array also the arguments are going to be a little different the first argument is going to be the start index also as to the second argument is the number of items to count from the starting point to remove so if I put two that means two items are going to be removed starting at the set the second index I put three then three ends will be removed and then the third argument is any items you want to add so I'm going to add Jase nuggets and it's going to return the items that were removed and then I'm going to log the array so if you can see first it removes fi because it started off with this array and we went to this index two if we have zero one two we remove two items one two F&I and that's what it returns for this first console log and then we're going to console dot log the new array which is be a be jeaious nuggets because it's going to insert it at the index that we had up here which is the second index and we're still gonna have the P on here well thanks
