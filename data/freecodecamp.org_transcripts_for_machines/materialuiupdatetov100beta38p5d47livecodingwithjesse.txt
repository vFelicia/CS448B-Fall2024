everybody welcome to live coding with Jessie I'm Jessie and today I'm streaming from a recliner in my basement and I guess I do have a robe on so I'm gonna try to stream if you all have seen streams in the past when I tried to stream from home we'll be had some problems with quality of the stream so I've turned down the settings from you know what I've used in the past hopefully it'll work keep me up to date on how it's looking on your end I've been testing it out for maybe the past you know five minutes or so and I don't sometimes it's write it in you know all right sometimes it drops down so it's just not I'm not sure I don't have very much else running on my on my computer this may be a good excuse to buy a more powerful computer also sorry about the background noise so my home office is also in the laundry room and there's laundry running right now I think it's almost finished though so let me know if the noises is too terrible and maybe I could just shut it off but I think it should be done in a few minutes okay all right so I'm trying to check the analytics just to see what kind of quality or getting alright it's not looking really good I don't have a lot of data right now but it's it's not looking great okay we do have some 720p streams going alright okay it looks like okay John saying there is some lag here okay I was hoping this would work but they have to try to figure something out if I want to be able to do these from home so let's give it a shot today the what we're gonna try to do today is upgrade to material UI version the the beta version points was a 3/8 yeah point three eight all right so there are some breaking changes and I'll bring those over on the screen in a second I have them on my my other screen but that's we're gonna do today so I'm right off the bat we're just gonna start with that we're gonna update on a separate branch and we're gonna see how many things break and so alright cool the washing machine it's now finished so hopefully it'll help with the background noise my setup too it's not as good as my work setup I don't have an external mic so if I'm gonna do this more from home I think I'm gonna get a camera and a mic that'll be a little bit better but for now hopefully this will work well enough and let's see oh let me switch screen so y'all can see what I see all right so here's our package.json this is what we have right now it's your UI beta 29 so we're trying to upgrade all the way to 38 so let's see how many breaking changes we have before we start this let's pull this over let's try to zoom in all right so let's let's go all the way down to the version we're on now and just kind of go up and see what we're what we're dealing with so if you want to check this out just go to the material UI repo on github and click on the releases and you can see all this as well while I'm scrolling I tested out deploying this site using now and it worked I ran it through some issues what one mainly is now runs by default HTTP we're still pulling data from that test WordPress server that is not HTTP so probably gonna get the WordPress on to its own droplet at some point and give it a real URL you know with encryption Wow okay it took awhile to get there all the way down to the bottom so this is where we're at now but anyway I was impressed with how easy it was to deploy to now I'm and how fast it was you all know we have done pretty much no optimization for speed yet and it was really fast so I'm super happy about that so we'll probably be doing more with that as we get closer to the launch date which is still to be determined okay so we're just gonna look for breaking changes there we are so breaking changes so we'll have to keep in mind buttons I don't think we're using tabs we definitely are using typography okay so that need to keep that in mind I'm just gonna scroll through it quickly right now and that way like will at least have in mind what to look for when we update it and we're trying to look for things that are broken and then as we deal with each issue we can read you know more indepth into each thing as we need to fix it let me start my poem with or a timer as well maybe area so if you're asking questions right now in the chat I do Pomodoro session so after 25 minutes I'll take a little break I'll come back to the chat and I'll answer any questions that you all have so please be patient and I will get to your questions okay well it's gonna be a lot of breaking changes okay so icons are we I think we're using SVG icons which I believe is a separate it's a separate thing okay maybe some changes to the themes all right Wow we'll see okay let's keep going another breaking change okay for more buttons okay so we're changing to using variant for a lot of these so we had we had seen this change before at some point oh yeah we were looking something up in the documentation and they were telling us to use variant but we hadn't updated to that version yet so so we were aware of this we'll definitely have to keep that in mind that's I mean that's gonna be something that will for sure need to update and yeah that one is know breaking changes alright here's more breaking changes okay we may have to switch up our type for our inputs we don't have too many inputs we do have a few the alright no change is there just a small breaking change here okay so just don't have a font size property I'm not sure if we were using that anyway so I think we're fine here I if I remember correctly I'm pretty sure we use CSS to change the font size all right getting close more breaking changes interesting okay let's see alright alright we're gonna have a lot of stuff to deal with this might be more than one day of working through these changes so definitely going to do this on a branch this is not gonna be something that we want to do on our master branch it potentially this this could be breaking things for you know a few days until we get everything sorted out alright so let's get to the code and let's let's go to our docks here this is the documentation for material UI just to show you you know how we how we update this we're just gonna get material UI at next and that's gonna give us the latest prerelease and that's what we want so you know we go into this and we use things that are still in beta this is what you you deal with this is kind of the cost of of using the latest thing so you know that was that was something that we are willing to work with but we're definitely gonna have to you know keep up with this I just checked in the lab chat it's uh someone says speak Hindi please unfortunately I do not know how to speak Hindi so apologies for that I know there are a lot of viewers from India but I don't I don't know really anywhere it's at all in Hindi so sorry about that okay alright so this is how it looks now I just wanted to take one last look before we potentially mess it all up alright so here is our terminal and we have the package.json file open so we should see this switch over to the new version when we run this so I'm gonna do a yarn ad and I'm just gonna paste that material.you I next end right there I did notice okay Nikki says the page is skipping so drunk dropping frames oh yeah you know what I do have a yeah it's showing up like a point six percent point seven percent yet for some reason actually this makes sense so while this is running I'm dropping frames IIIi think the problem is the problems definitely with with my computer I mean my internet connection is fine to handle this and I me very obviously frames drop when we run things so michael says branch yeah i forgot to make the branch will make it after this so i frequently forget to do a branch when i'm doing to change or i start to make a change and don't realize like how much of a change it's gonna be beforehand so there you can make a branch afterwards and everything will work so what we're gonna do now and you can see we've we've updated to beta 38 that's awesome so now what we're gonna do instead of saving what we've done on the master branch we are going to make a branch now so we're going to do git branch let's say get check out we're gonna do beef leg that way we'll go right into the new branch and let's call this mui 38 and that way we know exactly what was going on here on this branch hopefully we won't need it for that long okay so now we have on this branch all the changes that we want when I go back to the master branch we'll be back on that beta 29 and I can just run yarn again to change the packages on this machine and really everywhere else you know it'll be fine since we haven't pushed any of this yet so so anyway if you have run into the situation like that that's all you need to do just don't commit anything a master just make your branch switch over to your branch and do all your commits there and then you come back master will be clean with with no changes so it looks like yeah the stream the frame rates not doing too well it's starting to get better now all right sorry about that is at least it is the audio at least working so somebody let me know in the live chat please as long as the audio is working I think it's worthwhile to keep the stream going and I'll do my best to describe everything in case the the video is is lagging a lot maybe at the end of the stream we can go on Amazon and look for new computers no I don't know if you heard that that was my wife in the other room saying no okay cool so the audio is good alright so we'll keep going this is not ideal but I'll do my best to narrate so let's check out what actually happened let's let's click around ok I'm gonna do a refresh just to I shouldn't need to refresh cuz we have you know like the hot reloading and stuff but sometimes it requires a refresh okay so far it's just really slow no weird air is on this face we'll just scroll a bit if I can okay okay this all looks pretty good cool very cool even our buttons the buttons are custom so that makes sense that they work let's try to our side over here okay things are really slow that's most likely just my computer though you gotta remember to change that hover color Wow super slow okay all right not bad wow wow this is really not bad I just want to double check and make sure yeah we do we do we upgraded all right you know what let's go to that search page because we have some inputs happening there so let's see there's a search page I'm not running any rock today too so I don't know if anybody asked about that yet but since my computer can't even handle what we're doing right now I'm not gonna attempt to run in Grug so sorry about that Matthew says to check the frame rate you know what I I turn the frame rate down to 30 and I mean is what's the video like if you go below 30 frames per second is it watchable I mean how low can I reasonably go I wonder I have a a Windows machine that has what used to have pretty decent RAM in a graphics card it's a little bit old but I may be able to get better performance out of it so maybe I ought to try to install everything I need on that and try to stream from that at some point so that's another option I'll have to get used to it the developing on Windows again ok so alright cool it looks like we click things work kind of ok yeah that wow that does work that's amazing and everything looks pretty much the same as we've had it we're not even getting we're not even getting any errors I mean is it possible that we could be this lucky Matthew says do you have slack open or a bunch of chrome tabs open you know I closed out almost all my tabs let me double check I'm gonna double check just to make sure I don't have anything like minimize that I forgot about all right so at my timer you yeah nothing nothing out of the ordinary what's this one ok I can't close this stuff so I found two tabs that I didn't need so we'll close that down almost up running I have Spotify running maybe I should turn off Spotify alright sorry music Spotify is off okay I think that's about all I can do I could turn off I term too and then run the server all right I don't know we'll see maybe turn it Spotify off will help maybe I'll try running Spotify from my phone next time alright so Niki notices the color of the checkboxes is different okay I thought that might be the case I couldn't remember exactly what color we had okay alright so we noticed one one thing so far let's check out maybe some of this alright that looks good I want to check this again because I didn't really look that closely yeah that works Wow okay so so far the only thing that we've noticed is the color on checkboxes is different which I'm really glad something's different I was starting to worry that we didn't actually update anything somehow it just didn't work okay wow I I mean this is good this is a really good surprise I just thought based on you know all the breaking changes document it I just assumed that stuff would be really messed up Wow I mean let's let's take a look somewhere that we know we're using some things that change so there were some things that changed about buttons you know let me check my timer all right eight minutes Oh in about eight minutes I'm going to come back to the live chat answer a bunch of questions and we may wrap things up early since we don't have a lot of issues and is kind of not going too well so yeah let's check out our hero component that's I think we have buttons in there now we did use that custom button so oops that so we are okay so we're importing our custom version of that button so maybe that is why our buttons still work because we yeah that is what okay so our buttons are all gonna work that are using this one because this was a modified version of the regular button component so this has not changed at all even though the regular button component did change so we'll just have to decide if we want to update this based on the changes or not but I guess that explains that typography has changed so we can check out what's going on with typography the thing that I believe we did though is we we did use a lot of custom CSS to kind of override things so I think that's I mean I don't know if you all have any theories on why everything still looks okay let me know but to me that seems to be the best explanation is that we just overrode a lot of this stuff and it's so we were okay I just saw something funny in the live chat so I just got to say this so Michael says professor Bonjour doesn't teach French does he know so Andy Bonjour he used to work in my department and then he got really fancy and got a degree and became a teacher but he's good guy my son and one of his sons they're best friends but no he does not teach French he's in the Communication Arts Department he does video stuff but and he has a really epic beard too much longer than mine he's a good guy but we do have a dr. Plato who does teach philosophy so I mean that's perfect like he was destined to be a philosophy it's philosopher you know from birth Nietzsche says in the student profile card variant changed okay so we have the change here with typography I want to go back since I have a typography component here I want to go back and see what changed so let's check that out okay so instead of type we're gonna have variance that's so odd it's still working I mean if they say breaking change that usually means like it's not there's no backwards compatibility right now let's just check I think we were looking at this see how it still looks fine I mean let's use variant and see what happens so I'll just do these top two we'll save that and see if there's a change wait a second for this reload here oh okay Wow all right so that changed things a lot I'm definitely gonna undo that I'm running yarn again just to be sure yeah I mean I I was pretty sure that it works but okay so I don't think I'm gonna change things over to variant right now maybe with new components will use variant instead I mean obviously when we go to the docs we're gonna be using the new stuff recommended by the docs which will be the latest so you know we'll do that but in terms of what we have already nikki says in student profile carl card variant changed the cards i mean it it looks it looks okay tell me what else would have the other thing I can see and this may have already been like that before is this could probably do with a little bit of a heavier font weight just for readability but other than that it looks okay hmm all right let me check okay so I only got about a minute minute 30 left so I'm just gonna go to the live chat now and I'm actually gonna shut down some of what I have going on here so I'm gonna shut down my local development environment here and shouldn't have done that because I needed to run tests shoot all right let me let me spit it back up again yeah so yeah if you try to commit things if you're if you're committing to this project you do need to have the server running to run all the tests so you won't be able to commit without it I mean you could force the commit but usually don't want to do that okay all right so let's at least commit this get Ad and let's do whoops yarn see em okay sure now what is it what the name is I guess we'll call it a chore for right now breaking changes yeah oh yes it does affect an open issue what is that issue I can't remember the name of the issue let's try to get back I'm sorry the number of the issue well this issue's kind of old because we were gonna update to beta 33 so issue 81 all right there we Michael Patterson just asked about an end Rock link I'm not running in got a knock right now because I'm I'm streaming from my laptop that's not very powerful so I didn't want to try to run and rock as well I mean I I didn't think he could handle it in stream at the same time all right impasse we are passing Wow I really just take for granted how nice my my iMac is at work and so I try to do stuff like this and see how long it takes so for those of you that have slower machines I admire your determination and patience because this stuff takes a long time Wow okay while I wait on that I'm gonna start in on the live chat so I'm gonna scroll all the way up to the top and try to answer all the questions if you have a question you know please put it in the live chat now I'll do my best to answer it and we have a lot of really knowledgeable people in the chat that can also help answer the questions Ricardo says greetings from Venezuela hello thanks for watching gamer D asked why the background is all black I'm not sure if you mean the background to my screen why it's all black I was running the dark thing on github and I'm running dark themes on pretty much everything so that could be it if you mean why the it's black behind me and in my little video in the corner I usually work with the lights off to cut down on the glare on the screen so that's that's why it's it's so dark I pretty much the only reason you can see my face is because of the lighting from the monitors you can see the light changes as I switch from a dark screen to a lighter screen Oh after all that we didn't pass Oh timeout all right let's just force this because it's so slow I'd hate to do that how do we force it with that let's see if we can do this I can't remember what the area no verify I'm not sure if this will work is it working or is it gonna try to run everything again I hope it doesn't try to run all the tests again well it is going a lot faster the Sun alright so Gannon for you I'm assuming that's Gannon from The Legend of Zelda videogames so awesome I'm a big fan of those began in four uses hello first time I see the livestream from you so I want to thank you for taking the time for streaming and a heart emoji so hey I appreciate that I'm really sorry that the first live string you see is such poor video quality I sorry I just got distracted by that error message but anyway I appreciate you saying that and welcome to the stream hopefully you can make it for more streams and for sure if you have any questions about anything that I'm doing just just let me know I'm happy to go you'll go back over things alright I'm not gonna mess with this any more during the stream I'm just gonna let it do its thing and fix it afterwards oh okay Matthew uh sorry I didn't see this message earlier but Matthew Potter is saying when he had this similar problem he switched to Firefox and completely got out of chrome and that fixed everything that's not a bad idea if I switch to a more lightweight less resourceintensive browser then it might work all right that we're pretty we're almost done the stream so I'm not gonna try it right now but that's a great idea all right I'm gonna do a little bit of research and and find out what browser uses the least amount of resources and still can handle the code that we're using if you all know what browser is ahead of time let me know it will save me some time in research but that's a great idea I mean every little bit can help I suppose all right it looks like that actually went through awesome so let's do good all right so now what we've done which isn't really much we is now on github github so if you want to check it out and pull it down to your local machine and and see what's happening feel free and if you want to use any of the code in any of the repos that I have or that are in the fus marcom or getup organization you know feel free it's it's all it's all open source I think we have put would MIT license on everything haiya coding in caffeine is here it says hi code eaters and coffee drinkers cool good to have you okay Blake says the Spotify web player takes up less resources than the desktop app is that that makes sense I didn't think about that so maybe I'll I'll use that as well I I don't really need the music and I could run it off of my phone so I'll maybe I'll just try to run off my phone next time our Blake saying there is a terminal B Eska yeah I well I mean I'm using terminal D s code and then I was also using these terminals so let me just get rid of this right now yeah there we go let's make sure shut it down okay there's one more thing shutdown at DISA sorry if I'm mispronouncing that but Odysseus says you should stream on Twitch you know what a while back I did make a twitch account because I had thought about the streaming on there as well but just I haven't done it yet I'm still kind of open to the idea of doing it but it's just one more place to have to organize things so not really sure I mean if if I was gonna stream on Twitch maybe I would do some different content maybe not exactly the same stuff that I'm doing now on maybe I'll play like oldschool Starcraft on Twitch and just not even do coding or do a totally different type of coatings Andrew asked if I tried lowering the bitrate I did I did lower the bitrate as well so this bit rate and the bit rate is significantly lower than what I use on my my iMac and I think I did switch to 30 frames per second on my iMac as well so the frame rates the same but I mean maybe I could try for a lower bitrate it's just only I mean I wanted to at least make it possible for people to stream 720p I think the the font is just too fuzzy if you go lower than that so I need to keep the bitrate high enough to achieve 720p so maybe I'll look up exactly what range I need to be in for that and see if I can lower that a little bit more okay Nikki says the Firefox developer edition okay cool or oh michael says firefox Kuantan and Chrome Canary depending okay I do I don't know if I have canary on this machine I think I just have canary at work but I'm wondering you know what I do want to try Firefox quantum so Firefox dev Edition and Firefox quantum which one's faster of the two does anybody have experience with that also Gurpreet Singh says hi hey how's it going welcome to the stream so I've gotten to the bottom of the live the live chat I'm just gonna give it you know a few more seconds because I know there's a delay to see if anyone has anything else to say about Firefox quantum and the Firefox dev edition and then I'll probably wrap things up who knows a little bit shorter stream than normal really so sorry about the quality I'm definitely gonna try to change some things and get that fixed before I attempt to stream again Oh Matthew says the video is is really smooth now what was the solution ah I think the solution was just shutting down as much as I possibly could and not doing any worse so I'm I'm barely even moving my mouse right now so I really think that's that's it so really I I mean the only thing I did you saw it on the screen is I completely shut down my I term so I was using I term too so maybe maybe I'll do that I have no problem not running I turn to I just I don't know if I can run to terminal windows in vs code maybe I'll just look it up and see because I need the run the local dev server in one and then still be able to use get in the other okay Nicki says it's the same quantum is the name for the new Firefox okay cool all right yeah I had that really confused all right so so basically Nicki and Michael you were both talking about the same version of Firefox correct which is called Firefox quantum I think I'm gonna load that like as soon as I in the stream I'm just gonna load it so I don't forget well I mean I'm really glad the stream is going well now too bad I'm ending it right when it started to have good quality but I really think I could notice you know OBS if you used it you know it shows you your framerate statistics and everything you know right there and as I would do stuff you know over here and in the terminal even like doing stuff in chrome like hitting the refresh button I can see the framerate like the percentage of frames that I was dropping just start going off and then whenever I stopped doing that you could see it go down so definitely I mean maybe his computers just just can't handle it oh cool Blake says you can run multiple terminals in Visual Studio code awesome it seems like something that you would expect to be able to do I just didn't never took the time to look it up so I I appreciate that you let me know about that I think yeah there's really not gonna be any for me to run I term too anymore if I can do that alright so the plus sign is gonna give me another term what oh that's cool and I can split it what this is so cool Wow what all right this is it was so this made it for me so worth it to stream now that I know that that is awesome so let me see how let me give credit alright so a few of you were telling me about it so Blake saying you can do it and Nicki says you can even split the windows Michael said the plus sign next to the drop down awesome so Blake Nicki and Michael thank you so much for that that's gonna be super useful for me and it'll be one less program that I need to run now which is really cool Nicki's also saying alright so Andrew says bitrate for 720p is whoa 2,500 to 4,000 whoa yeah there's no way I can get that bitrate on this machine Nicki says try streaming with the special h.264 thing options CRF or something option in OBS oh yeah let me check that option for a second I remember seeing that where it is all in the encoder okay yeah I'm not using it right now maybe I'll have to use that then alright I'll try that so definitely I have a lot of good ideas for how to make the stream quality better next time so first I'm gonna try to make it work with this laptop and just by adjusting settings and doing some there changing what browser I use and if that still doesn't work then I'm gonna try using a different computer I'm going to switch to a Windows desktop that should be a little more powerful than then the laptop so that's the plan for the next time I stream I'm gonna be doing probably more streams from home then I then I normally do so I definitely want to get this working so like I said I'm potentially gonna get you know a a more kind of decent setup than I have right now huh I mean I have the laptop in my lap so I apologize for any shaking I know that would probably make me motion sick apologize maybe I'll try to get better lighting as well better mic things like that alright so I think that's it for me there's no more questions in the live chat thank you all so much for hanging in here I mean I can't believe how many people are still viewing even after the the terrible quality of the stream so I really appreciate you all putting up with that Oh Andrew says just googled it again and you actually only need 1500 minimum for 720p ok that's that's much more doable so thanks for that Andrew I really appreciate that alright so I'm going to end the stream thank you all so much for watching for your patience and for your help this ended up being way easier than expected I'm sure as we keep going we'll probably find some other things that maybe don't work like we wanted them to work that we just couldn't see right now so I'm not saying it's completely like a hundred percent works but it's way better than I expected cool alright now the stream is perfect yeah so alright so evidently it is possible to stream with this computer I just need to do nothing so if I'm gonna talk only then I can stream all right so anyway thank you so much for watching and I will see you all tomorrow
