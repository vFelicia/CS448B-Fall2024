good morning my name is colleen this is a day in the life of a freelance software engineer my day starts at about 6 30 when my kids wake me up i am here with them having some breakfast do you want to say hi hi do you want to say hi i will check back in with you when my work day starts so my work day starts at 8 a.m when my babysitter arrives i have three kids one in full day school one in half day nursery school and one that is still home so juggling all of that can be a little bit challenging when i first started out i was not making enough money to hire a babysitter and so i was hustling to get work done late into the night early in the morning and during nap time having the freedom to have her here has really made a difference now that i have a good clientele and i'm making money she has been a tremendous help i am not one of those people that can work with my kids running around i like quiet i like intense focus with what i do so that has really added to my productivity i have three kids in a three bedroom house so my office is in my master bedroom i have a new macbook pro here that i work and a 27 inch monitor it's kind of hard to appreciate how big that is on this video but it's amazing i love it i thought about going to coworking space so i could meet more people but i love my monitor and i think i would miss it too much um one of the things about freelancing is there's a lot more overhead than you would think you think hey i'm going to build 40 hours a week at 100 an hour i'm gonna be rich but the reality is you're not going to build 40 hours in a week unless you're working 60. at least that's been my experience so far there's a lot of overhead especially as you're ramping up i've been doing this for about a year so although i have a pretty good backlog right now i probably keep about a three month backlog of work so i'm always looking for new clients and i'm always managing those clients that's the other thing because i have so many clients managing them actually takes a little bit of my time so this morning i'm going to start with checking my email and i have a new client who has sent me a contract so i have to read the contract and sign the contract and that client has also sent me their github repo so i have to look at the code and see what kind of issues i need to fix i've noticed or one of the things about being a freelancer is you switch code bases quite often and there's always a ramp up time when you're learning a new code base trying to identify the issues that you have been hired to solve one of the really cool things about this is i see a lot of different styles i see a lot of different gems used for different things but one of the kind of frustrating things is it can slow you down a little bit because you do need that ramp up period for a new code base so i'll start my day looking at that contract checking my email getting that signed then i'm going to have to go into my time tracking tool i use harvest there's a lot of good ones out there but i've been using harvest i've been happy with it it provides time tracking and invoicing and i will have to add this new client and i will have to start billing hours the thing you have to be very very specific on when you are a freelancer is your hours so you have to be very diligent in building the correct hours to the correct client and so i think having a time tracking tool it works way better than trying to use excel in a timer or something like that so i signed the contract i told you i was going to look at and i just cloned the new repo i'm going to be working on while that was cloning i hopped on to slack to check in with my slack teams one of the organizations i work for is a contract basis so i get a little bit of work from them every week and we use slack to communicate i try not to keep slack on all day because it can be distracting so i clone the repo and i am having problems i can't even open the code yet that's always really frustrating a lot of times you'll see that sometimes they all use different versions um of ruby and rails i use arbemv arbenv to manage my version so it's actually not a problem but i just it does you know it is a little thing you got to go you got to figure out what they're using why isn't my gem file working that kind of stuff so that's what i'm doing right now um like i said i check in on slack and everything is good there are no updates for me with one company i contract with i get paid when my pull request is merged so i like to hop onto github to see if there are any comments on my pull request and see what status that is in and then i sometimes use the pomodoro technique to focus depending on what i'm doing which is 25 minutes of intense focus five minute break so i think i'm not going to start that until i can get uh the repo working properly and once i get that and i'm really diving into the code i'll start my pomodoro pomodoro pomodoro what do you say has pomodoro pomodoro timer it's about 12 o'clock i spent the morning getting set up with the new code base that i'm gonna be start i'm going to start working on this week and also taking on some other issues for one of my contract clients if you're wondering why i'm laying on the floor it's because i use the pomodoro technique which is 25 minutes on five minutes off so for those 25 minutes i turn off my email i turn off my slack and i try to focus for my five minutes off i do some yoga and i do 10 pushups um and then if i have time left over i do some laundry so i'm gonna get back to work and i will check in with you around lunchtime good afternoon it's about one o'clock so it's lunch time one of the things about having my toddler in my house while i'm trying to work is i have to stay out of sight while she is down here so i sneak down here during nap time and get my lunch i don't know about you but one of the problems i always had working from home is i wouldn't make lunch and then i'd get hungry and then i was too lazy to make lunch so i would just eat chips and salsa but i've started making these mason jar salads doesn't that look delicious and i eat them because they are super convenient so i just dump this in a bowl and i can eat it all right i don't really break for lunch because time is money and as long as i'm paying my babysitter i want to be working so i'll probably i'll grab my beautiful salad dump it in a bowl and i will take it back to my little cave slash office it's about three o'clock and my babysitter just left and i got my little one here up from her nap next we are going to pick up my eldest son from school and then hopefully we'll have some fun outside and get to enjoy the day a little bit um and uh probably check back in later one of the biggest benefits of being a freelancer is having flexibility over my own schedule so as i mentioned i worked eight to three today it's about 4 30 and i brought my kids to the beautiful norfolk botanical gardens and they are playing on the world's biggest sand pile can i tell them something hi my name is declan i'm digging for a treasure that has candy inside i'm back at my desk it's 7 30 at night i just put the kids to bed and um there's a lot of work i have to get done i'm traveling the second half of this week for a conference which is awesome but being a freelancer i build hourly so if i'm not working i'm not getting paid that means i have to put in some hours in the evenings to make up for the time i'm gonna lose also it's not as consistent as i used to think i thought being a freelancer meant i could just take time off whenever i wanted but the reality is you have a lot of clients that you work with continuously and it's important to meet their deadlines and make sure you don't let them down in order to keep their business so i will probably work here till i don't know 9 30 or so and then i'll go to bed thanks for watching bye
