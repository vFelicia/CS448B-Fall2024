in this video I will talk about how to add and remove elements in jQuery if you need help adding jQuery to your project check out my getting started with jQuery video so the appended and prepended methods add new elements as child elements to the Target and the after and before methods add new elements as sibling elements so right now I just have this code up here and I do have some styling down here and one thing I do have some styling for a child element El and a sibling element so it's more obvious what where the child and sibling elements are so let's add some jQuery here so first I'm going to select the Target and then do append okay you can see I appended a div with the class of child and it just says append inside so I'm run that and see what happens remember a pin and pre pinned add elements as child elements to the the target so that just means it's going to be inside the Target and it's going to be a child inside the Target and so I'll show you the same thing with prepend just going to copy and paste this and if we run that we can see prein is inside the target so now we're going to do before and after and as you can see you can chain these methods together pretty easily I'm going to do before but now I'm going to do the class as sibling and we'll put before run that and now it's going to be before the item and then after is pretty much just like that you can also add more than one element at a time so if I just go up to the a pend I'm going to do a comma and I'm going to add another element this time I'm going to add a paragraph element so we appended this child div and then we we appended another paragraph down here and you can also appin prepend do before and after to many things at once so for instance I can select all the paragraph tags and if I run that you can see the word Lots was appended to the end of each paragraph tag and it's in bold and to remove elements and content there are mainly two jQuery methods we have remove which removes the selected element and the child elements and empty which removes the child elements from the selected element so let me show you some examples of that so here I'm selecting the Target and I'm calling the remove method if I just run that the entire Target is going to be gone now we just have the before and after divs that we added before however if we move this remove and put it above when we appended and prepended things uh now it's not going to be able to appin and prein things so so now it's not going to show the before and after because there's no target to add things before and after okay let's move that back down we can also remove all the paragraph tags so now we just have the child and sibling divs left and then the other thing was empty we're going to go back to selecting the Target and I'm going to run the empty method so now the target div is still there but everything inside the target div is gone I'm going to show you one final thing with the remove method we're going to go back to selecting all the paragraphs remove and now I can enter a parameter to filter what's being removed so if I add a class to this paragraph tag now I can actually remove it based on that class so now instead of removing all the paragraphs I'm just going to remove the paragraph that has the filter class so if I run that you can see the filter this paragraph Was This div is a target for all sorts of things and it's not in here anymore okay well thanks for watching my name is Bo KS don't forget to subscribe and remember use your code for good
