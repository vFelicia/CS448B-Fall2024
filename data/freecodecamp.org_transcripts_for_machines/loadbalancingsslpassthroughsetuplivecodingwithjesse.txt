hey everybody its Jessie and today we're going to finish our our load balancer that we started yesterday and we got everything working out but we just needed to get it working with our SSL so we're going to do that today and we're going to use there's two different ways to do that in digitalocean and we're going to use the passthrough technique so the traffic is going to be encrypted even once it gets past the load balancer since we already had SSL setup that seems like it's going to be the easiest way to do things you can also do it a different way where your SSL is set up at the level of the load balancer and then that's where it gets unencrypted and then it goes to your servers that are behind the load balancer so but we're going to do it the first way I I'm getting I'm getting the message here on the stream that the streams not not great so let me know I know there'll be a delay so I'm probably back for about a minute but let me know how this is coming through on your end I am streaming from home again so if you're with me yesterday you know my network is not great I did lower the settings so yesterday yesterday I had kind of too ambitious settings hey Sebastian so somebody is in the live chat sebastian's and then he said hey so I'm assuming that means he can hear me sooner yesterday the settings were too ambitious so I lowered them now so I'm trying to get 720p normally I stream in 1080p but that's from work and the work network is good enough that I could probably do 2k and it would be fine my home network I'm not even sure I can get 720p yesterday the recording I just checked the recording earlier today and the highest that you can even play it back is it 480 which is not great so hopefully it's good enough that you can see what I was doing but not really great so hopefully next week I'll be back in in the office and can stream at my normal quality and hopefully one day I can actually get better internet at my house so I don't know when that will happen but that'll be awesome if it does so before we get started I have a few questions for for you all that are watching now live and that will give everybody a chance to to get in here if they're going to be a few minutes late getting in before we get started so yeah we only have about 22 viewers right now we usually have more than that so okay Sebastian says that the video does keep stopping sometimes so that's the thing okay I've had a good stream status for maybe like a minute now so hopefully it'll it'll stay good yet normally I am I do work from the office I rarely work from home but okay so it is it is lagging Mira says it's lagging as well okay so I'm sorry about that we'll try try to keep going if it gets so bad that it's not you can't even watch it at all just let me know maybe I can try to and yeah I don't know what I can do as far as the settings go you know because I actually did lower them from yesterday so it should be I mean it should be a little better than it was yesterday but if it's just terrible and totally unwatchable I guess you know let me know in the live chat and then maybe I don't know maybe I can mess with the settings a little bit and if worse comes to worse I can just either postpone this till next week or record it and then upload it and then at least at least you can all watch it at some point today but it would just be recording I'd rather not have to do that because I do like being able to do the live chat so all I'll give it a few more minutes just to just to try to test it out here before we try to change anything you just same setting as yesterday keeps buffering hmm alright let me go in let me check my settings here hmm the only thing all right let me I'm looking at my settings right now Patrick says pause my Torrance I don't don't have anything going on in the background I'm gonna do I'm going to do a speed test really quick to see maybe maybe my Internet's just slower than normal I mean it's the same time of day as yesterday it ought to be I mean also be comparable so this once I get my my upload speed that should maybe tell me what I should set my my bitrate at it's not looking great 1.5 upload yeah I was getting twice as much as that yesterday for upload but still right now I only have my bitrate set at 1500 so that should I guess it should work let's uh I guess I can mess with my bitrate I'm not I'm not super knowledgeable about OBS I'm gonna bring this over actually so you can you can see what I'm saying hopefully assuming the video quality is good enough for you to even see this so these are my settings normally the settings you know that I have this set a lot higher but it should even with the upload speed that I have from the test that I just did the 1500 bit rate should be okay and that's the minimum that you need to stream 720p I can't change so as far as the YouTube settings go I actually can't go back and change the the ingestion settings as far as the like what I set the the bitrate at so like I said it for 720p minimum 1500 kilobits per second so I can't change that hmm that said I'd have to actually end this stream and start another one I'm going to start another event so yeah and I'm looking here at my my stream status I'm not I'm not actually hitting that 1,500 I'm coming close but I'm not hitting that I'm definitely under it okay I just I just popped up over while now I hit 2,000 it's just really it's lagging on 360 okay so in the live chat I'm saying it's lagging on 360p yeah it's it's actually it's all over the place I'm watching the stream the status here you know on my machine and I'm getting anywhere from 2,000 kilobits per second all the way down to like 700 and I was 600 it's just bouncing around like crazy alright well at least before before I change this or do something else let me at least ask a few things that I did want to ask you at the beginning here and one is I got a new microphone and I just set it up so I'd like to know if this sounds better or worse than what I had yesterday and what I normally have so normally I just used the builtin mic that's built into either the the iMac or MacBook Pro but I did buy another mic it just came in yesterday I set it up so it was on sale it was pretty cheap so I thought why not it had good reviews on Amazon I thought you know it at the very least it might be a little bit better than what the builtin mic does so just let me know it might be hard to tell since the video quality is so the string quality is so bad right now also I had I had someone comment on the colors that I was using saying is really hard on their eyes so I at first I thought they were talking about my my code editor but then I realized after they posted an example of something that would be easier on the eyes that the background color looked pretty much exactly the same so I think maybe they were talking about my terminal so I switched it up so this is what I normally have is black just completely black background and I think that was just the default dark theme that came with item 2 so I changed it a little bit and made the background more grey I don't know if if anyone else has been having that issue where that's been hard on them hard on their eyes to see let me know I don't have a problem keeping it with this gray this actually matches a little bit better with my code editor anyway so I may just keep it like that but I just wanted to know your thoughts on that should I change it to something totally different is anybody else having issues with seeing things the only other things I wanted to do I had Oliver on Mensa on Twitter requested that I just go over the WordPress API just a little bit about how I'm getting data from there so I thought I might take a minute to do that so we'll see but assuming this stream is watchable I will do that otherwise maybe I'll just make a video and I also had a comment this is last last question I also had a comment yesterday saying that I sounded a depressed so I wasn't depressed but it may it got me thinking maybe I sound depressed all the time when I do videos and I don't want to because I'd rather sound happy or at the very least like neutral and not depressed because I don't think it would be enjoyable to listen to somebody who sounded depressed the whole time so let me know if it does seem like I sound depressed alright so I'm getting some feedback so it looks like Patrick and Sebastian say the the mic sounds good so awesome I mean I'm not I'm just talking so I'm I'm not really expecting like you know I need excellent quality sound I mean maybe if I if I keep streaming and I get you know people watching at some point maybe I'll get like an actual like a really good mic but for now I think this is this is fine I've really haven't had complaints about the the audio quality and Patrick also says plus 1 4 WP API so I think I'll I will go over that then let's see I'm gonna check out the stream stats just to see what ok Sebastian says it is cutting the sound occasionally but that's probably a video problem also a Sebastian also wants to know about the WP API ok cool I didn't realize so many people were interested in that I would have would have done more with it so it looks like most there are some people that are getting a 720p stream it doesn't it doesn't say how good that stream is how much buffering but at least the majority of people are actually getting a 720p stream right now some are actually getting like really low like 240 I'm going to here's what I'm going to do I'm going to attempt at least to go over some WP API stuff and I'm going to blow up the the text I'm going to increase the font size as big as I can ok Sebastian says the delay delay for him is only about 5 to 10 seconds I can there was a setting I wonder if I can get to it there was a setting about whether I would go for low latency or less buffering and I almost I always pick low latency so that there's less lag time between what I am saying annoying and and when you see it but maybe I should if I can still do that I'm going to try to switch that back to less buffering I don't know if some of the settings are locked in and you can't change the after you've made the made the video actually I can't change this so I'm going to switch it up for less buffering hopefully that makes a difference so I've saved that I assumed that'll that'll go a take effect immediately so there may be more of a delay than normal between what I say and do and and when you see and hear that but hopefully that will there'll be a little less buffering okay DAW says it's good for 720p Patrick went down to 480p and it's buffering less okay so oh I'm sorry about that like I said normally if you're just watching and you haven't watched my earlier streams this is an anomaly here I don't normally stream from this location usually there's no problem with the stream you can stream @ 1080p and as long as your connection is okay it'll be fine today I'm just on a bad connection so next week it'll be back to normal I'm just um I have a pink eye right now I got it from my kids or conjunctivitis whatever you want to call it and it's very contagious so I don't want to spread it around to my coworkers so that's why I'm working from home so so I'm fine to work I don't feel sick it's just my eyes are really red and swollen so anyway I should be fine by next week and and everything should be back to normal so let me go over the the WordPress API just very quickly probably just about five minutes mears's says there's hardly any buffering on 144 P but I feel like I need new glasses yeah awesome so if you wanted to to perform really well drop it down to 144 p and and that should work so alright but let me bring up I know I already have open on on one of my tabs one of my screens somewhere I have the WordPress API stuff open to see it alright so I'm going to bring this over on this screen just so you can see this is the output that I get from WordPress in JSON format and let let me make this as big as I can so this is the the parsed version I mean this is really how it comes just this big string here but it's it's JSON data and you can see I get this this is a custom post type that I set up it's the major event custom post type so basically I get the title I get the content of the post here including the HTML tags and then I have some custom things coming in just from some plugins that I did so one plugin I actually made myself and then the other plugins I found that other people would made to work with the WordPress API so I get some extra data about my images that I have attached to this this post and just some extra fields I'm using the advanced custom fields plugin I get some extra fields here that I added in here so this is what it looks like I'll show you in WordPress what I have going on okay yeah let me show you it's not if you have a newer version of WordPress so let me show you really it's the plugins that that matter so I'm not I don't even have everything active yet so I have some plugins that are for for caching and things that I don't even have activated yet but I will activate it at some point but it used to be met like a year ago if you wanted to use the API you actually had to download a plugin to activate the API now it's part of WordPress core so you don't if you have WordPress and you've updated and updated it anytime probably within the last few months or so then you already have the WordPress API it's already working you don't have to do anything to get it to work all you have to do is go and I'll go back here just briefly I know it's going to be hard to see this so I'll read it out as much as I can here this is just the address of my wordpress site which in this case is WP KDK Dexcom and then you type in slash WP JSON / WP / v2 and then you probably don't you you may not have any custom post types but you will just have regular posts or pages so if you type in slash posts then you'll get the list so if you went into your browser right now and you had a wordpress site running and you typed in what I what I just said then you would automatically get a list of your post in JSON format so it's that easy and in fact if if you don't have a wordpress site running in you act you typed in what I have here for this WordPress site you would be able to see it as well this is totally open it's you know it's public publicly accessible so it's it's super easy now I've customized mine a bit so I'm using the advanced custom fields plugin to add some fields to my post type so I've I've added in some custom post types myself with and that's the only plugin that I did you know completely custom it's the the to actually make the custom post types I did it in a plugin and I can show that I'm lucky I wonder if I have if I still have it up and I haven't closed it out I'll show it looks like I closed it out so maybe maybe I'll just show a little bit of it but if the quality is bad it's going to be hard to read it anyway so when I when I get down to that plugin maybe I'll show you a little bit of code how I did it so basically I'm using advanced custom fields and then I have this extra plugin to just expose those fields to the REST API which is why I can see them in my API I normally by default the API doesn't give you the URL of the image it just tells you hey here's an image and here's the you know the number of the image so it's not really that useful so I have this better featured images that gives me a lot of extra data about the images and URLs for all the different sizes of the image that exists so it's a a lot more useful here's the the custom plugin that I made so let's let's go to the editor screen on this just to show you what it's like so making a plugin in WordPress yourself is super easy you just pop this stuff at the beginning I mean you got to have the you're p8 it's it's all in PHP so you have to know a little bit about PHP at least and you just put this stuff at the beginning just to name your plugin a little description and author name and then here I actually I left this in comment it out just as a template just to show so if you want to do a custom post type you just use the function create new type and then you can set up all your labels so these labels like this is how it'll appear in the in the admin panel okay so however you want it to display that's how you you put it up just on the back end in the admin panel for WordPress and then these here are more like what it will actually do like what the slugs going to be how it will show up on the API and and if you're doing some other PHP code with it you can tell it what it supports so what fields you want it to be able to use of the normal field so in this case I wanted to use the title field I wanted it to be able to use the the regular editor the excerpt field and then the thumbnail you can assign it taxonomy x' and you can also do custom taxonomies if you want so i actually did in this case I had some custom taxonomies one name brand one name body material options this was I pulled this from another site that I did I just copied the same plugin and changed I just edited it to fit what I needed for this site you can exclude from search if you want this one you need it's a show and rest we do want it to show up in the rest api so we hit true ok we want it show up in the menu as well so that's it and that's basically you make a post down here below you need to let me scroll down so at the very end you need to add the action ok so you need to create the new type so you don't have to do it every time you see I just put all these together I lump them all together and then I just did it once I also did some taxonomy so I'm not using custom taxonomies for this site but I had them it was already in the plugin so I just left it in commented out in case I in case I really you know wanted to use it later on it would be easy so this is how you do a taxonomy it it's pretty similar you know you're just setting you know here's how it's going to display and you know here's some of the values I want to show it and rest I want to show it in the menu all here's what the slug is going to be and so not not terrible to do if if you if you see it done once you can just copy and paste and change the values and it's it was super easy this is just a little custom thing that I needed I didn't want to display the normal title field in my post my custom post I wanted it to be different so this like automatically changes that so but that's that's pretty much it for that plugin I'm going to check the live chat just in case I've totally lost somebody okay yeah no John says buffering has stops on 720p so that's awesome so maybe changing that setting did help a bit ghetto Street says not WordPress yeah this is not going to be about WordPress I just wanted to go over it quickly because I had I had a request to go over the WordPress API just really quickly some of the other plugins I'm using that makes this easier I'm using this filter field WP REST API filter fields this lets me return only the fields that I want so I can make the the response the JSON response that I get from WordPress when I make that call is going to be a lot smaller because I'm cutting out all the things that I don't need I'm only getting the data that I do need so that's really useful pure taxonomy x' this allows me to get normally you by default you don't get a lot of information about the taxonomy x' back you just get the number of like the ID number of that taxonomy which is not that useful if you want the actual like slugs for the taxonomy x' which is more useful you can use this plugin to get to get that I'm talking about like if you want the actual name of the tag instead of just the number of that tag or that category you can use that here's the cash that I have when I activate this the the rest api calls will be cached so it doesn't actually have to go to the database and get the information to put together the the json data once that's already been done it'll be cached and then that will be ready so I'm going to do that I'm going to edit the plugin a little bit because I wanted to when WordPress gets updated I want to automatically flush the cache so that the people editing these posts don't have to remember to flush the cache themselves so other than that small edit which on the github page for this plugin it actually walks you through how to do that edit I'm basically just going to use this plugin as is I just don't have it activated now because there's still a lot of content being added um filter tools okay this just adds in when I first started using the API some of the the way you made an API call was different and then they switched it and I just didn't feel like learning the new way so I downloaded this so that I could keep using the old way so eventually I'll learn the new way and I probably won't use this but for now just save me a little bit of time and this is multiple post types so normally you need to make one call one API call per post type well that stinks because you don't want to have to make another call but also in in next which is what we're using that's that's kind of what we use to bootstrap our react project here their default method of making API calls and having that work with serverside rendering only lets you make one API call so you you want to only make one I'm actually still working on trying to figure out how to make multiple API calls and make that work and I did I read something recently that made me think that it's possible but I haven't been able to get it to work yet so this this helps out because when I on pages where I need to make multiple calls get multiple post types I can get it there so anyway so that's how I have it set up you don't need any of these plugins to make the API work this just makes they all just make it easier to work with the API and easier to customize it you could you could do all this yourself if you were really good with PHP and with WordPress and not use other people's plugins but it saves me a lot of time because I'm not I'm just a very like very much a beginner with PHP so I don't I'm not really confident that I could do all that myself without it taking forever all right so that's it for the wordpress part of this hopefully whoever was interested in the API I I gave you enough here that you could you know get started and work with it a little bit let me know if you have any questions I've been working with it for um at least a year now maybe a little over a year yeah actually it has been more like a year and a half now that I've been working with the API so not nonexpert but I definitely have some experience with it I'll shoot so aim high says too much buffering so it looks like the stream is getting bad again let me check the the status here yeah it's definitely below yeah it's it's getting the the problem it looks like I'm looking at some of the data of like what I'm outputting on my end and it seems like the problem is it's just fluctuating so much on average I'm it's like a decent stream but it it drops down really low and then it'll go up really high back and forth so I'm I'm really sorry about the stream what I'm going to do at this point I mean we actually don't even have that many viewers so I'm assuming that probably the stream is that bad that I'm just losing people because this is way below the normal amount of viewers that I have so I think sorry I was just reading the live chat again yeah the WordPress site is hosted on digitalocean that the site that I just showed you is on digitalocean so I'm going to get rid of this stuff we don't need that the the actual setting up of the the load balancer is for the SSL is going to be pretty simple I think we can get through it pretty quickly so all right since the streams getting worse okay um if it's getting worse than alright let me I think I'm gonna put this up to a vote in the live chat because I'm really I'm torn on this and I can't see what you're seeing so I I'm not really feeling how bad this stream really is if it's that bad I'm gonna put it up to a vote and I'm gonna give maybe like three minutes or so before I make a decision should I go through with setting up this load balancer completely with the SSO and everything even though the the stream quality is pretty low or should I shut down the stream and just do it right now and make a video or option three should I just wait and do it next week whenever I'm at a better connection okay so I have one one vote here aim high says can we reset reschedule the stream I can definitely reschedule it I will have to reschedule for next week because I won't be I won't be able to get anywhere with the good connection until until Monday so I know there's there's going to be a delay until everyone can respond to that question so I'm just going to wait a minute for for that I feel really bad about this I know I even I mentioned yesterday I was going to do this we're going to set up this load balance balancer so I'm really sorry that this is not working out the stream was not nearly this bad yesterday okay Patrick says keep going so we're splitting up okay I'll give it just just a little bit longer to see if anyone else responds okay now it says the stream is getting better see that's it's just it just keeps going back and forth as being really good and really bad I tell you what I think I'm gonna go for it I'm gonna try to get go through this and then after I'm done I'll check out the video and just see what the quality is if the quality is terrible even on the recording then maybe I'll just I'll rerecord it or I'll do it I'll go through it again like maybe when I stream on Monday we'll take like the first part of it and I'll just review what what we did just kind of really quickly and then that way you know maybe there are some people that are getting a decent stream so so let's go for it so if you see here I'm in the basically the same screen we left off at yesterday we had I think we left off here actually so here's our two our two droplets that we had cloned and it's being we have the load being balanced between these two they're both up the only thing that I did differently is I started the the node server with p.m. and on this one it just started just straight out with just the the regular server so basically the only difference is this this is being this process is being run by by p.m. it'll like Auto restart and things like that so not really a big deal and so no no really significant changes so I have linked in the description to this video kind of the the digitalocean instructions for setting up an SSL pass through on their load balancers so if you want to follow along with that or read some more details as we're going then you know go ahead and click that link I'm going to keep it on my other screen so there'll be more room to actually see you know what I'm but right now we were going past step one we've already completed a lot of these steps so I'm going to scroll down all the way to let's go is step three we've assigned okay so step three is assigning the domain name to the load balancer so we have assigned a sub domain to the load balancer so it was test Caddick addicts calm and yesterday I think some people were able to go to that and it worked I was not able to go to that it didn't work for me I think it was just a caching thing so if you go to that and it works great I'm just I'm going to assume that it works because it's not really you just point the you know the a record to to the domain name of the load balancer so I'm going to go back out to the the actual load balancer here just to say so that's the domain name that we pointed to so for me I'm just going to go to that domain name just to show like hey it's working still just to verify that but you should also be able to go to test dot katic addicts calm and it should work like I said it's not working for me all right so now we I'm going to skip step three just for a minute okay we know that we're going to have to point that a record of the main domain name so just catechetical comm we're going to have to point that soon but I'm going to skip ahead a little bit step four configuring nginx to use the SSO so we've already configured this before if you remember yesterday we just commented out all the SSL stuff so to go back in all we have to do is just take out the comment tags which in free nginx config it's just a hash tag so we just need to take out those hash tags and then it should work again we've already copied over all the SSL configs from that that original droplet that's live right now in khattak addicts comm so everything's set up so that's why I say this is going to be actually pretty easy because we don't even have to generate new certificates or anything so almost all the steps we don't need really the only two steps we're going to have to to worry about for this is I think step six which is actually adding the SSL passthrough rule to the load balancer and then we are going to have to point the the correct domain name so this needs to be done quickly I don't want the main site to be down for too long so what I'm going to do first is the first thing I'm going to do is change the records so I'm going to bring this over and this is our our second droplet right now which we have we have it running and I'm going to go in here I'm going to go to that configuration file that we edited and I'm going to enable the SSL stuff again I'm going to do this ahead of time now I'm doing the steps out of order but I want there to be as little downtime as possible so I'm going to do this first and then I'm going to switch the the domain name so I'm going to go in okay Patrick said the test domain worked briefly and then an unexpected error occurred huh that's interesting I wonder what's going on with that's just it's just really odd because obviously the load balancer itself seems to be working and I'm not even getting it saying this site can't be reached I'm getting an entirely different error Patrick whenever you get that error is it like basically a gray screen with just some text right in the middle like centered in the middle saying and unexpected errors occurred okay it works for Sebastian okay so does Patrick's and unexpected errors occur it sounds like it's the error that comes through when when there's a problem with node like there was some type of issue so yeah refreshing it blinks the site and then blows up Patrick can I ask a what browser are you using and do you know what version of that browser it is I'm just I'm thinking maybe there is some some issue with my site that I don't know about I guess I should ask too if you go to catechin xcom without the test does that work for you Sebastian says that error happened yesterday after you set it up alright so I'm not sure I'm not sure what that area is let me um I'm gonna go here on another browser and just to see I just kind of wonder like maybe one of the okay Patrick says never mind you block origin was blocking CloudFlare it works after white listening it okay cool so hopefully we that area is not an issue I guess we'll find out so anyway so let me bring my terminal back over and I know I said at the beginning I talked about changing the color but I guess the when I changed the color it only applied to this one tab so I'm not going to take the time to change it again after fresh okay Patrick is using Chrome it should definitely work with Chrome ok so I think it's going to be fine think it'll work so I'm gonna do the I'm actually gonna check the live chat from yesterday I had it somewhere did I have it here yeah I have it okay so Oh actually I just saw this right before I am right before I started the stream so I just wanted to share this with you all I'm not really looking for work right now but this came up when I was looking at Stack Overflow on something and this looks like an amazing job like the salaries awesome its remote work or if you want to go there it's in Florida which was just a nice place to be all of it just looks really basic like they want basic HTML CSS JavaScript they mentioned like jQuery in here really simple stuff they use WordPress so anyway check that out senior website developer at Central reach they said they're taking as long as you have like two years experience there they're taking that so anyway check that out I'm not affiliated with them at all I just saw that and thought that's a great opportunity I would like to share with you all so I'm gonna check here's the live stream from yesterday so I actually saved the live streams because I don't always get to read everything and I want to make sure that I see everything and can can answer questions in case I forgot so I'm going back here just because there were a lot of good commands that I use yesterday that I want to use again today and I think yeah it was it was something like / you're not gonna I think my fines not going to work for this command because it's altogether I was trying to get around having to look up how to get to the config file and I can't find it for some reason so I will just go in here and try to remember what it was I think I can so um sudo nano um TC and was it engine X yeah it was and it was sites um enabled and then default that's it all right I should have should have more confidence in myself that I remember that so okay so here's our config file so like I said I'm just going to go in here and I'm going to take out all those places where I I commented some things out and then this should make it so that it has the exact same setup as are our main server which is what we want I'm only going to do this for one of these because we're going to we're going to end up deleting the third droplet that we set up because I'm only going to run two so I so can say yeah we should be good when we do these few last few lines and then we should be good and I'm just going to format that a little better alright and that's it that's that's the only thing we changed yesterday so to get out of nano you hit control X and then yes and yeah we want to rewrite that all right so now we need to restart nginx and that I'll probably have to pseudo this sitio no I spelled it wrong there we go okay all right so now this should be set up the way we want it to be able to use the main address that we want with with our SSL so these are we going to do I'm going to say this out loud so I have it right in my head the steps that we need to take because I want them to all to go really smoothly so we have minimal downtime so what we're going to do then is we need to remove we need to point the main domain catechetical comm to this IP address we need to remove the load the the droplet 3 so I'm sorry I'm getting distracted I've gotten calls from my wife and now my my motherinlaw so I just want to make sure everything's all right let me my wife left a message so I'm just going to listen to it well while I'm doing this to make sure that you know none of my kids are got hurt or anything and it sounds like I have like two minutes of just random noise in the background so alright it sounds like my wife accidentally called me and then left left a message sounds like the baby's crying in the background okay so I guess I'm assuming that that's if that was a mistake and then the same thing it seems like my motherinlaw accidentally called me as well and left a message that's an insane coincidence so sorry about the interruption but I was just worried that I got two calls right then since I know that my wife knows I'm streaming right now alright so we're going to remove this this droplet we're going to add our original droplet so we'll have these two and we need to set up the rules the past three rules on our our load balancer okay so let's do that so let me go here let me log in I'm going to log in to our domain name registrar so that we can change where the main names pointing the only good thing is for a lot of people it's going to be cash so if we mess it up some people won't even notice that we messed it up because they'll still be going you know pointing to a different place so we should be okay at least for a little it'll buy us some time normally the the caching messes me up because I can't tell whether I've done something right or not but in this case it may be helpful okay so on my other screen I'm gonna do the login and then I'll bring it over know if anybody else uses UNAM for hosting but their site just seems really slow or not for hosting but for domains I mean okay so here's what we need to do all right hey Thor how's it going Thor just joined us um yeah actually no I'm not I'm not early he said that I'm earlier he's late to a start time was 200 p.m. Eastern Standard Time so right now it's 300 p.m. Eastern almost 300 so we actually haven't gotten through that much yet we had some more technical difficulties which basically just my network is not really great right now but we're at the point now where we're going to point the main domain to our load balancer and then we're going to set up the rules for the SSL pass through and hopefully it'll work so I'm going to go here and copy I'm going to copy this IP address and then I should be the same IP address for this test and that one but just on the off chance that I had it wrong I wanted to copy the original okay so I'm going to save that hopefully I don't get you no calls and messages immediately from people at work saying the site's down what's going on that actually happens really often when I do something like this it's like 30 seconds after it's down somebody happens to look at it all right so that's there let's move we need to move our droplet over let's add our original CI droplet let's remove this droplet okay great and why I see I react down No okay so for some reason that's down maybe the move made it down briefly I can I can go into there quickly if I need to and see what's going on let me at least set up these rules for now because we still have one that that's up and running so let's go actually a thing I just need to go to settings alright and if you're following along in the documentation I believe we're on step 6 yes we're on step 6 okay so we need to go to this forwarding rules and edit those and we need to add a new rule for HTTP and we need to pass 9 I need to not a new certificate I need to pass through there we go and we don't we want port there we go HTTP should be port 443 I'm going to save that rule ok that's been updated and that should be it that should be all we need to do so let me check it out all right so this is at least still working although like I said there could be some caching stuff so that may not be the best test I do want to go back out here to our droplets and see if we still have one down no and that actually came back up so the down time must have just been temporary due to the switch behind the load balancer so what I want to do now is I would like to purposely bring one of these droplets down and make changes also on one of the droplets that I don't make on the other one just to kind of get a test of like is the load balancing really working are we going to have downtime still so I want to see make sure this works like like we wanted to do where we have zero downtime even if one goes down temporarily so let's come over first test and let me go to this original so here's the original I know this is super small so let me make this bigger goodness alright alright so that's a bit bigger probably can do do a little more okay so I can do p.m. to stop next okay so that should be stopped so since that stopped if we go to catechetical comm it's just still work I'm going to click around normally if it stops I can get maybe like 2 or 3 pages that have been cached and with our service worker and then the rest don't work so right now it looks like it's ok I'm going to go in on my other screen in an incognito window and Chrome and try it here as well oh it's not working there so we did get a bad gateway so let's see might have an issue so it's giving us let me bring this over I'm getting a 502 bad gateway error when I try to visit this site from here let me do a another refresh here okay yeah it's it's still working here but I'm assuming that this is some type of caching thing that's making it still work since I'm not getting you know basically since I'm getting the error okay and I'm starting to get some weird stuff happening here okay so let's see something's not working Thor says it's working so are you are you saying the site's working for you I do want to make sure I don't know that these IP adjusters will even work anymore since they're behind the the load balancer all right so I'm not sure what's going on here with that IP address worked and it shouldn't because I did just bring down that that server I don't know why it's still saying it's healthy to should not be healthy what is going on did I not bring that down it should be stopped yeah yeah it's it it stops what is going on yeah this is okay so Thor mentions in the live chat it seems like the load balancing does act actually does not recognize the 502 as unhealthy so that was a thing yesterday we had we had tested it out and it seemed like it was recognizing the the bad gateway error as the droplet actually being down but now it seems like that's not the case so I'm going to bring this back up I'm going to bring this back up and see if I can get rid of that error just to make sure that this is possibly what we're doing now but yeah look at this as soon as I brought that up immediately it started working again so yeah so this tells me at least this hints to the fact that maybe it is not recognizing that so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to shut down nginx so there's this droplet will actually be completely offline it should show up as being totally down so what's the what's the command I'm gonna have to look up the command for how to stop nginx I assume it's just stopped yeah okay so now we should be getting a message that this is down I think it does update automatically I shouldn't have to refresh it but I was just in patient and where they wanted to see looks like something went wrong that's not what I want to see networking domains hmm what happened this is really weird because when I when I go to networking I should get I should get an option to go to load balancers so this is really weird who de Rohan glad you could join us Rohan just joined in the live chat and said said I'm late okay so in case you didn't catch what just happened here the way to get to the the admin panel for load balancing and digitalocean is to go to networking and then there should be an option to go to the load balancer so you'll I'll show you here this is what it should look like I should click networking and then I should have this here what's happened now is that I don't have that it's not showing that at all so I can't even get in to see what's going on I'm gonna go I'm just gonna switch try to figure out something here now as far as I can tell it's still running all right so it's still working because we did shut down we did shut down nginx on our main droplet but on our secondary droplet it's still running so both the node server and nginx are still running so I'm just going to verify that yeah it's still running so it's probably directing everything to there so it seems like it's still working let me know in the live chat if you tried to go there Khattak addicts comm and if it's not working for you but I am a little bit I'm going to leave this up just in case we need to switch back the the test doc addict addicts calm I don't know I mean that's still pointing to a load balancer so me I don't know what would happen if it went that looks like you want to be topless this is my own actually don't even have any droplets going right now okay so I went I've switched to my own account my personal account and yeah so this is what it's supposed to look like I don't know why it didn't work so I'm going to switch back to my work account and go to networking there we go okay maybe it was just some some glitch in the digital ocean UI let's see I wonder if they built this with this is actually react so I don't know if you can see this it's really small but this plugin shows me with this built with so that's pretty cool that this this in fact is a the frontend is react very cool and it looks like they use jQuery and react together just like just like I did on this site so I'm not the only one it uses it even though it's probably better not to all right so let's check out the load balancers it says there's an issue that's that's what I want to say here we go and this should be down okay so what's this is saying Eric connection refused Sebastian says he got an error connection refused when you try to go to the site it's working for Thor for Julio it's working uh and he's in Chile or how do you actually pronounce Chile if you live there is it is it chill a or I think that's how you pronounce it I don't want to be like mispronouncing your country and being disrespectful like that so let me know okay so so it is chilly not chilly okay thank you I thought it was I I remember when I took a bunch of Spanish courses and we would I'm pretty sure that's how it was pronounced in those courses so sorry I mispronounced that at first all right so all right it's decides not working for Rohan I wonder okay Carlo says it's up in Brazil here's what I'm wondering I don't know maybe this is not possible but if like let's say that the old IP address is is cached as where the a records should be pointing to then maybe maybe that's causing an error so for those of you who aren't able to get to the site try this out go to type in this IP address if I'm going to zoom in so you can see it and I'm also going to say it just in case you can't see this forty 5.50 5.1 19.1 42 because that should regardless of any caching issues that should take you directly to the load balancer if that works for you then then we should be good temporarily they'll probably be some people who can't reach the site until the until the caching has run its course thanks Laura Thorpe that the IP address on the live chat so you can just copy and paste that and let me know if that works it's actually super helpful having so many of you testing this out right here I mean otherwise it would it would be nearly impossible for me to get you know instantaneous feedback from people all over the world on whether or not this was working so so this is awesome thank you okay so Sebastian says the IP is redirecting to Khattak addicts calm which is giving an error for Rohan it did work now alright um so but I I doubt it's it's a browser error but on the off chance that it is web browser are you using Sebastian and I'm going to try I'm just going to try it out in some other browsers so my other screen so this should be actually I'll show you so I'm going to use opera now and I set up the VPN to be like as if it's coming from somewhere else so I'm thinking that that should hopefully get over any caching things as well just to check it out okay so that's working and I think I can set let's set it to come from somewhere really far away from where I am so let's try it from a Singapore okay so that's working cool it's actually why they're not loading there should be an image right there so I'm not sure why it's not loading that image because that's the wrong that's the wrong URL oh I see what happened I recently edited this image I optimized it and so I needed to change the name here and I guess I forgot that I had been using media queries and had it in those as well so I guess on certain screen sizes that image isn't showing up let me test that out by expanding it maybe let me go to an interior page yeah okay so it does work I just for that particular page I forgot to change it I'll have to make sure I change that so I'm going to add that to my list right now so don't forget it add it to the to the Trello board okay okay so Sebastian said he tested on Chrome an edge so I'm assuming it doesn't work on either one Thor says it's definitely a DNS cache error which I'm hoping it's that because then that means I didn't do anything wrong and it'll just resolve itself with time rohan says if he uses 4g and row on i'm assuming that this is a he correct me if if you're not a he but I'm assuming Rohan this is a boy's name so so on 4G it won't load but it works on the the home broadband okay so yeah so this does seem like I agree with Thor here it does seem like a DNS thing since there doesn't seem to be I mean it's it with browsers and everything okay so Rohan is in fact it's it's he feel awesome sorry about that that's just not really a common name where I'm from so just wanted to be sure I've only heard the name Rohan two other times and one is from the the country in Lord of the Rings and the other one is a character's name in a cartoon Melissa called Legend of Korra that I watched it with my kids okay Sebastian asks he said yesterday we set up a load balancer on react to and react three but now it's on CI react in C Iraq too and it does work on Sebastian's fund okay so I'm going with DNS error so I'll probably check it again but only on 4G it works so what we'll do is it won't really work for me to keep checking it since it is working for me I guess I could try it on my 4G quickly just to see since I can't get the error I won't be able to check but what we can do is on Monday when I stream on Monday then if any of you can join me on Monday as well then especially those of you who are having the errors now we can see if you still have the errors or if they work because by the time Monday comes around if it hasn't sorted itself out then I have to look for a different different cause for the error because it definitely should have sorted itself out by then so right now I'm checking on my phone on my 4G network okay so it does work on my network so there's really not any good way that I know of for me to test this error since I can't recreate it so it's it's just going to have to wait I'm just going to have to give it some time and check it out but anyway to answer Sebastien's going to question confusion so yeah what we did and let me go back to this just in case you didn't you didn't catch what we did you didn't see it maybe you're just joining in a little bit later so initially did we ever turn that back on I don't think we did let me turn that back on because there's no reason for that to be down right I felt yeah we did turn it back on maybe it just wasn't showing up oh we turned off nginx I need to start nginx again so no I spelled it wrong didn't I there we go okay so hopefully that will come back on here in a minute so what we did was for testing we were using react the CI react to and then we had a CI react three but we had gotten to the point where I mean it's pretty confident that the load balancer was working we were able to go to the IP address of the load balancer it worked when one was down so that part was working I couldn't really test very much else out and that set up it was time to test out the SSL so this is now set to run this is the main droplet that was on I honestly could have just used two and three and not brought this in and left out too it was just I would rather have it be CI react in CI react to rather than two and three so it's just kind of a naming thing for me but it definitely could have worked with the other ones I didn't have to pull that one out so I guess to be honest with you in hindsight it may have been better to just set it up on two and three redirect everything and then that way at least if the DNS was still going to the IP address for this droplet it still would have worked so that may have been a mistake on my part I probably could have avoided some downtime if I would have just kept it going with the two and three I just it was just slightly less work for me because I wouldn't have to go in and edit the config file for nginx for the CI react three so so actually thanks for asking that Sebastian because now after I kind of talked through that I realized that that that was a mistake I should have left this one as is so that it could handle any other requests coming from if this this IP address was still in the DNS cache so I could probably move this out again and it would work I wonder at this point if it's even worth it because the cache should not last for that much longer Oh Patrick says he has a nephew named Rohan in my neck of the woods which is Pittsburgh so yeah I'm actually really close to Pittsburgh my wife and kids are in Pittsburgh right now so really a short drive depending on traffic takes me maybe like a half an hour to get into Pittsburgh from where I am so Rohan says it's a common name here in India most people from Europe or stateside call me Ron okay cool I mean I'll probably call you Rohan I don't have a problem with that I like the name oh okay Sebastian says now that I turn enginex back on it does work so I want to actually am really curious to see if I can reach this site from the IP address though and I can okay so I take back what I just said about three minutes ago I had thought that I've made a mistake by doing this but it seems like you actually still can reach this droplet with the IP address for that so I guess it works so I guess it would not have made a difference and this was still probably the most efficient way to do it I mean really only saved me maybe a minute and a half of work to do it like this as opposed to keeping the third one but yeah okay so we have them both healthy now what I need to remember to do though so if you remember the original intent of me doing this load balancing was to avoid any downtime when I updated the site because I had 30 to 45 seconds of downtime whenever I was rebuilding the react app so I wanted to avoid that downtime so I figured if I set up load balancing I could update one droplet and then all the traffic could go to the other droplet and then I would switch droplets update like that the problem is that the load balancer is not recognizing when I take node down because nginx is still running even though it's giving an error it's running so what I need to do is add another step to my update process where I actually shut down nginx in addition to shutting down node that is not really going to be a big deal because I have all my commands chained and I literally just copy and paste a big chain of commands when it comes time to update and I don't need to do anything and then I will probably find out a better way to update in time right now I just haven't decided on anything but I'm going to look through some of the suggestions that I was given yesterday and the live chat as well so this should work out I just need to add a step and I thought I think we've accomplished what what I wanted to accomplish and this actually did take longer than expected but a lot of that was just due to the technical difficulties on my end and just kind of more testing and making sure everything was working all right so we've reached the end I'm quickly going to go through and check and see if there's any questions in the live chat that I missed I don't remember really seeing any questions but you never know III definitely could have missed it so at this point if you were just here for the setting up the load balancer and you don't really care to stick around for the questions thanks for watching and I'll be back on Monday at 2 p.m. Eastern Time I'll post the topic on on Twitter sometime on Monday to let you know what I'll be working on then otherwise if you have any questions put them in the live chat now and I will I will answer if you don't want to put your question in the live chat you can put it in the comments below the video and if you don't want everybody to see your question just direct message me on Twitter my the link to my Twitter account is in the description for this video okay so I'm checking the live chat most of it at the beginning is just you all helping me to figure out if my if my video was was any good if the quality was any good looking through this chat it's just crazy it's like a wave between it's working it's not working it's working it's not working so sorry again for that I know I apologized already but I do feel really bad the shot really that much I could do about it I can't I got a stream from home today okay so I've got through pretty much pretty much everything in the live chat now I'm just going down okay Sebastian said he sent me a DM okay I'll check that out as soon as the streams over unless you want me to check it out now and answer you on the stream let me know Martin asks what is SSL so SSL secure socket layer correct me if that's not the right term so basically like when you go to a website and it has the little green like HTTPS with the lock on it it has an SSL certificate all right that basically it's showing that the data is encrypted and I see some of you are already answering Martin as well so make sure you know check out the answers here because there are a lot of very knowledgeable people in the live chat right now but yeah that's what you need if you want your website to be encrypted and to have HTTPS PS show up instead of just regular HTTP you need an SSL certificate I did do a video I think two weeks ago where I set up an SSL certificate so check that out it's when I was setting up initially setting up the servers if you want to know more about how to set it up and I went through how to set up a free SSL certificate there are paid ones that you can get yeah Martin don't worry about it I asked for questions so you can certainly look out up if you want but I don't mind answering it right now yeah so yeah Martin so that's I mean that's pretty much all I know about SSL so I don't know any of the details about like how the encryption works or anything like that but if you have if you're taking any type of user data like in a forum or something or like especially credit card data definitely want to get an SSL I recommend having an SSL on any site now because of search engine optimization I Google search engine ranking algorithm is always like clouded in secrecy but we know that having an SSO is a factor we don't know how big of a factor it is but it could you know potentially help your rankings your search engine ranking so I recommend it for that I also recommend it for just in general like confidence in browsers now you know it's definitely very visible whether site has an SSL or not so even if you're not gathering user data your users are going to feel better on your site I mean not everybody but I certainly feel better on sites that that I see have the SSL especially because you can get an SSL for free now it just almost seems like you know if I go to the site where there's not an SSL I wonder like why didn't they take the time to do that because it's so easy to set up now and it's free you know you may as well just do it so even if they're not gathering my data it just does make me wonder like it's such a small thing and it's so common now like you know you think that they would take a step you know that just a little extra step to make you feel more comfortable so I definitely recommend it like if you're doing a commercial site a hundred percent recommend it but if if you can spare a few extra you know minutes and really depending on who you're hosting your site with it can be as simple as just a few minutes to set it up sometimes it could be a little bit longer but I would say you know it's probably not going to take any more than an hour to set it up even if you're doing it for the first time it's really it's really simple I will say this though depending on who you host your site with they may not allow you to do the free SSL you may have to pay for one I know I have some stuff hosted on shared hosting with GoDaddy and at least the last time I checked I was not allowed to set up a free SSL certificate but on other shared hosts like SiteGround I am able to setup a free SSL and they make it really easy I just have to click a button and they handle everything for me so it depends on your hosts certainly if your hosting with digitalocean you have full control over your server you have you can set it up it takes a little bit more work but you can set up the free SSL let's see I'm just checking the the chat again yeah so Mark Martin and Thor are having a little disagreement here I'm just I'm just going to weigh in a little bit I mean Thor III definitely I understand where you're coming from but at the same time I did ask for questions so I'm not I'm not mad at all at Martin for asking a question that may seem to some people like kind of an easy question because I mean I would always just keep in mind like you don't you don't know where people are at so it seems like an easy question one person may not at all seem like an easy question to another person so especially if you've never worked with SSL before like you know a few years ago setting up an SSL certificate was a really difficult question to me now that I've done it you know I don't know six maybe six times maybe more on digital ocean and done paid certificates and stuff it doesn't seem like a big deal to me but you know you just can't expect it this is my opinion now obviously I'm certainly open hearing other opinions but I don't necessarily think it's fair to expect people to know whether or not a question is an easy question or not so definitely because I asked for questions and the topic you know the title of this video has the word SSL in it so to ask a question like what is SSL is definitely relevant to this so so just so everybody knows I will take any question pretty much on here and I'm not going to get mad if you ask a question that I've answered before or that seems really simple it doesn't bother me at all I used to teach high school so I'm like almost positive I'm not going to get a question here on this channel that is that is worse than some of the questions that I got when I taught high school I mean I love my students but occasionally you would just like get the craziest stuff so that's my opinion you know I'm not worried about it and Thor I'm not trying to say that you're wrong about it you're certainly entitled to your own opinion you might have your own experiences with that so but at least on this forum on my on my shows feel free to ask whatever you want and I'll do my best to answer it Rohan says I know this is a this is from a project but I'd love some regular back end and maybe networking walkthrough stuff there aren't many good quality stuff out there and most of them are really old all right cool that's good to know I do have a list of topics that I would like to make videos on probably not live streams my live streams are always just going to at least for now they're going to be related to whatever I'm working on that day because the idea behind these streams were I want people to see what my daytoday work is like because I think it'd be useful for people who are interested in frontend development or people who just like me were kind of a lone to see what it's like for other people to do their jobs so want to keep the livestreams like that but I would love to do something like prerecorded videos of on specific topics and have them be a little bit more focused sometimes the streams can be all over the place because I'm answering questions and stuff so it's a little bit scattered and I know that probably is annoying to some people you know they don't have a lot of time they want to come to learn something specific and then they hear me going on and on about some totally different on the live stream so I'd love to do some videos that will be more focused and hopefully a little bit shorter but more to the point on specific things so I will add your suggestions Rohan to that list I just haven't got to making the videos yet because I've been working so much on this site now that it's actually launched and I'm just kind of I still have a long list of things that need to be added and changes that need to be made but I don't have to go it's quite near the same pace so now I will be able to start making some of those videos I actually wanted to sort them this week but then I couldn't go into work and at home it's just way too noisy with all my kids and everything the only reason I've been able even do the streams is because my wife has taken the kids somewhere else during the stream time so I should be back into the office next week and should definitely be able to get some of those videos made and those will be on the list some some more backend networking things I'll have to do my homework on it as well because that's not what I normally do but I'll try to do my best and I get you some good information yeah good point Rohan I didn't mention that CloudFlare Rohan says CloudFlare and let's encrypt are really easy and free for SSL so yeah so for this particular project I used let's encrypts to set it up and there are some there's some really good documentation from digitalocean on how to set that up so if you just literally if you look up and I think I link to this in some of my previous videos about setting up a server so you can check that or if you search digitalocean how to set up an SSL and then just put like the name so if you're using nginx a how to set up as a cell with nginx using Apache say how to do with Apache you'll find an article with it try to find one of the newest one is and then it'll take you through step by step it's super easy I've been able to get a plus scores for my SSL certificates just from following some of the instructions on digitalocean so yeah try that out don't spend money on an SSL unless you really have to because the free ones are are certainly they do the job also CloudFlare that would be even easier to set up so check out CloudFlare you can route your your name servers to CloudFlare and then point them once they're there CloudFlare then you can point your your a records to your server so all the traffic will go through CloudFlare so between the client and CloudFlare servers everything will be encrypted and then you don't even have to have an SSL on your own servers now the traffic between CloudFlare servers and your servers will be unencrypted if you do it like that but at least from a client's perspective it'll look like you have everything encrypted and if you're not really taking any data from the client then that's that's certainly an acceptable way to do it I wouldn't do it like that if I was taking credit card information but but that's definitely an easy way to do it okay cool it looks like Thor and Martin have kind of come to maybe a little agreement here and things have kind of cooled down so I thanks thanks guys for for working that out I like to see everybody getting along because I mean we're all just trying to learn and help each other here anyway so I mean not that arguments will arise I mean we're all just Rogers people right we're not perfect so arguments are going to happen but I don't I don't want to see the live chat for my shares turn into anything that's kind of like aggressive and people feel like they they can't be open and asking things so this at least should be a nice place for people who of all skill levels to come and not feel like they need to be ashamed of what they know or don't know so Rohan's now says I can learn the basics online but there aren't really any intermediate level stuff out there there's just basic and over the top expert level stuff yeah I definitely understand what you're saying there it can be hard there's a lot of basic stuff that's really easy and and you feel accomplished you know you do the the basic tutorials and then yeah you're right there's stuff out there that's just super hard to understand in at eye level though how do you get from one point to the other so yeah I mean if if this if my stuff can be kind of that intermediate thing because honestly I would consider I would consider myself to be entering into that intermediate level you know I've been doing this for a while you know I've been making a making sites the sites work you know I'm getting good feedback from them so I'm definitely past that beginner stage iving you know I'm not in the you know tutorial level of doing you know like code Academy tutorials and stuff which there's nothing wrong with those I did all the code Academy tutorials and occasionally I still go back to them if they do a new one but you know I'm past that level but I don't I'm not at the level of like getting pool requests accepted into major projects on github and things like that and really like you know doing some cutting edge you know amazing stuff so hopefully I can you know if there's not good resources for that level out there hopefully this can be a good resource I definitely want this to be useful to people with if it's not useful then I'll probably stop doing it so if there's uh okay uh rhoann add one more comment I think this will be the last comment unless somebody else says anything and then we'll wrap it up Rowan says he's a student and can't afford all the like the intermediate courses that are usually too expensive so I agree with you there I shine away from the paid courses not that I don't feel like they're valuable or I don't want to can you know I'd love to contribute to somebody who's putting their time and effort into something really useful you know so I'm not saying don't pay for courses but for me like you know I'm you know I got a family I got four kids and a wife and everything if I don't need to spend money on that that means more money that can go towards my family so and I'm not I'm not wealthy at least by American standards so yes I mean I'm always looking out for the free stuff you know as long as it's good so yeah my stuff I don't have any plans to make any of my stuff paid at any point I mean maybe like maybe at some point if I really want to do like some of those affiliate link things that you see people do I don't know but I don't have any plans to make money off of this so it's going to be free at least for the you know foreseeable future I mean maybe if I started doing this a lot like if most of my day was taken up by this kind of thing then it might make sense to do some paid stuff but at this time you know even if you don't have that much money I'll I'll at least help you out as much as I can Martin mentions out of college for a year and in the same place with meaning like in that intermediate level above the tutorial level can't get a job called college 100% way CS decrease don't anything yeah so I am I also I don't have a computer science degree I have a business degree so if I think I mumbled that last thing a little bit so Martin's comment was college 100 was 100 percent waste and CS degrees don't do anything so I can't comment directly on that because I don't have a CS degree but I did it do you have a business degree I will tell you I would not have been able to get the job I have now unless I had a degree it didn't have to be a computer science degree but I had to have some degree now I do work at a university so they're a little bit at a university everybody has to have a degree right and I've actually had opportunities and been asked if I was interested in teaching this I can't teach because I don't have my masters so I can actually get hired to do this job for the university but I can't be hired to teach people how to do the same job so I mean I think it has to do with accreditation or something so I'm not upset about it anything I'm not really sure if I'd want to teach anyway but there are some places that will require a degree no matter what even if it if it doesn't make any sense so in that sense a degree is not necessarily a total waste also I would say depending on the program a computer science degree wouldn't be a total waste there are definitely some programs in call in schools that are very prestigious and the companies will see and they'll be impressed that you got a degree from that particular program like near me there's Carnegie Mellon they have a really good reputation I know the top tech companies frequently hire people from Carnegie Mellon both students and professors from Carnegie Mellon so and there are other schools like that you know probably it throughout the you know the United States is probably you know also throughout the world so depending on what field you're trying to get like you're obviously trying to get a tech job but you know if you want to get into a specific field like if you wanted to get into education you probably need a degree probably government as well they would look more to degree so I just kind of depends so I wouldn't I wouldn't say it's a hundred percent of waste I I would not go back and get a computer science degree at this point the only way I would I would see computer science degree being of value to me right now is if I wanted to teach I would go get my master's in computer science so just it does kind of depend what your goals are and where you're at already but but it would be more or less useful depending on where you're at Roland says yeah I mean last year degree was a total waste so it's either stuff I already knew or old stuff that nobody cares but having a degree is very important in Asia okay okay so Hardin says schools like that are all about prestige and grades and stuff I thought I would see students as the stuff didn't appeal to me yeah that's true to get into really prestigious schools you do have to be like really good with the grade so that is not for everybody to get into so yeah but I think the any degree can at least be helpful because there are still some companies some institutions out there that will refuse to hire somebody without at least a bachelor's degree so that being said even if you got a degree in anything it could still be helpful now the nice thing about this field is there's a lot of places that do hire without a degree so if you don't have the degree don't worry about it you can probably still get a job if you do have a degree then that gives you a little bit more opportunity than the people that don't so it's probably not a total total waste but it's actually I'm actually trying to address that at the school I'm at I'm working on setting up internships for the computer science students to work on these same projects that I'm working on so they can get some realworld experience and some things in their portfolio because if you just go through your computer science classes and you don't do anything extra you would have the degree but you wouldn't necessarily have a nice portfolio and that's what companies care about more I think a lot of companies care more about the what work have you actually done I know where we're hiring a web developer right now at my university and I'm involved in the hiring process and I've been sorting through resumes and for me personally I don't care where the degree is from at all I don't even look at that part of the resume it is a requirement yeah I think a degrees a requirement there might be an exception for like if you have a lot of experience you don't necessarily need to have the fouryear degree but I don't even look at it what I want to see is do you have a link to your github profile if not automatically I'm a little bit skeptical because I think you know what one does this person not even know what github is do I really want to have them working here or two if they do have a github but they don't have any code on it or they're embarrassed by the code and don't want to tell me about it then what does that say so work on definitely work on your portfolio regardless of whether you're in a computer science program or not because that's going to be the the most important thing okay Martin says I'm probably going to wrap this up soon because it's been a really long stream so just a few more comments Martin says grades are nonsensical measure of absolutely nothing as that's harsh I mean that but you are right in a sense I don't necessarily think grades are a good indicator of your success on the job all the time I know I have I have a family member who I helped out a lot in high school and in college to help him get the grades enough to pass and like it was just barely passing and he's had no problem getting jobs right off the bat you know getting jobs good jobs and it's able to just move from job to job getting better jobs and he's great at it and he was never great at school I was I graduated at the top of my class in college where they call it assume summa laude a so top of everything for six months I couldn't find a job at all the first job I got was a assistant manager at a Burger King it's a fastfood restaurant so and I actually end up quitting that job in a few months and taking a job as a waiter at a restaurant because it was actually better and I could make more money so I definitely say yes like grades are not necessarily a good indicator of your ability to get a job or to do well at a job so so I agree with that Rowan says getting a BS degree this year would love to get a masters degree really only edge about actually getting into it for it I would say row on it just it depends on what you want to do really for computer science related stuff I don't think a master's is worth it in terms of the time and the money it takes to get it unless you have a job in mind that you know needs that master's so for instance teaching would definitely need it or if you know there's a company want to work for that requires that so I would weigh that that out because it's definitely you know your time your your all the money will take to pay for the school but you're also losing out on the money you would make during that same amount of time assuming that you could get a job so it's a big I mean it's a big investment and a big sacrifice to go for that master's degree so if that's what you want and it's going to get you to the place you want to go then go for it but otherwise you know definitely you know do the math on that and weigh that before you make a decision on it yeah Martin mentions shouldn't have to do the extra work went to school to get a job and I completed the steps yeah I think that's like that's the big thing that people are realizing now like I'm um I'm 31 and when I came up through like high school the idea was you know you go to college you put in your time you get your degree you get the job but then as I was starting to get up like later in high school and even into college um started to realize that's not necessarily how it works and then now since I've been out of school what's getting even worse and I think it's the case now that going to college does not guarantee you a job anymore maybe it did at some point in the past but now that is not the case you need to do you know you don't you need to in addition to being in college you need to have good internships and you need to have good connections and you know that's um that's just the way it is I honestly think having good connections is more important than pretty much anything else if you're doing computer science stuff having a good portfolio and work is is probably right up there maybe tied with your connections but that's kind of the way it is so if you're in school now if you're thinking about going to school going to college you know definitely take that into consideration going through college even if you're at the top of your class it doesn't guarantee you anything in terms of jobs it definitely didn't help me in terms of getting a job and you know like I said I wouldn't have gotten this job unless I had a degree but it didn't really matter at all that what the degree was or what I was you know it was just like I had to have it so I'm gonna check back in the live chat just keeps I can't get to the end they're just more keeps keeps coming so let me cut this once we hit four o'clock I'm just going to cut it off because that would have been like that's a twohour stream that's pretty pretty long especially if this ends up being lowquality I don't want to have to have people suffer through two hours of a lowquality stream if they're going to watch this replay somebody asks a sin since in your case oh is that as is their playlist so I can watch this project start to finish yes there is on freako camp's channel there is a playlist it's called live coding with Jesse but the project actually started on my own YouTube channel so I link to that in the description for this video so if you want to start from the very beginning go to my own youtube channel and start with a video that's titled I think it's titled building a website as fast as I can because when I first got this project it was like hey can you do this project in like six days I did get a little bit extra time so that was good but start with that video and I think there's two videos on my channel and then I switched over and got invited to to do live streams on free code camp so now I've been doing on free code camp since then Martin Martin mention he says I'll never get a job world is messed up martin noth I definitely think you can get a job don't get discouraged and I've been there like I've been in your position in terms of being out of school not being able to find a job or being able to find jobs that aren't good that aren't what I want to do I've been there it's really tough and not just when I was out of school there was a time when I had a job for a while and then I quit that job and then I didn't have a job for a long time and I was just taking little side jobs doing websites here and there but we're like lowpaying type of stuff and it was tough and at that point I had kids and everything and then it was really tough because it wasn't just me it was like I felt like I was letting down my family and my wife so I definitely can be really tough when you can't find a job but just you know don't give up and keep trying you know you're going to get a lot of rejection to keep applying to places and keep working on things you never know you know what'll lead to something you know I had a connection that you know my boss my current boss now I had I had kind of known you know I known him we had talked to you here and there we you know we lived in the same town but I actually got involved and we were both involved in the same volunteer organization before I got this job so we had already kind of built up a relationship and he knew he could trust me you know that I was I was a trustworthy person before I got this job so that I think kind of helped things because that's it's really hard to tell from a resume whether somebody's trust with you or not so you never know what kind of connections will will help you so you know just try to try to keep going keep working on projects and you know if you got to take some job that you don't really want to do to pay the bills you know go ahead and do it you never know it may help you out but just try not to get discouraged I know it's easy for me to say that it's but I've been there before so keep working through it you know you'll get something check out the the free code camp forums recently there's been a lot of good posts about people who have come through the same struggle and have finally found something and they talked about how they went about doing that the things they did that worked and didn't work so if you haven't already checked out that forum and read about some of that stuff I definitely recommend it there's some inspiring stuff in there and maybe may be helpful to you someone asks and I'm sorry I can't pronounce this name at all because it's not in the normal alphabet that I I know but is is Moscow State University well known in the USA I can honestly say that that sounds familiar like I've maybe heard it before but I don't think it's well known at least not to me in the USA Rohan says freelancing is great to make portfolio mostly for web devs yeah that's true that's how I built my portfolio up was through freelancing I like I had my own company kind of it so I called it Jessie why go digital marketing but in reality I was pretty much a freelancer so I was able to make a lot of good connections and improve with real work that I got paid for that I could do what you know that could do this job so that really did help when I got the job that I currently have now was being able to show my portfolio and what I'd done and when I was interviewing being able to reference you know hey I had this client before and we worked on this project and this is how he handled it because I did get questions about you know how did you how would you handle this if this happened and I was able to say well this actually did happen to me when I was working on this project and I could talk about what I did so you know freelancing is not freelancing was really tough like oh my family especially on my wife it you know she worried about it because you don't have guaranteed income you know one month you're doing well the next month you know you can barely buy any groceries you know so it's tough but in that in that sense and it's tough because you have to market yourself to people and I never liked that part of the job at all but but it can definitely be a way to get nice a nice experience and get paid okay Kenya says I'm a mathematician I found out that there's more work as a developer than mathematician unless it's in big data and stuff so I started free code camp and it's really good awesome yeah I'm glad that you like free code camp stuff so I did free code camp stuff and I definitely yeah I definitely recommend that I'm actually I never finished my free code camp like all the certifications you can get I really want to go back and do that at some point it's just it's hard to justify taking time to do that what I could be doing work that I'm getting paid for so I still really want to do it someday because I you know I just like free code camp so much it'd be great to be able to have a post one day and say hey look here's my certificate I think that would be cool yeah Kenya uh it's hard I feel very nervous and anxious to find a job I I know how you feel um yeah that nervousness is um that's tough it's tough to get over it's hard to put yourself out there you know and take the chance and then get disappointed with things so just keep on trying you know it gets easier the more you try to do it it'll get easier and even uh you know if you can't try to do something uh like this like I am you know live stream a YouTube video or like a meetup or something like that where you can get out there with other people and it will help you feel a little bit more comfortable I was super kind of paranoid about other people seeing my code I thought like people will see my code and they'll like you know think it's terrible and then like they'll tell my boss there are employers that my code is terrible and then like I just had kind of this irrational fear of that and I remember about a year ago I was at a conference and someone told me I had kind of mentioned my my fear of this because I was even afraid to put my code on github I had stuff on github but it was in like private repositories and they you know they said I don't you know don't worry about it just you know put yourself out there and most people are going to be helpful and so what if some people were mean about it you know just you know don't don't be afraid to do that and I didn't act on that right away but I stayed in my mind and and they're not being really helpful advice and I actually I don't even remember the name of the person that told me that I wish I did but I'm really glad that they they did tell me that and that helped and then now you know a year later not only do I have stuff on github but I'm live coding you know on YouTube which you know it's kind of I guess even more of a scary situation because people can immediately tell me hey you're doing terrible stuff that's never happened but it's been remarkably positive feedback for me and it's it's helped me to get better but yeah I just the only way to get over the nervousness is just to get yourself out there and and just kind of face it awesome rohan says really good talking here um Tony since I have si and usually don't talk too much in chat so I feel good here I'm sorry what's si I'm blanking here what's that an abbreviation for situational anxiety is that maybe I'm not maybe that's it I don't know we'll see actually I am I definitely understand I have a son my oldest son has obsessivecompulsive disorder and has a lot of anxiety and so I have a lot of sympathy if anybody struggling with stuff like that I know it can be just super super hard and I know I'm usually not it probably sounds weird because I'm doing stuff on YouTube now but I like never talk on you know online forms or chats and things like this I'm always like just kind of staying in the background but now that I'm doing more like this I just I wish I would have started sooner okay Rowland says I guess we should start a discord server so or an IRC yeah whatever whatever you all think would be the best way to do this to have a chat it would be kind of cool to have some sort of group to chat where it's you know it doesn't have to be just during the the livestream so let me know what you all decide and so I can I can join up okay so Thor says freako camp already does have a gator thing yeah that's true I forgot about that they do have get her okay Kenya says thank you she's really helpful I'm glad I'm glad I could be of help and you know feel free to ask anything or you can direct message me on Twitter whatever I ask it in the comments I'm more than happy to help FCC jesse is here just created okay cool so is this so we have hash tag FCC jesse sounds good that was created where are we still talking about gator or IRC I'll shoot it looks like the streams getting terrible again so maybe this would be a good time to wrap it up if the streams the stream quality is going down Oh on on freenode okay so so on freenode there is now a channel that's FCC jesse so FCC Jes si which I'm really flattered that the channel has my name in it but so yeah so if anybody is is still listening which we actually have picked up in viewers now it's I'm really surprised that now after two hours we picked up more viewers but not a lot of years not as much as usual but um yeah check it out on freenode channel FCC Jesse and we keep the chat going and I'm going to try to join in and just you know this chat I definitely want to keep it as a very very friendly place where the criticism is gentle and you know everybody tries to get along not in like a false peace kind of getting along like I'm definitely fine with heated debates and things but I just I'm not fine with people being mean or rude so let's so let's all try to keep it that way and keep it really open and I think that'll be the best for people who maybe are a little bit nervous about speaking out and and asking questions or things so yeah so if you watch an hour if you hear this recording and you want a place to go you're a little bit nervous you know check out that you know that channel on freenode and you know you'll get you get some some advice I you know I don't know there's a lot of people in this chat now they don't know what they're talking about and I I know what I'm talking about at least some of the time and so I'll do my best to help out and I'm sure they will too so awesome so I think this was a really productive video I'm going to wrap it up now because well we accomplished what we wanted to accomplish which was the load balancing with the ssl passthrough we also went over the wordpress api a little bit which was requested so hopefully you all got a little bit out of that and if you want to see more about any of that stuff let me know we also got a lot of good advice on finding jobs and kind of getting through that and now we have a free node channel where we can chat even outside the live chat so this is probably you know with a really really productive live chat sorry about the poor quality and if you're watching this video later on i'm sure it's not going to be a great quality either probably only like 480p replay quality so sorry about that they're not all that quality most of the other ones or are at least 1080p so I will be back on Monday at 2 p.m. I like vaguely remember that I might have a meeting on Monday I do have it on my calendar but I'll have to check my email so if I have a meeting during that 200 p.m. time period I will make sure that I reschedule for a different time that same day and I will post that on Twitter to follow me on Twitter if if you want to get that update it will also be like they'll be an update on the free code camp channel so I think it will like pop up if you have notifications enabled in your browser or like on your phone so I so hopefully I don't have a meeting and I can do it as normal time but otherwise I'll still do it I'll see you all on on Monday and have a great weekend you
