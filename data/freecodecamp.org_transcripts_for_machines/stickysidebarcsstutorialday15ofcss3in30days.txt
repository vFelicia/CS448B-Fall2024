hey everybody welcome back to css3 in 30 days today is day 15 and we're going to be coding up a sticky sidebar what is a sticky sidebar and why would you use it well a sticky sidebar is essentially just a sidebar that sticks to the side of the page as you scroll so that the content in that sidebar is remains always visible and the reason why you'd want to do that is maybe you have an optin or a lead magnet a subscription form a call to action maybe an order purchase maybe you have a checkout and the sidebar has the checkout details with the price and the taxes and so on and as you're scrolling down that long page that sidebar remains in view so that you can always see important details maybe even the checkout button something like that there's some there are a few ideas uh to use the sticky sidebar so jump over here in my browser and let's see what that looks like here we simply have a info page we're doing that info page student page and final page convention that we've been doing uh a couple times and essentially this is just the instructions with two buttons one takes you to the student version which you're gonna be playing around with and the final version which you can use for reference let's go ahead and check out the final version just to see what's going on here is the layout we've got a left side left content with long filler text and the sidebar as you can see remains in view and that's kind of interesting you can position it any way you really want and if you wanted to use javascript or you wanted to get even crazier you can wait until you scroll down until this look this part of the page and then you have the sticky sidebar start moving but for this case we're just going to use css and keep it simple and just have that sidebar just remain in its position and it is quite easy it shouldn't take us very long at all here's a student version we haven't done any styles here in terms of laying out the sidebar sidebar is in fact down here with no styles whatsoever and it looks really bad so let's jump over to our code editor make sure you download the sticky sidebar number 15 course files and i'll wait here just a moment for you to go ahead and do that good that should be enough time here in the code editor i'm going to show you what the the code looks like real quick and then we're going to get started so the index file is simply that info page that has the information uh with the instructions you really don't need to concern yourself with it it is the student.html and the final.html are those are the html files that you need to concern yourself with i'll show you that in a sec sandbox.css is where you're going to style things up as usual final.css is where all of the styles are for you to reference just in case you need a little bit of help so student.html looks like this we have a div with the class of sticky sidebar lesson we're going to use that class in a moment it wraps everything including the sandbox div which is the left content and the sticky sidebar div which is the sticky sidebar on the right those are the two two or three elements that you need to know and concern yourself with so jump over into the sandbox.css and let's get ourselves coden coden coding let's get coding let's code sticky sidebar dash lesson sticky dash sidewire dash sticky shard bar luscious width eighty percent we're gonna say margin zero and auto that's just gonna make those things look a little bit like so there it is a little bit less wide then the reason we want to do that is we want to make some space for some things let's carry on sticky sidebar lesson after pseudo element after virtual last child after element whatever we want to call that thing the after display table content empty string clear both what is this everybody it is a clear fix clear fix okay uh and that's just simply to allow the footer to stay put rather than collapsing up when we start floating the next element which is the sticky sidebar lesson and then the sandbox we're going to style this one up it's going to be nice and simple we're going to give it a width 60 percent and then we're gonna we're gonna margin zero zero forty that is zero on the top zero on the left and right forty on the bottom just give it some space from the footer and we're gonna float that left so now if we save that and check it out footer stays put and the this content is over on the left at sixty percent width sticky sidebar is over on the right problem is the sticky sidebar doesn't look right so we're going to style it up real nice and pretty here so let's scroll down and do one last set of styles sticky sidebar coming for you sticky sidebar background we're gonna make it that pale blue color which is e7 ee f1 padding 40 pixels 40 pixels 60 pixels that's 40 in the top 40 on the left and right 60 on the bottom and we're gonna go box sizing we're going to say border box what does border box do it essentially means that the padding that you add to the element doesn't add any width to the box itself it just maintains the the width that i determine and the padding stays on the inside by default when you add padding to a box it increases the width and that causes issues when you're doing math for floating and so on and so forth we want the box to say the same width that we determine and the padding on the inside if this makes any sense whatsoever to to to maintain the same width but the padding on the inside stays within there contained so that's what that does border radius two pixels a nice little subtle all the way around we're going to give it a box shadow and this is just going to be an offset 0 12 pixels 0 negative 6 pixels and then f a 9 0 3. all that's doing is that little 3d effect that offset pale blue shadow makes it look 3d you'll see in a sec here let's go check it out there it is it is over here on the right and it's got that two pixel border radius and then offset shadow but the problem with sticky sidebar is that there's no space in between the two it doesn't look very good and and that is a problem right there so let's go ahead and continue over here we're going to say position position fixed that's going to fix it in place but we got to tell it where to stay put 5 from the right the width will be 36 percent that's to give it a little bit of a gap between the sandbox because we don't want it to be the full width of its of what's left we want to give it some space from that sandbox i want to float that right save that come over here check out the student version sticky sidebar selfcontained when i scroll down it stays put nice and in place and really that is it now i have a little challenge for you if you want to take this a bit further outside of the scope of this lesson but fully something that you should try is make this responsive currently it is not responsive so if i resize this we're just going to have a sticky sidebar that you know it doesn't look very good the text isn't right these these shouldn't be side by side on a mobile device they should be stacked or the sidebar should disappear or whatever it is that you feel necessary i want you to go ahead add some media queries here in your sandbox.css and stack these elements remove the floats remove the position fixed do whatever you feel is necessary to make this look right on mobile devices i suggest you do that as a little challenge see what you can come up with and i hope today's lesson was valuable to you today hope you have a few ideas running through your head of how you might want to use this in your own projects thanks for hanging out for a few minutes and i'll see you tomorrow in day number 16.
