in this video i'm going to talk about effects you can do in jquery we just have a few elements on the page i have an image an h1 tag and then a paragraph that you can see on the page there and i'm going to first talk about the hide event so we'll just type in the jquery selector and then we're just going to do a dot hide and that's it so if i run this code with just the image.hide it's going to hide the image the image just disappears you can see now it's like that image isn't even in the code there and if you need help adding jquery to your website you can check out my first video on jquery where i show you how to add jquery after you hide an element you can show the element so i just have to select it again and then just do dot show and now you're barely even going to be able to tell anything because it's going to hide it and then show it right away so hide and show just hides and show instantly but you can use animation in a couple of ways so you can pass in arguments to hide and show so it won't do it instantly i can pass in slow to make it a slow effect or fast to make a fast effect you can also use normal so let's see what that looks like see it disappeared slowly and then it came back quickly so instead of putting words slow and fast you can also put the number of milliseconds so i'm going to put 500 milliseconds to hide it that's a half a second and then 1 500 milliseconds to show at 1.5 seconds so let's see what that looks like okay so you can really do any speed you want by just passing in a number like that and let's just see what that looks like if i do it on the h1 tag so here i'm going to change this to h1 and let's try that so you can see it looks actually kind of different on the h1 so the show and hide effect use a combination of slide and fade effects with the the slide effect it's actually just changing the height really quickly so it's lowering the height and to zero and with an image when you lower the height it also automatically changes so it changes the width but with an h1 when you change the height it does not automatically change the width so that's why the h1 looked like it was just coming straight down and up and then the image looked like it was going into a little corner so show and hide used slide and fade at the same time but you can also use one or the other so instead of hide or show i'm going to use slide up or i can use slide down so now it's not going to change the opacity at all it's just going to slide up and down and you can still use the slow normal or fast or you can use specific number of milliseconds with this so let's see what that looks like and so it just slides up and down or you can use the fade out and fade in fade out and fade in and you can do a combination of the milliseconds and also i'm just going to put normal here for the amount of time so see it didn't slide at all just change the opacity another thing you can do is the toggle a toggle is just going to change the display based on the current visibility state so if it's currently hidden it will show the content if it's currently shown it will hide the content so we put toggle and this time i'm not going to pass in anything so if i toggle it it's just going to you can see really quick it went off and then came back on it came back on because of the fade in so toggle is just going to make it disappear if it's already appeared but you can also pass in speeds here so i'm going to pass in some milled seconds up at 700 milliseconds let's see what happens now so it's going to hide and then fade in high so it's kind of weird that it's going up and then when you fade in it starts at full height and then the opacity goes 100 but i can also put toggle here using toggle here is just like putting hide or show but it just does the opposite of whatever state it's currently in you can also do slide toggle or fade toggle so if it's slid down it will slide up if it's slid up it'll slide down or fade toggle if it's disappeared it will reappear if it is reappeared it will disappear okay now i want to talk about doing something after an animation completes so if we hide this element and then we're going to do a fade in so i'm going to fade in for a thousand milliseconds so nothing fancy here is just going to fade in just like that and now we're going to do a method chaining so if you do method chaining you can put in a lot of methods at the same time so i'm going to add a class blue now i'm going to quickly go up into the css here and for a class blue i'm going to change the background to blue and you'll see it's going to fade in and it's going to add the class blue so let's see what happens here and actually to make this more apparent i'm going to change the amount of time to 2000 milliseconds so you can see even though the fade in comes before the ag class they basically happen at the same time so this starts to fade in and then adds the class right away before the fade in is even done if you want to defer an action until after an animation has run to completion you need to use an animation callback function so you can put a callback function as the second argument passed any of the animation methods let me give you an example after the milliseconds i'm going to put a comma and now i'm going to put in the callback function let's see okay so now um we have this selector as this and this is just going to apply to what we're doing the animation on which is the h1 and now we're going to add the class blue so let's see what happens now run that so it fades in and then the background turns blue now one thing you can do is stop an animation so what i'm going to do here i'm going to attach a click event to the image the free code camp image and then in the function we're going to stop the animations we select the image tags and the on click will run this function where we select the h1 tag and do dot stop it's gonna stop the animation happening on the image so i'm gonna run this and while it's fading in i'm gonna press the image i just click the image and you can see it's slightly faded right now and it never add the class of blue so if i run this again you can see the full animation run it again and i'm going to click the image and it stops in the animation before it finishes it does not and it never gets the callback function so it never adds the class of blue the last thing i'm going to show in this video is the delay method so if you use delay it's going to introduce a delay between animations so let me show you an example of that so look at the paragraph at the bottom i know there's some other animations happening but when i run i get this again it's going to hide the paragraph for a half second and then it's going to delay for full seconds and then it's going to show for 0.3 seconds so those are the basics of javascript effects you can also do a few more custom effects with the dot animate method well thanks for watching my name is beau
