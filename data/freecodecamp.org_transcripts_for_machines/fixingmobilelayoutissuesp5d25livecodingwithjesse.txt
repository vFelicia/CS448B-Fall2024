everybody welcome to life coding with Jessie today we're gonna get back to work on the main website for Franciscan the University I work for sorry I was a few minutes late I turn it on the stream and I started dropping frames so let me know how the video is I tried turning off a few a few programs that I was working with earlier that I don't need so hopefully hopefully everything will work I was just looking to see if there's anything else I could turn off I don't think I can all right looks like the videos fine hey everybody alright so a little update on some of the projects I think I have for the catechetical Institute site for now I think everything's completed I'm just waiting on some content before I make those changes live I hope that comes in soon because we also updated all our packages and some of those packages that are currently on there are pretty old so I'd love to move to the new updated branch as soon as I can the stuff for the bulletin if you remember I've been talking about the university bulletin that I think is it's like you have to log in to get into it which i think is unnecessary but basically they're still going to be a login so that's not gonna change for now but we made it a little bit easier and was it yesterday stream I think we made it easier to get in so I think that'll be fine it'll take care of most of the issues that some of the users were having and the JavaScript AF site works being done on that so javascript sir that was in here yesterday is doing some design work building out a little bit of the the front end and just some basic HTML Harshit is working on the the server or the api so maybe we'll have something to see with that you know maybe hopefully soon I'm not gonna be able to work that much on it because this projects gonna take up a ton of my time I'm preparing to you know work over over my normal amount of time on this this morning I was just doing a lot of migrating data and who looks like the stream cut the black for a second is it all right now all right cool so anyway I was trying to migrate a bunch of data and some like my eyes are just so dry after staring at the the screen and anyway I'm glad to get back to doing some like frontend work my coworkers are looking in the door alright so let me check the live chat quickly just to say hello and see if there's any questions I should answer right away and then I'll show my screen and we'll get started let's see all right looks like a strange fun for most of you Stephen says today Jesse will be discussing beard care and the two buttons shirt rule ready go I did have my beard trimmed up a little bit when I got a haircut so it's freighting less scruffy than normal all right okay harsh it's adding commits to the PR I'll check out those PRS after the stream alright let's switch it up okay let me start my timer and we'll bring over our projects so I have updated this project this Franciscan react is the repo name I've updated this project too based on the pool request and I don't think there's any outstanding pool requests right now that are completed so I shouldn't we should be up to date I'm gonna double check though yep all the pool requests are in alright so some of the additions we have are the search the search animation works here which is awesome and I believe we went over yeah we went over this I mean yesterday I have some additions here we have a different color here so pretty good I'm happy about that and the pool requests were mainly so rook or nikki has added that search toggle and also those links that we just saw on the drawer also added committees in so when we go to do a commit I'm gonna try out this new way we're doing commits that should help have like a standard for for committing to get so we'll see how that works I think it'll be it'll take some getting used to at first but in the long run it should be should be better all right if I missed any PRS I'm sorry let me know and I'll I will give you credit for any PRS let's see let's see probably five days all right just doublechecking the lights out again so today we want to fix some stuff with the mobile the mobile view I'd mention maybe yesterday that it looks I hadn't kept in mind at all the the mobile view of this and I I don't know why because we should be thinking mobile first based on the audience which is going to be primarily teenagers so today we're gonna try to clean this up and have it be acceptable for mobile I mean you can see right now this is just I think it's just ridiculous so bad and that's I mean that's my fault Wow okay let's start up here with with the header first thing I'd like to do is really remove all of this I'm just gonna remove everything for the mobile version of the header the only thing I might even consider keeping is a call to action but I don't think I'll keep that a thing I'm just gonna get rid of get rid of all of it and then see how it looks if it looks like we might have space to add anything in maybe but we'll check it out we'll see how it goes I'm not worried about the links right so we have all the links here so mobile users aren't missing out on anything they'll snowball the same content the only thing that'll be missing is you know this access fus and button and then these social icons maybe we can add those in here somewhere we'll see I could maybe access fus yeah we'll see maybe we'll add them in the side but first things first let's just get them out of here all right so oops wrong code so let's check up I don't need this right now do we need to let's keep the drawer up I'm not making any queries all right so our app bar is where we're gonna be working at for now so for all these SVG icons I suppose we're just going to take care of this with a media query Stephen says I should do a social dropdown that's interesting idea we'll think about that you say maybe like up in the corner here just have a small icon it can drop down I kind of yeah I'll think about that all right so let's add let's just add in a class here and let's go just uh only yeah let's call it desktop only I mean really this will probably end up being the case for oh no I can't do it in here I need this to be like in a media query I don't think we can do media queries in an object like this right well that's interesting I've I've never come across the the case where I need to make a media query when I was doing this that's really weird I wonder if I wonder if it's your UI has anything built in that I could be using before we make our own it would probably be I guess it would be the fastest just to make our own but I I do want to check oh all right Aniki says that's why I had trouble with mobile styles in that pull request no media queries all right well let's let's see what we can do I don't need pretty much any of this stuff right now I'm Seri lie let's see layouts hidden area here we are ok looks like we have some breakpoints release beta 34 break oh they're breaking changes in beta 30 alright cool off to check that out I open that in a new tab for now all the mounts are visible unless they are explicitly hidden universe' ranger grateful all right so they're bringing in importing hidden and then let's see what using it they're just wrapping hidden okay so wrapping the component and hidden so let's see I'll probably give the children will be hidden at or above we won't want the up we want it down probably most likely for what we're doing here so maybe medium and down then we doublecheck the live chat see if missing anything all right cool harsha do is mentioning that there's that hide component alright cool well let's let's do that let's grab our hidden will import hidden and bring it in up here oops I'm sorry this is so small I was working earlier so I had it really small sorry about that hopefully straining your eyes to see that tiny tiny text alright so now let's wrap something in hidden and see if it will work I may as well just copy what they did here so I'm gonna try medium and down I think that'll work I'm gonna move this over a bit we don't need it so let's see what this is to our icon I want that we went to title we went to logo and all this this whole grid well yeah everything within this grid I think we can get rid of so let me double check the grid here see where we had it yep so we can put hidden here and then down here sorry if I'm scrolling really fast I hope I didn't make anybody motion sick hidden woah oh it's just indentation we'll save it there we are okay let's see what happened wonderful okay that worked the the top have had really really thin I think it could use a bit of padding at the top but I mean that's it basically worked it did what we wanted to do now that I look at it if we keep the logo this size which I think is is fine that size works especially for a small screen then we may have some space over here I do want to check to see what this is 400 all right let me let me shrink this down a bit so if we dock dev tools here we can actually shrink the screen down a bit more so I think 320 is the smallest screen so that's about 320 yeah so if we were to add something in here it would definitely have to be something very small so I say I'm not gonna add anything for right now and we'll see later on at this point let's just keep it simple we need to launch this thing we can always add more in later on and the only thing that I'm thinking of is would it be better to Center this logo now that there's nothing over here or should we keep it aligned over here let me know in the live chat I'm not going to do anything with it now on a larger screen it definitely looks whoa all right okay so medium is all the way up there let's see it where that breakpoint you know what it doesn't the brief only doesn't just happen like normal and CSS so what is that 1212 it's like 1280 or something is the breakpoint huh let's try to drop that down I think we might be able to drop down to the next breakpoint and it would still work so let me double check what that is called ASM so let's change it SM and oops alright let's see how far down this will go whoops okay yeah that definitely works that works okay I like that not that's a great point that's more around nine of what is that nine sixty nine ninety somewhere around there we're get another ninety yeah I think that's much more reasonable I don't think we could go any lower than that actually there's only one break point lower than that so I think that's that's really all we can do anyway but I think that's fine that's that's definitely acceptable really we definitely can't fit very many more options up here which is okay with me I don't want to clutter this up let's see what happens when we expand this all right good that still works let me shrink it down a bit more all right great so I don't I was worried we'd run into issues with expanding this but it looks like we have enough space awesome awesome all right cool so that that works now I do want to double check you know what we still have a little bit I can still scroll horizontally a bit so we have something else that's that's messing this up it wasn't just the the header visit this it's gotta be yeah it's gotta be this let's check this out hmm that's got some weird stuff going on all right well I'd say if we are going to have cards like this with that much text yeah we got to change it so internally these need to stack I suppose they either need to stack or these always need to be you know a hundred percent with if we get down lower something has to happen there I'm gonna check the live chat quickly just to see if if you all had any any advice all right I just want to take a moment to think about what I want to do with this type of thing I know we're gonna utilize these on the home page let's see all right so would it look better if we stack these so that the image was on top I don't know really know that I like a circular image on the top like that you know we may have to go we had just used the the existing I think it was a list component to do this and we just made one item in the list we may have to do something you know more custom to have some more control over this that probably went up being easier than trying to modify the list component directly yeah for now let's see if we go see how it looks when it's like this all right you know what I still really don't like that look so this type of card I think only looks alright the way we have it with just the right amount of tags just the right size I want to think of something a little more versatile for this because we needed to look good on different sizes rook says or Nikki says can you use shape outside CSS when it's a small card makes it look like magazines with text around an image oh that's a really good idea if we're gonna do that though I think we probably will have to make a custom card so let's I guess we could try that out yeah alright let's try it out let's I want to do something with this though as well on a smaller screens so it's I don't want it you know I'm like a screen this size I don't think it looks right to just have this all the way up against the edge like that so let's do something with this first I'm just kind of like working my way down so I don't want to skip this and go to the cars right now I mean we could we center this what is this is this yeah a textaligncenter works yeah I mean that works good okay yeah textaligncenter is fine for that it's nice when the answer is so simple alright so we're gonna put that oh I'm up in the app bar I need to go to let's close this index page here we are so here should we do it I guess we could make a clasp for it flex innocent 80 or things kind of well we could just add it onto here I mean this has a lot of really specific things so it's not like we're gonna reuse it so let's just add it onto here oops Center all right I'm gonna double check just to make sure I clear out anything in dev tools all right cool that works awesome all right now let's work our way down the page I want to try to remember to keep this small okay those buttons are an acceptable size there I think I can live with that yeah and this what size is this yeah this is just we're gonna need to do something with fonts as well I mean even on that this is like the simplest type of card you can make it's just a card with text on it even there we're leaking over the edges so more marius says why not use the mobile view simulator thingy I don't I don't like them okay be honest with you I do use it sometimes but I I'd like to do this better I like to just you know move this back and forth and see what happens so it does have its its uses but just not I don't know I like this better in case you're not sure what we're talking about we can toggle this mobile view and like we could change it and say like our let's check out an iPhone 4 right and this would be iPhone 4 view you can see what it would look like on our iPhone 4 click scroll you could change the you should be able to change mobile there was a button for like landscape mode and portrait mode I don't know what happened to that button seems like the UI for this has changed huh I for I don't know it doesn't really matter but anyway this is nice if you want to check it on a specific device and you don't have that device then anyway yeah Nikki says yeah you use the ability to play with it with good point I hadn't thought about it that way yet yeah yeah I mean it's just uh you know like this I can see like okay exactly the point where things shift that helps me especially if I'm trying to write media queries myself like I need to know the the real like pixel number exactly and I don't want to be switching trying to find phones that have that pixel value but it does really come in handy if you like if let's say you don't have something like browserstack where you can simulate phones you could use this and at least get you know something that could be useful all right my timer ran out so I'm gonna take a short break from coding now go to the live chat and answer some of your questions there's a question about what does the p5 d25 mean and it was answered in live chat but I just want to answer that again in case you're watching later on it's project 5 day 25 so I've tried I don't think I have it for every video but some of the early ones I didn't do this but for most of the videos it has what project it is and what day it is and I abbreviate it so we don't have really long titles but then that way if you want to go back and watch things like in order you can kind of easily tell what where we're at in the series Antonio says hi hey how's it going thanks for watching see all right it looks like Harsha and Marius is saying you can actually move back and forth in that mode let's check that up so it's not responsive mode oh nice I didn't know that I liked it yeah I like that then you could do this too ohho I actually really like that that's cool maybe I'll try this I'll try this mode out for the rest of the stream you all convince me I'm gonna do it I'm gonna try it out what do you see that what what is that veneer yeah these cards are not gonna work we we gotta redo those Wow that dog is just too cute all right well there wasn't really very many questions I kind of looked back into the live chat a lot more than I normally do so kept up with things so I guess I'll just we'll go back in here and let's I don't know get rid of these cards or you know make something else we had to do something about this because that's that's pretty bad we can also check on some of our interior pages I don't think there'll be a problem with the interior pages but you never know some of the markup that we're importing may have some weird stuff going on so it's worth we can obviously can't check every piece of content but maybe we could check you know one or two examples of each type let's see Nicki says that whitespace is caused by elements that are taken out of the document flow like positionabsolute elements that that could make sense because we're using you know masonry so that is still in positioning absolute but the element itself looks fine it's just the the insides of it that are getting messed up alright let's take a closer look at what's going on now Wow harsh it already has eight tasks done in the JavaScript AF API repo if if you all want to check out what's going on with that project it's in my repositories so the stuff we I do for work is in the fu s marcom organization if you check my profile just I think it's Jesse or Weigel that's where the the new stuff is harsh janessa says you need standard J s and the repo yeah I'd like to do it just like we set up our projects here you know like prettier husky standard J s uzs lint think what else we do I mean obviously we want to use testing so I'd like to keep it you know keep it the same and then depending on how it goes with using committees in I think we we might want to use that as well I want to make it as easy as possible for people to contribute but also keep everything you know the same in terms of style I think it'll just make it a lot easier oh look ask for n Grogg sorry sorry Nicki I totally forgot about Endre let me get that up and running for you all so if you haven't seen me use this before if you click this link that I just paste it into the live chat you can see this website as we're working on it and you can go into dev tools just like like I'm knowing and check everything out all right is this the this is the container I wonder if we mess with overflow let's mess with the overflow alright so let's see if we can I mean we can do something like this which at least should prevents what should prevent all this weirdness from happening but then we don't see any of the content so that's not an ideal and it fixes one problem it makes another so we may end up putting that on there just in case something weird happens and content sticks out so it doesn't mess up the whole page it just messes up that piece of content John Ensign says hey Oh watch this lady your busy day here oh hey John thanks for stepping checking in alright so it looks like let me take this off for a second so we can see area yet let's rebuild this card all right we're gonna rebuild the card we want to make a card then that we could probably do with making the font a little smaller he so really this is what we came from and we just made it really big so I wouldn't want to shrink this down to that size just to make it fit he I actually I don't even remember what I did to change this so let's go in and see what we did so should be should still be in the index and remember we hardcoded a bunch of these cards in here we're not gonna leave it like this so it looks a little crazy now but this will all get taken care of so YouTube embeds where's there we are okay alright so we gave it an avatar big in list item text big all right let's check it out you know what I gave this this avatar a fixed width and height which that's that's an issue hmm hmm I guess we could try to shrink this hmm I'm really I'm really kind of undecided here John Anson says 100% with four cards get rid of image right now that I look at this I mean it won't fix our problem but it'll help do we really need this much margin on the sides where are we getting all that margin from oh because I put the margin in okay under what we had before I mean that's that's definitely more acceptable see what it looks like on a larger screen yeah I am I think I'm going to remove that margin for that padding I mean sorry let's make sure that that is he record yeah let's take that out all right this will give us a little bit more realistic picture of how much space we have to deal with all right so as expected we still have this issue maybe we could just and this is a I think what John was saying is yeah this is what John was saying let's just get rid of the image on small screens what so I mean let's see what it looks like yeah I mean this looks exactly how I wanted it to look and expected it to look when it has enough space but say probably anything beyond this so was it nine let's try small and down let's hide this one's falling down if we can and I'll be realistically we're gonna have more text than this let's go on the site now and and find a comparable piece of content just to get a realistic view of how much text is gonna be in these cars so slow I Wow all right so right now we aren't giving more information we just have a little quote I guess with a link okay will quote with a link let's see if we have I think we do have let's check these pages I know somewhere in the site we have little sections like that that with the picture and text the islands check the accounting department see what's here all right so this is how we're doing this student 1 so this is the amount of text that we have and but we still have a read more link all right then we have a bigger profile all right so I guess we're fine we can deal with just having this amount of text it seems like we are just using a link to get people you know we just have a small amount of text okay all right Nikki Nikki see you later thanks for watching thanks for all your help okay then a thermo timer yeah I did all right I suppose then what we could try to do is have have the fonts an image then just get smaller for a small screen let's just try that at first this is one of those things where I I hate I think I've already spent too much time on it because no matter what I do here it could change dramatically when I actually start showing it to people here where I work and get different ideas so I think I'm just kind of stressing over you know really unnecessarily at this point but let's let's go in here the the big thing is I need to be able to change these classes based on a break point so let's see we're in mom it's here you like the area so I don't need hidden I need these break points though heeey all right that's interesting this is kind of our problem here alright I'll keep that in mind alright responsive breakpoints wonderful see how this works whoa very cool I had no idea there were breakpoints built into here all right let's try it out so we are going to within Syria maybe avatar so within this avatar big let's go pain breakpoints now small let's drop this down to 100 and let's drop this down to let's just let's get 24 all right see if that works I've never tried to do breakpoints with material UI oh all right pretty cool let's all right so we go not bad not bad Wow all right it still there's some spots where it's a little weird a lot weird why is it still there I thought this breakpoint was a lot oh because we have it going like this oops keep going the wrong way let's see where we have this ever I'm gonna try like this and see what difference that makes so let's see we go to this point oops I did it on the wrong thing alright so what I'm trying to do here is let me search for there yeah search for Thomas crow this is my boss by the way and here I'm gonna change this to medium and that should help make things look a little better okay yeah there we are so this is always gonna be all the way across until we get up to a more reasonable size alright so here yeah not bad not that bad not perfect but I think that's way more acceptable than it was before it looked obviously broken now I think it looks okay we still have you know I can't zoom in in here I'm gonna switch this up and toggle back to this you so I can zoom in so we still have this white area even on large screens we have this white area and we can so even on large screens I I have a horizontal scrollbar over so like this shouldn't happen see this site does not have a horizontal scrollbar all right let me check my time three minutes if anybody has any idea why I have a horizontal scrollbar still please let me know in the live chat I know I've had this same thing happened to me on various projects throughout the years I don't know why I can't remember what the problem was before all right so usually when this happens I just go through and try to see which elements are sticking out see it there doesn't appear to be any let's go to the top Dave says start removing elements vishal says hello a lot of love from india hey Vishal thanks for joining us I have a lot of love for India as well I have quite a few of you from India that that watched the show I mean based on the analytics I think number one is from the United States number two most viewers thinker from the UK and then after that is India then I really appreciate it because I know the time zone because of the time difference sometimes things can be crazy for the live stream let's start opening up some of these header all right let's go do we all right so it's not in the header let's check the footer the weight not in the footer so at least we know it's in the main main place here all right so we can check let's just get rid of this hero section oh it's in the hero section awesome alright let's refresh this and get to hero section back now he can go in Dave thank you so much for that that was so helpful Dave suggested that I just start removing elements and that was way faster than what I was initially trying to do all right so where's our header or I'm sorry I hear a section here here's our hero section let's see where it's where it's at what's going on there we are it's right here I thought it was that pairing yeah but it's not the padding it still does that well I have this set on Macs with just forgotten soon see what's inside of here as well all right it's nothing inside it's definitely this alright my timer did run out but I really him so close I really want to figure this out before we end the stream let me go to computed see where I'm getting my width from all right looks like it's calculated I'm just gonna start removing Stiles I already tried removing the padding that didn't do anything it's crazy it's got to be padding whoaoh let's go up on here with all right maybe I added this let's see where that's coming from now let me actually look at this you know a grid container alright so is it this one yeah yeah but was it this grid container oh no the screens freezing shoes let me know is it freezing for everybody what's what's going on but so anyway I think I found the problem it's with this grid right here this grid container I'm not sure what to do about that so I'm getting some Styles applied here here mmm grid type container so it's not that it's a type container it's a spacing it's a spacing one special issue system maybe I'm not gonna be able to use grid for just two see if I can just override it what all right that fixed it alright so I'm not sure what was going on with that but I just put an inline style which would override the other styles and made a width of 100% let me move the screen about a little bit just to make sure that thinks they'll work no I'll never see a screen that small what am I thinking let's get its feet more reasonable here all right all right cool so that was another really easy fix I'm gonna keep trying to work within like the material you I you know documentation but sometimes it's just so easy to fix it with a little in lifestyle so now normally if we are gonna reuse this component a lot of places I might think twice about doing that but this is the hero section it's only gonna exist on the front page so I'm gonna do it once and it's it's only gonna have to be once if I end up having a similar problem on other pages then maybe we can dig deeper and look into it but I think that was a pretty simple fix so at this point at least the home page now doesn't have any glaring layout errors on mobile so mission accomplished for today let's commit this and put it up to github so let's go get status get status and looks good yeah that's what we wanted to check I had the yarn lock updated from when I was bringing merging pool requests earlier all right so I want to use this new this new thing that Nicky put in here what is it commit is in so let's see how I use this all right so let's try yarn run cm oops I forgot to get it get a yarn see em alright so now when we do committin you can see I can just move up and down with my arrow keys and select what kind of commit I want to do so I mean maybe a fix all right let's do a fix component or file name we could do at bar in short imperative tense description I would say horizontal scroll the skin let's see all right so I just wanted to like do a large example here but I don't expect you all to write out that much if you want to you know if you want to make a commit message in fact like the long message I don't need that at all in the commit I mean odds are you're going to be submitting a pull request and you're gonna put the description in your pull request but basically probably the first part right what kind of commit this is and then the third part a short description that's all you really need the other stuff does help but it's not mandatory no breaking changes no I don't think so we have any issues I don't think we have the issue up and for that alright cool now it's gonna run all its auto formatting linting and testing I kind of hope it doesn't pass the test just so we can see an example of what happens but I think it will cool with past greats now we can do get push origin and everything is now on the repo on github let's see Harshit says merge my PR as well Harshit is that your PR is there PR for this repo there you mean for what is it the JavaScript AF all right I'm just merging it right now from the command line or I'm sorry from github all right I should I merged it I didn't bother checking it out because literally we had nothing in the project I just had a readme a contributing MD file did I even have that I had to read me a license and maybe a contributing file and that was it so obviously whatever Asha does is not gonna break it okay so now that we've got that accomplished I'm gonna go to the live chat get through all the questions read out some comments so if you have anything you want me to answer or anybody else on the lab have to answer please put it in there now let me scroll to the top someone in the lab chat said they are high AF if you don't know what that means good for you if you do know what that means don't do drugs that's the public service announcement today from me um I'm not not sure I'll let this person I think that's it I think it's all day they said and didn't make any more comments got to see not really a lot of questions all right Louise says hi Jesse is this a project that you're building the same as the one on fu s Markham Franciscan react on github yeah yeah this is it this is that project and now that we've committed the changes and push them up to github it should be it's exactly the same everything I have on my machine is the same as what's on on github Anmol says do we really need a degree to get a web app developer job you do not you don't need a degree it probably depends a lot on what the what things are like in your particular country or wherever you're trying to get a job as to whether it's kind of customary to have a degree or not but here in the United States if you're trying to get a job with a tech company or maybe a small startup having a degree is definitely not mandatory it's possible that it could help you if you have some sort of undergraduate degree but it's it's not mandatory most of the jobs that I see they don't mention education at all they just want to know your skills are but I do see some that require some sort of degree ayyyy bows here hey Eva how's it going davus how can I be part of this Dave you can you do as much as you want in terms of you know checkout the repos so we have we have a lot of projects going on right now mostly react stuff we have this react project is our main thing project that we're working on and that's what we'll be talking about here on the streams for at least another month but we also have a react native project and we have a react project where we're using electron to make desktop apps so depending on what you're interested in you could work on those as well usually I'll just create issues for these different repositories you can find links in the descriptions for the repos and you could just take one of those issues try to work on it submit a pull request if you want if you'd rather not you know contribute code but you just like to contribute advice and help in the live chat that's that's excellent too if you want more info about that you know ask more questions here or you can message me on some social media platform whatever you want but that's it I'm missing some other way to contribute I mean really help helping answer questions and things the live chat and then work and/or contributing code or probably the main ways Harshit says might clone the repo as well I have a feeling that you haven't cloned that you mean the repo I just made yeah I haven't cloned that repo yet I created it in github and didn't clone it yet all right I've got another the end of the live chat this was surprisingly short live chat today mostly because there weren't a lot of questions there's a lot of discussion during the chat about what we were going to do which is awesome I always appreciate that help okay we got Evo says have you ever done something with with Go Go laying I'm currently thinking about doing some big scale data processing and looking at some solutions currently unfortunately I have no experience with it so wish I could be more help but I I know almost nothing about it so if anyone else here knows more about go please let ebo know but yeah I I have no idea it's alright so that's the last question here I today's all right yeah today's Thursday so I should be back tomorrow maybe sometime around noon 100 p.m. something like that and that's my time Eastern Sun and we're gonna come right back here and be working on something else I'll I will be busy migrating data so I'm not exactly sure what we'll be working on but I'm definitely not gonna broadcast me migrating data cuz that's super boring maybe we'll have some new types of pages that will work on depending on how much data I get over but until then have a wonderful day
