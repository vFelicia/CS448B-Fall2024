hi everyone welcome to free code camp and another vue.js stream if you don't know me my name is gwen and i run the faraday academy youtube channel that you can check out from the description below i do mostly django and vjs content and a few other things sprinkled in there um yeah so if you are a member of this chat you can go ahead and comment or make any suggestions as we're going along this is the repo that we'll be working off of today it's basically under my github which is gwen f uh view nwjs hours tracking and this is also linked in the description below um so it has uh different yeah all the different information requirements uh tech stack so it's going to be another vue.js application the only difference between this and the other apps i've been building hi anish how are you it's good to see you is that it'll be using nwjs which is a desktop application framework that uses node.js and chromium and then i'll be using um actually not mongodb but i'm going to look for the same style of database i think because nwjs has some similar options for that hi sassy how are you it's good to see you again um yeah and then just bootstrap for the design library so i don't have to design it myself here are the or here is the schema that i made just a basic first go at it um yeah and then i do have some mockups so these are the different pages for both the mvp and version one and then i just pick some colors before the stream yeah and so this is the road map what i want to add first and then what i want to add second and then i can add more and more things after that so this is probably where is it so hours log will be the first one just a plain table and then i'll make it more fancy from that as well as being able to add new hours into the log so this should be a fun project now if you've used um electron before then there are a lot of similarities because it's it's i mean it's still building a desktop app in javascript you can do a lot of the same things there are some pros and cons to both of them but i'm going to be using like i said before nwjs for this project so you can go to nwjs.io and the documentation is decent for this project and there are some good examples online especially with vjs that i found so here's the getting started um you'll notice there are some differences let me see if i can find it yeah so you have this uh so for global objects like you have in um when you're developing in the browser you have the document object which is actually also polyfilled in nwjs and you have this nw global object so you can use nw.window yeah and some other things like that so um yeah you can do document.body.ad event listener so you can use all of your regular frontend stuff and then you also have access to the operating system too so you can access the operating system information file system all kinds of stuff like that hi techstack glad you're here again um yes i think that's all i wanted to say about nwjs it's an interesting project actually with a lot of new updates coming soon um it's also been around a long time so it's very robust and i found this or someone showed me this where which one is it it's this one so this uh nw view cli example so it's it's basically like um you know when you when you use the vcli use view create and it sets up a basic project for you this is the same thing except it sets up a basic nws and view project for us so i'm going to go ahead and use this boilerplate here and i'll post a link to this in the chat so i'll call it view nwjs uh wait boilerplate okay and yeah so there are some instructions it basically you know gives you a boilerplate desktop window these are all the technologies it uses it it's not opinionated about a design framework so we're just going to pull in bootstrap and it gives you instructions how to install packages start locally that's all the same and then it gives you a whole bunch of other commands that have to do with building desktop apps for different os's and that kind of stuff so i'm going to go ahead and clone this repository as a starter so oh let me copy it and go to my terminal in this folder so i'm going to do git clone nw if see vcli example except i'm going to call it nwjs hour tracking okay and now zoom in a little okay so i have that folder now i'm gonna go into the folder and i'm gonna install the dependencies which will take a minute so npm install and kind of wait for that so i know not everyone can chat right now but for those of you who can chat how's it going any comments about desktop apps vue.js life right now okay it's not going too slowly that's good okay and then right after i install this i'm going to go ahead and install bootstrap so i don't have to stop the server again later so bootstrap view let me zoom in again let me go to the docs and getting started actually i should have checked my node version before i installed everything there i'll have to check it after i think i'm using 12 which is lts because i use mv nvm so i switch between versions sometimes okay so let's see all right so npm install i need to install bootstrap view and bootstrap it also has view here but i already have view installed with the project so that's it hi tom how are you it's good to see you again npm install bootstrap view and bootstrap so just waiting for this to finish installing and that should just take another second come on and then i'll install bootstrap and then later on i'm gonna go ahead and make the view components and the view application and then later on i will need to add a database for this so not sure i'll get that get to that in this stream so i might start off next stream hopefully adding the database then i'm doing well i'm happy to still be streaming this should be a fun project because it's a bit larger than the other projects which were just kind of oneoff onestream projects can you brief a little yeah sure i i will um brief a little bit more as soon as we open up the actual files which i guess i can do that now and let me just start installing what was it bootstrap bootstrap view and bootstrap need to install those hi jared i'm glad you are here so this is this is kind of cool because jared is in nwjs and also a view expert who contributed to the nwjs project so he knows a lot about this project so welcome to the chat jared welcome to free code camp all right um okay well while this is waiting let's take a look at this project so if you just take a brief oh let me zoom in zoom in twice okay so if you just briefly look at this this looks almost exactly like a regular vue.js project with the exception of probably this file so it has a server.js file with express so basic express server you should be able to do view add whatever oh for um vcli plugins yeah i don't know if i need any plugins right now but i'll definitely keep that in mind okay so the package.json of course we have all of our regular view and static files here but i'm going to go into the package.json right now and so there's a lot of stuff going on so you have a lot of the same objects of course it's a regular package.json so here are all the scripts some of them are regular like testing running testing and linting all of these build scripts are for building for different operating systems so you have windows linux is there a mac one um oh maybe oh the linux one no build nw that must be mac maybe i haven't actually built an into vgs um are we at max 720p so i'm streaming in 720p and from the preview i get i can see it in 720p so hopefully you can see it if you can't see it in that quality then try changing it in the youtube settings because i've had to do that sometimes when i'm watching someone's stream and it's low quality you can probably change it in the youtube settings hopefully um yeah so the only commands that or the only command i'm going to be running today is actually the start command and you can see it runs these two commands concurrently at the same time so it runs npm run serve which is the regular view cli service command that you get from abuse ucli and then this nw command so it runs the nwjs desktop server so it can open the actual desktop app okay and then some specific things so there's specific configuration in here just for desktop applications and i'm going to go ahead and open the window but you can see it has this metadata about nwjs so you can choose the height the width min height width icon and a whole bunch of other things for the i think this is the manifest of nw no for the desktop app that you're building so when i open this clear now let me run npm start to start the development server and this should open the desktop app as well okay there's a lot of stuff going on okay now it's running uh and the port don't need to worry about the port because it should have opened here hmm oh there it goes there it goes okay so this is the boiler plate and you can see the window size actually comes from the size denoted here um and then this is also resizable so i can do it this is built on chromium but you don't actually have to have a chrome browser installed to run it because it has it built into nwjs um yeah and then it just runs it and you can also you also have access so this is a shortcut link that the people who made this boilerplate built in but this is just a link to open the developer tools so that i can use developer tools while i'm building this desktop app so that's not any different than electron or any other desktop application hi bobby welcome to free code camp how are you um okay so okay now i have the basic page for nwjs and actually so let me let me maximize the browser okay cool it has view dev tools built into this template i'm using that's great i didn't even know that okay um so there is actually one thing that i forgot i would have to do here and if you look at the mockups oh wait it's this way um if you look at the mockups i have in the repo which if you just joined the repo is linked in the description below that i'm going to be working off of and um need to do that so you can see it has these different pages and it has a draw menu here without links to different pages so i'm going to need to install view router to route between the different pages in the application and so i will be using the cli plugin for that and let me just look it up real quick so i get the right name for the package uh view router so um getting let me go to getting started because okay oh installation this is the one let me zoom in one more okay so it shows via script tag via npm and view cli so i'll do view add view router just peachy awesome so jared says if you do view ui and add your project then you oh yeah so vue cli has a ui interface where i can add dependencies from there if you haven't seen it it's really awesome so i think i'll just do that so let me do view ui because i want to also add the uh or i want to add state management as well with vue x okay so let me see if it opened yeah it did so this is the view ui and there's a server running and serving this ui interface and now if i go to plugins i can see these plugins are the plugins that are already installed that came with the boiler plate and oh no i'm i was like how did this one get there uh let me zoom in so actually these aren't the ones that came with the boilerplate i have to um oh wait i have to zoom out i want to get there we go i need to open up the right folder so let's look at yeah i think view project manager and projects import so i have to go into projects and then i have a lot of stuff in here so i have nw nws so uh nwjs hour tracking this is the one okay and this is my view project so i'm going to import this folder okay now i can correctly see oh click the home button oh yeah that would have been a shortcut thanks um okay so now i can go to plugins and i can correctly see the plugins that are installed with this project and oh great so there are links here let me zoom in if you can see there are shortcut links to add these common plugins i didn't even know they had this yeah so add view router i'm going to click this it's suggesting it to me it says official library to support multiple virtual pages in a single page app okay continue so it's installing view router and then after this i'm going to install vuex this is exciting getting to build and if i actually build this desktop app it'll be my first one ever building and distributing to systems while this is uh installing actually so the idea for this app came from my consulting because if you watched so on my channel i have a video about consulting where i just talk about some of the things i've learned over the years and so this app it's actually what i do like keep an hours log for each different project my next tasks list all of this stuff that i do for myself but i do it all manually and so someone suggested that i make a desktop app for it and i was like oh that's a great idea um because that would save me so much time especially where is it where is it uh where's the page especially oh i must not have included it oh but there's a a page for exporting so i can export as in a csv or i can export an invoice and i can basically give an hour log to the client because i always give the client a breakdown of what i did on which days and then i also of course i have to send them an invoice to get paid so if i could generate those things in kind of a simple desktop interface without you know all the complicated software for it out there this would be kind of a cool thing to have um okay so where is it oh that's probably done now let me check on that install oh where is it yeah um successfully so at the bottom in tiny tiny words it says successfully invoked generator for plugin view cli plugin router okay now let me add view x then for state management because there's going to be quite a few pages and components yeah and there's no reason to not use view x for a multipage view application in my opinion anyway maybe some of you have a different opinion all right so that's installing i have bootstrap i have the vcli tools once this is done installing i'll start setting up the pages one by one and the first thing i'll set up is i guess a top bar with um with a navigation draw so let me see what it's called in bootstrap if it's called an app bar or a toolbar does anyone know what it's called i know the chat legs like hopefully it's not much more than five to eight seconds um okay let me just look at components oh they added new components wonderful um let's see navbar that makes sense oh yeah right it's bootstrap's nav nav bar thing let's see navs navigation is available in bootstrap uh share general markup and styles from the base b nav class to the active and disabled states okay so this is a basic nav bar and you can change the appearance of the links if i want tabs i will want tabs for something later on but not yet so the only thing i really want in the nav bar or the two things is really a link oh no no it's a button to open the draw menu and then i want the logo or the title the name of the app basically and that's it okay so i think i can work with this oh pills so pills will make it look like a button um no because that will make whichever one's active look like a button so yeah i'll probably just copy the basic one for this okay yeah there's a lot of stuff here okay i'm gonna get rid of that and now let me check on the install okay that's installed let me refresh this page because it's not showing those two new yeah so once i've refreshed it's now showing the router plugin and view x can we try sidebar it says new uh yeah let me look at that sidebar what's the difference between a sidebar and a draw menu let's see toggle sidebar oh cool that looks nice actually i like that okay that's what i want um so using sidebar and using nav nav bar so let me look at navbar see what examples they have yeah i'm going to copy this basic navbar example then and first let me run the app again and i'm gonna stop this server for the view ui that i started yeah fancy um let's see uh what do i want to do oh yeah i keep wanting to type in python here because i've been running so many django commands i want to do npm start okay dev server spinning up again this will open the desktop app again and oh this was an accident so oh oops oh i'm gonna have to um fix this i think install or adding those view cli plugins messed it up because those are made for regular view projects and they might have intrusively changed some things that they weren't supposed to change in nwjs so maybe i should have installed them manually i don't know okay so i'll fix that in a second i did make a mistake here and that is i think bootstrap and at least view router and view x should have been installed in dev dependencies so i think i messed that up but i can always move that over later so i'm not too worried about that right now okay because once it builds i don't need those packages so i don't need to ship useless packages okay so in source let me see what what these things did yep so uh what did this do okay so it changed my app dot view file which i don't think this is a big deal here i think the main issue is that it changed this and for some reason the app is erroring here okay and then what else did it set up so it set up a store this is fine set up the index.router file um that should also be good although i don't need all of these routes so i'm going to change the routes so let's see why isn't this island disable oh yeah that's the iceland so creating a new view object render rendering the app so i don't see why um what was the error message oh okay i'll show you the error message why this would have a problem with it let me see so oh it's saying oh okay it's saying it can't resolve this i see assets asset.logo.png it's because there isn't one i'm pretty sure yeah because in this project it's expecting this to be a normal view project which already has an assets slash logo.png but this one doesn't so i'm gonna see uh where it's trying to pull that in okay so it's in home.view it's trying to display this logo.png yeah it does look okay um so what was it nw what was the file name let's see yeah nw.png so yeah now it works sweet and i have my view router set up so it works just like a normal view router okay cool um so let me open the developer tools for later so i have it oh yeah still has that error so it makes sense to rename them that should be fixed in the boiler plate to avoid this bug for others yeah so it's good it's good i'm testing out this boiler plate for everyone all right so now i have my router let me add that top nav in the sidebar now so in bootstrap i'm in nav bar so i'm going to copy this nav bar and then get rid of most of the stuff inside okay so nav bar let me also delete some of the extra stuff so let me delete this about page and then i have to delete it from router 2. so let me delete okay where is it uh let me also delete so the home page uh okay i'll leave that alone for right now so in this app.view this is where i'm gonna delete um or i'll add this above real quick so i have the um oops this i pasted the nav bar in and i need to indent this and now i need to let's see i need to get rid of all of these items i think what is navbar collapse oh yeah so that is um drop down item i don't think i need navbar collapse so let me get rid of that then just start from scratch with that okay so let's see how this looks okay so i just have a basic nav bar there oh am i i'm not importing the css that's what i'm not doing hi in namdee how are you that's a that's a cool name um welcome to free code camp so uh oh if you don't know i'm building a desktop app with uh nwjs and vue the link is in the description below so um now i have the navbar i'm not importing the bootstrap css or i must not be because it's not displaying anything so let me stop what i'm doing real quick go back to getting started and um where is it okay i need to scroll down okay using module bundlers in all my installs i forgot to actually set up bootstrap so i'm going to have to put this in my main.js file so let me go to that main.js file and well okay so absolute imports should go first and then i have relative imports and then i can put this here okay so now i'm registering this and i still need the css links oh no it didn't like that okay oh view imported twice that's why thanks okay so uh oh i guess i need the css here then because those are absolute imports or uh library imports what i mean okay so um css yeah so i think that's it oh also oh cool that looks nice this nav bar um also i would like um what was i going to say i can't remember what i was going to say but i'll i'll remember it in a minute so let me add that option to open the menu from the nav bar from bootstrap so in components where's that new sidebar okay it's a fixed position toggleable slide out box which can be used for navigation menus details okay so i'll copy the basic sidebar then and i'll also copy the button uh which toggles oh i didn't know in the docs now you can double click to edit oh that's pretty cool um yeah bootstrap docs are good so let me go to um where is it oh yeah in my app.js file so in app.js i'll go here and put the sidebar and now this button for toggle sidebar i'm going to put inside of v navbar toggles okay so i don't want that so let me put oh wait undo i think i have to yeah oh it's because i just undid that there we go let's see how that looks okay so toggle sidebar and i want to switch these two around i think and i'm going to rename this to menu that's pretty cool it has a prop to toggle the sidebar from the button um and the sidebar one okay so it's referencing the id here so i guess i'll call this sidebar not sidebar one because there's no other sidebar okay so that should still work yeah um the menu oh yeah and then i was gonna switch these around so oh that's that's pretty ugly oh because uh the title must be giving some margin right so i can just add some margin to this button then so i can add a class and use a margin shorthand from bootstrap which i think is margin margin right and i'll say 4 to push it out a little bit which is something like 16 pixels bootstrap doesn't do it exactly in increments of four pixels for these numbers so let's see yeah i think that looks okay um other docs using view live edit and see it update the demo in real time yeah it's using uh something so let's see i can get rid of shadow and now there's no elevation on the sidebar yeah so i guess that's v live i don't know but it's updating live for bootstrap that's pretty cool okay um so now i have the menu open now i need to put stuff in the sidebar that was really low effort like nice to use um so i'm gonna put that down here and get rid of the paragraph in the sidebar oh there's a title here so what should i call the title i guess i'll call it menu i could do username or with an avatar or something i don't know um or main menu okay and this so this div is just providing some spacing inside so padding on the xaxis of three um and then padding on the yaxis of two i'll leave that spacing div there and then i'm going to add these router links inside and see how they look and i might want to put these in a list i don't know how what would look best in bootstrap commit oh this is awful um yeah that was a bad idea so i'm going to put these in a list view in a bootstrap list so let me see first if they have an example here of shadow borders with padding disable scope header footer backdrop okay yeah i think it's getting all right so it has the full api details but i'm going to look for a list here so list group and let me see all right so that's a list group and oh it can show active items to indicate a selection so it's not exactly what i want or maybe i'm just used to the material uh design from beautify all the time or if you prefer button elements over links see the button prop okay so you can make these into buttons instead of list links i guess um colors badges okay um yeah i think unless someone knows of something better let me look for list actionable list group items yeah so this is what i want i mean the style can always be changed later it's not a big deal so i'm going to copy this list group and put it inside the draw okay and now so inside of each list group item i'm gonna have um yeah i'm gonna have the view router link so oh let me get rid of it add it here and then okay that works i can change the color and underline state i guess and then and i'll just get rid of about here so i can just copy this link um oh okay so there's actually an href from here and then there's a router link inside so actually oh wait um i don't need the router link inside which will stop the need for extra styling which is good so i'll just put a forward slash here and have home that looks pretty good the home link so let me what's next so i guess i can add all of these links that i have in the mockups down here let's see oh my other mockup i see where it is i'm it's not displaying so i must have spelled it wrong in the readme okay um let's see add entry um yeah so i need a button at the top actually and then i need these four links and then a horizontal line so there might actually be a bootstrap component for this horizontal line so let me see hours log projects exports and settings so hours log okay then projects and then exports and oh wait uh settings all right so now i have the menu here and um what else i guess i don't need a horizontal line unless i could make these two different list groups actually so i could what i could do is actually here close that list group and then make another b oh wait b list group yeah and then just very quickly i can add a class of margin top of two give it a little bit of spacing yeah that's okay for now uh class drop down divider okay oh jared wants to post a link so let me show the link get bootstrap docs components dropdowns dividers cool thank you um oh get out of that let me divider oh i'm looking i'm looking in view router for dividers let me go to uh drop down these are all in drop downs and i can't scroll down so they don't have a divider component but since i'm updating bootstrap like you mentioned i can oh cool because i'm getting the chat directly through youtube this time so it's letting me copy paste or copy from the chat okay so let me copy this divider then and see how it looks um in between these two list groups i'll paste that divider nice so i have the two different list groups and then i have a divider and then i guess i can get rid of this margin class because it looks like it's the same space on either side of the divider either way okay good so now i have a menu so now i need to make this main home page and let's see oh yeah let me go to the mockup and look at the main page so it's basically a table of all the hour logs that looks fine yeah i think it looks it looks fine to me i mean you're the you're a design expert so and we can always change something later okay so hours log um oh yeah so i need a bootstrap table here the tabs i'm going to worry about these tabs later so for right now i'm going to have a title a button and a table with four columns so let me just work on that and okay so i have app.view and then this router view is displayed and actually i'm going to need to use the view what is it called the grid system not the view grid system but the bootstrap grid system so let me find which component i'm going to use right now i only have this one component which is home and actually i'm going to change this to hours log um and the component will be hours log so hours long hours log okay and now i need to actually rename this component to hours log oh wait uh hours log and i'll delete the hello world i'll delete this image i'll give it a class of hours log page um in case i want to name space my sas later oh is it slog did i put slog hours log yeah it's hours long i don't think i misspelled it anywhere our slog okay so i'll get rid of the hello world component the name here should be hours log okay how is everyone else everyone else is kind of quiet in the chat how do you think it's going so far so i have the hours log page and i need i need a title first and actually here so let me go ahead and look at the bootstrap grid system because i'm going to need to implement that so let me look for grid uh layout and grid system so okay so it's b container b row and b column which is same thing as usual all right so i'm going to change this div into b container actually and then i'll do b container and then inside of that i'll do a b row and then i'll do a b column here so uh b column your legs are shaking and excitement great okay so um i don't know how exciting the mvp is but it's definitely exciting if i can get this app working so let's see um brow here's here's column which i want so how do i okay so i can do offset equals or offset dash small and then okay so the props are small medium large extra large normal so into b column i want the table centered on the page so i guess for small oops for small i'll do let me try eight columns and then offset small is two columns because there's a total of 12 columns and then i'll put the header in here so i'll put actually i want the header and let's see so this column will contain everything on the page and then inside of this column i'm actually going to do this is the thing about component libraries there's so much nesting so i'm going to do another b column because i want the header inside of a b column and now i'll put an h1 in here and i think this is how i want it unless i just want to do some flexbox in here but so let me give this a title of hours log close that and then close the column and then i want another column here which will be for the button for this add entry button so i think the button oh let me add the column first so b column and then i think button in bootstrap will be be btn and then that will be add what is it i forgot what it was already add entry add entry okay and then close the button close the column close the row and i think that's it yeah and then i'll add another rule with the table in it yeah that's pretty good the only other thing is on this nested row here i want to add a margin top so it's not pushed up against the very top of the page so class equals margin top of five yeah that looks pretty good and what else oh yeah that button should also have a color so i think i'm gonna put is it color or there was another keyword i can't remember what it is for primary nope that doesn't work so let me look for button in here or i can just click on button oh variant that was it yeah thank you anish it's variant uh variant okay wow that's bright um that's fine so they can add entry and now i'm gonna put a table below this so it's been exactly one hour and we already have a desktop app i'm pretty happy with this and we have another almost an hour to go so um let's see oh yeah table let me get a table component i need some water all right need a bootstrap table oh wow do they have table light and table simple i wonder what those are let me look table okay so it's all under table so for displaying tabular data b table sports pagination filtering sorting custom rendering various styling options events and asynchronous data yeah the hour went back one by fast you know even when i've done like four hour streams they just seem to fly by like nothing well especially now that people chat when my very first couple live streams where it was just me talking to myself they felt like they took a long time so supports pagination filtering sorting custom rendering various styling options events extinct data a lot of stuff for simple display of tabular data without all the fancy features bootstrap u provides two lightweight alternative components b table light and b table simple um so i'm not going to use those but that's good to know about because i do want this to be filterable sortable and support infinite scroll which is pagination so i'm gonna use a basic b table and i guess i'll start off with just the most basic variety um okay so so it's not passing in the headers separately so i guess it's getting the header items or it must be getting them from the keys in the objects so let me um okay so let me make a new row here b row and inside of it put a b column even though it's full width i want it to match up with any spacing with the above rows and columns okay oops so b o b row and then i think that's right and now let me paste the table inside and let me copy the items too actually so let me get this um actually i don't think i have any of this so oh no i do so let me just get the data then okay so i have components and now i have the items on the table nice so i have a table of items um yeah it's not the columns that i want though so let me update the columns so i need project name i need date start and end okay so let me delete all these extra rows for right now and just update this one so project and then underscore name because i guess that's how you denote for the column like how many words you want you put underscores in the middle even though javascript generally doesn't use underscores so what should i call uh i'll just call this company one and then um and then date oh date and i'll say may 12 2020 and then i'll do start time which is i don't know uh start time you now i'll do uh should i do 24 hour clock um let me do seven oh seven a.m yeah sorry i'm using the 12hour clock because i'm from america and it's just easier for me so maybe that will be an option in settings later so um let me do 11 am not a fan or returns oh you're not a fan of returns what does that mean i don't know what that means um let's see oh cool awesome so now i have my first log entry here and just um to make this a little bit better i'm going to put some spacing in between the header and the table so let's see um since i already have a class here i'm gonna add it here so i'll do margin bottom and try four yeah that adds some good spacing between the table and then later on there will be tabs here so you can see the table view or a list view that will show the logs oh you're saying i'm not a fan of returns because i put all my code on one line no i like returns um actually this should all right i'll do this i'll i'll do this nicely real quick this should have returns in it okay everyone's happy now that's better okay and now i want to create a second page now that i have hours log let me hook up the projects page and so the projects page actually i need an ad entry page too but let me just hook up the projects page real quick so i have the second route and this will have a drop down of all the projects um and then oh i need a button here too actually so i need a button here for add a project because the projects are what you're going to associate your hours with so when you log new hours you need to associate it with a project yeah so and we're gonna have that association in the database as you can see um so i have a projects table or i will have a projects table or collection or whatever it's gonna be um and then where is the oh time entry and then i'll have time entries um and then yeah solve time entries and then i was thinking about making separate log entries although if it's no sequel then i probably won't make these separate tables but yeah i'm going to figure out if it's sql or nosql probably for the next stream so anyway um and if you watch my video on consulting then you'll know why i have logs of what i did every day because when we export the the documents for a client to see it will have log entries of the time you worked on the day and also bullet points of like all the different things you did that day and what you accomplished okay so projects so i need the title i need to add new project button and then i need this drop down here so let me create a new view because it's a separate page so i'll call this projects dot view i keep hitting escape because i'm so used to using vim so then it deletes the file that i'm trying to make okay projects dot view enter and let me start off with a template and let me go to hours log and steal some of this stuff here so um yeah let me steal all of this actually everything and then i'll delete the table basically so yank that and paste it here and then delete this table okay and now let me hook this into the actually let me change the title real quick so projects and add new project all right and now let me hook this into the router so i'll make a new um what's oh okay so let me make a new route the path will be project so projects the component will be projects and the name will be projects okay and i'll duplicate this projects projects okay and now i need to make a link and actually i'm gonna put the forward slash i don't know if i need it but just to match up with this one unless i shouldn't put it there i can't remember what what i did in all my other view routers okay so um oh yeah in my navigation let me do projects and now if i go to projects it doesn't do anything okay let me refresh this does it refresh doesn't refresh projects why doesn't it must be with the routing okay yes pass starts with forward slash okay so it's not routing correctly and i wonder if that's um because i should be using the view router 2 for these view router routes instead of an href i don't think is it the order oh because it's matching i see what you're saying because it's matching this route before it ever gets to this route i could try changing the order here let me try all right let me try going to projects nope it's not the order for some reason it is refreshing because the council the console is refreshing so i guess it's a problem i would say that it's a problem with with the href instead of using two so it's not using view router yeah so i think i'll have to do that because if i do let's say uh it shouldn't be the order all my routes start with forward slash yeah i thought so okay so i'm gonna change it back then real quick okay so try that idea now now let me do uh oh it's router link uh router link two equals uh slash projects and then close the router link and let me get rid of um the href here although now it's just gonna have the text as a link instead of the whole button so yeah i have to click on the text which stinks oh try putting oh because it's not history mode that's right so my router is not set up in history mode so maybe if i put um the hashtag not the hashtag the pound sign first okay let me try that yeah because i think that's probably why it's refreshing all right so let me go back to yeah it's not going anywhere in here too so let me do this as well um okay so let me go here now yeah that works cool so now it's looking for the hash router instead of the history router okay so now i have add a new project and i'll also have a filterable search search searchable drop down um so let me add that and it would be called drop down i guess or it would prob it would be a select actually yeah because these are just drop down with links that's not what i want at all so let me do uh jared says i would just use view route of programmatically routing and look for the route names instead of paths um yeah i could do that i'm okay with how it is now yeah that's what i'm doing but this isn't just a twohour project so i'm going to be hopefully working on this the next couple weeks making this actual work the only thing i'm not going to do on one of these streams is actually building this app for different os's because i guess it doesn't say it here but apparently it takes forever to build one of these desktop apps so i'm gonna have to do that off stream but all the other setup i should be doing on stream uh where will you be working on it at i'll be i'll be doing all of the work for this project on these free code camp streams on fridays so friday morning 10 to 12 is my slot that i've been given so yeah form select this is what i want okay so these are drop down selects that i want and let's see what components um bootstrap has for this because i really want the user to be able to start typing and search for an item and eventually i'll have to be making api calls based off their search so i don't pull in oh no no this is a desktop app what am i talking about uh yeah this should be fine but i still want them to be able to type in and search oh fc fcc free code cam i'm not going to be doing it on my twitch account um please select some item value in single mode yeah okay that's multiple select don't want that don't want that yeah so i don't think bootstrap has it let me see if it has search no there's no search um i could look at their api for this component properties properties they don't have any events oh they do so input change so i'll have i'll be listening for an on change event because i'll load the project that they choose based off of that and that's going to also route them to the next page with a breadcrumb to go back okay so those are properties um and the properties yeah they don't have any typing in so i could just add i could add that at another library for that let's see um view select component i can't remember what i added last time but there's got to be at least several of these components okay view select is a feature reach feature feature rich drop down component all right that looks nice and you can start typing so i could start typing nigeria and select it cool and then it has it's clearable by default or an option for it anyway okay this seems to be good the last relate date is in july oh let me zoom in let me take a look at their github real quick view select yeah looks looks fine to me so i'm gonna go ahead and go with this and go to installation installation my computer is running really hot right now okay so i need to install it and then register it as a component so let me go and stop my server clear alright so that's installing and now while that's installing oh it closed my windows for me i didn't realize it would do that um so let me import these and then the component doesn't include any css so i can import that separately or i can import the scss so that's one thing i really should have set up i guess is scss i guess i can set it up later but it would be nice to have like a sass folder for when i want to customize the styles okay so let me go to main.js and after bootstrap i'll import the view select and then oh no this goes here uh yeah that goes there and let me delete that and now i need to import the css so i'll import that and um yeah put that oh wait there okay so now it has the css yeah that's fine um installation uh drop down options okay so now that i've registered the component i can use it as a v select and then pass it props i guess so the props would make it oh it's searchable without me passing in any extra pops that's nice all right so let me close main.js close that i can close this and i'm just working out of projects now and i'm going to put that v select inside of here so oh yeah let me run the server first so i need to start that server again so npm start all right building webpack is going okay it's done now it'll open there and let me get so i v select options so i could just pass an array or i can pass in array of objects which is what i want to do for options because i want the value to be different from the label basically yeah it is but after initial build it's okay and soon we'll have i guess better options to webpack or advanced webpack that builds faster i don't know or maybe better computers that build webpack faster maybe it's my computer that's slow yeah vi vite is exciting um let's see view three should be out next month and then i guess vite or vite version one should be out in a couple months i think am i right all right so i'm gonna get rid of that make it selfclosing and then also just so i get my returns in there so let me put this on multiple lines and see how that looks go to menu projects awesome and it works out of the box it doesn't quite match the bootstrap styling but it's pretty close and i'm not too worried about it um so basically i'll have a list of the projects here once i have projects and then they'll display and i'll be able to search for them and actually because i have view x i can go ahead and be saving things in view x even before i get a database oh you're saying because it's mac it's slow no this computer is like five years old and i've been running it like all day every day for the last five years um it keeps the desk nice and toasty i think it actually makes this room hot with all the lighting and the mac and everything this room gets like 10 degrees hotter while i'm streaming okay so i'm going to leave this page as it is for now and exports and settings pages i guess i'll have to work on those next stream or if i get time later but i do want to make this ad entry page um oh yeah and i wanted to have a button at the top here to as a shortcut but i guess if this is the default page anyway maybe i don't want the button i don't know it's only a few pages in the app um yeah but i am gonna get a new mac hopefully soon i picked out all my specs but they're just so expensive i'm just waiting as long as possible i have a linux computer that works great for everything but i don't stream from it and i don't have my client software on it either so i kind of work on work on the side with that okay so ad entry i need to make i guess a time entry page and let's see so in views i'll make new file should i call it time entry time entry dot view and this will have a template too and i'll do the same kind of things v container v row v column then i won't have a second column here so i think i'll just do h1 and then new time entry uh wait until apple silicone comes out huh yeah that they just really want computers to be phones yeah i don't know i don't know about that i'm just what i'm happy about is that they fixed that keyboard and now they're no longer using the butterfly keyboards they have the magic keyboard which is supposed to be much better so because the butterfly keyboard my friends who have it most of them broke keys or a trouble and i just didn't like typing on it at all so i'm i'm really happy they fixed that after a couple years but they fixed it the new mac also has a physical escape key i don't want to be talking too much about mac but i think that was a better option to add that back instead of just a bar whatever the screen bar thing okay so now i have add new time entry this will be where the form is um okay now i need to make this page routable so in my routes i'm gonna say okay so i have hours log so actually after hours log i'm gonna do i don't know add time entry because i'll have an ad log entry too later so uh time entry component and time entry imported from uh time entry uh yeah i'm happy with i've gotten yes using vm without sp physical escape key yeah that's that was a big thing that i didn't like because i use the escape key all the time and actually on so at my desk here when i'm not streaming i use um programmable keyboard so i have my escape key right at my pinky finger so i can just hit escape all the time it's right next to there instead of being way up in the corner which isn't ideal for vim users uh a complaint terminal what's a complaint terminal windows has a complaint terminal to complain to windows about things you don't like about it yeah i used windows for years before i used mac um let's see i just think for development linux and mac are easier and mac is the one that has a lot of programs working for it but we'll see how windows turns out with their new adoption of linux i'm excited about that okay so time entry i need a form here let me go grab a bootstrap form form oh i'm not in the right place let me go here bootstrap form okay bootstrap form component and helper components that optionally support inline form styles okay so here's the basic form i'm just going to copy it because it looks fine to me form data results okay oh cool it has already has an on reset method as well so let me uh take the whole form and paste it in here then i'll just get rid of the stuff that i don't want okay b form so i need to indent that yeah i think that's good um yeah that looks good and now i might need do i need data in here oh i also need to make a route for the card um class form oh this is form data the form data results okay so and these are the v bound variables in the data method okay food so that must be some kind of a drop down show equals true i don't need show and hide so i'm going to get rid of that be if oops what did i do um let me go to here okay so on reset on submit i'll have to make those methods and then form group why do form groups only have one input or i guess if you're doing things on the same line uh can we have the new entry form on a modal box i want i want it on a separate page um i think yeah i don't always like forms and modals although sometimes it's okay i guess if i was doing it in a table no even then i don't know um anyone else have an opinion about putting the form in a modal uh can we have a new entry what's nice about nwjs though is that you can write all of your code once and it will run on windows linux and osx yes that is the nice thing modals are just asking for trouble thanks asking for trouble okay so let me get rid of some of these extra inputs and check boxes i can leave those okay i'm going gonna need to make a script tag here so i can remodel my elements so i need data and return an object and then so form data and then i'll need to remodel all of my elements inside of here and then i need two methods as well so let me go ahead and create those methods on a methods object i need on submit which is a method yep and what's the other one oh it's called on reset so on reset to reset the form okay avoid modals whenever possible yeah i hear that from designers all the time avoid modals or yeah basically don't use modals for forms just for displaying information um okay so let's see um what was i doing oh yeah let me make it the page routable so when i click add entry it should route to this time entry page um so i need to put that on the hours log this add entry so split up the lines here and then i'll add the add click at the end so when they click on this add entry button it should route them so i think i can do router.push because because i have the router object available to me in the component so if i do dot push and then push the route that i want which is um i think from here i can do name right so i can say just denote the name of the route that i want um which is time entry so i can do name time entry and then from time entry i'm not sure if view router will break but i just want to add the component name here so it matches up time entry okay that's good so uh yeah what just happened there okay uh oh yeah all of this stuff is not defined i need to clean up my form uh does that have something to do with accessibility okay you are all talking about accessibility of modals so i'm gonna let that happen and type reset um okay these are check boxes so let me see what items i need in this form in the first place and put those items in the form and let me go to time entry um so eventually i'd like these to be automatic like there to be a timer in the app to start and stop like a little window that pops up in the corner of your desktop where you can start and stop your time but for right now it's manual entry so they're going to have to input a start time and put a stop time and then i want like a text field of any notes that they have and then there's going to be a foreign key relating a project to the time entry later but not right now so i basically need start stop and notes so i can get rid of the check boxes let me get rid of these um i can also get rid of this uh these drop down so now i just have one input which is going to be actually i need a date input so let me look that up okay oh cool so it's displaying now i do need this i forgot to do oh no i have a container um this is centered for some reason that text okay so i'm going to do um let's see okay so this isn't all in one i need to add another v row and then nest all these components so that i can have a v column here small i will do 6 6 columns wide and then offset small will be 12 columns wide and then all of this stuff will be nested inside and all of that so container okay so i'm going to indent these ones and it's going to be oops command okay and then here i'm going to uh wait didn't like that close the column and then close that row okay and now it should be more centered is it is it just catching up now or did i do something wrong because i have the rows inside of this column now which should be six columns wide on small and oh it's offset is 12 columns that's weird offset is three columns okay offset small yeah so i'm not sure why this isn't working right now i can compare it to my other component so i have oh this is so dumb okay so i'm in beautify mode still and when you use the beautified design library it um has v dash for everything so let me see if i can do b dash and yeah shouldn't have anything else so let me replace this with b dash and change that okay now okay now it works properly that's much better i don't know if anyone said that no everyone's kind of talking about modals and accessibility in the app okay so that's just okay for right now i don't have a lot of time so i'm gonna just finish adding the form inputs and let me look for the date date times here so date form date picker that looks promising b form date picker okay so it picks a date and then what about the time though is there a time picker uh some some ui libraries have it where you can have them both in one so you can choose the date and then you and then it brings up another box where you can choose the time um hmm i wonder if you can default to the current date button only mode okay i don't want that um so let me look real quick at a time picker and then see how i want to do this time selection widget okay so they are completely separate uh this is interesting what is this never seen something like this before if you need a time picker as a custom form control use the okay this is what i want then the b form time picker oh and then it pops up here so it's the same ui which is okay i guess and then can you type in here can i type oh no i type here right this is weird uh okay and then i guess they probably have oh wow a lot of options i guess they probably have our 12 okay so this toggles 24 hour versus 12 hour so that's good does anyone else think this time picker looks a little weird um but i'll go ahead and use it for now that's fine so let me go to the most basic example oh that's disable no it's not disabled um yeah let me get the date picker and time picker and expand this um so i'm actually going to get rid of this and inside here i'll put the time picker and i'll make that selfclosing and then put it on multiple rows okay so v model will be wait uh form data dot start time or i should put start i guess because there's start and end for times and then there is um just one date because it won't go over into the next date so everything is separated by which day you worked on and yeah so if you need to go into the next day i guess it's going to not go over or should i like if you work from 11 p.m until 2 a.m should i have two different dates for that maybe i should if people want to work wonky hours that should be up to them your name so okay um so here i need to put start date and end date okay so now i need to add that date time form date picker ujs date object okay so jared's recommending view to date picker let me take a look at that um view to date picker view to date picker on npm let me go through mpm so i can find the official github for the project we have about 10 minutes left how's everyone doing what did you think about the desktop app today date picker oh this is interesting i can do date ranges i like that internationalization let me take a look so home page which is the repository but let me go there it's running a little bit slow all right so view to date picker so this doesn't do times but i can get the date range which is good there are i guess themes for it the props are documented that's good uh okay this is nice all right yes it does click the demo oh what demo is it this yeah must be this let's see oh it has time too oh i like i like this better than the bootstrap one with the arrows select week week 28 okay select date select month this is nice select year i might use this for other things in the app too select date time okay date time is what i want then select date time because i can select the date and the time for both the start and the end that's perfect thanks jared that's a good idea oh this isn't zoomed in so i don't know if you can see it but um okay and then i also have oh okay so this is date time range so let me pick a date and then an end date oh and then it says a time i don't know if i want these both in the same one okay but it's cool it lets you do the hours seconds everything hours minutes seconds um do i want these all in one or do i want two different boxes one for start and one for end okay so let me install this library for starters uh let's see install save view to date picker okay i'm gonna have to stop the server again all right so npm install view to date picker we have a couple minutes left so i'll have to pick back up on this uh next time we do a form for date and a form for time the news have computed to combine them into one date object i think i'm going to do them two separate ones so i'll store the i want the date and the time together but i want i don't want the start date and the end date to be in the same form basically oh i think uh youtube started lagging a little bit more toward the end so that must be about 20 seconds behind or 15 seconds maybe i don't know okay so i have nwjs hour tracking and now uh oh yeah let me start the server again so npm start i have that installed and i can start setting it up so i need to import the date picker register it as a component and i can just do this locally i guess it doesn't matter i can always do it globally as well okay there's my window add entry go to the add entry page and yeah now that i look at this again i really don't like this interface because i can't even type in here so i have to just keep clicking 30 times or click and hold yeah it's okay but i think it needs some improvement so i'm gonna get rid of these then these bootstrap form form picker time picker whatever get rid of those oh input group ids i shouldn't have the same ids multiple times label 4 um yeah i don't have these yet but i will and now let me do uh date picker i need the css where okay import date picker import date picker css so i'm going to do these globally so let me go to my main.js file and import the date picker okay and now i need to do view dot use so let's see um oh after so view dot is it oh it's registering component yeah view dot component and then i guess i can what is it date dash picker yeah so it's the same thing so date dash picker and then so it's registered as date dash picker and now i need to pass in a component which is date picker okay so now i have it registered here as date picker and i can go to my form and i should be able to use it here oh yeah oh no i got the css that's good good good so now i can use this so let me just grab one let me grab the date time one and paste it here and okay let me make this self closing again so i'll do that oh yeah and v model so i'll do form data dot start date okay cool um it's not working because it's not remodeling to anything but the drop down works that's good so let me quickly add this to the to the end one and okay that's good oh what happened what happened end date uh okay so hour log ad entry something's wrong where is the console you can just do oh my shortcut hotkey didn't work so let me inspect don't forget to plug your youtube twitch oh yeah uh check out my youtube channel uh faraday academy i'm also faraday academy on twitch academy oh misspelled v model did i uh where is v model start date v model um i don't think i misspelled v model is this on twitch no no it's not this particular stream isn't so twitch doesn't let me stream as a twitch affiliate i can't stream on two platforms at the same time um but that's complicated anyway so but i do all of my coding live streams on my faraday academy twitch channel no yeah so um let me just see what the error is real quick let me look at the console cannot read property start date of undefined oh because i i spelled it form date okay form data uh and then let me do start date and then what is that an object and end date i don't know it'll be modeled there okay cool and so now i have my start date and my end date awesome submit and reset of course i don't have those hooked up to anything so yeah i have like 30 seconds left um except for afcc guest spots yeah exactly so all my other coding streams are on my twitch account i have live interviews on this account so like uh danny thompson he came on my channel the other day maybe you've seen him if you're around coding twitter and instagram he's a really great uh speaker coder all that stuff you can check in your view dev tools yes i will use view dev tools in the next stream oh wait this is awesome this is awesome i can finally zoom in and view devtools in a stream yeah i'll definitely be using that next time firefox has been slightly frustrating i mean just i mean not being able to zoom in anyway so what do you guys think about the project it's it's kind of cool right uh i have all the different pages stuff is starting to get set up the components are there the plugins a little bit of the design is there thanks anish yeah this stream felt um a lot more like a real project than the other streams before i was just kind of building the free code camp projects which was also kind of cool because i built them five years ago and then to go back and build them in a new framework today that was that was cool for me anyway yeah thanks jared thanks anish thanks tom uh thanks sashi thanks everyone for everyone who joined the stream chatted i know a lot of people couldn't chat which is unfortunate but if you want to chat then um join my discord channel so after this stream i'm going to post a comment on the stream with a link to my discord channel so you can chat with me further let me know what you thought about the project and feel free to go to the github the github for this project and raise an issue i have to get off the stream now but i'm about to push the code yes i need to i'm going to push the code and i'm going to rearrange the png mess that i made here and update it so that's gonna be live in the next five minutes okay so i'll do that as soon as i get off thanks again for coming check out my youtube channel and i look forward to seeing you again for this project next friday morning take care
