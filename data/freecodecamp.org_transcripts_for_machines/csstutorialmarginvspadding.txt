do you know the difference between margin and padding in CSS the margin is the space around the border of an HTML element you can think of it as the space between the elements here we can see an example with two diffs that contain paragraphs if we assign the margin property and gradually increase its value we can see how the diffs become separated from each other padding is the internal space the space between the border of each element and its content it we assign padding to the divs and then gradually increase the value we can see how their content separates from the border gradually moving inwards we can assign the same value or different values for each one of the four sides of the element for the margin and for the padding
