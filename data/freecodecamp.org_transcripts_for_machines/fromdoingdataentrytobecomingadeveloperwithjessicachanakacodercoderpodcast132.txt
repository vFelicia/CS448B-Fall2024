the first one to two years were incredibly stressful because I constantly felt like I was going to fail and they were going to fire me for incompetence so it was a lot of Googling it was a lot of like looking up at deack overflow trying to do as much research on my own before I actually asked one of the other developers because I was also very afraid of annoying the other developers if I bug them too much with questions so it was like I would say it was pretty difficult for me at that time but I was learning so much like I think my brain was just like expanding with the amount of things I would learn welcome back to the free Cod Camp podcast I'm Quincy Larsson teacher and founder of freecodecamp.org each week we're bringing you Insight from developers Founders and ambitious people getting into Tech this week we're joined by Jessica Chand AKA coder coder she's a soft software engineer who has worked in the field for more than a decade and interestingly she studied Photography in school and she never even took a programming class uh and yet she's had this illustrious career so we're going to learn a lot from her welcome Jessica yeah thanks so much for having me yeah I uh I've been a longtime admirer of your work uh of the caliber of your husband's animation sound design like all the production you put into these amazing uh video courses that you create and just your fun sense of humor and like it's just like if there was like a word to describe Cod or quer I would describe it as like fun I mean that may seem kind of like a like a short word to describe it but it is fun to watch your videos that's awesome yeah thank you that is definitely one one thing we we aim for with the the videos yeah so I want to like go way back as we always do and just start with like kind of how you got into Tech because my understanding is you don't have any formal training en coding and in fact like your career kind of like evaporated early on as the field just fundamentally changed and uh you you found yourself like working kind of like in those kind of temp office type jobs and stuff uh for quite a while like but before we get to that like maybe you can talk a little bit about your early days and your early Ambitions yeah so as you said I didn't you know go to school for anything programming wise but I was always into computers even from a pretty young age um like I remember going to the library and checking out like a book on basic programming and trying to like do that on the computer at home um and then also in I think it was middle school or High School my sister and I ran a BBS this is pre internet days a bullet and board system so that was and that was something that I kind of set up myself um and yeah that was super fun um back in the back in those days yeah how do bbs's work I mean I know because I used to use them but but like what is running it a BBS like uh of course that's like a major plot point in the show Halt and Catch Fire like uh they set up a BBS in the 80s but maybe maybe you could talk about what that was like cuz yeah how did you get special software did you have like a special server um we ran it off of one of the computers that we had at home so we had two computers at home so one of them you would have to run the software to run the BBS and people would actually have to physically call your the phone number attached to the computer in order to connect to the BBS from their computer um with these different protocols and everything was sort of asy art you know very slow slow speeds like 2400 bod modems and all that kind of stuff um but yeah you could log into the BBS you could there were message boards there were games you could play they were actually really fun you could also upload and download files so yeah it was just a way for people to find community and just like you know have fun in their spare time yeah and what kind of software did you have on that because I remember like when I dial into a BBS there would be like places you could like leave messages for other people kind of like a like an altnet uh uset like precursor uh but there were also lots of interactive games where you could only do so much every day so it like encouraged you to come back the next day and like bu buff up the stats of your character and like explore it was like kind of like text based Adventure type stuff yeah for sure um I ran it off of a software called Renegade so you could you didn't have to code it from scratch so you could download these BBS software packages I guess and then install them on your computer and so you didn't have to do any actual programming to really set it up you just had to kind of install it and configure it um so yeah no programming needed what do people use it for I used it to play games they were really fun um there was like legend of the red dragon the sort of D and D themed game where you you know fought monsters and try to get gold um there's also kind of a Star Wars themed game called trade Wars where you would trade different um resources and you could like save up to get like the Enterprise type uh ship and they like fangi and stuff yeah it was it was fun fun times that's pretty cool so it's basically like kind of like a Commerce simulator where you you have like uh yeah that sounds fun and how many people could use the BBS concurrently like did you have multiple phone lines um it was limited to one person per phone line and we only had one phone line so yeah how did how did uh your parents feel about like having that phone line tied up all the time we yeah we're pretty I would I guess privileged because my parents were willing to pay for a second phone line that was dedicated to the BBS um but yeah I limited to one person at a time which is kind of mindblowing you know considering nowadays everything is like happening at the same time yeah maybe you could talk about like how you get the word out as a kid like did you just tell your friends at school or like how did people discover that there was this phone number they could dial into with their modem and play games and stuff I think there were places you could list your BBS but my sister and I were members of other local bbs's and had made friends and stuff so you just kind of tell your friends about your own BBS and because ours was smaller it was you were less likely to get a busy signal when you tried to call in which I think the friends really liked so it was kind of like a just like a hangout place um for like us and our online friends yeah I mean that's so cool because it's like very local I mean it yeah I don't know if there's like a an equivalent on the internet right now because everything is concurrent like just because I'm looking at somebody's Instagram feed doesn't mean somebody else can't also look at it right or any sort of synchronous like chat type experience like using slack or using uh Discord or something like that like everything you just take for granted that it's like a multitenant operation right um yeah so yeah I can imagine all the constraints in terms and and also the fact that it's like dealing with extremely low amounts of data so everything text ask text yeah that's so cool like it was a different world how did you even discover like how did it like pop in your mind because I would use other people's bbs's but it never occurred to me like I should create a BBS on my own like what do you remember like was there like some uh moment of Revelation like I could do this I think looking back I think I've always had this interest in building things so before I became web developer I taught myself HTML and basic CSS in high school like this is back in the geoc C's days and I just would kind of make blogs for myself but it wasn't because I had all these things I wanted to say it's because I just enjoyed setting up the the blog websites and I remember my friend was like sort of making fun of me a little bit because I kept just like having new blogs and I would have to send her like the new link every time um but it didn't really sort of cement in my understanding that like I enjoyed making making you know blogs after blogs cuz I enjoyed building websites um but yeah I think I just always liked making things and Building Things yeah well um maybe you can talk a little bit about like your early days and and you know what your aspirations were around High School age um I think in high school I was probably I was a very goody two shoes and I think I wanted to be a doctor um cuz my dad he's tired now but he was a doctor um so I think that was kind of the the limits of my aspirations for some reason I didn't realize that like you could be a web developer or a programmer back then I'm not sure why but I just I didn't really think about you know what job out of all the jobs in the world can I do I think I just sort of had a very limited sort mind mindset at that point yeah and I think that's that's a common thing uh among like a lot of people that come on the fre cocaine podcast is like they have like this mentality like oh I'll be like a doctor or a lawyer or a dentist or or some kind of other type of engineer like because that's what the people you know that are older than me seem to be doing in these Social Circles and they seem to be doing well they've got like the house and they they've got you know stable income and they they're eventually going to be able to retire and stuff like that so so you kind of look at those people and you're like wow if I just had a lot of money and I could basically just do whatever I want and like have like a really good you know sound system or whatever it was you know we aspired to when we were kids you you kind of like look at the job as just something you do as a means to an end to just have a relaxing enjoyable life and and be able to have a family and stuff like that like that's how a lot of people I think look at uh when they're younger they're just like okay what do I do that like being a doctor you get tons of respect right uh like people call you doctor right and and like if if if somebody like has like a collapses on the sidewalk or something they're like is there a doctor and you run over and everybody parts to make way for you so I can definitely understand why like I would definitely say that's the most common thing that people who come on the free C Camp podcast want to be when they grow up as a doctor uh but for you that that wasn't in the cards and it probably wasn't for academic reasons but like why did you ultimately not decide to pursue yeah um yeah I think the the doctor thing didn't last very long um so College I took I think intro to chemistry and I almost failed it and I think after that class I was like I don't think this is for me because I knew the classes would only get harder and harder with like organic chemistry and like all this kind of stuff so I dropped that and then I didn't know what to major in and I eventually took a drawing class and I loved it and this art is something that I had done you know since high school I took a lot of Art and photography classes in high school and I just you know really enjoyed that so I thought oh maybe I'll try majoring in art so that's kind of how I got into majoring in photography in school that's so interesting like I I just assume because you're like frankly you're like a really smart person like I definitely look at you and say she's probably like way smarter than me um and the reason I think that uh you know like if you look at like the caliber of your work and the way you carry yourself and talk and and stuff like this person is extremely organized and so I just presumed oh it's probably not an academic reason do you ever wonder if like that was like a weer class or some sort of like like that if you could have actually probably like powered through uh doing like Premed and then medical school and stuff like that or do you genuinely think it wasn't you didn't have it in you I think I could have I think the the problem this is I think this is just my personal situation I like didn't have a really big social life in high school I didn't really have that many friends that I would hang out with so the only thing I had to do was study and read books so that's basically all I did when I was younger then I went to college and you know college is like this new experience you meet all these new people so I had a lot of friends and so I in high school I didn't have to really have time management skills where I'm choosing to study over doing something fun but in college I ended up doing a lot of fun things as opposed to studying so I would like routinely hang out with people and then I would have to stay up till like 300 a.m. studying and trying to finish my work um or I would just stay up till 300 a.m. cuz I was hanging out with people so like yeah I did not have great time management skills like at all um when I was in college which is sad to say but that's kind of what happened so I think that's that's the reason why it didn't really work out but I I don't think I would have enjoyed all the different science classes to be honest yeah yeah so you're into art um so to to resolve that tangent you're into art and uh you're interested uh like like where does this drawing class take you in terms of like what's your progression as a creative thinker and and maker um yeah so I think the drawing class the the professor actually was like asking me she she was a painter who was doing like a temporary thing at my school and she was like I why are you not majoring in art so I think I just took that as a big compliment which you know was and that's kind of how I decided to you know major in that um but in terms of artistic uh skills or whatever I think that I actually didn't learn very much photography at all because my professor was very handsoff so he would just say all right go take pictures and then we would take pictures and develop them and print them and then we would like hang them up and have critiques and that was it he didn't really like teach us very much so I actually taught myself more after college um cuz I lived in Boston for a long time and I was unemployed for about a month after I moved there so all I did was walk around the city and with my little Sony point and shoot camera and I just like shot photos all around the city for you know that became one of my hobbies and I think that kind of practice over and over helped me to really develop better photographic skills so I'm yeah I feel like you can teach yourself a lot just through trying things yeah 100% I I can I can get behind that sentiment because that's how I like kind of root Force learning coding and other things like that and it sounds like so one interesting note about what you're there was actually a study like and I'm always like really load the quote like social science studies because they can't necessarily be uh reproduced the finings can't be reproduced NE early but uh I think there was like they B it was photography and and they they had like some Professor who basically said like told some of the students like I want you to just take one picture but I want it to be a really good one and the other one just go take a ton of pictures and it turned out that the people that just incidentally took a whole lot of pictures like they were practicing and their their photos were better subjectively how how do you judge a better photo but like yeah the the the researchers found that like the the students or the professors like like that I'm sorry I'm totally butchering the findings but the point of the study was that like it you know you can stand all day there and talk about the theory what what you know makes for a good composition of a shot what's like the hierarchy and like all these other different considerations right I know nothing about photography uh but but at the same time like if you just go out and practice the actual skill maybe a lot of this you'll into it and you'll build it up so maybe your professor was kind of like the the equivalent of like those old uh you know um the master from the Kung Fu movies like standing there pass you know you know basically just just giving you like very vinary feedback on your work but it does sound like you some critique right um but but like maybe he had kind of internalized that like to become a good photographer you just got to go out and take a lot of photos right a lot of a lot of shots on goal so to speak um yeah that's cool so you you were living in Boston so this is after college we can we can go to Life After College right like for a photography major um which I mean I I think if you took like all the different college majors and you rank them like you know Premed and like software engineering and things like that like computer science I think is like the highest compensating degree you can study overall like over like the next 20 years like something like that but like if you were to stack rank those like I'm pretty sure photography would be toward the bottom in terms of like remunerative careers I apologize if you can hear like some lawnmowing stuff this is just like that one day of the month can you is that coming through to you at all I cannot hear it so I think you're good yeah well it dodged I don't have to go out and like politely asked the gentleman to like come back later okay so um yeah so I guess my point is like no no shade at all the photography Majors like I uh you know I'm an English major so that's also toward the bottom of the list but like when you arrive at Boston what are you thinking like why did you move to Boston first of all cuz that's like a big expensive city and like you said you were unemployed for a month like did you have a job lined up or what what were your what was your thinking at this point in your life I I went I was like kind of already in the New England area and some of my friends had moved to Boston already so it seemed like the next logical step to just kind of move to the nearest big city um but yeah I looking back I can't I almost can't believe I did this but I just was like okay I'll just move there I'll find a job once I'm there um and the only thought I had was I'm going to try to be an artist because that was the only like I guess job that they really talked about at school they didn't really train us to yeah think about other jobs like you know I don't know going into advertising or other things like that being a commercial photographer like everything was about about the fine art stuff so anyway in Boston I was just looking for jobs related to photography and so I just called up all the Photo Labs in the area and one of them like ended up giving me a job so that's kind of how I fell into I worked in a commercial photo lab and yeah that was a that was a fun experience but I did not make much money at all so when you say like a photo lab like where you going to get your photos developed like with the chemicals and stuff yep yeah so they they serviced commercial um photographers so it was a really large lab the professional photographers would come in with all their roles of film from their shoots and we would develop them we had a film guy who just all he did all day was develop all the film um and my job was to make contact sheets from the strips of film where you can see it's like the size of the negatives but you can see what's on them um before printing um so that was one of my jobs but yeah that was a it was a really fun experience but but definitely not doesn't exist as much anymore today yeah yeah I mean with the EV a digital photography that like kind of like probably made that industry go the way of like buggy whips like there are still some people that sell buggy whips like there there are like multi hundredy old companies that produce these buggy whips and it could be that like 100 years from now there are still Photo Labs but they're going to be probably very Niche yes and yeah it's not like a giant industry anymore right uh like I wouldn't be surprised if that that industry had undergone like a 90% you know reduction over the past 20 years for sure if not more so okay so you're working in this photo lab uh servicing uh professional uh you know photographers probably like wedding photographers the people that do like yearbook I don't know like who who are the commercial what are what are the jobs in photography how did how did the photography industry work at the time um from what I could tell just from the people coming in they were like um commercial portrait photographers they do you know newspaper and magazine photos there were wedding photographers um and there also some just like fine artists who would come in um and they would have us print their their photos for them um so it was it was kind of a range I'm sure there were some like hobbyist photographers who were just kind of doing it for fun too yeah did did you have any ankling like hey I could do what they're doing and like go out and like make kind of like a consultancy out of this or like be a freelance photographer I don't know why well I sort of tried I did sort of second shooting for some wedding photographers and I interned with one of the commercial photographers who came in but for some reason it never really stuck with me in terms of oh this is something I want to do um it just seemed like I think I just didn't know how to even break into the field and I didn't have enough of a maybe desire to be a photographer to do the research to figure out how to do the business side of things things so yeah yeah I mean this is kind of like sorry I didn't mean to interrupt you there's a little bit of legy uh yeah this is like an indictment of higher education that you studied photography for like four years and you still have like no idea how to actually like go out and make money as a photographer and and you're not even sure that you would want to even if you knew how but you know college just kind of put you onto this track and they give you a major important major and then there's so much momentum behind it and it's so hard to switch but I mean it does sound to me kind of like uh if I can like be probably over prescriptive in hand wavy but it sounds like you know uh you said you didn't have a a big interesting social life uh when you were younger you go to college college is where a lot of people if you're fortunate enough to go to college like their social life kind of burgeons and the whole world opens up right it's not just like High School never ends type uh you know clicky things it's like real people kind of like becoming friends and and around common interests and stuff like that and a lot of that kind of like high school nonsense kind of like breaks down to an extent like once you get out of like fraternity sority spheres and stuff uh and I'm not trying to like knock those or anything but like I was never in a fraternity and like I didn't have a lot of respect for like the fraternities and stuff like we we always kind of looked a SCS at them if that's how you pronounce the word like oh you know like that's like we're here to learn you know like like I kind of like elevated myself above like the people doing like you know drinking excessively and stuff like that so um but it sounds like you had kind of like a social Awakening in college and then uh maybe the fact that that that was all happening distracted you from academics to an extent and when the professor was like oh you should consider being an artist or wanting to switch to Art you're like sure it doesn't sound like there was like a ton of Liberation and like longterm planning during those four years would you agree with that sentiment I I don't want to mischaracterize it no I would definitely agree I think I just didn't know what was possible so you don't know what you don't know and I didn't really understand how I needed to think about trying to find a career or you know choosing you know which one I wanted to do um so I think it was yeah a lot of fumbling and just not really knowing what what I wanted in life I think back then but you're in Boston this very expensive city uh very you know prestigious City like that's where like Harvard is MIT there's so many uh like big important companies based out of Boston there's so much research being done there it's it's like a really important and it's one of the oldest cities in the United States so it's got like this very long stored history and um and you're just kind of working at a photo lab and like did you feel like ambition going to and from work every day like at what point did the more ambitious Jessica Chan start to materialize the one that we all know and respect today I think it took a while I think I I really just didn't know what I wanted to do when I was in my 20s so I think it wasn't really until I started working um at this small web dev shop in Boston that I was thinking oh I can like sort of stay here and learn how to program they were doing like sort of backend like database work that's kind of where I started um how did you get how did you get that job um so as you probably saw in my like YouTube video I did a lot of temp office jobs for I would say a few years so this is just you know like it was fine work but um it wasn't something that I necessarily felt passionate about but I was looking for a job at one point cuz my like temp work had ended or whatever and I looked on Craigslist for just random jobs and I was like oh I could probably do data entry because that was one of the things that I'd done at my temp jobs so I found this data entry position in Boston and it ended up being at this small web dev shop and I got the job there started out doing data entry but then they ended up teaching me like SQL database work and doing net um programming and Microsoft Access for those of you who remember um so yeah there was that was kind of like my entrance into like the world of web development even though I had taught myself how to build websites when I was younger it was always just something I did for fun and it just never clicked in my brain that this is something that people can get a job in and also make like really good money so for some reason it just took me falling into that job and realizing like oh I have these like skills that I can develop and then use to apply for you know actual web development jobs cuz the job that I got from Craigslist was like very contract like temporary stuff yeah yeah it's almost like Destiny's way of like you know repeatedly like shoving you in this direction yeah um so so you're starting to learn the skills how do you go about learning this giant Corpus of knowledge it sounds like you already knew a little bit about you know Microsoft access database tool that comes with Microsoft Office like the PowerPoint everybody knows how to use PowerPoint everybody knows how to use Excel and Word but not as many people know how to use access because yeah the learning curve is a little bit steeper um but it sounds like you were you were learning relevant Tech skills just on the job and you were being pushed in this more technical Direction like do you remember a clear point where somebody entrusted you with actually building something do you remember what your first project was I mean I started out and I think this is what I think people realize when you get your first job in programming or web development or whatever is that you're not necessarily going to be tasked with building this entire giant project from scratch most likely you're going to be given tasks to do in existing projects that the company already has had running so that's what I did so I had to work on this website and I had to for example you know add or subtract um drop down menu items so I had to learn how to do that so it's very like task by task based or I had to learn how to um make changes to the websites that they needed with CSS or um just like learning how to run reports and write reports and SQL to get you know data from one of their clients so it was very much like I need to do this thing because my boss told me to if I don't know how to do it I need to figure it out yeah so uh essentially you had the benefit of having somebody tell you what to do and give you these missions and then each mission was like a growth opportunity uh and and how did you figure stuff out like because again you have no formal programming training you are a hobbyist like web designer I guess um and you have very rudimentary skills probably but you do have the benefit of kind of like a sense of Aesthetics you have like an eye from photography and from taking art class and stuff like that uh maybe you could talk about like the like your Ascent as far as like gaining more confidence uh in your abilities as you ran these kind of like fetch Quests for your for your boss yeah I think like looking back I honestly really lucked out with that job um it paid pretty terribly and also like I wasn't paid for eight hours a day I was only paid for like the actual tasks that they could build to their clients so depending on how busy they were it I might only have like 30 minutes or like a couple hours a day but what I did learn was how to learn or how to find solutions to things um because my boss would explain one time how to do something like how to you know run a squl query and how to write it and then I would have to do the same thing for a similar task and he got very grumpy if I had to ask him how if I had to ask him to explain something to me more than once so he actually would give me um and I think there were a couple other people working there at the time we all had notebooks that we had to leave at the office and we had to take notes um so if he would explain something I would write it down how to do it and then if I had to do the same task in the future I could just refer back to my notebook and be like oh this is how to do it and then if you do that five or 10 times eventually you learn how to do it without having to refer to your notes so that process times you know a hundred or however many times I just learned everything kind of Peace Meal which was one way to learn I think it worked out for me um because you learn real skills applicable skills like right away um you know I didn't learn things from a class and then have to figure out how that works in the real world later on so it was it was an interesting way to learn I'm not sure if that way exists as much anymore because this is back before coding boot camps existed so in some ways timing wise I really was fortunate in in terms of being able to find this job and also use my skills to land another Junior Dev job um a couple years later so I think the world has just changed a lot from that um but you know that's how it was for me I mean what you describe doesn't sound unlike what like a blacksmith might do to like an apprentice thousands of years ago right or maybe hundreds of years ago uh where it's like I already showed you how to do this like almost kind of like a cartoon like if you ever seen the old Sam Remy SpiderMan movies The Cigar chomping boss with like the the buzz cut and he's sitting back in his he's like Parker I told you to do this this and this you know kind of like very um I guess uh he has very high standards for you and what you're going to get done right um very much trial by fire yeah and that Trial By Fire Man the the lawnmowing is really intensifying again I apologize uh if anybody hears like you know what sounds like a helicopter landing it's very faint okay good good good good uh thank you for reassuring me that uh as I'm very openly say like at free camp we don't do anything of these podcasts like this is unfiltered like unfolding in real time right uh and for me that's like exciting it's exciting that there are a bunch of men with hoodies and leaf blowers outside my window like playing a part in this recording so uh yeah it sounds like you learned a ton from that opportunity even though it was probably like um it was like a certain window of time when it was like the Wild West in programming and technology and there weren't there wasn't really the expectation maybe that somebody would have formally studied programming and computer science or they if they studied that they probably studied a bunch of Applied Mathematics they didn't study how to build websites and how to do do and a lot of this these Technologies were kind of being invented on the fly during that era um so you don't necessarily have comprehensive textbooks maybe you go to like a a Barnes & Noble or a borders and you get like did you ever get like the big fat books like um on different Technologies like yeah yeah like um I have quite a few that I actually need to donate because I don't read them yeah well um I mean do you remember that era like uh of just going into a big bookstore and just be like wow like so much knowledge all this knowledge is right here yeah I need to buy this book and then there was like a CD ROM in the back oh yeah of course yep in the classic sleeve yeah very cool well so it sounds like you learned a tremendous amount there and I I'm excited to learn a little bit more about what transpar because it sounds like you you were kind of going through the the proverbial uh learning process but you were doing it in a way that most people don't do it because most people uh nowadays in 2024 like just use freeo Camp to learn or they use some combination of courses like the courses you've developed uh or or you know video based courses or um they may use some books uh still to learn different Technologies like everybody learns a little bit different but to actually be in a shop with other devs kind of like almost kind of like I think of it as like um I mean I keep coming back to like a newsroom feel cuz it does feel like an editor just sending you out like giving you assignments and I worked in newspapers for a while and that was very much what it was like it was extremely hands off and you just like learned from your peers you learned from reading the New York Times every day and seeing what they were doing like like were you going to like CocaCola's website and like looking at their like interaction design and stuff like that and trying to learn from it or were you studying a lot of work that was out in you know in the wild to be honest I didn't because I was so overwhelmed with the work I had to do for my job during the day um and this is this is more like after I left that sort of temp job and was able to work at an advertising agency like that was like drinking from a fire hose in terms of I just had to like change this button on this landing page but like I knew that I had to get it done like in less than a day or a few hours because you know I need to meet my deadline so like it was I would say that the first three years the first one to two years were incredibly stressful because I constantly felt like I was going to fail and they were going to fire me for incompetence so it was a lot of Googling it was a lot of like looking up at stack Overflow trying to do as much research on my own before I actually asked one of the other developers because I was also very afraid of annoying the other Developers is if I bug them too much with questions so it was like I would say it was pretty difficult for me at that time but I was learning so much like I think my brain was just like expanding with the amount of things I would learn because like every day I would have to learn you know five five new things and then you multiply that by all the days in the year and like by the end of the first year I learned like so much just from having to do all these like innumerable little tasks yeah it was so yeah I didn't have free time to um try to build my skills because I was learning so much like on the job yeah interesting so like I mean would you just go home and be like exhausted like collapse in your bed like cuz learning is so hard and it's so tax like I spent a lot of my time learning and and not to make it about me again but like like there are days at the end of the day my brain is so tired I it's like mush because I spent the entire day like studying really hard on different topics and stuff like for me like the greatest feeling in the world the thing that I optimize and I build my life around obviously like rearing my kids and stuff like that and you know making a living and and you know running free camp but like in my free time I spend as much time as possible reading listening the podcast studying uh World languages of course shedding on the Bas woodshedding uh Charlie Parker famously goes to a Woodshed and just gets better by just practicing every day in the Woodshed and like like putting on records and learning from anyway sorry like go music tangent I'm obsessed with but um it sounds like your brain was kind of like expanding and you were probably I imagine again I don't want to talk too much about what was theoretically going on in your parid but I imagine like there were more wrinkles getting like you know formed in there and you were like did did you feel yourself becoming more powerful and more uh capable with every day was there a sense of full momentum I I think the first year was more just like living in complete compl abject fear of losing my job um so I think it it took I would say two years I think by the end of my second year at the agency I was like okay I think I'm like starting to feel less panic and more like I realize I'm still at the early stage of the learning curve but it doesn't feel as difficult and impossible as it did in the first year so it's a long time but like I think the 2year Mark was really where I was starting to feel a little bit more comfortable with and even if I didn't know an answer right away I knew that I had the tools to look up and figure out the solution and I think that when I hit that point I was like okay I like subjectively like or objectively I can do pretty much anything that someone asks me I just need to have enough time to like do the research and do trial and error so it was like up to that point it was very hard but after that point I knew I was still a beginner but I felt more confident in my own ability to research and gain you know the the knowledge I needed to you know do my job so one of the takeways I'm getting is like as much as you were learning a and gaining competency like it was not a fun experience cuz it it sounds like like uh imposter syndrome the clinical diagnosis that every developer gets when they're learning the code unless they learn the code when they're a little kid and they completely forget you know like all the the trial and error and stuff um um it sounds like that was completely casting a shadow over like all the enjoyment like so this was a rough year of your life it sounds like it was rough yeah and I think personally I also don't like feeling incompetent so I think that also made it even more difficult for me to not just be fearful and stressed the entire time so you know maybe other people if you're more comfortable you know not being not knowing everything then maybe it would be a little easier for you but I I think I just put a lot of pressure on myself and I think that definitely contributed to how hard that first year was um yeah I was I was very grumpy yeah I I mean like I guess that was like my one thing like Saving Grace when I was like trying to learn to code over this very lengthy process like looking like a total amateure on stage at these hackathons presenting you know having my code crash and or or just like there was this one time that I went out to a hackathon and like I couldn't actually get the project to work like the whole team was counting on me and we just showed a slideshow instead of showing a working prototype and that was like probably like the lowest point in my coding Journey just having let down my team uh but the one thing that like I think made it a little bit more bearable is I've always been kind of like I've never like thought I was a particularly smart or interesting or capable person I always kind of looked at myself as kind of like a uh just just not like a serious human being um and you know like Socrates like the the only thing I know is that I know nothing and I I always kind of like like you know Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure like the fact that they're like these happy golucky kind of fools uh just stumbling into like these very important matters and stuff like that like I always kind of like looked at myself that way and that cushioned kind of the impostor syndrome I'm like of course I'm an imposter like I'm not that smart of a guy you know so uh it sounds like you were holding yourself to a higher standard than I was and that might have been part of the reason for the misery yeah uh you did power through it right you stayed at this job for like seven years right at the at the agency M that's a long time to be at a first job but it's commendable cuz cuz like you know the saying like a rolling stone gathers no Moss you were gathering tons of moss just chilling there right and you want to get moss you want to get character very Moss right you want to be an organic you know uh because Rock by itself is not organic right maybe some types of rock are like sedimentary I don't know but um you know like you were building out like this character and this this Persona as a developer and and kind of coming into your own can you talk about those other six years at the agency once you'd kind of gotten through the first yeah kind of Hell year yeah so I would say so I think I also got promoted um twice in my time there and obviously like companies are completely relative you know everyone sort of has a different idea of like what senior means and all that stuff but I started out as um an assistant web developer so junior level and then I think after two years I got promoted to just web developer so like in the middle and then I think year four I got promoted to senior web developer um again this doesn't mean I could be a senior at like Google or Facebook or whatever but I think that sort of I was it shows that I was able to progress in my career and the agency felt like I was you know contributing more and more the longer that I was there um so yeah it definitely got easier um over time and I felt more confident and less stressed and I sort of like I had a lot of fun back in my agency days cuz you know we all were it's like working together on these incredibly tight timelines and St staying up late sometimes and stuff like that and I don't know if I would want to do that again and have to stay up till 300 a.m. deploying something to production because a client needs it live exactly at that moment in time but it was a fun time and I did feel like um because I was more confident in my skills I was Al also able to take on bigger sort of scopes of work so in the last I would say few years of my time at the agency instead of doing these sort of peac meal tasks like updating this button or you know whatever building this like One landing page I would take on sort of full website builds like from scratch so for example one of our clients was a bank and so I built their website both back and front end um so I built the I set up the CMS we used craft CMS which is a a c CMS and then I also did the front end so I did I worked from the design from the designer and I did all the CSS and all that so that was very satisfying to be able to reach that point where I could actually build a project from start to finish like completely on my own so I I enjoyed that work a lot yeah that's that's sounds like quite an evolution so very beginning you don't know how to do anything you're like struggling to like referencing your notebook over and over that your boss is giving you you're scared to ask questions probably because he's created a Culture of Fear around asking questions but uh yep but by the end you're you're you're like this kind of superhero that's just like sure I can do I can learn you know CP craft new CMS I never heard of uh CMS uh I can do the front end and I I'm like Soup To Nuts uh full stack Dev basically that's that's got to be still have a notebook I do have to say I I still I didn't have a physical notebook as much but it was more like I would keep track of notes like online that's actually how the blogging thing started cuzz I started a blog spot just to write down the notes so I could quickly um refer back to them based on the the tags and stuff so that's kind of how I started the developer blog thing notes for myself man that that is a blast from the past so uh I know right there was this Blogspot and blogger were they were the same right they were the same yeah the domain was blog spot but it was called blogger great branding yeah it's very not confuse anybody right so if you read this book uh it's called the founders at work great classic book that every startup founder has to written by Jessica Livingston uh YC you know board member why combinator board member there's this amazing interview with EV Williams uh where he was running blogger and he had to fire everybody they ran out of money at one point because he was such a bad you know developer like CEO I I no shade to him but he's not the greatest CEO on earth right as we've seen time and time again right so uh then he went on to found Twitter and medium and all these other uh websites but um yeah man like that is a harrowing tale that's by far the best interview in the book is the the tale of kind of ineptitude that led the vlogger almost being destroyed until Google swooped it and saved it the 11th hour but uh that's a that's a cool website so you started blogging on there just as a way to track your own learning like I just take and email them to myself and then I search them in Google right like they're personal but you were actually publicly you were learning in public as Sha Wang likes to say like you were learning in public before it was the thing to do uh you were kind of like one of the early adopters of just yeting your learnings out into the stratosphere yeah I mean I wasn't trying to build an audience or whatever this is kind of before everyone was trying to do that it was really just I wasn't expecting anyone to find my blog and I don't think anyone public ever really discovered it cuz like it was just these random notes on like SQL and c and CSS and stuff yeah but it got the uh kind of like technical writing creative Creator engine going right like the the Jessica Chan the coder coder that we know today is ultimately a consequence of you sharing your learning online right yeah for sure and I think yeah looking back I think that notes blog did help me sort of eventually choose the Cod or coder Direction yeah so you're working at this agency you've been there for six years um at what point did you start like seriously taking or taking seriously the notion that like hey I could create tutorials on YouTube or I could write blog posts that actually help people like actually having an audience in mind rather than just yourself as your future self as the audience yeah um so I would have to say this whole time as I'd mentioned like I just enjoyed setting up blogs just for fun I also had this kind of like maybe entrepreneurial interest even from when I was a young kid like I remember when I was young I made this like vending machine out of a shoe box and I tried to sell it to my siblings and like I would just put like random candy and like peanuts in it and trying to make money off of them so I feel like I always was interested in not necessarily like making a lot of money and getting rich but again kind of creating this entity that worked in terms of operating as a business and letting me be autonomous which is a huge sort of core desire of my of mine like I really like the idea of kind of being independent and not having to be dependent on say a company or whatever um for my livelihood so I think you know when when you're working at a company I think there's good and there's bad and I think I saw both of those um in my time at the agency we had I think maybe one or two layoffs and those are incredibly demoralizing for the people who are laid off obviously but also the people who are left and it kind of really hits home that the company's not there to like help you like the company's there to exist as its own and you are it's kind of being built on the backs of the people working there every day so I think maybe with a little bit of um disillusionment I would say with the you know the whole like getting a corporate job and they'll take care of you and give you benefits y y which was very good um but I think and that may have been how it was back in the day when there was like zero competition like nobody went to college and uh you know if you served in the war that was probably good enough for you to be up to be like an executive and an advertising agency if you seen Mad Men like they always make fun of the college kids cuz they went to war when the college kids just went and like lived these yepy Lifestyles and stuff uh but but like things used to be a lot less competitive people would just drink martinis all day and like it was uh you know I mean like things have gotten so incredibly intensely competitive over the last 30 or 40 years and I I don't think cut old folks understand frankly there's like a like a lack of empathy from like you know a lot of older folks I don't want to say all older folks there are definitely you know people from previous you know like people in their 70s and ' 80s that do understand how hard young people have it but it has gotten so intensely competitive that uh any kind of like social contract between an employer and an employee that may used to exist when you were like a you know an IBM man or something like that right that is long gone right like there's nobody that can't be fired basically unless you're Mark Zuckerberg and you have like Ironclad control of like the the preferred chairs and you nobody can fire you like he can't get fired right Travis K in theory couldn't have been fired from Uber he he also had like super majority like shares and stuff he ultimately stepped down because there was just so much pressure on him if you watch super pumped on Netflix great show about entrepreneurialism not uh not safe for kids um to check it out it's great show I I've talked about it before and I I do recommend super pumped uh with perhaps one of my favorite actors uh today uh Joseph Gordon Levitz he does a great job representing Travis K the the most mocky valant business figure of our time but what I'm just trying to get to is like like anybody who says like we're a family you know blah like you know like run the other way if your employer doesn't accept that there is you know like you're a mercenary essentially uh and you can really like working at the job but at the same time just know that um you know companies ultimately have to respond to incentives from you know investors and other people like that and like you're just one of many people they don't like laying people off I don't think anybody enjoys let letting people go but as you saw twice just on the front lines your your colleagues getting let go like that that happens and um yeah that was that one of the reasons why you like ultimately wanted to get out of the proverbial Rat Race and like become independent I think eventually but I think I I also had sort of discovered the whole like idea of blogging as like a income Source um I think you know this is back in the I would say maybe 2010s or so this is when blogging was like really I would say at its peak with like you could you could make money off of like affiliate links and all this kind of stuff and so I think I since I loved blogging I was like oh this could be something that I could do and I think I was kind of searching for a way that I could make money on my own without having to be dependent on a company and I'd read this book called um the $100 startup by Chris Gilbo um and I remember this is this is how coder coder started so like I was on a flight to Japan to visit my friend and I was reading this startup book on the plane and Chris Gilbo asks you like okay to figure out what business idea you can come up with like what are you passionate about and what can you know you what can you do to help other people and so for me I was like oh I would say I'm passionate about coding I really enjoy building websites and I think it's a skill that I could you know share with other people and help them to basically do what I did because you know coding took me from working these temporary office gigs to having like a very stable like wellpaying career and so I felt like that moment of realization of like oh I should do this like I want to do this and so that's kind of how I started like getting more serious about writing coding tutorials on my blog and then I also got into Instagram I found out there was like a whole develop our community on Instagram which was like really cool because um in my job like my coworkers were great but like I only had worked with like male coworkers like there were no other women um like at my job the entire time that I worked there so seeing on Instagram that there were like you know other people doing web development who you know looked more like me was like a really cool sense of community and so I kind of like fell into like those sort of areas in terms of like online you know webd type of stuff um so yeah that's how coder coder started yeah um yeah yeah that that's really cool so I mean you brought up an important point about the fact that like the field was very maledominated um at the time and uh so just just to finish kind of like the the origin story um and establish our chronology we're going to be drawing from for the rest of the conversation so you you did leave this job at the um at the agency and was that to ultimately go into freelancing yourself um yeah so I left the agency because I was trying to do freelance and sort of build up like the coder coder thing so I did end up freelancing for the agency for a little bit after even after I left um but I think it was just nice to yeah have less of the sort of expectations and everything um but yeah so I did freelance for I would say a long time maybe like three or four years um and then I I did freelancing for like other like another company as well before I quit that a couple years ago so you were able to kind of like taper off having people go out and find clients for you essentially that's what like an agency does it it kind of like puts Under One Roof like both the sales side and the actual like I guess production side uh that's probably an oversimplification I've never worked at an agency uh I have people that swear by working at agencies that love agency life like Cass Marino CSS artist whom you can watch an interview with here on the fre C Camp uh YouTube channel or on the uh that listen you can listen on the free C Camp podcast she's amazing uh but uh I'm really interested in kind of like how you tapered that off and how you went out and got your own clients because that is something that a lot of people listening to this would like to ultimately freelance and have their own kind of consultancy yeah um I mean to be honest I never was like having to find my own clients because my clients were companies if that makes sense so like my first client was obviously my old agency and then um just through knowing coworkers who moved on to other companies like they were hiring Freelancers as well so I was doing freelance jobs for like their new companies and stuff like that um so I never did the the whole like you know local like try to find you know local businesses to to build up your clientele but I do know that's very possible that's such an interesting departure from what a lot of the other people who do fre so essentially you built like this network from working in an agency for so long uh that you already had like kind of all the connective tissue you needed to be able to just continue to Coast on those relationships yeah yeah for sure I think I had a very very yeah I'm very fortunate that I benefited from my my networking um back then and yeah just able to find different freelance gigs um yeah yeah and the entire time you're blogging and as you said in the early 2010s blogging was at its Heyday you could slap AdSense on a blog or potentially get like sponsorships or do other things like that and you could actually make real money blogging now can you make real money blogging well I am going to tell you how much money free Cod camps publication Mi right we do uh millions of page views a month uh on that and we just have like Google AdSense running and I think we make like maybe like 10 or 15K a month from like the ads the show on there it's not a lot of money when you consider like the entire staff millions of and yeah like like we have an editorial team uh we we have a a ton of volunteer contributors who write their excellent tutorials and publish up there I published my entire book if you Google learn the code book it's free it's all on freecodecamp.org newsnews that's our publication um and we published tons of tutorials there every week we probably publish like 20 tutorials a week and including a lot of full length books and handbooks we've got more than 100 books through freeo Camp press which is really just us publishing through our CMS but uh yeah like there's no way that I was like an individual author trying to live off AdSense that I'd be able to right we've got like all this momentum from SEO and like just being around and like having reputation and all everything we do free Cod Camp kind of like feeds into like people knowing that free Cod Camp exists I wear the free Cod camp shirt literally everywhere I go you know it's like FR I've got like 10 of these and I just wear them every day um it's my uniform I got to be a billboard for for this charity right uh so so you know 15K I don't imagine you were making even close to 15K off just ad ad Revenue but like maybe you could talk about how you were able to gradually become more of a content creator and less of a uh freelancer yeah so I think it grew I would say pretty slowly so like initially I had the blog and I don't know if I even put ads on the blog initially I think the only way I was making money was Amazon affiliate links um and it was doing like it was doing okay but it wasn't like I mean when you say okay if you wouldn't mind giving like could you could you tell us um if I can remember I would would say maybe like I would say $200 a month would be pretty good oh wow okay so so that's from Amazon affiliate links like yeah and now if you try to do Amazon affiliate links I think I've heard it's a lot less like they really don't care about the affiliate Market yeah yeah so I think that the the the landscape in terms of online like moneymaking has definitely changed you cannot you cannot live off of ads and affiliate links alone you you need other you need other Diversified channels of income for sure yeah yeah so um what were your what was your like I guess Revenue stack if you will like how were you able to like uh to make it work yeah so I think things changed a lot when I decided to go into YouTube um and not just writing text tutorials but like you know doing these screencasts and other things and so that started probably it was had like like stops and starts so I think the first YouTube video was uploaded in like 2017 and then I didn't upload another video for like a year or two years um but I did eventually start being more consistent about uploading videos and things started taking off in 2020 like I think when the pandemic hit everyone was just like online 24/7 so like back then there were a lot of people watching YouTube videos so that was kind of when my channel started growing a lot and I was able to make money off of AdSense I think maybe since then maybe the max that I would do was like 1,500 a month from just AdSense which was pretty good um and then I also had some affiliate links and that was bringing in about the same per month um but okay so so you're making about $33,000 a month just as a Creator and you're still doing Consulting work at this point or were you I was doing freelancing um and then at some point I was like I think when I hit that three 3K a month Mark I was like all right let's like just try to do coder coder and not do freelance anymore so I stopped doing freelance I would say maybe 20 22 just like just like a couple years ago yeah and to put this in context like for a lot of people listening to this they may be single or uh not like Mar or you know maybe in a situation where they they are not able to get health insurance your your husband uh is an accomplished animator uh if you wouldn't talk if you wouldn't mind talking a little bit about him and like the role he played in you being able to make this transition cuz my wife was absolutely instrumental and me being able to make the trans transition she was working you know in Tech doing accounting and we had health insurance she wasn't making just a ton of money cuz she was she wasn't a developer she was like doing accounting and stuff and which is like half a quarter of 10th of what developers make but uh but that insurance was very helpful and also the fact that we just had like a consistent Baseline like the rent was basically covered just from her income and stuff uh so that gave me the flexibility to take more risks if I were a single person uh and I didn't have like and I also had like a lot of savings and I've famously plowed like $150,000 of my own Savings in a free Cod camp and that was money that like I earned over like 10 years working as a teacher basically like you can imagine what a teacher I basically saved half of everything I I earned and I also like hustled back in the day like you hear about this all the time and I'm not sure if you can even make money on it anymore but I I would like buy tons of old like video games and stuff that like Collectibles things like that on Craigslist go to like you know buy Big Lots of these things and then I break them down and sell them kind of piece them out on eBay and sell them that way and that so that's how I like the the small fortune you know $150,000 that I used to fund develop like the first few years of free Camp before we got our tax income status but the entire time of course we also had my wife's income so it just uh so so I always like to point out like your situation your circumstances are going to be different from mine and Jessica so just factor that in your mileage May VAR and also factor that in when you hear these getrich quick schemer type people or like these like oh like the you know the hustle culture Bros and people like that right like you know there is risk in trying to become a Creator there is risk in trying to become a freelancer there's risk in taking time off to like learn to code in hopes of getting a developer job and uh I think people are remiss when they don't acknowledge that risk but anyway sorry with that sidebar your husband um yeah so my husband actually is also a freelancer so unfortunately we are paying um out of pocket for Private health insurance and it's like very expensive um I think I remember I had a friend who was talking to who lives in Canada and I was talking about how we have to pay for our own health insurance he's like oh like how much is it I was like you know it's like $1,000 a month for like two people and she was like what because like she was and she was like I'm complaining about spending $50 a month on my Canadian health insurance so like that was just like a huge like I think eye opening moment for yeah yeah so it's it's very expensive in America to pay for insurance yourself um but we I think we make it work because we do have savings and we also live in kind of a lower um cost of what's it called cost of living lower cost of living part of the country so that helps too um cuz you know if you want to live in like LA or New York or you know wherever it's like I think there's definitely obviously benefits to that and there's a reason why so many people want to live there but you know I remember reading about um Chris coyer from CSS tricks and finding out that he lives like up in Wisconsin or something and I think that was for me at least the realization of like oh you can like still have a really big online presence and be a part of you know the whole Community but you don't have to live in like these bigname cities so yeah I think that yeah a lot of those those Heavies as I like to call them in the teaching space you know Chris Kyer of course uh great dude whom we hope to have uh on the podcast at some point uh yes West boss Scott stalinsky uh like a lot of the kind of like the I guess the people that preceded me uh like like whom I looked up to and learned from very early on and probably you and like a lot of other people also look up to and learned from them they live out in the middle of nowhere and and like yeah and so you don't have to live in SF it absolutely helps and I did live in SF during the early first few years um free cooking SF San Francisco I moved out there because that's the tech Mecca and for me it wasn't that big a deal because I was already living in like Southern California so I just went up there and slept on my friend's couch uh for a few months and then I eventually was able my wife was able to transfer within her company up there and we were able to make it work inff but we we're living in a a one bedroom shoe box it's like 600 square F feet and we were paying like a ton of money to live there and so you know it's definitely for me it was a phase it was like a stage if you look at like a rocket you know how there's like the booster stage that was the booster stage and now like we're a little higher up you know we don't need as much fuel to like keep keep ascending or something like that I don't know it's a weird analogy but it sounds like you and your husband and and by the way I also get like Obamacare like I pay from the private Market as well and like most people I know do unless they're at like some big company that has like fancy health insurance and if you're getting health insurance you're paying for it some way right like you're probably getting a lower you know uh compensation in some other form because that benefit employees are sophisticated they look at you as the total cost of having this person fill this cubicle seat right um they're they're not unsophisticated and they're not Charities right like free COC is literally a charity but its purpose is not to be charitable to the people that work at free c yeah it's to be to serve a charitable purpose which our our mission our charitable tax exam purpose from the IRS to create free learning resources like this podcast you're watching right now and uh I'll just while I'm ranting about freeo I'll just say you can become one of the 9 million plus 9 million sorry I wish it was 9 million 9,000 plus I think it's like 9,000 and3 we just crossed 9,000 uh recently people who support free C Camp each month with a small donation of like $5 a month or something like that you go to freec camp.org donate you make all this possible the the courses the Interactive Learning platform the text based tutorials the books uh everything so um shout out to all those those kind folks and if you're watching uh thank you um or if you're listening I always listen to the audio version I don't actually watch the video version but like we have a lot of people that watch the video so they get to look at like the cool video I put on in the background so that people don't just have to look at my face for two hours they can look at like a trct mode of some old Japanese arcade game from the 80s okay so back to uh like just daytoday living as a freelancer so your husband is no stranger at a freelancer life he is doing animation his animation is amazing I don't know if he also does the sound design but like just like the the candy anything yeah yeah and and like so again I'm going to link to uh that one video about your coding Journey uh which what we just talked about at length over the last hour you can like learn all that in six minutes with really cool Pokemon kind of Earthbound looking uh animations and stuff um by the way I was like watching that video I was like uh I hadn't seen it in like four years since you first published it and last night I watched it um and I also I showed it to my kids um back in the day but like I I left this really lengthy comment on on YouTube like anybody who leaves comments on YouTube if you ever feel like man YouTube just like did anybody even see my comment I don't think anybody saw this comment you saw it you like put like the heart thing which you can do if you're the creator of the video but like it had one thumbs up and that was probably you I like spent probably like 5 minutes like you know coming with this really compliment I think Brad traversy who runs uh you know uh traversy media he's jumped in he's like great video and it had like 2,000 upvotes and like so I I genuinely believe that YouTube is like heavily biased on toward people who leave comments within the first few minutes those are the ones that people are going to like and it those are the comments that are going to rise to the top so if anybody ever leaves a video and you feel neglected or if you ever leave a comment on a video and you feel neglected know that I'm right there with you and that I feel robbed by YouTube's comment algorithm I spent so much time coming up like 5 minutes of My Life coming up with that comment and nobody saw it yeah anyway definitely heavily weighted toward the early early stuff yeah so uh so you've got approximately uh $3,000 a month uh in income uh and you're paying a th000 of that just to uh private insurance and stuff like that but like where do you go from there and how do you build out this coder coder brand uh and this kind of like High touch polished like fancy animation like really high energy uh I mean it's almost like you're definitely the highest production Creator in the uh tutorial space in my humble opinion oh unless missing like I don't know anybody that like puts as much thought and deliberation into every minute of a video as you do yeah I mean there's there's definitely a lot of really great creators in the space like fire ship and um there's like some new channel that are pretty pretty good like hyperplex a lot of Animation Stu but yeah thank you you're you're very kind I will pass on the the compliments to my husband um yeah so sorry the question is like how do I yeah like how do things unfold from there like like what what are some of the main things you've learned creating these video tutorials I would actually say that yes I acknowledge I have a very unfair advantage in terms of being married to an incredibly talented animator and editor um but I would actually say that you can't rely you can't just Coast on like the sizzle you do need to have like content so I think I would actually say that one of the main maybe benefits of my videos that I really try to go in depth in the tutorials so like I spend a lot of time when I'm writing scripts for the videos one writing a script because I'm terrible ad living I've gotten better over time but um I like writing everything out and I do a lot of research on like I read like the um Mozilla developer Network a lot I also read the actual like um what is it the the HTML spec from the the W3 and that is like bedtime reading it's like incredibly dense and hard to pick out the meaning but you know I do it when I have to so I would say that like I try really hard to do a lot of depth research but also present that indepth information in a way that is accessible to people who are not you know experts in the field because I think that's really important to be able to talk to people at the level that they're at and sort of guide them through their own Learning Journey so that's I would say that's the most important thing that I try to do in all my videos so research and preparation so by the time you like turn on the camera or turn on the mics you've already spent a great deal of time thinking about the topic that you're going to talk about and uh yeah and and it shows it comes through in your videos that you're like pretty authoritative and and you're pretty definitive um and and also it's just like really compressed like you said Fire Ship is famous for having like these three minute videos that are funny and just like overload of memes and stuff like that um and like like C in three minutes or something like that right like those kinds of videos those are cool those those are fun uh and then you have like the polar opposite where these long winding conversations between two people who have done stuff you know over here on the freeo camp podcast right so um zero production value just just Personality yeah so good content yeah exactly and like again I listen to so many pocket people like I I interviewed Scott uh sininsky not Scott Selinsky uh Scott the other Pro Scott Hanselman yes he like how do you do it like who listen list to this stuff like who has time to listen to but I listen to this stuff all the time I learned so much for like long interviews um and I feel like they they surface a whole lot of you know interesting stuff that wouldn't come out in like a polished like if you were to go on Good Morning America which uh you know is like like you're lucky if they take like three sentences of what you say and put it on there right so for sure I I have so many questions for you we haven't even gotten to them and I'm just going to start firing them off sure right uh so you worked seven years at your first job would you recommend people stay at their first job for seven years I think if it works for you I think if I stayed as long as I did because I felt like I was constantly learning and like I didn't plateau and I felt like it was a reasonably not toxic environment for the most part and so I think it really depends on the situation but I do think that it can be a benefit to start at one company and kind of you know work your way up and get experience there um yeah varies you yeah absolutely you have a really cool like background like area it looks like you got a nice bookshelf you may actually have the same it's not the same bookshelf it's a similar bookshelf I got it on like Wayfair but but like you've got like a cool kind of like setup over there and like I imagine you know you're into like mechanical keyboards and stuff like that uh like just like the Aesthetics of getting work done mhm especially as like an more artist artistic minded person who who is like studyed photography and probably like you know you know Mary condo cell like looks thinks about like all the different little details and stuff right I try so maybe you could talk about your setup and like how you get in your happy place for getting work done oh yeah that's a big question um I'm going to be completely honest here so I've worked remotely for the past seven years um some of it was at the agency where I actually worked remotely and started out working in the physical office but motivation has been a huge like I cannot overestimate how much of a struggle staying motivated has been um working remotely and then also just like working for myself essentially um I'm still like figuring it out but like I I'm very embarrassed about like the thought of what I do with my day um like you've seen those videos where it's like you know day in the life of a programmer and like you see all the things that they do it's like everyone's like waking up at 600 a. and stuff it's like I do not wake up at 600 a.m. my sleep schedules can very swing widely um and I'm definitely not like sit down the desk for eight hours and like type away so it's like it's been a pretty big struggle if I'm honest and I think you know the whole pandemic was part of that too I think um yeah yeah just made things hard but I'm hopefully getting better at motivating myself but it's yeah it's hard man especially when you're just at home all the time yeah when you have to turn it on when you're like man I got this deadline like or I committed to this goal of mine maybe nobody else uh knows about it but you like want to hold yourself accountable like how do you fire yourself up to to get things done do you have any sort of ritual or some sort of like fallback some sort of song that you put on that like you know the rocky them like something that you do to like to to get on point for me um yeah I'm still figuring that part out but I will say there's this guy on YouTube called struthless he's a tattoo artist but he makes really cool videos on a lot of them are like productivity and motivation and stuff like that and just like artistic stuff and he had this whole video on motivation and he named something called the dark why so it's this idea that when we think about motivation we want to think like oh like I'm you know it's like all good it's all like positive stuff but in reality people are really motivated by either getting away from or proving something wrong or like avoiding these like bad things that we don't want to happen and I think that that is true for me for sure so for example I've been working on this course for like I don't know how how many years now it's been again a big struggle but I think um when I had a early access launch back in November um last year that was my like drop dead deadline where it's like this has to be done before that point otherwise I've already said it publicly what the launch date is I'm going to like hugely embarrass myself and also disappoint myself if I don't make that deadline so once I had that external deadline that really like lit a fire under my butt and got me to just like the finish line so I think I think a lot of it is just figuring out how you operate and what things actually can motivate you um but yeah also not to sound cliche but I think not letting myself scroll on Reddit all the time helped a lot so just kind of like limiting that social media phone time I think helps helps your brain yeah 100% I will second that uh I um I don't spend any time on Reddit uh in fact Reddit timed me out as a mod for my own subreddit oh no R free Coke camp like I in like inactive status it's this badge and I'm the I'm the mod like I created the free C Camp subred right and they won't let me like add Naomi from our team as a as a mom because I'm inactive so I have to post on Reddit and like you see me posting on Reddit just say hey great job like I mean it I am impressed by the project he just submitted but like I'm also trying to get reddit's algorithm to uh to say like okay he's he's active again he can add new me as a mod now so uh but but yeah like that like the amount of time I spent on social media is like vanishingly small and it used to be this huge good part like I've I've definitely mellowed out not spending time there um yeah not that it's not incredibly useful yeah but but yeah you've worked for yourself for a long time like have how do you sort of stay motivated because it feels like you're working on like 20 different amazing things at the same time well thank you uh I'm I'm glad it looks good from the outside because every organization from the inside like every person's life I think feels like it's probably a mess because you have access to all the gritty details um but I mean like like one of our guests um Phoebe vong Fidel um she talked about how like having kids was like the biggest productivity Boon in her life cuz suddenly she had to be accountable of the kid and it took up so much of her time that she had to figure out how to like structure the rest of her time so that she could be as productive as she was before she had kids and that's a that's a great interview recommend everybody check it out um but but like you know she learned like you she learned a code at like 36 or something right and uh it it was having that extrinsic pressure of like I've got this kid that's constantly crying and I need to get things done in between dealing with this kid and like I I would say like the first few years of free COC I was just pure ID I don't know what to say but but it's was just like like I really don't like forprofit education I don't like student debt I don't like like it it was kind of like a rage that was driving me and it's a dark why yeah my dark why I like I am so upset that we're in the most prosperous country in the world and that there's suffering that there's homelessness that there are uh people who don't have access to opportunity just because of where they were born if they were born in like Appalachia or you know uh Middle America like where I was where I grew up and there just was an expectation that like you'd be a construction worker when you grew up or something like that right like uh I definitely that was what fired me up initially was just like wanting to destroy the forprofit education complex and make education free like I and I still feel that way but I've mellowed out a lot and a lot of my productivity is not based on emotion it's based on like okay like I've got systems that keep me accountable like I wake up at 700 a.m. every day because I've got kids and they're like roosters and they jump out of bed at 700 a.m. full energy and you're up when they're up right there's no sleeping through kids jumping on your bed and like uh you know stealing your phone and watching like Zelda videos at full blast and stuff like that um yeah so so like that that is kind of and and then just like all the normal diet exercise like if you live in one place for long enough uh and you you establish some routines you you can kind of Coast on those routines uh like you know like like today I woke up took my kids to school uh I went to the YMCA I exercised I walked home entire time I was thinking about this interview and like preparing and I I did my research I had like three pages of notes I was you know questions I was going to ask it's just a bunch of prep uh and then that prep carries you you know sorry for that little like weird inhale thing um I'm not going to edit it out because I don't edit okay keep um yeah uh I I feel like people need a source of like real human beings on the internet who are not fronting and Max you know who were just being themselves and uh not trying to impress people I'm not trying to impress anybody I'm trying to teach people and you know potentially Enlighten them about the nature of reality it's not these perfect human beings it's not like James Bond not getting killed the first time he goes on a mission because he's a ostentatious bastard you know he be the worst spy the real spies you never even hear about right so anyway true so um I want to draw some more insight out of you because you just have some and and I also want to be mindful of your time uh so uh we have like 13 minutes I'm just going to start firing away all right you're very you're very vocal about uh how how you look things up all the time like this is a huge part of your message to developers it's like developers are not omniscient they don't have like Tic memories where they've just committed the mdn to their brain right you're constantly looking things up and can you talk about that and like how you did you ever did you feel weird about that when you were like aren't developers supposed to be smart and just know this stuff yeah I mean I think I was lucky that I when I was starting out in my career like I had other developers around me and I think it was it seemed pretty accepted that everyone looked up stuff all the time so I think that at least I didn't have any sort of like you know false impressions of what a real real developer does but I noticed that when I started putting out some videos I think early on I did these live coding um live streams actually on my channel and I would try to build a website from a design which is my whole shtick I guess and I would spend a lot of time looking things up on stack Overflow or reading the docs and I used to remember getting all these comments from people being like Oh my gosh like real developers like do lookup stuff and so I think that really like sort of stuck with me that if you're just learning how to code on your own and you don't have any knowledge about the industry like it's very easy to think like oh these people on YouTube or professionals working at companies like they don't have to look anything up like everything is just like living in their brain 247 and it's just like a library up there but that's really not true because there's just so much knowledge there's so many areas in programming and web development and also things are changing all the time especially now nowadays um yeah things just change so quickly so you have to that's just part of the routine so I think it's really important for me to like keep it real and just like show people people like real web developers like look up stuff all the time yeah and it's not going to get any better like like it's always going to be like that because by definition the field is like people operating at the frontier of what the tools are capable of if the tool abstracted something away then you wouldn't need to do that anymore so you're always going to be working with like higher and higher levels of abstraction probably unless you have like really crazy constraints like we need this chip to work on this satellite and it needs to work for 2,000 years or something like that right yeah so um Okay so you know those kind of edge cases aside like you're going to be using lots of tools you're going to be using the raw compute power and like all the other stuff that gets better every year what kind of uh when you were developing uh websites and apps as a consultant what were kind of your bread and butter types of elements and things that you just build over and over again H that's a really good question um I think like the whole like card UI where it's like you have different cards with like photos and like things like that and I think just when I was learning it there was no flex box initially so you had to like lay out things with CSS float which was kind of a nightmare um but yeah I think just like getting good at these sort of multi column layouts that stack to one column on mobile like that was I would say 90% of my job um working in advertising and marketing yeah were there any UI kind of dark patterns that you're like I'm I refuse to do this I mean I mean personally I think carousels are just a huge waste of time and they don't work because no one never clicks to the second slide in the carousel but carousels basically exist so that you can tell the marketing higher ups that the content they wanted to put on the homepage is on the homepage it's just on slide seven um so I I consider Carousel is a little bit of a pattern that I would not I don't think anything that's like an anti pattern but like a dark pattern like something that you think is like manipulative of users or maybe something that where there's like an ethical gray area oh like Adobe unsubscribing yeah or LinkedIn the the the uh master of dark patterns like hey would you like to tell your friends that that oh your friend's not LinkedIn would you like to like import your inbox and every single person you've ever like emailed and like send them an email say hey why aren't you on LinkedIn they did that like five times like they said they do it once and even the way they asked it was really sketchy anyway I don't want to hammer L too much but they they did so many sketch things to uh to build that out initially but but but you said AI uh Adobe like unsubscribe but are there any dark patterns that uh you you've like felt really bad about like implementing just because your boss told you to implement or is there anything that like an ethical line that you'll never cross again yeah I mean I was fortunate that I think I didn't have I was never asked to do something that I felt ethically like questionable about um but yeah I think anything that like leverages is like your real life information or personal information I think you know for social credit or whatever on the app is like something that I think I would never I would never want to do that um yeah anything that that tries to get you to import your entire like contact list from your phone to the and give all your personal data to the app is like I think pretty bad yeah 100% agreed um so in terms of like gradually you're somebody who focuses on expanding their skills all the time in terms of strategies you've used to like learn things like what is something that if if somebody wanted to learn an entire new area like let's say they're a front end developer and they want to learn backend so they can do full stack development like are there any particular strategies or advice that you would give to somebody that wanted to absorb an entire new you know Corpus of knowledge yeah I think if I was trying to to learn something new in programming I think I would definitely go to YouTube first I would go to YouTube and see what videos are kind of the most popular for for example a search term for like you know xyz4 beginners um I think I'd also probably I would probably check out Reddit I think Reddit is a good source of like real information from like real people usually especially for like learning I think it's really good um because there's always going to be someone posting like I want to learn this and that like how do I get started and then people who are more ahead of you have like good recommendations I feel like um yeah so I think just I think learning how to just figure learning how to identify what a good resource is versus a not good resource I think is kind of important um yeah are there any like telltale signs uh what is going to be like my biggest concern is not necessarily the quality of the resource but like how much of the resource you're going to get before they slim a pay wall your face and like oh I just spent like half an hour learning this tutorial and suddenly like I can't Advance any further you know like pay walls are really annoying I understand that that you know code academy and websites like that have to keep the lights on uh but uh it's all like sometimes I wonder if they're not sufficiently forthcoming about what the course actually includes for free before you have to start like you know inputting your credit card but sure are there any um just just to re rephrase my questions this is a Meandering thing um are there are there any like telltale signs of like hey this is going to be too superficial like I shouldn't cuz you can watch the same you know C in 3 minutes not to pick on because he does it inest Fire Ship does like ingest how C Works in three minutes there's not an expectation you're learn CP in 3 minutes but like you can watch the same like HTML explained for forgetters like 30 minute tutorial like you can watch 20 of those and you wouldn't really be any better than if you just watched one or two of them right like uh how do you identify a a good resource um I personally I sort of look at the tone of how the information is conveyed so if someone starts the video like how to learn HTML and they're like what's up like I'm here to show you and it it feels a little bit too like um there's like a certain energy that like sort of makes me naturally distrust the person but so I feel like and this is again just maybe my own personal preferences but if I feel like the person teaching me something seems like they are more like serious or more it seems like they've really put time into explaining things well I think that's a good sign I think also you can look at a channel and this is just for YouTube resources but you know for example Kevin pal all his videos are about CSS they are incredibly in depth and I think people kind of recognize that over time um and they and he explains things really well and so I think that looking at sort of their body of work on their Channel and seeing how you know either shallow or how indepth they go on the topics I think if you do a little bit of research and just kind of yeah see for yourself like how the teaching kind of sounds so I think yeah whether they're talking authoritatively or it looks like they're reading a script that was probably generated by gbt or something right yeah yeah uh and Kevin Powell the king of CSS he does not like it when I call him that but that is like the the moniker that he has uh he's given by the community yes uh last question what are some biggest what do you think the biggest misconceptions uh people have about learning the code when they're just watching a bunch of YouTube videos like what are some misconceptions that you want to just shoot down real quick to like reassure people no that's that's not how it really is I would say um you don't have to be on The Cutting Edge this might be an unpopular opinion but it is my opinion I don't operate on The Cutting Edge and I don't think you need to excuse me um I think like especially when it comes to content creators in programming like you're trying to make a video that gets views so people will always make videos on like the next you know new hottest technology out there or newest framework or whatever but the reality is a lot of companies are using jQuery or they're using Wordpress or you know they're not using like the newest CSS feature that's not like um supported by like the majority of browsers so I would say don't worry about learning the newest hottest thing right now I would say just stick to the basics especially if you're at the beginning of your Learning Journey and you can always learn newer things like later on CU if you learn the new things now they may or may not be hit the mainstream and then you'll have in some ways maybe wasted some time that you could have spent just kind of focusing on the basics so that's my biggest piece of advice yeah 100% that's a great note to end on Jessica it's been such a blast learning more about you learning from you I've got like 160 lines of notes in my uh editor here I've learned a tremendous amount and uh it's just such an amazing blessing to have you in the developer Community creating tutorials focusing on delivering substance for the people right and and uh you know we're all excited about your your big course that you you're working on best of luck continuing progress on that and again I just want to emphasize like over the years you've contributed so many tutorials to the Freo Camp uh text based like publication got some video courses from you like I am always really really hyped up and really jazzed whenever Bo mentions oh yeah I heard from Jessica you know so so like thank you for everything you're doing for the community yeah hopefully I can do more once this course is done with but yeah yeah love the free code Camp Community absolutely well thanks again for just providing like a really cool like I guess model of someone who has gone out and uh blazed their own path and who has transitioned from working in a field that like basically just cratered um I mean you talk about like having to go work as a temp with a college degree it's it's not a position that I did that too I worked uh doing like their temp agencies in Oklahoma City and I did that that whole thing for for a few years and it was miserable uh but but being able to find a way out of that being able to build up a skill set being able to you know do have a choice whether you want to do freelance work or for or continue to work for previous employers or work for your your friends new employers and stuff like that or um just continue to create content on your own like having that level of agency that level of security that that uh being being the master of your own destiny I think it's incredibly inspiring and I love how you don't sugarcoat any of this and you don't seem to take any of this for granted you're out there getting things done and you're working just as hard as you were before so uh it's a huge source of inspiration for me awesome yeah thanks so much for having me on yeah well everybody until next week happy coding
