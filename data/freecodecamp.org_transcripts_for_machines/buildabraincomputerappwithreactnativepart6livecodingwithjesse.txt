hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and i'm i'm excited to be here today i miss streaming i think the last time i streamed was a week ago so and i know the last time i streamed i had mentioned that i would like to do it like every other day and i definitely did not do it every other day so apologies for that i really i think what happened was uh after my last time that i streamed shortly after that maybe like just the reality of everything that's going on hit me and i just i got like super depressed and i had a lot of like anxiety and stuff so pretty much like just getting through the the normal week of uh working my normal job was about as much as i could do working my normal job trying to be there for my kids and my wife like i just had no energy there were a couple times when i tried to stay up late and do a stream and i just sat at the computer and just couldn't couldn't do it like couldn't start the stream just was too exhausted so i'm feeling pretty good today though had some good weather been trying to do some workouts at home hopefully i'll be i'll be all right but we have some good news so one piece of good news is the app got accepted to the google play store so on the last stream we did um we did submit it to the google play store so we're in so now um i just just brought up the dashboard here so evidently yesterday i acquired seven new users and i lost four so i'm guessing is that like a net then of three users one of them is me so uh i do know that uh some people downloaded it and then didn't realize they need to have the neurocity notion headset so it's uh understandable that people would delete it immediately but i downloaded on my device it worked pretty sweet you can see it here it is like in the app store on google play i'll post a link in the chat that way if anybody wants to check it out you can actually maybe i should put this link in the description to the video too if i remember to do that later on i'll do that um just a reminder too i've been putting out some tutorial videos on my own youtube channel links in the description uh please check those out if you want a lot of times the questions that i get frequently in the chat i will take those and turn them into tutorial videos uh so that you know if you have any questions about some of the stuff that i'm doing on the stream i may have already done a video to answer it uh and if you have any ideas of tutorial videos you'd like for me to do put them in the stream i keep a list of all the topics that i want to do so anytime anybody gives me a topic if it's something that i think is possible for me to do i put it on the list and when i have time i try to go through it and do some videos alright so see a lot of people in the chat saying hello hey everybody thanks for joining me today if you don't know yet we are going to submit our app to the apple app store we're going to build it first which more good news you can actually build using expo which we are using expo you can build for ios on a windows machine i did not know that earlier today i was on my my macbook and i was gonna go i was gonna build it on my macbook so it would be ready for the stream and i was going through the documentation and realized that i could just use expo so that's pretty awesome so that's what we're gonna do so we're going to make whatever changes we need to the code to get this ready to go we're going to do a build similar to what we did last time but this time we're going to build the type of file that we need to send to apple and then we're going to actually submit that to the apple app store so we'll take you through that whole process i don't know how long this is going to be remember the last time it took us like three hours to do the google play store so i'm hoping uh so some of the steps that we had to do then we won't have to do now so i think we can do it in way less than three hours uh but we'll see how it goes now one thing that we can't do that i'm slightly worried about is that we can't actually test on windows so um we might have to i don't know my wife has an iphone if we really need to test it and don't think it'll work on an iphone before we submit i could probably grab my wife's iphone and um maybe like download the expo app and just test it on her iphone first but other than that i think we should be good that's the only point of this whole thing that i think is going to be a problem now here's what i had to do before the stream to get ready for this i needed to create a developer account with apple alright and that is not cheap so it's a hundred dollars a year to create an account and uh i recommend like it said it could take up to 48 hours for the account creation process to to be complete so i'm glad i did it last night because uh it it could take a while thankfully though i got approved like very quickly i i think it was like less than an hour later i was approved something like that so i don't know i guess they just say 48 hours because you know maybe it's um potentially could take that long i don't know but that's already so that's definitely you you have to have that you can't submit to the app store without that so um you need to do that google play i believe is only like 25 and that's it it's just a onetime fee so if you want to start out with putting apps on an app store and you don't have a lot of money to start out with definitely recommend doing it on android it's significantly cheaper to do it on android let's get started i can see one thing that we need to do already we uh we took out the ios for the platform here last time because we weren't using ios but uh we're going to do switch that up to ios and support tablet true yep no reason why we couldn't support tablet now we have android we have it we have a package of version code and permissions i don't know that we need to do that but we're gonna we'll scroll through the documentation i read it beforehand uh but we'll go through step by step now actually let me set my timer i'm gonna do a 25 25minute timer of just going through the code in this case going through the documentation after 25 minutes i'm going to uh go back to the chat and i'm going to read the comments and answer questions in the chat i'll try to keep an eye on it on the chat as well uh occasionally just to make sure everything is going all right in there try to keep everything positive and let's scroll down so here we go install all right we've already done this step our app.json there we go let's add this in our ios build number and let's just throw in the same thing that we have here we'll put it in here and that looks good 1.0 it looks looks good that doesn't really matter it's not like uh not too serious about build numbers at this point all right that looks good and i believe that is the minimum that we need all right and let's go i'm gonna split the uh the terminal here let me push this down i'm gonna split the terminal up so we can start we can do expo start we found out on the last stream that you can't do a build if you haven't actually started expo yet so we're running the expo start there's a new version i thought we installed a new version last time that's weird i like i really thought we installed the latest version let's let's do the install real quick while that's going we could figure out our next steps as well i was uh i just didn't anybody watch last time didn't we update that i seriously doubt in one week it's the version has increased that much uh but anyway we'll we'll double check version numbers and stuff unless i have the uh the version in the package json locked we'll see all right so we have skipped the android part for ios i need the apple id and password which i have all right so just like we had our android key store last time we're gonna have a distribution certificate and uh i'm just gonna let expo handle that it looks like we need to make a password for that all right we're not gonna worry about pushing okay notifications right now we'll probably add those into the app at some point if we keep going with it so um just kind of make a mental note of that cool it looks like we're good uh in terms of build let's let's double check now and see if we are on the right version all right cool so we did not get the message that we're out of date so that's good it must have worked okay so that is working and i'm going to double check the oops wrong wrong thing but double check the command expo build ios that's it so let's throw that in there expo build colon ios it should work according to what i've read this should work i'm still like somewhat amazed that this is going to work on windows now do you have the access to the apple account yes i do have access to that apple id password what hmm all right let's try it again like i'm almost positive that was my correct username and password so let's try it again yeah you know what on my other screen i'm gonna check it out actually you know i just got an email from the app store i'm gonna verify what my login is because i need to do this anyway all right this this looks like slogan yeah so i was able to log in to my developer account here so you can see i'm logged in so let's uh all right let's try let's try it again hmm all right i'm gonna try one more thing hmm all right let me look back here and see for sure what we need you need your apple id and password hmm i'm gonna try to log out and see hmm all right that worked all right let me try one more time maybe i'm just typing it in wrong what's the problem when you try to use like secure passwords that have a bunch of uh different characters in it i guess sometimes it's hard to type in all right is jesse weigel at gmail.com all right all right here i'm going to copy and paste what i just typed in and uh hopefully that'll work hopefully it lets me maybe it didn't i guess we could do let's run let's get rid of up on that and let's run this uh expo debug true and then we'll throw in the uh yarn um what was it was it build ios yeah build ios or it was expo build ios you authentication to developer portal failed all right well let's look up this error then debug mode didn't really give us anything extra huh all right let's look up the air see what we're getting here can't authenticate it's always good when you get something hmm hmm uh what we can try is uh we could try to put the password and stuff in a uh i believe we have the option to put it in an environment variable file so let's try that i'm going to look at the chat real quick to see if somebody else has any ideas okay um i remember seeing in the documentation somewhere earlier that you can use uh environment variables instead so let me just gotta figure out what the keys are for that hmm i don't know what else i guess i could go back real quick and see after entering credentials wait is this it 127 that was what we get right all right so this is the same error let's um let's turn on that windows linux subsystem i don't know if it actually has to be running in the background remember we installed that the last time so um there we go we'll run that and hmm all right well this person said they use pseudo and that helped and they got two thumbs up and that's the only solution that i saw any anybody give thumbs up to which is usually a good sign so let's just try that because that's a very easy thing to do so let's run sudo expo build ios and now we have the linux subsystem up so oh it's not going to let me do pseudo because this is still the uh still that one nothing yeah okay this is not i'm not gonna be able to run it from within there of course i can't do pseudo you know what i could do i could open this project from um as an admin so let's do that actually let's let's just try to run it let's try to run it one more time with uh ubuntu actually running just to see if that'll help all right did not help so next step all right here's the next two steps i'm going to take i'm going to try to open this as an administrator and run it if that doesn't work i'm going to try to run it in powershell and see if that works then do i already have this open yeah i do this one is run as admin i believe i already have an admin version of vs code running so i'm just gonna go to open workspace and small projects what can i not find my projects for that's weird there we go stay focused uh did i after all that it was the wrong thing open folder um what didn't open it no all right run as administrator all right running as administrator see if this makes a difference okay now let's run expose ios all right onto powershell it is oh i can't do cd i don't know how to make powershell bigger let's run it as admin just to be sure though uh windows system32 i need to look up powershell commands uh there we go change directory no that's not there we go if i could do what all right that's an insane amount of files i did not need to know all of that um change directory uh where am i in there we go there we go i'm sorry about this uh font size i just like i never use this so i don't really know how to make it bigger all right i'm assuming that i can get to users directory from here no maybe where am i at windows let's go here and see okay now from here there we go users and then jesse and then projects and then stay focused yay finally i'm in here okay now let's see if this will work expo build ios yes all right uh this is a good sign right whoa all right we get past that step nice all right it says all right so it's sent me a text message for the six digit code i have to put that code in what developer portal failed when author has access no i got so close zero five one one all right i got farther but for some reason it didn't work dang it let's try this again all right so i got a new code okay well my timer ran up so let me go some questions now and uh take a few minutes as a break and then i get back to it um world's world best tick tock official sf i'll make flutter tutorials uh probably again i'm not gonna make a flutter tutorial anytime soon uh because i just i don't work with flutter so probably not gonna happen uh usually the tutorials i do i i use like stuff that i actually use so that i could like know what i'm talking about uh there's some questions about like what is the app what's it capable of i'll give a little overview but if you want to know more check out like the previous um the the previous live streams or uh on my youtube channel i go over the the notion nerosity headset that is the brain computer um and the links in the description to my channel so you can check that out i go into a lot more detail but basically this app just works you put a device on your head actually this device you put this device on your head it reads your brain waves specifically we're looking at uh the part of the brain that tells us your level of focus and when your level of focus goes below a certain amount the phone vibrates and flashes the color red and then that way it gives you a little reminder to stay focused uh john jonathan says uh hi i heard i i heard order helps on energy levels do you have videos on that like organization of data time and files because it also absorbs your energy to have digital disorder and congratulations um well thank you and you know what i actually don't have a video on that but i've been thinking about doing a video on how i do project management with like a kanban board so um that that kind of falls into that in terms of like managing the tasks in a particular project so i was thinking about doing that video i wanted to do it today i don't know if all the time or not but i want to do that video soon um someone says hey i need a good tech lead to project manage and build a team on an application i'm building do you do any consulting work or know anybody qualified i can talk to um send me a dm on twitter or something my link's in the description uh i don't know that i have that much time to do it myself but i could try to get you get you in touch with somebody um someone asks about um what's react native why is it useful react native lets you use javascript to build native mobile apps so it's very useful if you know javascript and you don't want to have to learn two other languages to be able to build for android and ios someone asked why expo uh expo i think makes it very easy to work with react native easy to build and and run locally and test also it's supposed to be easy to build for ios even if you're on windows although we're having some issues with it right now and uh so that's why i chose it pj gaming says love from india man uh thank you i appreciate that someone asked what a brain computer is um i think i just showed you what the brain computer looks like and um kind of gave a little description if you want to know more check out the link in the description of my youtube channel i do a whole demo video on the nerosity notion brain computer interface looks like there's a nice discussion about why you would learn javascript uh in the chat there uh someone asked how they can get the previous material because this is the first one they saw uh check out the um the videos on the free code camp youtube channel uh the the previous videos they'll all have like the same thumbnail and they'll all be listed as uh i believe it's build a brain computer with react native our brain computer app with react native all right i'm gonna go back to the code now and here's what i'm gonna do uh i'm gonna copy this and see if we can debug what's happening yep this is it this is exactly what we're getting um probably need to accept some new agreements in itunes connect all right let's check this out then and see it doesn't look like that help for that person but it's worth it worth a try uh oh looks like it let me get in um agreements see what this is oh there we go new agreement yep hey you all know my address wonderful i don't really care because like honestly if somebody wanted to know my address like it wouldn't be that hard to find it online i'm sure it's like publicly available what set up tax banking and contact i don't want to do all that let me do this on my other screen and just see if no i'm not gonna set up tax forms right now all right anyway um i opened up this page because we'll need this page to register an app id or to register our app once we get it built but i guess it's worth a try to run this again just to see if if that really was the case that i needed to accept that dang all right so that didn't work all right let's go to let's go to that github issue see what else people are saying all right so yeah unauthorized access you hmm all right that's interesting so this person said they uh signed signed out of the main apple id logged in with the id they're trying to use with expo tried to build it and then that worked because there was an extra step of clicking allow i guess did i bring my macbook down i didn't i left it up i meant to bring it down what i could try to do is be on my macbook with this account at the same time just to see if some sort of other notification comes up i would hope that that wouldn't be the case jesus check this one out before i do that team happens to me interesting actually so setting this with the default phone number it said it solved it we could try that all right so saying if i enter sms then select the trusted phone number and then enter that second code then it works let's try that that seems like it'll be pretty easy to test i'm sorry this is so small let me uh whoa what the heck why is it giving me i don't know why it's giving me a different different input um make powershell font bigger properties there we go yeah you know what let's make this fill up half the screen all right and okay that is wrapping yes i do have access to the apple store why is this not working all right what too many verification codes have been sent uh all right let me let me grab my mac real quick we're going to take a we're going to take a break so we'll take like i don't know like two minutes or something for me to get my mac and it should still be running so i shouldn't have to like actually set it up or anything like that and then i'll come back so i'm pretty sure i have my my stuff just upstairs i will be right back hey let's do it all right so got my macbook one of my kids just lost a tooth so that's cool uh all right i don't know how long it's gonna like make us wait until we can send another code hopefully not too long but i'm also hoping that maybe the one person mentioned something about the like a button popping up on their macbook saying to accept so i'm i'm hoping that maybe like a button will pop up uh instead of the uh come on macbook what are you doing why is my macbook not working i'm hoping the button will pop up and then i'll be able to just click that instead of having to do the text message for some reason the macbook screen just went black that's crazy it was fully charged it should not run out of batteries i don't know if that's the issue or not but it was fully charged all right cool i don't know what why the screen just keeps going there we go okay let me sign in to my apple account on my macbook and see if i'll get some sort of prompt on there when we try to do this all right let's run this again see if anything happens all right all right see what it'll give us now okay let's type in sms now let's select i guess if i put in one ah too many messages again shoot now it did say we could try putting in whatever the last message was that we got so i guess i could try that it's worth a shot did we get oh kevin's back in here kevin i gotta i gotta boot you from the channel man i don't understand sometime kevin comes in and he talks normal and sometimes he just spams the channel i don't under i can't tell yet if he's like serious or just messing around all the time all right okay so let's let me try to just enter the last one i have i don't really think this will work but it's worth a try okay let me get my last code zero three one seven three two nope all right let's see uh john jonathan says jesse do you know how to recover apple id um i don't think i need to recover the apple id at this point like i got i have the right id and password the problem is with the text messaging so it looked like a lot of other people were having the same issue and someone was able to fix it by requesting a second text message and that seemed to fix it looking for lemon says try entering the spaceship 2fa thing yeah actually that's a good idea um to enter it like that maybe it'll it'll let it come in so i'll try that um let me see oh i know what i was going to do i want to see if i can uh if there's like some way to reset it in terms of my like in my apple account let's see if i can i'm gonna go to app store connect no that's not i'm not seeing anything users there's a users an access panel but that is not all right let's pull this over let's see if there's going to be a spot where i might be able to do something i think it'll be this place so right now um i thought there was more to this screen there we go account holder admin and finance let me developer all right yeah i don't think this is going to be it now oh well keys i mean it seems like the app store connect api would be good but i don't think that that's what um expo uses so it's not necessarily going to help us in this case so i think i copied and pasted what i needed no it's not gonna yeah it's not gonna come up too much okay so let's try the um that two factor authentication thing let me find where it's at i believe it was in the docks here and where are we at maybe it wasn't in these ducks maybe it was in one of the um don't want android ios yeah maybe it was just in one of the one of these ah there we go okay let's read this is the actual issue on fast lane which is what we're trying to use to get the uh um to get the app there so make sure to see what their what they're saying about it all right hmm all right let's see this is this is all pretty recent like this one was 23 days ago what would be cool is if i could at least temporarily turn off twofactor authentication interesting somebody's saying that they got it to work by changing the password and then signing out of all their devices all right so they have a pr that's supposed to fix it but it's still open not surprising i assumed it was still hmm oh interesting they get to this point they type sms it'll ask at this point and then they enter in the code that they received earlier we didn't try that yet let's try that all right oh that actually sent a new code let me see all right there we go there's the second one three four three two six four three four three two six four three four three two double checking that come on yes yes yes it's working sweet okay let expo handle the process yes do it only took us an hour we finally logged in the expo handle the problem just uh if you're not if you can't see what's coming up on the screen there uh the fonts still might be a little small i'm just clicking let expo handle the process to every option because at this point i don't want to mess anything up and go through that process again wow so we we had like several um several issues there while that's going we'll just like recap so um the first issue was we couldn't actually run this from the bash terminal in vs code we had to run it from powershell i happen to be running powershell as an administrator i don't know if that makes a difference or not because i just skipped right to that because i didn't i didn't want to mess with with running it normally um but it did work with powershell as an admin then once we we got in there uh and we could actually log in uh to apple let's see what was it you could log into apple and then the issue was with the text messages so there is a bug with fast lane the fast lane uh package and there's a fix for it that has not been merged yet on github so currently right now it will send a text message but the first one it says does not work you have to request a second one by typing sms instead of the code you get then it sends a second one after you specify what number to send it to the second one is the one that works so if anybody's trying to launch to the uh the app store using fastlane keep that in mind hopefully uh it looks like that that pull request has been out for like 15 days and it still hasn't been merged yet so hopefully it gets in there at some point soon i don't really know what fastlane is to be honest if it's a company that has this or um if it's just like the community runs it if it's just the community like that totally explains why it hasn't been merged yet you know if nobody is is actually like getting paid to keep that up sometimes it's difficult but all right that's cool the build is in progress and we can monitor it here at this url let's see if let's copy and paste that once our build is ready oh sweet is it finished nice it is finished very cool okay so our build is finished let's go back to our documentation wait for the build to finish and build your actual project which is simulator flag then download the timeline given which we can't uh we can't simulate it on this device so test the device build with apple test flight download the file to your local machine upload the app to test flight which i don't know what test flight is um oh is this an app store thing beta testing made simple with test flight i guess i can't do it here we have this here we have this url here which that has our our build and oh hey we could i don't know if i could download this and test it all right that could take 10 to 15 minutes to build let's let's check out our i thought i had this open somewhere already said uploading apps yeah uploading apps to the app store if you choose to upload your ios app to test flight oh we can just do expo upload ios all right let's do this that feature works on mac os only all right so it looks like i can't do that manually uploading looks like i won't be able to do this hmm all right so it looks like i have to use this is this is somewhat misleading that i can build for ios on the um on windows but i can't submit is this correct does anybody have experience with this this seems like very odd um let's see store submit your is to absolute windows system 2017 get out of here it's too old uh i'm gonna check for anything in the past year let's make this bigger how to submit your app to the app store all right so this is microsoft all right so the first the first time it has to be i don't think that's going to help i think that's the same same problem we have right now hmm yeah that's not using windows all right so i guess what i have to do is let's switch this over see what i can do i'm going to see if i can uh hop on to this stream on my macbook i don't i usually don't stream from my macbook because the quality is is not great but i'd rather you be able to see what's going on all right all right let's see let me i'm going to briefly stop streaming here and then pick up my stream on my other computer i don't know i've never tried this before but uh we'll see how it goes maybe it'll work i have already downloaded this i don't think i'll need to do anything with the code so i think we're fine there but just in case i've already downloaded the repo i'm going to stop all right let's see uh all right can you all can you all see me or hear me let me know if you can hear me i think you can see me right now i'm going to try to shrink this window down sweet so evidently i can switch devices in the middle of the stream and it'll keep the stream going that's pretty sweet i need to figure out how to get this window to fit all right that's pretty close close enough all right let's go to my apple apple developer program and let's also go to expo dot io so i'll sign in to my expo account and then we'll be able to download we should be able to download the file that that we just created and oh you know what let me what was that thing that they said there was some sort of thing that i needed to get from the app store the transporter download transporter from the app store okay so i do want to get into here and i also want to get let's open up the app store and get transporter hopefully that's not a large install and i don't want to enroll i want to log in see if it'll let me log in um oh not this again two factor off all the time all right uh eight four five nine two five cool sure go ahead and trust it what's up app store nice transporter is here let's check out expo i hope the stream isn't lagging too much uh usually when i try to do stuff on my macbook one and stream it it does not work another code five six seven seven five nine all right so here's another tip when you're doing anything with the app store uh make sure you have your your phone ready because you're gonna get a million text messages sweet so we can add the app uh this is the one we want stay focused let's download it i will say the build for ios took significantly less time than the android build uh downloads nice seems really small um downloads nice there it is just put it in all right cool all right so it's going to do its thing and examine this and then at some point the button will come up to say deliver no suitable application records were found verify your bundle identifier com.jesus focus is correct hmm let's try that again i shouldn't have clicked off of that error i should have looked it up right away okay um let me let me look i'm gonna look this up on my other screen real quick just because i got more space over here um let's see there we go it the auto complete came up pretty quick so i think this is a common problem i see it on stack overflow okay all right for somebody it just seems like itunes connect click on my app plus sign new app fill out all the info choose your bundle id for the app you're uploading now maybe i have to do this maybe there's a step i have to do first um let's go to i know i i know it's already there okay actually it looks like let me switch back i think this this actually is working i just need to do a step now in the app store connect so i'm going to switch back to um all right let me know let me know if you can hear me or you can see anything happening seems like i'm back all right so you can see like before when i tried to add an app this screen did not come up and now it actually has my my bundle um so you see like this stuff so using the expo cli to upload said it would it would need this stuff anyway uh so now it just seems like obviously like i'm doing the manual thing so connect test flight actually i wonder now it's saying let me double check i didn't see a test flight option yeah it doesn't say test flight all right i'm just double checking i'm in the right place i think this is the right place so uh this is going to be ios stay focused primary language is going to be english although there's not really many words in the whole app the sku a unique id for your app store that is not visible in the app uh i don't know how to do this at app store sku we'll just generate one how to get the sku number all right all right so it seems like we just make up whatever we want so let's let's do that let's go let's just say stay focused one uh user access what's this you can limit which users see this app and the full connect i'm sorry if that made a big noise i accidentally hit my microphone all right it seems like full access is cool let's create that sweet all right privacy policy url oh you know what we made that url in the last video let's see if we can grab that from our um our google privacy policy yeah no i don't want to edit when i want to let's share copy link there we go all right cool minimize that there we go subtitle um long enough um subtitles option i'm not going to put it because i can't think of one right now all right there we go no age rating category primary one i would say is productivity i don't know what secondary is maybe i don't know it's optional i'm not going to put it see save that so it saves pricing and availability what do you think should i charge 20 bucks for this it's gonna be free i'm not gonna charge anything i don't think i can charge anyway because i didn't fill out all my all my stuff somebody said um we're losing the video oh no losing the video all right i'm sorry i haven't been keeping up that well with the uh with the channel or with the chat here for the stream all right cool price free all countries of region all right that looks good save that prepare for submission uh oh need to create uh let's see at preview app store um let's just see if we can find a generator is this one that we used before i think this was it and we had yeah this was it it was super easy to generate all the the ones that we needed and we used uh which ones did we use this one yeah we use these two cool oh i already have them maybe i already have them i just didn't realize uh probably downloads there we go no let me download it again because i thought back to editing device there we go iphone the site is not iphone oh they i think they want like better images hmm hmm what was the other one this might have been what i already have let's see yeah that looks like what i have let's just try to let's try to upload what i have um dimensions are wrong looks like i'm gonna have to go with some sort of other uh appsource screenshot designer hmm i don't want to log in wow there's a tornado warning in my area that's crazy just came up on my phone we usually don't get tornadoes here uh let's see fastlane automates that let me get rid of some of these windows and start over so this is definitely not making it the right dimensions what dimensions do i need all right so i need 1242 by 2688 saying fastlane should automate all that and get rid of some of this stuff here i don't think i can do this on windows screenshots there you go i don't know if i want to install all this stuff right now we're already coming up on almost two hours for the stream uh i think i want to maybe try to get the screenshots hmm the same ones come up apple screenshot builder by launch pad we tried this before i didn't want to do it but let's give it a shot there we go ios fine that looks good um hey app store url did that download did not look good app is not live yet there we go uh someone said someone's fighting behind you yeah it's probably my kids so well for one thing it is um raining so hard it looks like there's a waterfall outside my house coming off my roof it's it's really crazy there's a tornado warning um my kids are running upstairs because they're probably like looking out the window and are all excited by the storm actually if the internet cuts out and the video cuts out you know what happened because it's storming it's really crazy um so yeah things are pretty crazy hey the app screenshots are downloading let's open this up see what we got alright cool we got a lot of screenshots so that's pretty sweet extract okay all right so let's go back here and see if we can get these apps screenshots let's let's pick some actually which size i needed 6.5 inch right i don't want that one at least six five there you go let's just throw in a bunch of them right i need five five whoops i didn't mean to click that okay all right that looks good um promotional text i'm just going to grab what i had from google and put it in here oops i guess not i guess i'll put it in here promotional text um there we go um let's see support url i don't have one do i need one marketing url i don't have one uh looks like support url is going to be necessary i guess i could do jesse weigle.com all right let's see all right the transformer app that's i'm going to try to do this again and add the app see if it'll take it this time doing that on my other machine um icon choose a file for the app store icon let's use the one that we generated uh where's that oh we gotta go in here users projects stay focused oops and assets let's use that one this let's say no sign in required and attachment for what notes okay yay it worked i'm gonna hit deliver so see if if y'all can see this probably not anyway it just says it's delivering to the app store now so basically if you remember beforehand uh it was saying that it didn't match like the build id didn't match or something like that well we we had to do this stuff on this end before we could upload it in there so i'm gonna automatically release that and let's hit save here see we're not ready yet certainly because we didn't actually upload it so um we are uploading the build now i assume that once the build is uploaded then we'll actually see it here so the upload is happening i don't know how long it's supposed to take to do the upload um it did say something about like make sure you're connected to a power source while you do this i don't have my plug down here so i'm not going to connect to power source while i do that but i can go back and answer some questions here in the chat while we're waiting for that to upload seems like that's the last thing we need to do anyway is do the upload and then we i believe we've done everything else that's required uh yeah so we need to upload and then submit for review so i'm going to scroll up and try to figure out where i left off in the chat it's been a while let's see all right i think i found it uh john jonathan says uh hey jesse if you don't get by if you don't get to do the time management video today what is the rain check because it is taking lots of time indeed let's help him um yeah i i don't know when i'll do it i mean i'll try to get to it at some point this week i suppose abdullah says hi how are you how many people are here uh i'm doing all right finally got things to work so there's a little bit of a struggle but it's working and and believe it or not this is still way faster than the android uh build and deploy so it looks like we're 37 of the way through with the app upload so now 40 i think it's gonna happen pretty quick i'm assuming we'll see it on the screen maybe i'll have to refresh but uh it seems like we'll see it hey look there's the tesla thing cool now i see that what's new in test flight little builds oh cool we might get to see it here and run a test that'll be sweet let's we we should do that um all right oh abdallah actually asked as well how many people are on here actually right now there's only 56 but seemed like we had a lot more at some point wait we had my computer froze for a second there hopefully it didn't mess up the video too much um yeah we had at one point 190 viewers at a time so that's pretty sweet but right now right now we're at 52. um yeah i'm i figured we'd lose a lot of viewers because we had a lot of trouble sweet what is this sweet it said it was delivered so let me refresh this and see if we actually have oh is this the one that said something said that it might take a little while let's see the process can take a few minutes you can check the status you have submission test flight just click test right play and do your current builds all right i'll keep refreshing here every so often and um activity okay there's a build processing right now so uh i'll go back to the chat hopefully before i get through all the questions that'll be ready and we can run the the test flight that'll be cool i've never even seen that oh youtube's saying that the stream health is doing bad i hope my internet is not cutting out because of the storm oh well i'm gonna keep going do what i can uh where am i at okay sorry if i'm mispronouncing the name says how many years did it take to learn coding um i i'd say like it was a couple years before i started to get like really good at coding now i was like i was trying to do a lot at the time so i wasn't dedicated entirely to coding the entire time so when i first started out like getting paid to code i was also writing content so i was like a ghost writer for blogs i was doing search engine optimization work um like minor image editing stuff uh so there was um i was more of like uh like a multipurpose like media marketing type of person right so uh once i really started coding fulltime i leveled up very quickly so for me it was a couple years of coding and doing other things at the same time so if somebody could dedicate all their time to learning how to code they could probably get pretty good you know much more quickly um let's see jonathan asks someday can you talk about hardware installation of devices and streaming uh internet connections revisited um i probably could talk about hardware and stuff i don't know well i'd have to think about it what kind of like in particular kind of like what what type of stuff would you want to know about i never really thought about doing hardware see um kevin and i believe this is a different kevin than the one kevin that kept spamming the channel so kevin says uh which which platform do you deal with um web and mobile mainly so and that's via like react and react native um a question from id ids emerald i'm loving this i'm not really good in react but i would love to learn so can i learn from you um yeah sure i mean ask any questions you want during the stream hopefully you learned something for this particular stream we're not really doing much react like we build everything in react but this is more of like going through the the process the app store process i actually i really hope that i could save somebody some time um if they're trying to do a a build and stuff for the app store because we ran into some issues that that basically cost us a whole hour and it really shouldn't have it should have been like done in five minutes but it took an hour so if somebody sees this and is able to save an hour of work because of it then it'll definitely be worth it uh jonathan asks how did he grab the privacy policy uh so on the last stream i found the privacy policy generator and just used that and then saved it to my google docs and so then i just grabbed a uh a sharing link from the google google docs and put it in there so then i went in this stream and just clicked the link to that same google doc and mirandir mentioned that the test flight link is at the top left which i i saw it eventually but thank you for pointing that out i totally missed it at first uh strom stromboli kick says it's harder to upload the app than make the app you might be right i mean technically it did take us longer in terms of hours like to make the app but yeah it's uh it seems like it's gonna be when when like everything is all said and done it may end up being close to six hours sweet we got some progress we got the logo this is so processing nice it's here can i actually do something with it um um so will it will test flight run automatically in order to test the app you need to install the test flight ios app from the app store and sign in your chat buddy oh okay let me install that on my machine now wait oh no it's an ios app from the app store uh might need i might not be able to do tesla then because i don't have an ios device right now unless i could use unless i could use my wife i could text her real quick and see if i could borrow her phone let's see um all right go back to some questions uh deep sing says it's 11 where i am and i i'm kind of addicted by the way i guess that's cool you find it that interesting i guess uh so go check out cloud blocks what's what is cloud blocks uh amit pratap singh says i haven't stepped outside in seven days locked up this stream is the best thing to pay attention to well thank you all right well youtube's finally telling me that my stream health is back to being good so it actually says excellent that's that's cool let's see deepsync says i want to learn javascript but i'm 13. yeah you can definitely uh learn javascript at 13. um i've known some really good programmers that started out young and were good like very good in fact there was a uh a programmer who i believe was 14 when he started watching the streams and this was i've been streaming now for almost three years it'll be three years in april and um when i first started streaming like he started watching and was very very good and helped me a lot in the project i was working on and um he now he's uh i guess like 17 18 ish somewhere around there and um he already has a job with a company uh programming he's very good so yeah don't don't worry about you know only being 13 years old like get in there and and try to learn as much you can check out the tutorials on freecodecamp.org um that's that's part of like where i started out that's why i recommend everybody start out i think they're really good um and then depending on what how you like to learn you know check out some blogs uh videos like youtube videos um there are other online tutorials there are there are actually some good javascript books that are available for free like the ebook versions are available for free so there's a whole series called you don't know js there's a series called right i don't think it's a series i think it's one book called essential javascript um i believe that's what it's called i think there's like a peacock on the cover or something the like the online cover but yeah you know go for it and start building whatever you think is cool to work on oh okay he says um all this oh this was some other advice going free code can't finish the javascript course yeah so great advice it's same same thing i was thinking see i lost my place it skipped down on me uh black cat says hello everybody what do you think about angular uh i think it was fine i don't i don't really use angular but you know i know um you know good programmers that use it and build good stuff with it so uh certainly uh a valid option deepsync says what ide do you think is the best so ide is a integrated development environment if we want to consider vs code as an ide then i really like using vs code i work with some people that love visual studio um i know people that that really like some other you know other options but for me i've been using vs code for a couple years now and i i really like it it works very well for for javascript and typescript so i recommend that looks like my wife maybe does not have her phone on her right now because she didn't respond to my text message um micah says some say that there are more jobs in react than angular yeah i don't know the numbers for sure it i seem to see way more job listings for react than angular but it could be that i'm being targeted for react jobs because i am a react developer so i don't i don't really trust that too much and i don't know what the real numbers are let's see jonathan said oh you you ghost right i'm planning that while i love uh why code love to write both languages yeah i don't do any ghostwriting anymore but i used to um when i started out as a freelancer like i just i did whatever i could because i had i was married i already had two kids and i needed to pay the bills so i had to take care of my family so like whatever i could do for a client um like that had anything to do with websites i you know i would just do uh what mod randir says does uh react native equal react it does not if you want to know more about that i actually just did a video on my youtube channel that uh lets you know what the difference between react and react native is so you can check out that video the link to my channel is in the description of this video uh the short answer is they do they are not the same they share a lot in common but they are used for different things like primarily so if you want to know more check out that video i think it's less than 20 minute minutes long and i give some pretty simple examples of how they're they're different and how they're the same uh some someone asking uh people where they're from we have somebody from kenya someone from turkey someone asked if if we had a video uh in french i don't think we have any french language videos on the free code camp channel um i'm not sure what our our status is on subtitles um so apologies about that i really um primarily just speak english i know a little bit of some other languages but not nearly enough to do a video in oh no no we have people speaking in french in the chat i did take a french class once so i can say a few words in french okay so earlier somebody mentioned cloud blocks and i asked what that was and evidently cloudblocks is home automation so that's pretty cool uh haroon says it's it's uh 1108 pm in turkey and i'm gonna sleep thank you free code camp for these online courses see ya i'll see ya uh thanks for thanks for hanging in there and watching for so long uh eric asks for links where to start learning react uh go to freecodecamp.org and check out the lessons there there's a whole section on react i think it's a good intro jonathan says jesse thanks for the lifetime sharing and good luck thank you i appreciate that just going to get up because it's two hours they usually move uh around every hour for five minutes oh okay that's that's actually a good uh good thing to do um all right cool so i got through all the chat so i guess the my wife still didn't get back to me about borrowing her phone to do testing on so evidently this test flight thing is going to require me to download the test flight app on an iphone and missing compliance this build is missing export compliance information does your app use encryption if yes yes even if your app only uses standard encryption within apple just operating okay you know what there was something about what was it i remember there being some type of data look at this disclaimer at the top this feature works properly only on mac os i can't believe i missed that that would have saved a lot of time um where did i see it maybe it was on the build it was something about some special permissions where am i going to find it hmm i don't not see it maybe i have it open on my other computer i'm going to check really quick store review oh okay no it's different so i don't know what's exactly what the answer here i don't think that i use encryption if you're making use of ats or making calls to https you are required to submit a year and selfclassification report to us government maybe i am encrypting all right let's just say yes then does you have qualify for any of the exemptions providing category 5 part 2 of us export medical use yes this question if the encryption of your app is yes i think because it's limited to authentication digital signature decryption of data files i mean i'm pretty sure that the endpoints we hit to get data is https so that's the authentication part of it right so it's ready to test is this it right hmm oh maybe i have to do this okay i just did this actually privacy policy where was that at uh that's my other screen and i should policy all right there we go all right i don't really know expire bill who's this ready to submit let's see i'm gonna get back to the chat chat in just a minute one app store connect users add testers i wonder if i need to do this step like what if i went back to the app store and said i just want to upload this oh do i really need to add these okay so which one is this 12.9 inch display download tap screenshots what's this wait is this one 12.98 i guess i'll just send them both in all right let's see anything else age rating uh no no no no no no no no no no there we go all right cool well copyright name of the person or anything's exclusive rights to your app jesse be fancy about it put the middle initial all right now let's see if i got it does your app contain show or access thirdparty content no does the app use advertising identifier oh actually yeah i think this was it yes it you want to check the following three boxes so on my other screen i have this attribute app installation to a previously served advertisement attributing action taken yes there we go man i'm glad i remembered that page and brought that up cool so my app is officially submitted and ready for review now i don't know what's going to happen because uh we didn't test it on an actual device i wanted to but i didn't have a device so we'll see what happens uh i don't know if it said waiting for review i don't know if it says how long it will take no not really okay um so yeah not sure how long that will take but for now let me go back to the chat i'm gonna get through the rest of the questions and then we'll wrap this up let's see deep singh says uh what time is it there jesse um it is 4 26 p.m so you look tired do i look tired after all the trouble shooting i think it just kind of got to me so i i i kind of feel tired uh jonathan jonathan asks can you emulate mac on uh pc i don't know if i can emulate a mac you can do like uh like a dual boot i believe i mean you can make they call it like a hackintosh and run mac os on a pc but i don't know i could just run mac in the pc i thought about maybe if i could do some sort of remote desktop thing then i could do stuff on my mac while i'm still on here i might look into that for future streams if i if i really have to do like ios stuff um deep says uh i'm actually surprised on how long it's stressful it is for people to put up their apps uh most youtubers out there show it as a piece of cake yeah it is it's harder than i thought it would be as well i think though now that i've done it this is the first time i ever did the app store the apple app store and then the last stream was the first time i ever did it on the google play store so having done it once now on each store i think doing it the second time would be way faster so you know knowing what to expect ahead of time will definitely help so i think i could do both stores like in less than an hour now assuming that like the the builds worked and everything eric says thanks for the info i will let all the other guys who are learning to code with me know that there's a free code camp website oh yeah awesome yeah definitely share the info uh is there anything else i should know um yeah i would start with free code camps lessons they have links to a lot of other resources as well i think it's a great place to start and um you know it's all completely free but uh do that there's enough lessons there that you know you could learn a lot just from from that website and then branch out like the free code camp youtube channel that you obviously know about because you're watching uh has a ton of great content uh free code camp has a forum and blogs um and you know they like they often link to other content too that's not just free code camp content so you'll you'll get an idea for where the good good stuff is deep says how much longer is this live stream going to go for uh i'd say just a few more minutes i'm almost to the end of the chat here and basically did everything we need at that point d says my mom wants me to sleep yeah you'll be just a couple more minutes we'll be done uh nerosity uh commented and that's who the company that makes the headset the brain computer headset says hashtag crushed thank you i appreciate it took longer than i than i thought um aj says if you do the test flight i'm happy to test on my device oh that's awesome um yeah i don't know how to i'm not really sure how to have other people test like i could add an external tester app store connect users i guess i could add myself um so i guess i've been invited now to test that's cool um anyway we could uh aj we could talk about it later too if you want to about what i need i guess i just need your email to add you or for external i don't really know i have to look into that more but that would be cool uh alexander says i have a little time just answer me one question how unit testing and react what is your experience with unit testing like you know what to be honest with you i tried to do unit testing and react but i found that i don't i don't see much value in it uh if you are doing endtoend tests i think the endtoend tests are much more valuable and um really make the unit test kind of obsolete all right so my internet cut out completely just a second ago it's lightning storming lightning storm all right my daughter just said it's lightning there's lightning so it cut out so i'm gonna i'm gonna get off here um let's see uh deep says it's now 11 31 here but i'm still happy to be here all right well i'm gonna i'm gonna finish up because i don't know how much longer my internet's going to uh going to work anyway so see y'all later uh thanks so much for hanging in here for this stream and um hopefully i'll be back at some point this week with some more streams and with gemma okay
