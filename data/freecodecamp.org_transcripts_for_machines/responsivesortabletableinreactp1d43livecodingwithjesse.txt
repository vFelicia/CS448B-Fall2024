hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to work on an old project and i i already started working on it and it ended up being a lot easier than i thought so i've already finished what i said i was gonna do for this video uh but what i will do is i'll go through everything that i've done and if there's a chance to refactor or improve it in any way we'll do that this would be kind of cool to revisit that that first project that we did just kind of go through the code i know you know some of you were involved in that first project but you know a lot of you watching probably weren't so some of this will be new to you and i don't know i always think it's kind of fun to go back and look at old projects and and this is a project we were working on at least six months ago maybe probably more so it'll be cool to see how long how far we've come you know hopefully i've i've improved since then so it'll be fun and that's cool this would be kind of more laid back uh my my throat's just after yesterday's stream uh my voice sounded all you know messed up so maybe it's better that this is laid back uh i just want to start out too by showing you something i got today so i work at a university right so i got a knock on the door which is weird because nobody comes to my office but it was a student and who i don't know and they had some some stuff and they're gonna give me this card so i got a a thank you card and i'm gonna cover up the phone number here in case but i got this thank you card from a student here you kind of see it says dear jesse at the top but um i just kind of wanted to share this is a student that i i kind of mentored um last year and he he wasn't a computer science major he was a communications art major but he was taking a web design course and for his project he he wanted to do like a really cool website so i helped him out with he had some parallax stuff going on that was really cool and uh you you all know that i'm partial to parallax um and then he also wanted to grab data using i think i think he ended up using ajax i don't yeah i think he was using ajax uh to grab some data from a google sheet so he had all his data in a spreadsheet so i kind of you know helped him out with that and he'd come into my office and and we'd sit down and and talk about it and check out the code and uh so it was cool but i don't know i just wanted to share it so i'm gonna the card's just really really small so i just kind of want to share uh just as an example of i guess if you take the time to help someone out it can make a big impact on their life it it might not be that big of a deal it might not seem like that big of a deal but it is you know it was a big enough deal for a student to leave me a gift and a card uh you know after everything so it says hey i just wanted to write you a quick thank you for all your help this last semester i honestly couldn't have done it without you so thanks i can see your live stream has been going good i hope you're the next youtube star uh thanks again and please keep in touch um so that was cool i don't know about the youtube star thing but uh i don't know i just felt it felt really cool about that and yeah i mean it took some some hours out of my my day here and there but i don't know who knows the last i heard i haven't talked to him for a while i just sent him a message uh so we'll see if he responds but the last i heard he was developing uh java he's developing software in java uh somewhere out near washington dc so really cool um anyway hey everybody i can see all the everyone in the live chat now um oh rook has to go it's gonna go help a nephew troubleshoot motherboard and graphics card problems oh cool thanks for stopping by to say hi good luck with the the motherboard issues uh the graphics card issues sometimes those can be a pain um let's see kyle uh says been watching replays of your live videos glad to watch you live awesome really glad that you could join live too uh don't be afraid to ask questions make comments on the live chat uh sergio says hey i just want you to know that i like the coding with jessie's series thank you for saying that i really appreciate that comments comments like that make me want to keep doing it um let's see monier says hey guys check out my daily coding life on instagram it's elhrimounir cool i'll um off to check it out i'm gonna copy and paste that right now and uh that way i won't forget i'll check it out check it out later yeah that's a good actually i'm on instagram as well so i do i don't know just some coding stuff from time to time sometimes i just post things from from my life like me with my kids or like food but i do post a lot of coding stuff as well so if you're on instagram and you want to see some of that stuff let me know and if you're doing coding stuff on instagram i'd love to see it so um you know again just let me know i think it'd be i'm trying to follow like as many coders as i can uh on instagram uh it's kind of like twitter has their thing but instagram seems to have this whole different community of coders that kind of do it's like at a different vibe to it so i think it's just kind of cool to see i don't know the differences like twitter seems to be like all about like business you know like let's really talk about the code instagram seems to be more of a mix of here's what i'm doing with the code but then here's kind of how my lifestyle like here's how i handle worklife balance and health and so it i don't know it's kind of cool to see that side of of you know my fellow coders so anyway sorry for the long intro that uh talk but let me go sorry i still have that cough i'm gonna try my best uh i have my g fuel today so g fuel if you're watching hook me up i'll give you shout outs in every video just hook me up with like one tub of pink lemonade flavor i'll give you shout outs for for a whole month um all right we did have a lot of pull requests so after we do the code when i go to answer questions at the end the first part of it i'm going to check the uh the pull request i'm going to check those out and i'm going to give credit where it's due to those of you that submitted some pull requests so i really appreciate that okay cool uh moneer i i did get your uh your friend request on instagram on my phone so i will be following you as soon as i'm done thank you all right so enough of my face let's go to some code so this is our old project and this is the page where i've done the most and it looks like a lot but most of it was copy and paste so that's why i ended up being really easy because i when i first made the video and said i was going to work on this it didn't occur to me that we already had a page that was doing everything that we wanted this new page to do so i had to do a little bit of work in wordpress too i'll go over what i've i've done there and let's see let's turn on the pomodoro clock okay so first things first let me show you what i wanted on the screen i think that's a lot easier to show at first and then go to the code so here's what i wanted a new page called mentor training well when i say i want it i mean the the people that are making the site who are wanted uh we want an intro section which right now it's just uh some bacon ipsum um and then this table if you remember this project this table should look familiar this is the nearby events table we've just changed the name now what i'm not sure about i remember talking about this in a meeting months ago but i wasn't sure if we came to like a conclusion for sure on what these fields should be i vaguely remember basically saying just let me know what field you want and i'll do it and i don't know if i ever got a list so right now they have the same fields here like the same same headers and this data i'm pulling the nearby events data just to give us some sample data because i don't have any real data for these mentor training sessions yet but i did invite the person in charge of content to come edit the wordpress site and and put in some some data so hopefully we'll get some of that soon obviously i'm not going to go live with this until i get the data and contest it if you remember in this project we have a test server on digitalocean and then we have two live servers that we're load balancing between we also have another server where wordpress is running and that's where the data we're getting all the data from uh so you can see with this table it works really well on mobile one of the problems with tables is that often tables don't work actually i changed this and now it goes over so maybe i'll um i'll fix that i'm not sure if we're even going to need that heading anyway but normally you have a table and you try to go it's fine on a large screen but you try to shrink it down and there's like all this table out here and you scroll you have to scroll over and that's not not a good thing you never want to have your users have to scroll horizontally on mobile so that's why we went with this type of table so i didn't come up with everything on this table it's just a modified version of what materialized css had so in this project we're not using material ui like we did in later projects in this project we took materialized css which is not really intended for react but we made it work eventually i'd like to redo this so that we switch everything over to material ui because we have some jquery going on i'd rather not have jquery in here but for now it's it's working so i'm okay with it and on so with materialize the way the table works is by default is when you get a large screen it looks like a normal table with your your headers your headings up at the top and then when you go small to small screen it changes well that didn't exactly work for us we still had a lot of headings so uh just modify it slightly to always be uh in the mobile version and we added in some things like we added in some of these uh icons so you can move back and forth uh otherwise like normally it was just scroll but we've we kind of found it wasn't 100 obvious that you could scroll um we we've also added in some sorting so you can see we can sort by date i believe we can sort we can sort by location as well i think oh you know it's not working because the location data wasn't put in i'll show you where where we need to enter it in it was kind of tricky um to get the right data for that so it actually does assuming you give it permission which i have it will get your location and use it to show you which one is closest and which ones are farther away all right so let's look at the wordpress install right now so basically i made a page called mentor training intro would hat which has the data for that and we'll see where i pull that in and i made a custom post type called mentor trainings you see there's nothing there right now let me zoom in a bit and show you so we have normal we have the date and we have display date this is important because we want we want the date in a format that's easily readable by javascript so that's why we have the date here but then we also want the date displayed in a way that's easily readable by humans so i have two different fields just a little bit more work but it gives us a lot of freedom with how we want to display the date and right now it's uh you know the month in the day comma year um do you have a question about will you upload the video to watch later yes i will i will definitely so if you can't stick around don't worry about it uh i'll answer your questions and i'll upload the video and you can just check in later if you need to um what else we have okay so we have location here and this is just the the location text that will show up to the user so we're usually just doing like city and then state sometimes i guess if you wanted to you could put an actual address here and then down here is where you put in your actual location so we have a map uh yeah this is a google map yes we have a google map you can search for an address and put a pin in there and then it will send the exact coordinates for that location and then that's how we're comparing the coordinates that are given when we turn on the geolocation for the browser we compare that to the coordinates that we're given from that google map for each event and that's how we figure out which ones are closer and which ones are farther away so if you want to know more about how we did that go back and check out some of the the early streams the titles are pretty descriptive on those so you will find some about using geolocation with react okay so now that we have all this let's get to the code so here's the actual components and let me make some space here let me know if this font is too small for you all right so nothing really special here we're bringing you if you're familiar with react we're bringing in react we're bringing in some components here and we're pulling in data so we did make uh use next js to build this so we have access to this git initial props function where we can pull in data and then that data is available to us on the server and the client which is awesome and great for server side rendering um awesome hey just got an email from the content manager for this website that we're working on right now let's see what she said all right so nothing she's just gonna add some stuff later on and also wants to have a rough timeline for all the other updates so i was hoping she'd be ready to put some data in we could actually test it um let's see all right so we're in this get initial props function and we're getting so we're using the wordpress rest api so no graphql and um we have we're sending basically this long string saying what we we need to get so we're using a plugin that lets us get multiple posts and host types in one request so we have multiple post type the tradeoff when you use this plugin is you can't specify a lot of like what you want so we can either get multiple post types and then get everything or we can do one post type and narrow it down and only get certain fields so that was our tradeoff uh we but we needed to get more than one post type so that's we ended up doing it like this so right now i'm bringing in nearby events like i said this will change and we'll actually pull in the mentor training dates and locations but right now we don't have that data we're doing some filtering we're going to order it by by date and ascending and we want some of these fields but then on our second type with our page uh so we can't we can't get like different fields so we can say what fields we want but it's it's not gonna we're not gonna be able to do it for more than one post type so for instance with pages we're getting all the pages i can't specify one specific page so down here i need to when i bring in that that intro section i'm going to do a filter so we're going to this props data so the data we get is stored in props and then we're going to filter the post by the slug which is mentor training intro that means it's going to pull that text in that we had in that we had here right it pulls that text in from wordpress and it displays it here uh also there's supposed to be an image back here i don't know uh what would happen but the image quit showing it stopped showing up right before i started the stream so i was in the middle of troubleshooting um so that's how we pull it in and we have just a div and we're setting the the content we're using dangerously set inner html because we want to preserve the html that's coming to us from wordpress and then down here is where we have our our table and we're also doing a map function over that that data that we're pulling in which right now is the nearby event data and we're just mapping over that and adding our tr's and our tds for each one of those so that's not really the exciting part that's kind of like basic react stuff you you just loop over things and add them here's where we're doing some of the the different sorting things so we actually this is where the jquery comes in we have this h scroller function that's being called and we use some some jquery coming from another file to do that but we wait and call it on componentdidmount so we don't have the document.ready function like we'd normally do instead we call our jquery from inside componentdidmount and that way we know that the component and that the the dom elements that we want the jquery to manipulate are actually loaded so that was kind of a little work around that we had to do this is not ideal for react so this is something that we had to do to get the site launched on time we were converting it from a site that already basically was doing all this stuff but it was using jquery so i'm not saying we should do it like this but if you have to do something like this that's how you make the jquery work let me know if you actually want to see how we did this in jquery you know go ahead and i i can for sure show you just let me know in the live chat if you're interested so for the date sorting right we need to get today's date obviously and one thing we're doing is we're not showing any dates that are before today so we automatically don't display events that have already happened right which makes sense the whole point of the table is to find events for you to go to you can't go to it if it already happened so that's why we're grabbing today's date and we're also getting the location so we're using this navigator.geolocation.getcurrentposition and what will happen here is the user will be prompted to allow geolocation if the user allows it then we can get the location if not then the location sorting functionality will not work which is okay that's entirely up to the user if that's something they they would like to do and then we're calling compare location so once we get the user's location and we're out we're saving all this into state so our state see we have user latitude lose user longitude all right we're going to store that there and here's where we're doing some some fun stuff i remember when we made this it was really cool when we got it working so we have our data we made a constant called new data and it's just all the data that we have in in state in this state data and we're mapping over each event okay we've actually taking let me check in here that's a probably location map all right so we're checking to make sure that that event has the location map property right so we don't want to try to do this if the event does not have a value for that we you know that would potentially give us errors or at the very least it would have event show up as being really close or really far away um and it's it's not really true it's just that there's no value there i forget what the what actually happened if we didn't check but that's why we need to check so this is a just kind of a long term area so think of like a ternary like a shorthand for an if statement so if we have this location map property then so after the question mark is then we do this so then we take the user latitude minus the latitude of that event plus the user longitude minus the longitude of the event and what that gives us is a number and the higher the number yeah let me double check i believe it is the higher the number the farther away the event is the lower the number the closer the event is so it ended up being i was a little bit worried about how are we going to judge these distances i was thinking we'd have to make another api call to some other service to get that but no just very simple math i mean literally addition and subtraction got us through here that's why i ended up being really pleased with this because i thought this is such a very like a simple solution to our problem um and then we have uh let's see if there is no location um then we do infinity i forget why we had to do infinity honestly i'd have to go back and watch the stream but this wasn't my idea somebody else put this in here to solve some problem um and then we're just returning uh the event clone which was our constant up here now we can sort all right so if you've never used sword it's actually it's really cool so we're sorting each each item right so a would be like the first item in in this array and then b would be the second item in this array so we remember we have an array of objects that's the format that our data is in so if item one this distance to event here's how we doing sorry this is not if this is uh distance to event minus b distance to event basically what this does is compares all of them and then sorts them so the the ones that have the lowest value will come first and then it'll go up all right we got through that it feel free to ask me to clarify this even more and like if you see something and you're not sure about it you like here it might be a little complicated like check it out on mdn mozilla developer network just type in like javascript.sort it'll be one of the first links and then you could probably get some like more simple examples and a better explanation i'm happy to answer your questions but i know i'm not as good as mdn so that's why i'm just i'm throwing that out there for you all right we're doing a similar thing with the date right so we're sorting by date you can see the same thing we have a um sort are we doing the date sort oh here we are so we have a sort here and um this date sword okay so we're actually able to do ascending and descending with a date and we store that in state why would we store that value in state i feel like i'm a teacher now sorry sorry but we want to store it in state because every time state changes it triggers a rerender in our component so to go back here if i didn't have this saved in state i could click on date all day long and nothing would happen right i could i it would be doing something in the click but it would never trigger a rerender so this isn't like i would put an on click handle on there and it would do stuff that's not how it works and react i mean potentially you could do it but that's not really the react way and so that's why we put that in in state and i've done that for a couple different projects uh some projects that i didn't stream uh is i had to use this for like for my udacity nanodegree some of those projects anytime you have to do any kind of sorting i found it always helpful to put that that sorting in states or if you're using redux you can put it in there as well but when you do that and you have a you know some sort of toggle or even a drop down we have multiple things to sort by it's um that's the way you want to do it to trigger the rerender all right let's see locations okay cool so here we have our our handle sort we're passing in sort by so if this syntax looks weird to you it's it's called an arrow function uh so just if you want to look up more about it type in arrow function javascript you'll see a ton of stuff it's part of the es 6 syntax or it it's officially called es2015 but a lot of people say es6 so handle sort and then this is the parameter that we're put we're passing in um and then here's our our arrow function because it looks like an arrow so that's the that's where we get the term arrow function from and then anything in here is actually our function so we have this sort by and it's just a switch statement so if we want to sort by date then we have the name date passed in here if we want to sort by location we do that the default is sort date so if we have nothing in here it defaults to sort date and let's see i don't remember why we needed two digits here something i needed to change the two digits so that's why we made this function uh but that's basically it that's how we did this sortable responsive table you can check out uh this code in github i haven't pushed this yet but if you go to the events.js component it has all the same stuff i just copied it from there so you can check it out right now in the repo this project is called ci react so ci hyphen react and uh you can go through that you know feel free to clone the project mess around with it use the code for your own project it's totally cool to do that and let's see so that's that's about it like i said i'm not ready i'm not ready to commit this yet because i messed up oh sorry i messed up something so we don't see the the background image so i don't really want to commit it with you know something messed up so i think i just i changed the id and i think that's what messed it up it's missing some css somewhere that it needed um so potentially i could just change the id back maybe i'll try it right now let's see if it works oh yeah yeah that was it it's just the id so for now actually i will commit this because cancel because the id i'm not doing anything special with this page it's i do want it to be identical to the events page in a sense uh so let me commit this now and that way you all can see everything so just walk you through the the process here i'm going to do a git status now this is on the branch called upgrade i have not put any of this on master yet so just be aware of that it won't be there by default on master you have to change the branch to upgrade i'll show you all how to do that in a second so i've added this and i've changed some things in the title component and i've changed some things in the styles now i just made a few adjustments there are some things that i didn't like how it looked on the page so that's that's what i did in here uh just very small uh adjustments on um just like size of things and padding and margins so let's go git add and i'm going to put a period there and that's going to add everything so now if i do a git status again we can see in green here these are all ready to be committed so now we can do get and when they're ready to be committed that's called being staged uh so this is like these are all in the staged part of the process of git committing so now we're going to commit and i'm going to do a flag dash m which means we're going to do a commit message and let's see we want uh let's see add page admin to our training page looks good oh what's going on i messed up something event section is defined but never used oh okay not a big deal let's check it out so we have some linting that runs and some auto formatting that happens when we go to commit and this is very useful because it caught this obviously this isn't an error that would have caused our app to crash but we still would would rather not push that so we're just going to go up to the top here and see this event section we i took that out because that was not needed for this particular page um but i forgot to take out the import so if i go back in i just press the up arrow key it brings my message right back up my my last command i can hit enter again and we'll redo that hopefully we're good now yay all right awesome so everything worked it told me i need to upgrade but other than that everything worked and now we're just going to do a get push origin upgrade right because i want to push this to the upgrade branch and there we go everything's there let's double check that and i'll show you how to get to it let me make this a bit bigger and increase the font size so i can get to it easily because it's one of my repositories here but if we go to fus fusmarcon is fps hyphen marcom is the organization and the project is ci hyphen react we go down here right now we're on the master branch and you see there's not very many updates because we've been doing all the latest updates on the upgrade branch so we just click that drop down go to upgrade and see now we have some updates that are a minute ago those are what we just we just did right so you can go into where we're at pages mentor training and here you can see everything that we just went over so i know a lot of you are really familiar with this and you don't you don't need the explanation but we do have some people who are are very new to coding and some people that don't really know anything at all about coding that watch um so this kind of explanation i think is is helpful uh hopefully you know some of you are new you don't have to say you're new i don't if you're going to be embarrassed by admitting that uh you know you're you don't know anything about github or something like that i don't think you have to be embarrassed but i totally understand if you don't want to say it but hopefully that helps you all i know it adds a little bit of time to the stream but i want to be as beginner friendly as i possibly can all right so at this point i need a drink and at this point since we're already on github i'd like to show you all some of the pull requests that were made and um and thank everyone that submitted pull requests and i'm just gonna kind of go over what's what's changed and it looks like i have a message here about the side menu let's check it out all right cool so uh angel is is working on that react native app that we're making so we're taking the resource center which we already made in react and we're just converting it to be able to work in react native so if you're not familiar with react native that means that we'll be able to run the resource center on android and ios as a native mobile application which is going to be awesome it's going to solve some browser issue problems that we've had i did read an interesting uh article recently and i i forget where i saw it so otherwise i'd let you know where it's at but it was basically making the argument that if we really care about our users we won't support older browsers because older browsers are not secure so by supporting older browsers we're enabling that behavior and we're actually contributing to our users being at risk like if if we handle sensitive data and we allow people in an old browser to actually make transactions on our site let's say it's an ecommerce site then we're allowing them to put their data at risk they probably don't even realize it so the the i think the title of the article was by supporting older browsers are we really like caring for do we really care about our users or do we care about our business right so from a business perspective you want everybody to be able to buy something no matter what browser they're on but if we're really caring about the users wouldn't we want to stop them from potentially leaking their data out from an old browser so that that's kind of changed the way i thought about things i still like to support browsers to an extent but i've kind of felt the the same way in in terms of supporting really old browsers is are we really doing anybody a favor by supporting older browsers so anyway i just it reminded me of that because we've had issues with the resource center not working with older browsers and i've i've tried to accommodate the older browsers but i'm not sure that that's that's the right move anyway if you all want to weigh in on that uh please do i'm interested to see you know what what you all think about that uh so basically from from the perspective of how we can best care for our users is it better to support older browsers or not support older browsers all right cool let's go to our repo here and most of the changes uh i'm sorry the pull requests that were merged in were for this franciscan react but we did have some for this react native so we'll look at that as well so i'm going to go into the pool requests and the ones that are closed and just check out the first few so i don't think i ever gave credit to angel for this one but this was a while ago last week fixed that center logo uh centered the logo on the sidebar which is awesome uh i know also updated material ui to the latest version so we were on 26.26 and we're now we're now on the latest version which is 0.28 so that's awesome evidently there were no breaking changes because everything still works and let's see we also have let's look at these look in here these ones so make social icons larger and center them great so for a while i've been bothered by the um social icons being like weirdly off center so now the social icons are bigger so thank you very much and let's see we also have the the text for that donate button is now uh corrected so now it says access fus so thank you for that as well and then we do have a pull request we had kind of a large pull request here and this was from angel as well and you can see basically this added a lot of stuff right uh a header with the green back u background for all the views uh drawer navigation uh if you're not familiar with react native navigation it's not the same as you'd normally navigate in a regular react web app so that's why we're talking about drawer navigation uh think of like being able to click links in a side drawer right on an app that's the kind of navigation we're talking about which like it's like you would expect from the name i suppose i also created the drawer the side menu um added some views added an about view and added an icon to the header so we can actually click to open the drawer so that's awesome you can check out all the changes here you can see quite a few eight files changed really nice a lot of good stuff here so if you want to know more about react native and how we set this up initially go back and check i think we called this project six so go back and check in the the live stream uh playlist and find the one that's project six i think it says react native in the title almost positive i'll have to separate this out into its own playlist at some point but right now we only have one video so i'm not gonna make a playlist with one video in it uh so anyway those are hopefully i didn't miss anything but those are the pull requests that we got and they're really awesome i'm i'm really glad that we have some progress here on this react native thing i don't have any time right now to work on it but i was always hoping that somebody would be interested in getting some practice and would want to want to work on this a bit so really glad about that thank you we also have an electron app if anybody's interested in electron so we're basically using react and electron to make an app that would could run on windows ios or i'm sorry mac os and and linux could run as a desktop app so that's also another project out there it just depends um depends on you know what you're interested in uh so if it's something you're you're into then you know please by all means go ahead if you know ask me what needs done or i can help walk you through things just let me know uh harsh it says show contributors data i wonder what's happened all right let me go to contributors you have three contributors our or you're still number one on this still number one cool and i guess we can show contributors data for our franciscan react as well i haven't shown that for a while i do like to show the contributors data to give you all credit so hey i'm actually the top contributor on my own project this time that's good um we got hardship close behind so i'll zoom in on everybody so y'all can see thank you everyone who contributed i really appreciate it okay i'm gonna go to the live chat now and i'm gonna answer as many questions as i can if you had any questions about anything that we've worked on it doesn't have to be a topic that we've covered already in the stream it could be any of the repos we're working on or just any question in general i'll answer pretty much anything uh as long as i mean i'll pretty much answer anything it'll be really obvious if something's not an appropriate question and i'll just skip that but otherwise i'm i'm i'm open so i'm scrolling way back up to the top sorry i had a missed call i think it was spam though just wanted to check um all right i just got a really surprising message from my wife wow it's nothing bad with my marriage or anything like that it's just somebody that we both know something crazy happened okay sorry i keep taking drinks if you weren't here at the beginning i have a sore throat so i'm just trying to keep myself from coughing and drinking helps um let's see all right so uh acrom says which javascript framework can i start learning um you could start learning any of them that you really want to if you'd like to be able to follow along with these streams i recommend learning react because that's what we use mostly if you're if you're really really new to javascript i recommend learning a little bit more javascript before you get into a framework you don't need to be in javascript expert but sometimes it's really hard to understand a framework if you don't have a basic knowledge of javascript so i'm not sure where you're at i don't mean to imply that that you don't know javascript but i i don't really know how much you know so uh if you're solid in your javascript like i said i recommend react but it depends on your goal if you have a company that you really want to get into that uses angular go with that uh if check out vue a lot of people like vue i mean there's still there are companies that use amber uh there's a lot of stuff out there so but i would say the top ones right now you're angular and reacts by far they're the top ones views getting a lot of more people using it but it's so it has momentum but it's not up to the level of uh angular and react i mean in terms of like total users and people people doing things with it uh hopefully that answered your question let me know if you have any followups to that uh dave says thanks for the work you put into this it has really helped me a lot oh you're welcome you're welcome thank you for uh telling me and let me know if there's anything i could do to make the streams better and more if you have any questions and that that's not just for dave that goes for for anyone if i'm doing something that you find really annoying or you think that you have a good idea for something i could do please let me know i can't guarantee that i'll change things based on that but i'll definitely take it into consideration and because i know i mean sometimes my videos get thumbs down i don't care if they get thumbs down it doesn't really make me cry or anything but what i really would like is give the thumbs down and then put something in the description that says here's why i gave you the thumbs down that way i can make things better uh all right that's always like on stack overflow you can downvote somebody's answer if i get a down vote and nobody tells me why i get a down vote i'm like well how am i supposed to give you a better answer next time i have no idea why you downvoted it i obviously thought it was a good answer i wouldn't have posted it right so anyway i'm the point is i'm trying to make is that i i welcome criticism in your ideas i do want to make this stream better and more helpful to you all uh nissar says jesse would you like to see your future full project with react native compatible uh with expo uh just pure javascript here's your full project with rec native compatible with expo just javascript i'm not exactly sure everything is going on in that question um but if i'd like to see my future full project with react native that would be cool that would actually be really cool i don't think that that's something that my boss even has on his mind at all about doing the university does currently have an app i had nothing to do with with the building of that app we hired another company to do it so um i think right now he's worried about just trying to work within that app structure he's not opposed to me having other apps though i've talked to him about for instance the resource center being a mobile app so i for sure want this website to be a progressive web app so i want people to be able to you know download the the shortcut you know on their phone be able to use it offline to a certain extent but if we can turn it into an app i'm cool with that as well uh ah i'm trying to remember how to spell that or how to pronounce that sorry uh duvoprio says uh no one replies like you do the way you help us with our personal projects and open a new tab for searching about our problems or us is really exceptional oh thanks for saying that i don't i mean i don't know honestly some of it i i like don't have a lot of people following me and i have the luxury being able to do this from work so a lot of the other youtube people or you know just people on twitter instagram or whatever sometimes they have a lot of followers you know i mean i have maybe i don't know my twitter is like almost 800 followers right there are people on there that have over 100 000 right so i have a tiny fraction of what they have so i'm not getting swamped in my dms by people so i definitely have the freedom and the fact that i can do this at work as part of my work and get paid for it kind of frees me up a little bit as well so having said that i mean i do really like to take the time to answer everybody uh the way i see it is i don't want to be the person that discourages somebody else and they don't go into coding i'd rather be the person that i'll never know it but maybe somebody was just on the brink of giving up and i say one encouraging thing and you know then they go forward right i'll probably never know about it but that's really at that point i could either say something encouraging or i could you know say nothing or say something you know derogatory towards them and then they they quit so i don't know that's how i think when i do stuff like this and when i try to answer and i'm not always the best i know there have been people who've asked me to like review their portfolio resume and i never really got back to them if that has happened to you please like send me a message and remind me because sometimes things just get really really busy with my work and my family and it just slips through so i don't want to pretend like i'm perfect when it comes to answering but i do try my best and uh but you know give the other people a break as well because i'm sure they have a lot more going on than i do and especially i don't want to go on too much of a tangent but i i would kind of like to mention this uh because i notice some of the female coders that i follow on twitter and on instagram they mention sometimes that they get a lot of direct messages from people um and sometimes they get inappropriate things message to them or you know so it's just hard like i don't get that you know i've never experienced that as as a male developer when people watch my stuff they they always talk about my code for the most part i mean occasionally somebody makes a comment on whether i shave my beard or not right but uh as a female developer a lot of the comments have to do with their appearance and it's like people just ignore their coding abilities so i just be careful about that and you know give them a break too if you're trying to ask them a question and that you know they have to deal with a lot more than i have to deal with and they've probably had some really bad experiences before so there may be a lot more you know careful so just be straightforward and you know if you send them a direct message don't just say hey what's up because they're probably gonna ignore it right because they probably get a million of those and then when they do answer it ends up being somebody who's you know not very nice to them so you know maybe say say something like hey uh you look like you really know what you're doing in coding i'm having this problem you know could you please answer my question right um you know don't start out with like you know the heart emojis and the heart eyes and saying you're so beautiful um and you're a good coder like now i mean i'm sure that's flattering sometimes but you know if you get that 500 times a day maybe it gets old i don't know if you all want to tell me how beautiful i am you know you i'm i'm open to that that would be fun but anyway all right that's my uh that's my message for the day is uh basically in general be nice to everybody when you do comments but especially um you know just kind of be aware of what some other uh coders on social media and on youtube have to deal with okay let me get back to the live chat oh harsh it said i'm late did i miss something um harsha you probably were able to catch up so let me know if you didn't and i'll i'll try to catch you up on things but you didn't really miss that much and you're super smart so i'm sure you caught up harsh it also says materialize eliminated jquery in version one i'll have to check that out because when we use materialize for this they still were dependent on jquery but i'm i'm actually really interested if that's the case that's really interesting i'll have to check it out i haven't looked at any of the updates for materialize in a while since we started using material ui for most of our our stuff uh oh uh i'm sorry i'm probably not gonna pronounce this right ogusan says what's the best ide uh i'm i'm currently using well if you want to consider visual studio code in ide which some people do some people don't but if you do want to consider an ide i really like visual studio code i've used atom before and i do like atom as well and you know so i think there's a lot of ids out there that are really close in terms of you know their functionality but right now i'm very happy with visual studio code harshit says so you switch to outlook how's it working i really like outlook is a huge improvement over what we did have before so you know for my personal stuff i use gmail but for work i use outlook and i love it we were using novell groupwise before which is really ancient and and terrible i'm sorry if you work at nobel group wise i'm sure you do hard work and you're good at your job but i'm sure you've also inherited a lot of legacy stuff and it's hard to work with so uh if you are working on that like keep working uh and do your best but i just can't in good conscience recommend it to anybody their their mobile capabilities were pretty much nonexistent if you're trying to go through your browser and um yeah it was just not fun to work with so far i really like outlook i really love the outlook app as well and i'm gonna give a shout out to uh marie clemency who works on the outlook app and i was i met her at november so i'm sure she's not watching but anyway if anybody knows marie or ever meets her she she's done a great job with the outlook app i'm really impressed uh tobe says love the beard thanks uh i had a poll on instagram yesterday about whether or not i should shave my beard and uh the the overwhelming majority said i should keep it so it's going to stay for a little while which is good because it's really cold outside but anyways as you sound a bit cold make sure you take those d vitamins i do need to take d vitamins i get no sunlight um and i am i have i don't know what i have a cold or something i don't know i feel i'm trying my best to just ignore it and pretend like i'm not sick but i'm so tired uh let's see harshit says that plus minus things is simple math kind of distance formula as far as it says difference of coordinates harsh it's typing in some math in here and uh harsha you're better at math than me because i'm like not even following it at this point the last math course i took was so long ago uh let's see harshad says you have not calculated the whole distance oh shoot it skipped down to the bottom sorry i gotta scroll back up uh you have not calculated the whole distance but that value works for comparison for complete accuracy i would have made the api called a google uh distance matrix api uh this gives distance by car plane bike etc yeah yeah like like i said i was thinking we'd have to go to an api but then i realized that we don't really need precise distance this is just in general also the the problem was as well is a lot of times the the woman who's in charge of doing entering the data doesn't really even know the exact location of these events she just knows the city so having more precise data wouldn't even be that helpful so anyway that's but that's good to point out though harsha so when we went over how i did the comparison of locations to tell which was farther away which was closer that was just a very general way to do it because for our use case that was sufficient if you wanted like people to actually have you know a really precise location you would want to use something like you know make an api to google and get to the more precise directions let's see coding in caffeine says i need coffee and yeah i could probably do with another cup of coffee i had like a half a cup of coffee earlier and it was what was left over from yesterday and i just heated it up uh let's see uh gander7 said okay so this is in response to when i was talking about browsers and whether or not it's a good idea to support older browsers particularly when you're thinking of what's the best thing for the user to support the browsers or not and to try to encourage them to upgrade their browsers so gander 7 says agreed we only support current browsers it is possible to let's see all right the next q the next statement doesn't have to do with that but yeah i'm starting to think like that as well that i should only support newer browsers but make have an easy way to explain to users and that they need to upgrade and then have links available for them to upgrade uh gander 7 also says is it possible to create an electron app that is selfcontained load urls uh loads load file um and handle react js versus load a server localhost i've been trying to find i've been trying but can't find a way um i'm i'm not really sure so i i have never successfully made an electron react app yet we just got one started so we we basically have like a hello world app running and it works but you know that's that's not really like i mean i made an app so i don't really know um but if you want to follow along with our project i can't tell you for sure when i'm gonna have time to work on it uh but maybe you know in the process of that you know we'll have to answer that question john hanson's here uh says hi all late i was eating yeah no problem um harsh it says i'm i'm busy nowadays i'm not able to contribute yeah i totally understand you told me school started and everything so you've contributed so much hardship i really appreciate it so don't don't worry i don't know if you're worrying about it hopefully not because you don't need to worry at all you've done so much and i i do i appreciate that and everybody here in my department appreciates it i told them at meetings how much work you have done so they they all know that you've done uh you know really good work and uh i even told them i said arshad's better than me he does great work like it's he's he's awesome so you do what you have to do for school and don't worry about this uh john says different skins hard to do on page x page y or client x client y on different screens and devices okay i'm not sure it was that was that was directed to harshit for something um oh cool harshit says check out ant design it's like material design but they made it completely for react all right cool uh it's it dot design let me i'm gonna type it in on my other screen here so don't forget all right just scrolling through their website their website looks good so that's that's uh good sign right off the bat got a lot of stars on github very cool i'll check that out later thanks uh thanks for the the lane carson uh s shravan says how to differentiate between um admin and user in authentication please help me to get the knowledge i'm using react uh all right i'll definitely need some more info for that uh but i'm happy to help if i can um a harsh respondent said are you using uh json web tokens or cookies let's see okay so stravan is using json web tokens and firebase all right it looks like harshit is is offering some advice on that so i'm going to defer to harshi because i know he's more experienced with that kind of stuff and uh harsh is coming from back end and moving into front end stuff as well so that's something that he's going to be way more familiar with i'm coming from front end and learning more about back end and using it uh let's see i lost my place here harshad said do you know oh sorry john hanson says for some odd reason learning pug for html taught me a lot when it came to learning javascript that's cool that's cool i um back when pug was called jade i did some stuff with it but i have not used it for a really long time at least a year or more harsha says do you know it cost points to download and stack overflow i didn't realize i don't think i've ever downloaded anything in stack overflow usually if there's a terrible answer it's already been downloaded or downloaded so many times it's like why even bother gander 7 says you got one more on twitter now awesome thanks thanks yeah if uh if you do follow me on twitter i do tweet about when i'm gonna stream and what i'm gonna stream about so it might be helpful for you to decide whether or not you want to watch a stream on a particular day and i also will retweet like if you tweet and say you're looking for a job or you need advice on something and i see that like i'll i'll retweet it so uh if you want to like tag me in the tweet so i definitely see it you know go ahead and do that and you know i'm more than happy like i said i don't have that many people following me but i can get you some exposure you know maybe you can get some more retweets from other people that have a bigger following so i can't really do much more than that but i'll do what i can for you oh harsha completed the the new westboss grid course that's awesome that just came out like yesterday right good job on that uh he said it was very good so that's really cool so if you want to learn more about css grid check out the new course from westboss it's css grid dot io it's completely free so go ahead and check that out i definitely want to check it out i just have a lot going on right now so i don't know if i'm going to be able to but at some point i do want to check that out uh olsa says it's good to see real life project working uh process i'm still new in web development so touching everything here and there so just wanted to say thank you for your streams it helps and motivates oh you're welcome you're welcome comments like that help and motivate me so i'm glad i'm glad you said that and i'm glad that my stream is is helping you out uh pollux says where to learn best practices about react in javascript um really the the react documentation is a good place to to go um i think with javascript best practices i mean mdn mozilla developer network is good if you want to learn about specific parts of javascript otherwise i mean maybe a book series like like you don't know js is free online eloquent javascript is a free book online and you can buy the paper version of it as well but those are good places to learn more about javascript you could check out some javascript style guides from big companies like airbnb has a very popular style guide for javascript standard js has one those can help i mean in terms of like how should you properly format and do things if anyone else has any suggestions on that please put it in the in the live chat michael says hey oh it's been a while hey michael how's it going thanks for joining let's see harsh is still trying to help stravon with his um authentication uh questions and one of josh's responses was it's easy i can show you how harsh it makes everything look easy some of the things that that you can do are probably easy to you but not not to me so so just remember that if harsha tells you something's easy it may not actually be easy david says vitamins are a scam even if the vitamins are just a placebo effect for me i'll take it at this point i don't really care because i just i i want to not be sick and have more energy oh okay harsha said school hasn't started yet it'll start on 13th of february let's see okay john says uh the google maps api has a way to put directions from the visitors location it's fairly simple to implement on a website it's to put it in a react app is a bit more tricky all right that's really cool like i said for this app i don't think it's necessary but that's good to know i it would actually be really cool to do that in some of the other stuff that i've been working on uh some like previous sites i i have a previous site that's not a react app where that could be really useful i think so when i have time at some point maybe we'll add that in divo says hi hey evo how's it going thanks for joining george asks if there's any firebase projects coming in the future i can't say for sure i i'd love to work with firebase i've learned a little bit about it and heard other people uh use it and heard them talk about it so i i'm really interested but i have to find some way to work it into a project and if i can i'll work with it but like i said i can't can't guarantee anything uh let's see sorry i don't know exactly how to pronounce this name it's berke so beric berka um says can you suggest a source to learn react for beginners check out the tutorial from the actual react website that's a good place to start code academy has a tutorial that would probably be good to go through free code camp their new beta curriculum has some react stuff in there i haven't tried it yet but usually the free code camp stuff is pretty good uh so those places i think are a good place to start um john says jen simmons has started a new youtube channel called layout and layout land she knows css grid like no one else all right really cool i'll have to check that out uh thanks for that john well harshit said she wrote it spec wow that's i would say she knows it she wrote the spec that's really cool harsha said she even kind of corrected westboss for making imperfect advice on the grid on twitter wow all right maybe i have to check out that youtube channel then i like youtube videos for code stuff because like when i'm eating i usually just eat in my office at my desk and i watch a video um some type of coding tutorial or something so i'm always looking for for new videos and useful things evo says doing pretty good sign my contract today with which i can start working next monday awesome awesome congratulations uh i understand you'll probably be pretty busy but if you could remember let me know like how your first day goes your first week or whatever i'm i'm really interested in that so uh so don't forget about us when you're you know busy uh building cool things and making lots of money all right well i've gotten to the bottom of the live chat and i think i'm gonna wrap things up now i can't believe i've been streaming for almost an hour and a half uh okay now's a great time to end it's friday so we're gonna have the weekend i'll be back most likely on monday there is um a storm that's gonna come through maybe sometime next week so if it storms really bad and i can't make it into work probably won't have a stream so just be aware that there may be some days when i can't stream next week just depending on what happens with the weather otherwise i'm planning on streaming every day if i can um let's see uh one more comment i'll read this out evo says about the video watching and coding one thing i noticed is that nonprogrammers find it weird that we really enjoy learning more about our expertise oh that's interesting that is true you know coders seem like we love what we're doing like we watch stuff we go home and think about code we may have side projects like yeah i mean i guess you don't see that in every um every profession but that's cool we're passionate about what we do we really like it i think it's a good thing as long as you don't overdo it you know ignore your family or your health or anything like that but um anyway that's a good observation evo all right so have a wonderful weekend everyone thank you so much for watching and for all your help in the live chat i will be back monday see ya
