i went over the basics of objects in a previous video now i will talk about other things you can do with objects you can see the list of what we will cover on the screen the first thing is using objects for lookups objects can be thought of as key value storage like a dictionary if you have tabular data you can use an object to look up values in the data here's an example of a simple reverse alphabet lookup so you just create the data you want in in this alpha object so one is z 2 is y 3 is x and then so on i'm not going to put all the letters in there but then you can just do console.log alpha2 so you can find out what letter is the second letter in the reverse alphabet next up is removing object properties so i'm going to create this object here dishes with plates eight cups tens and so on and if you just do delete the name of the object and then the name of the property it's going to delete that that property let me run that and you can see right in here there are no more cups and the y up here from the reverse lookup now testing objects for properties sometimes it is useful to check if the property of a given object exists or not i briefly discussed this in my previous video you just use the has own property method on the object so dishes that has on property plates dishes that has on property cups we're checking if we have the we have the property plates and cups we deleted the property cups so we have true it has plates and false it does not have cups okay now we're going to talk about accessing and modifying nested objects object properties can be nested to any depth and their values can be any type of data supported by javascript including arrays and even other objects so the sub properties of objects can be accessed by chaining together the dot or bracket notation in this object called our stores we have two properties desk and cabinet but each of the properties desk and cabinet contains an object as the value so here's an object that just contains the property drawer here's an object that contains the object top drawer top drawer and bottom drawer and inside the top drawer we have another object so we can access an object within another object by using the dot or bracket notation so right here we have our storage dot cabinet here's the dot notation to access the cabinet and then we're going to use the bracket notification which you always need the bracket notification anytime the property has a space in it so we're going to get to this top drawer and then we're going to use the dot notation again to get inside the folder too and then here we're just looking at inside our storage.depth.drawer which you right here you can also use the bracket and dot notation to assign a new value to a property that's nested inside an object so here we have the cabnet topdrawer.folder2 that's what we have up here but instead of just console.logging it we are going to use the assignment operator the equal sign to set that to cake recipe and then i'm going to log it again first of all in folder 2 we have secrets you can see here and then we're just going to check what's in the drawer which is a stapler which you can see here then we're going to assign folder to the cake recipe and we're going to log folder 2 again and now it's not secrets anymore it's just a cake recipe which anybody can learn and the last thing i'm going to cover in this video is how to generate an array of all object keys and the object keys are just the properties we can generate an array that contains all the keys stored in an object using the object.keys method and passing in an object as argument this will return an array with strings representing each property in the object so we're going to call object.keys you're not going to put the reference to the object you're going to actually put the word keys and then you're going to put what the object is inside these parentheses here and you can see in our storage we just have desk and cabinet because it's only going to give the first level it's not going to go into the object to get the the second the nested object well thanks for watching my name is beau carnes don't forget to subscribe and remember use your code for good
