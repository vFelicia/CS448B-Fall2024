hey everybody is Jessie a little bit later today than I normally am so sorry for everybody who you know won't be able to see this hopefully you can least catch the recording but maybe it might be better for some people because instead of coming in at the end of my normal 2 o'clock train you'll be at the beginning of the stream today that's at 430 Eastern Time it's really hot in my office so I do have a fan running let me know if that's making a lot of noise if it's annoying I'll turn it off it's not like unbearably hot so I can stand to turn it off today I'm gonna start out by showing some of the issues that I had yesterday that I was able to fix and I'll show you those had a few like little design changes for the the resource page basically I implemented a lot of what we had talked about yesterday and and then I'm going to show you what I'm doing with the API calls so we're gonna do I'm basically going to be trying to pull in as much of the content as I possibly can from the WordPress API so that the when I'm done with this project they'll be like really no need for anyone to contact me and the people in charge of the content for the site will be able to handle all that content so assuming that nothing like really crazy happens with the site I should be able to just just let it go off on its own which that'll be good I really like working on this I learned a lot of stuff but I am ready to move on it's nice to it's nice to start over with a clean slate and be able to try to do even better than last time all right so I'm just going to check okay great we got our view count is up to a decent amount I always hate to get like right into it before people have had a chance to to join in and I know that this was really late notice I think I I posted on Twitter about it like five minutes maybe four minutes before I was going to stream so they'll probably be some people joining in late because they didn't see it but I'm gonna check the live chat hey hi hey everyone a lot of people saying hi okay so Anthony says there's just a little bit of background noise not that bad okay so cool yeah let me know if it if it does end up being bad so like I'm actually the fan is sitting it's kind of blowing directly on the microphone so I am gonna move it a bit and then that should cut down on the noise and I know uh you know wind can makes really bad noise on a microphone so I don't want the same thing to happen here Anthony says I started frontend course two weeks ago and I finished algorithm today yeah all right way to go that glad to hear that you're you're getting through some of this stuff keep me uptodate if you can in the live chat I'd love to to hear about more about your progress and that's yeah Sarah said Mike's catch everything yeah it definitely it does so just I'm like turn it off after a little while anyway it actually has done a decent job of getting thing called getting things cooled down a bit so the reason I didn't stream at my normal time listen because I had a meeting the meeting I might have been able to get in like a really really short stream in and still make it to the meeting but I didn't want to try to you know do a really short stream and have it not be kind of like as good as normal I probably would have had time to do any questions or anything so I thought I'd better just a postpone it I plan on working late today anyway so so this this should work out I kind of thought I'd be able to get out of the meeting so that's why I didn't I didn't post earlier about the time change but then like right before maybe like within an hour before the normal extreme time I learned that I I was I had to go to the meeting so that's why I was kind of late notice okay well let me show you Jordan says moving the fan didn't change the sound sounds like you're sitting in a server rooms let me let me turn the fan I can actually turn it down I'll try turning it down a little bit right now and then if I have to I can turn it off completely I also do have another computer on that I don't normally have one so and it's kind of noisy as well I don't know how it turned on I thought I had it off maybe I just had it asleep but I do never like a really old Windows laptop that I keep around just in case I need it so I I almost never need it because I use a browser stack for testing now but before I had that it did come in handy for testing things okay cool so it seems like that sounds better now that the fans turned on all right so let me start showing you a little bit about what's changed since yesterday what's been updated the development site let me put the link I forgot to put the link in the description for the show so let me find the link now and you know I'll post it here we go have a lot of stuff open so here's the link to we now have a development server so normally before I was just doing everything locally which is okay but you weren't able to actually interact with the site near the latest version of the site before it really went live unless you clone the git repo and ran it you know locally on your machine so I had already had another droplet already set up and ready from when we were testing the load balancing and I never I never shut that droplet down so I had always planned on using it as a development server at some point so that is up and running now so you can check out the IP address if if I forget to put it in the the video and you're watching this later on the IP address is 1 6 2 dot 3.2 for 3.8 6.67 oh it's not working again it keeps stopping so it's right now I'm not running it with from from p.m. to and so it's possible that I just need to set that up it's probably not gonna do it right now there you go so I'm gonna start it up again alright it should be working now so I'm gonna try to refresh my page in my other screen okay it is working out I just didn't take the time to set it up in a more reliable way because at first I was only using it just to just to test a few things out but since then I had requests from other people to work here to see the site so now I probably ought to set it up in a better way pushpush Pinder asks about is it possible to get the live session on the weekend the recording will be available so you can definitely check out the recording I probably won't do another live session on the weekend but the recording is definitely available so it'll be right here on the free code camp channel there's actually a playlist for all the streams so if you don't see it on like the main page you can check the playlist is just called live coding with Jesse but if you're gonna view it you know sometimes the next day or two it'll probably one of the first videos up on the main page okay all right so let me show you now you can see the site now and actually I don't have it looks like I don't have the the very latest stuff but so I'll bring the latest stuff up on my screen okay see I was wondering where am i when my browser window went so went here I think I have it the site up somewhere else so let's pull it over and now I can't find it oh well not a problem just go to localhost okay so nothing new so yeah nothing new there on the about page figures my dev server needs to be started again I never bothered to figure out why my dev server always needs restarted and only on this computer I can run the same same stuff on my other computers and it works so anyway so on this page it doesn't look like much has changed but all of this data is now being pulled in from the wordpress api so all the text with the exception of I think this title is still hardcoded and the image you can see I need to work on the formatting a bit I think WordPress is automatically wrapping this in a P tag and so it's messing up the formatting so I'll have to I'll have to account for that it'll probably be easier just to account for that in the code then to try to change how WordPress does things because sometimes I do want them to actually use wrap things in P tags but sometimes I don't the only visible change here other than that kind of mistake is I'm actually pulling in the the test pages now the data before I had just made some lists just just to see how it would look now I'm actually pulling this in so when we click it the link works and it goes to our page it's still just test data but hopefully we'll get some real data in there and be able to kind of get a better idea of how it looks and on our resources page this is where we have the biggest change so I switched up from the black which you can see on the dev site right now so I had the black before and I've switched it to the red the red background with it has like this semi transparent background image kind of going across here and then now you know everything's white the check marks end up being like that gold color that's on the site so I'm not sure if I like it being gold what I might end up switching it back to white but for now I think the gold is okay so before some of this stuff was gray but it just doesn't look very good against the red so I did I got some feedback yesterday from you all and I got some feedback from some of the people involved in the project here where I work and general consensus was going with the red would probably be better so with the red and then I increased the padding a bit just to kind of it looked really weird with this background image when it was shorter so that's why I increased the padding a bit but basically everything still functions the same way so everything works I didn't get a chance to check this out on multiple browsers so we did have a an issue open up on github based on what we saw in the stream yesterday and that was that on some browsers especially windows browsers one of them in Windows this this doesn't look right so I'll still have to check that out on some browsers but I didn't want to do it if I was gonna change a lot of the colors anyway I wanted to wait until I changed it before I tried to troubleshoot that so that's something I'll be doing soon or that's something that's that's open for for anybody to you know try out if you'd like to and submit a pull request I did have a pull request that I pulled in from Bill so let me show you I'll be I'll show you and I'll explain to you so since I've only pulled it in on the dev branch I don't think he shows up yet in the official like contributors page but basically bills contributions were pretty nice and that he I didn't have a unique ID a unique key for each of these which you need and reactor it gives you an error message it still loads it but within the console you get an error message in dev tools and then he added this is actually a horizontal rule now before we had a black bottom border now this is an HR and with some shadows and gradients and things going on actually I think this is how do you do is I think this was a background gradient so I only changed what bill sent in just a bit so I just lightened it a bit I checked out the material design documentation on how to do lists and they're lines between the lists are very light so I decided to go with that since we're kind of trying to follow material design principles here and also he put in a little bit of code to make sure that the last in the list the last element in the list doesn't have an HR at the bottom so that's it not not a whole lot happening I didn't get to do quite as much work as I had hopes because I had meetings like kind of unexpected meetings this morning that lasted lasted a while but it was good I guess we'll get feedback for this site so it worked out alright so I'm gonna move this over because I don't really need it right now we'll leave this here so we can keep referring back to it but I want to show you let me uh organize this a bit better here we go but I want to show you the about page and how I pulled in the the data and actually let me check the live chat I had an idea so normally I use a Pomodoro timer so you use this and I thought I should I'm gonna start using this timer now and that way if it goes off it'll be a reminder for me to check the live chat so I don't forget so hopefully I'll check it you know before it goes off but just in case you know at least every 25 minutes I'll check it and then that'll give me just a little reminder of how long these things are taking because I usually forget to record how long things take during my streaming so let me check back in the in the chat here okay not a whole lot going on the chat hey Sebastian how's it going but my employer is now in the live chat Franciscan University Steubenville it's not it's it's actually the the guy that works in the office right next to me he must just be logged into the Franciscan University YouTube account so he told me that my mom was online too but instead of he's just kidding okay so John says thin light thin border lines are easiest by using one pixel inset and a very light gray okay cool I might try that I am I kind of just went with what what bill had for this and just lightened it a bit but if I get a chance maybe I'll try to you know change it even more I wouldn't mind it being a bit thinner I mean I think this I think this looks fine to me but but a little bit thinner probably would match more with what's in the material design documentation so so thanks for that I'm like I'm kind of getting down to the wire here so I'm only gonna work on things that are absolutely necessary but I can see like I'm I'm a little bit confident now that I can get done what I need to get done before the 20th and then I'll switch to another project but it seems like I'm gonna be able to get things done I say that knowing that I usually run into unforeseen issues that take longer so assuming that I don't run into too many of those should get everything done then I won't have to work crazy hours all right so I'm gonna show you what I gonna show you all the about page I have the music I'm playing in my headphones is from Spotify throwbackthursday playlist and this week it's on 90s music and so if you grew up in the 90s like I did it will be nostalgic for you I find myself remembering like lots of stuff that happened in middle school in grade school that I associate with these songs alright so at the top here before so as of yesterday I wasn't pulling any data in for this page it was all coded directly into this component now I'm gonna pull in more data so the big problem that I've been wrestling with and I've mentioned it a few times on the in the live stream is that I needed a way to get multiple data from multiple different post types in one API call so I needed it to be here because I wanted anything in here gets rendered on the server so the API call will actually get made on the server and everything will get rendered and then the data will get sent to the client as an HTML page and then it can also be made when you do clientside routing so the same call could be made on the client the problem was when I tried to write some code to do multiple calls inside here I always got errors it's possible that there's a way to do it and I just I just couldn't figure it out so I found another way there's a plugin for the WordPress for WordPress that exposes this endpoint this multiple post type endpoint and then you can say what types of posts you want so right now I want the PDF page post type and then I want just the page post type I didn't want to do this because you can't if you specify parameters for you know for how you want to narrow this data down the parameters apply to every post type so it's not that useful because certain post types have different they have different data that's coming through and I have different needs to the post type so what I'm gonna have to do to make this work is this is fine but I'm now going to end up getting more data I would normally need and it should work for most pages the only pages where it's going to be a little bit tough is if I happen to have a page that has a lot of different data I might not get it all with this hundred per page thing and that's that's the WordPress limit you can't easily get more than 100 posts per page and I don't have time to try to work around that so probably what will end up happening is everything that's essential that I really want to be rendered on the server will be in this first API call and then if there's other things that should be rendered later on they can be rendered later on I'll render it in another API call so usually it'll be based on a user interaction and that's fine so then upon that interaction it'll make the call and and that should be fine it should work if for some reason there's a page where there's some data that just needs to display and there's no user interaction I can make it happen on a scroll so perhaps if a user gets like halfway down the page then I'll make the call and load the stuff at the bottom of the page it should work out none of the pages right now are so big that it won't work but today I'm actually gonna do some of this I'm kind of showing you how I did it first and then I'm gonna do it on some pages so we'll find out if it'll work for all the pages but since I did that the API call I get back has all the PDF pages and all the page post types and so down here I started doing things like for the intersection I made a page in WordPress called about intro so I'm grabbing the the page that has about interest I'm using filter and then I'm I'm rendering the content of that page inside this this column div so I've had to move the float X class up here to the column instead of having it on the P tag which is fine because I don't want the person entering things in WordPress to have to worry about any code so why don't you just be able to use the the WYSIWYG in WordPress which will automatically add eat eggs but it won't automatically add the classes we want one thing I didn't know about is I use the map here just because I was copy and pasting some stuff I was doing elsewhere there's only one post that I really want so I'm not sure if I have to use map so if there's a better way to do this where I can just grab this right from filter and use it let me know if anybody knows it if not I'm I'm not really gonna take the time to look it up right now because this works and this is okay because if I ever have to grab more than one post type and render it it's already set up to be able to handle that but for now this is the sodus you see I've done that for each section so let me show you let's go back to the about page just to see so each section is now its own page in WordPress and I can show you what it looks like in WordPress as well so in WordPress if we go to pages see I have about intro that's the top part the about quote banner is down here section 2 section 3 so that's what I'm gonna do the only things that aren't on there right now these I didn't put in they're not editable in these for now I don't think I'm going to put them in because the odds of these changing are really small so there's not really high turn over here at the university especially for the upper level positions you know once people get up there they stay there forever until they're ready to retire also I'm not sure that these will change soon enough so if I have time later on maybe I'll do this but for now I think it's okay to keep these hardcoded because for these I would have to probably have to make custom post types so it's a little bit more work than just an extra page so I want to make a custom post type for this you know kind of bio card and then iterate over that render it and then the same thing here it would be a custom post type for these collaborator cards so I don't want to do all that for those sections right now since they're not likely to change but I want to check out we'll start with the home page and we'll just check out my service topic this is driving me crazy if I had only just took like you know 15 minutes a month ago to fix this when it first happened I wouldn't have to worry about this and I still I still never take the time all right so on the home page I'm gonna leave all this up here hardcoded this is not likely to change and I really don't want it to change because all of the spacing and everything on all the screen sizes is pretty exact if someone went in here and changed this and made it a lot bigger or something it it would mess everything up so don't want that to change the video for now I'm gonna leave it like this at some point it might not be a bad idea to have a page with a custom field that was just the embed code for this video to be able to change it but for now I think it's it's okay like that I want to make these their own custom post type so we'll definitely be pulling in we're gonna make the post type for this and then pull in the data the the image for this is gonna change but I don't think I'm gonna take the time to put it in here if I'm gonna make this editable from WordPress then we'll see maybe the person in charge of the content will do that the person in charge of the content and her name is Amy I always just keep saying the person in charge of the content but it's much shorter to just say Amy so Amy is gonna put probably put the the new image in I can show you the image though this is it's going to be this image so which will work well because then the the title will go down here and this section will be darkened a bit so it's perfect image too to put the title there it won't really block anything this section which I've already made a page for this section will be editable I'm glad Google Calendar let me know that today is garbage day or tomorrow is garbage day so I need to put the garbage out today so glad for that reminder and then these will be pulled in from the API as well so we're gonna have three three different sections so we're going to need three different post types this will be a from the page post type this will be from I guess we'll call this the formation cards yeah I'm not sure what else to call them right now but the formation card post type and this will come from the the news or the blog actually we won't need to make a new post type because I'm gonna pull these from there just the normal posts that are built in to WordPress so that should be okay as is and if I have time I may change how these look but I think they're okay right now I just don't like that I've like kind of made them all have a max height and there's all this space but I'm not sure I'll have time to really do what I need to to make them look how I want them to look all right so let's go in and work on this I'll connect this up first and these because I already have the post types made and then I'll decide whether or not I actually want to make a new post type during the stream or not let me know in the live chat if you'd like to see me create a post site but I've already done it a few times so you may not even want to see again it doesn't take very long but may not be very interesting all right oops not moose no is there some setting that I can edit so that the my Mac doesn't automatically change the order of my my desktops like that's for some reason it always does that and I don't like it I have them in the order that I want them in alright so we need to find our home pages are the index page and make it slightly bigger check this so I'm gonna grab the about page and move it over I have so much going on here let me get rid of some of these things serious like such changes no I don't think I changed it no okay so oh you know what I had I just occurred to me I had one other error that kept happening at the end and I didn't show you how I fixed that error so the error was that every time I tried to go to one of those single pages that the PDF pages that we were linking to from the about page I would get an error about the side nav init function and I figured out what the problem was the problem was that in the layouts so in in the layout components I didn't have these two dots here so it was just going to static jazz app touches which was fine normally it was working normally for some reason when it was coming from one of those pages that we were using the parameterised routing for it just wasn't working so the reason it I didn't catch it before was because the the one page that I was looking off of that did work was he wasn't using the layout it was using the old style of how we did this so anyway that's all I had to fix and it fixed everything so it took a while to figure it out but it was an easy fix once once I did all right so now I'm going to take the about page and move it over here so that we can copy and paste some stuff if we need to and I do want to copy and paste this it's not really fun to type out so we want to hit that end point that multiple post type end point that we get from the plugin and we're gonna need we don't need PDF page when you post I think post is the post type we'll see in a second we either get the data we want and then we want page we haven't made that other post type yet so I'm not I'm going to try to get it because we'll get an error and I can check this right away to see if it worked by going into dev tools for the site and we can go into the react dev tools screen and we'll see our props up here oops we're getting an empty objects I did something wrong so let me maybe I need to say posts which I it again hmm still not get anything all right so I'm gonna just grab this and we'll try it out right in the browser hmm not getting anything okay we should have gotten something on that first time oops I grabbed the wrong site it ought to it autofilled this other site which I also built in a similar way okay so this is better so this is giving us what we need I'm not sure why it didn't work the first time I did it let's try it again and I'm gonna manually refresh this it's possible it was just a refresh problem there we go and now we have everything safe props and we can filter things by its type if we need to or filter by anything we want but for the news part we're gonna filter by post and then we're gonna filter secondarily by we have a custom field where's our custom field ID so why our type inside this advanced custom field okay I'm gonna check the lights out again it's been a while this timer actually is really helping me to remember how long it's been d 404 says just arrived welcome also after you use the fetch API to get your data I do I do tests or I do use the fetch API so I recommend using it if you haven't tried it yet definitely try it out it's way easier than any other method I've ever used to make API calls and don't worry about the browser support just use the polyfill so as long as you use the polyfill you should be fine on most modern browsers it even works on it works on Internet Explorer 11 so definitely it's definitely worth learning it'll save you time it's just so much more simple I really like it a lot better then do the other ways of making API calls with you know Ajax or you know just like a plain xhr request Sebastian asks what do you need tested on edge ok the yeah the drop down the the select input on the resources page was acting weird if you check out the the github repo there's an issue open for that okay so Sarah Sarah tested her on Firefox and it looks fine on Firefox that's awesome but it looks like she said Opera and Chrome on on windows are not it's like waiting out everything so I have to test that out okay yeah if you want to see it in action I did put a link in so maybe for everyone that's come in a little bit later on I'll put the link in the live chat again for the dev server hopefully it's working and it didn't quit working again okay it's still working so should be able to go there okay blad says just landed here why does jessie have a timer running it's a Pomodoro timer which I usually run this all the time when I'm working and I record how long it takes me to do everything I record that in my Trello board so you can check out my Trello board I just not realised I have my calendar up here so I've been showing everyone everything I'm doing all month so I hope there's nothing embarrassing up there and it's not as my wife's calendar on there too so I really don't have a good idea of what's on there because she could have put anything in there so maybe I'll have to move that to another screen for future streams or just get rid of it maybe that's better I'll just headaches it out of anyway so like these numbers that are on my Trello board and there's a link to my Trello board in the description if you want to check it out these are like the dark numbers or how many plummeted or cycles I estimate that a task will take and then the greyed out ones or the the slightly transparent ones are how long it actually has taken me so this is really helpful for me to be able to like I can go back in and see how long things took me before it's helpful for being able to accurately estimate future projects how much time it will take me and it is helpful as well for me to remember just to take a break because otherwise I would just keep working and working and lose track of time so for every time I get through a 25minute session I take a five minute break after four sessions I take a ten minute break which is the long gray and during that time I can check my email I check Twitter you know get up and walk around so often times that'll be a nice break for me to just evaluate like is what I'm doing right now the most important thing I could be doing should I switch to something else like just gives my brain a break and I noticed when I don't do that I can they get stuck on one problem for hours and hours and not get anywhere and sometimes I shouldn't worried about that problem I should have just let it go and moved on but since I never really stopped to think about it I don't make that decision so this is a really nice way of doing things and I know I've seen actually a lot of people use this and there's even a one of the free code camp challenges is to make your own Pomodoro clock I haven't gotten to that challenge yet so I am still working through my free code camp frontend certification it's actually I'm gonna do here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna do my short break and then I know if this time is up then I should probably get back to coding again our likeness this I'm gonna try to remember this from now on we're gonna do Pomodoro sessions and we're gonna try to stick to during the session we code and then during the break we talk and that might be a more that'll be a nicer flow for things and then it'll let you all know like what's coming yeah I like that idea let me know if you think about that I think it should it should work but has anybody made the Pomodoro timer and the free code camp thing right now I'm working on my well I should say I finished working on my weather my weather thing my weather app but I didn't I didn't move on like I didn't end in a link to anything because I was gonna style it but functionally it can it works it works fine I just haven't done any anything to style it yet and I built it in reacts all right so I'm gonna check out okay so it looks like Sebastian also is verifying that chrome and edge or white for that talking about this this dropdown is it's all white and you can't see anything on chrome and edge for for Windows so I have to work on that oh yes Patrick you're my hero today alright so a few minutes ago I had asked about these desktops being rearranged automatically and I don't want that to happen so Patrick just sent me instructions on how to do this so I'll do it on this screen so in case you've ever had a similar problem we have System Preferences and Mission Control and uncheck oh wow that's really obvious so I even asked that everybody I should have just I should have just checked so we'll uncheck that and then that will fix the problem awesome I'm actually I was like a Windows user for my entire life until I got this job and I've been working here for almost two years so I've only been a Mac user for about two years less than two years so still don't really know enough and and actually I come way behind because Windows 10 like I haven't really used Windows 10 that much so I don't know what's going on there so I feel like I'm not really an expert in any operating system like if you like put me in front of a Windows XP computer then I would be fine I can do anything you want me to do but right now I am NOT not an expert at any operating system oh cool so Patrick actually like look that up and figured it out because that annoyed him as well so awesome Thank You Patrick thanks for taking the time to do that okay Vlad says it's a really interesting way to keep track and make sure you're working smart I may steal the process from you yeah feel free to steal it for me I took it from somebody else so I definitely did not invent this I did a course on Pluralsight because I got a free like three months subscription to Flora site and there was a course on using agile methodologies for one so usually agile was used for teams well I pretty much work just myself on all my projects so I thought it sounded really cool and I took the course and part of the course was talking about the Pomodoro timer and so that's where I picked that up from and I thought I'd give it a trial and use it for a few weeks and see how I liked it and that was last year and I've liked it so much I've continued to use it for for all my my projects occasionally I'll do a little side project where I won't use it but sometimes even on side projects I I still use it because it's still a good idea to you know break up the work like that okay Sara says she's on the jQuery part now for free code camp so cool yeah that would be cool if you all are doing the free code camp stuff too it would be fun to know what what part you all are on so if you're in the live chat right now and you can type go ahead and type if you feel like sharing of like about where you're at and if you're watching this later on you put it in the comments that'd be really cool just to get an idea of where we're all at if if if you are doing the free code camp challenges I had a question about the Trello Adams so actually so my my time here for my short break is up so I'm just gonna answer this last question and then get back to the code the question was about the Trello addons that I'm using with the Pomodoro Technique so yeah that's a great question let me I believe that this is actually a Chrome extension so let me see let's assume my extensions are okay so here are my extensions I'm gonna make this bigger yeah okay so where's that there we go so the extension is called scrum for Trello so I think that's it I think on a previous livestream I may have said that it was a Trello addon but I think I was mistaken so I apologize if anybody tried to add this in Trello and couldn't find the addon but then later on I I realized that it was an extension and I had meant to mention it in a stream after that and then I forgot until now so so that's really cool while I'm in here my extensions I'll show you this is a really useful extension this tells me like how what websites are built on so I'm constantly using this when I see a website that I like or one that's really terrible and I just want to see like what what do they build this with yeah this is Michael tampermonkey is the one that you need to make the colors on github change so react dev tools is how I get the react stuff in the in from developer tools and something what else all the JSON format err definitely recommend that if you want to check out JSON data that's why when I look at the data from the WordPress API it looks nice and not all jumbled and I think that's it for like developer stuff browsers that local I've actually never used this I download this and I never used it at all so I can't really say whether it's good or not and then retired j/s is kind of cool you can see if there's any vulnerable JavaScript libraries being used on any of your sites it's not bad but I found like 99% of the time it just shows like some version of jQuery as being vulnerable which which is ok but it's not like that useful because if everybody is using this same vulnerable version like I don't I don't know like there's got to be some version of jQuery that's not vulnerable but it seems like everybody that's using jQuery it shows up as vulnerable so anyway hopefully that was a little bit helpful can't believe I never thought of showing that before because I use those really often so you can see this is that analyzer here it's telling me that Trello was built with jQuery they're using Quantcast for analytics and Google tag manager and Google Analytics so this is actually this is crazy I wouldn't guesti if I were to guess that I thought Trello was built with some sort of like JavaScript framework but it's it's actually just all jQuery crazy I've been surprised to see how many sites are built with react now that I didn't realize her built with react so which one was I was on GoDaddy recently and GoDaddy site is now built with react that was a little surprising Wow okay so the song you guys remember the song Mmmbop from the 90s from by a Hansen that just came on I'm definitely gonna skip that it's nostalgic but not not really the song I want to listen to okay so let me get back to the code now I did ask a question and I'm getting answers in the live chat I'll read them off really quick it's not really polite to ask a question and then ignore the answers oh cool so Patrick has done the Pomodoro thing and actually put a link to it in the live chat so I'm gonna check it out and while that's loading yeah that's nachiket says join the camp only a day ago and have reached only till bootstrap also well you got a good start good start keep doing keep going and keep us updated on how it goes inside the matrix is on the twitch API projects about halfway done with it also gave your Pomodoro a heart Patrick all right cool it oh okay so here's Patrick's Pomodoro nice I like that okay oh so it automatically takes you into the break interesting that's cool we can double click to reset that's really cool I'm gonna check out the code to this later on that's awesome yeah thanks for uh thanks for sharing that link hey Andrew so Andrew joining us welcome glad you can make it inside the matrix says I've been listening in 90s rock such alternative on Pandora lately so many middleschool memories yeah we must be a brown the same age because that's I was in grade school in Middle School in the 90s as well so it's always it's always fun to listen to the old music and then just have all these memories come up Manny says it would be cool to link the timer to the Trello board and have it forcefully limit how much time you can spend on each feature I think it would increase productivity man he also says 90s for the best hey Manny I'm not I'm not sure if I've seen you post in the live chat before so I may be mistaken but if this is your first time posting then welcome and thanks for contributing here in the live chat yeah Manny that's like a really really good idea I'm not sure how I would accomplish that but I think that would be a really cool side project okay jonbi says hi hi again hey how's it going glad you could make it alright so let me go back I spent a lot more time so that the Pomodoro timer only really is effective if you if you pay attention to it and actually stop working or start working when you're supposed to that's a top tip for me you have to be disciplined about it alright so now we're back on our homepage we're getting the data that we need so now all we have to do is render that data in the right places so okay I was thinking that where's all their stuff that I forgot it's down the bottom because this is the alternate version of the homepage that will end up being the new version all right so this is where we're gonna put our the data from our quote so I need to figure out what the what the slug is for that so let me do that you find the slug pretty sure it as the word quote in it maybe it doesn't I have to bring up the the actual WordPress and bring it over let's see oh I didn't even call it quote I called it home black banner instead of quote banner so I guess that works yeah that it works because we're not we're not actually using a quote in there before it used to be a quote and now it's the mission statement so this yeah this actually does describe what it is so I'm assuming that that's the yeah that's the we need okay so we're gonna grab and we'll need to change this as well because we're not this is the the old information that was there okay so I know I was going to copy copy this to make it easier I should copy I have a similar section on the about page so I will copy the section that most closely matches it I think it's up up here here it is so I'm a copy and paste but then I'll go through what it does mmm this is actually a little bit different because we have this h3 but it is inside the block how are you gonna do this okay I think maybe we can do this so I'm gonna change it up a little bit so this is still gonna be we're still gonna have this blockquote like we do here but I want to have well actually is that why they're automatically make it a div I think I figured out why it wasn't formatting properly I didn't realize that it happened so that's cool I might have fixed this just by this and I won't have to worry about it again so let's check this out rearrange this because this will be good if this works now then that'll save me a bit of time anybody remember Lauryn Hill from the 90s just just had Lauryn Hill come along Spotify if you'd like to follow along with my playlist as well check out the throwback Thursday playlist on Spotify nice alright so that was the issue with the formatting so awesome so I inadvertently figured that out as always this is fun alright so let's I still need to do it alter this just a bit well I mean I need to make this home and inside of the block quote we're gonna have an h3 and the h3 is going to have the title wait no it won't because we have a title already we already have it site or the title is the home black banner okay so we can't do it like that but since WordPress already has a way to make things like an H tag without having to deal with the code then I'm okay with leaving it like that so I think we can safely just bring in everything including that that H tag and it should be pretty obvious to whoever is is updating it that it should work so I'm gonna copy this paste it in here and make sure see that's an h3 so it's already you know it's easy and WordPress to make that in h3 and let's check out the code really quickly so h3 I didn't realize when I copied it over it grabbed that I don't want that to stay that could cause problems I may have to double check and make sure that it didn't do it with other things as well okay so we'll update that so we can get there the correct data in there and then now we'll get rid of this block load and oops we need to make sure we close that I'm not worried about the formatting says we'll have once we once we commit this it will auto format it for us but it looks like something is making there we go the highlighting was just weird but I think that all right everything should work now so save that let's make sure okay so it's not bringing in everything let's check it out what happened did we not the update this maybe it was just it was probably keeping the that's really weird that was the old data right maybe it's just caching the old data let's see yeah for some reason that data is getting you still cashed maybe refresh maybe I need to log into WordPress again it looks like no I mean it looks fun that's all I'm not gonna worry about it I mean the data will update eventually usually it updates pretty quickly but anyway we'll check back in a few minutes the next thing is we can pull in some stuff from here and we may need to maybe to see I don't know if I'll need to copy and paste these myself or maybe Amy who handles the content can do this I think they'll probably be some additional things and so we'll see I'm gonna worry about it now but I do want to do the code to be able to pull these in so that they're not hardcoded okay cool um I was thinking I'd have to make a new component but it looks like I already made one so glad about that now I just check the live chat inside the matrix says the Fugees yes the the Fugees that's what I meant so I had I was listening to Lauryn Hill song but it probably was a Fuji song it's just Lauryn Hill does most of the singing let's see I just saw a couple of things in the live chat right now so I'm gonna check it really quick I'm gonna read it out really quick I can see if a few of you remember the Lauren Hill and Fuji song so yeah definitely good songs Jordan asked would it would I miss today we haven't really got that much done today we just kind of went over some of the fixes that I did for some things that were going wrong yesterday and we're just kind of gradually going through and taking a lot of this content that has kind of been hardcoded in and we're instead pulling it from the WordPress API because I would like as much of the site as possible to be editable in WordPress yes Ellie thanks for thanks for asking about the code editor it is Adam so I love it when people ask me about the editor the the theme is the steady theme SCT I also Ellie I don't think that I've seen you in the chat before so welcome sorry if this is not your first time and I just don't remember but welcome to the live chat Manny says sorry I'm late to the party here but did you scrape some content into the JSON I noticed that the quote had tags on the JSON object and I haven't seen that before yeah let me see let me make sure I know exactly what you're referring to let's see and I'm pretty sure you're referring about the JSON that we saw here and let's find it so are you talking about like the HTML tags that are showing up here in if that case if that is true then yeah we are we're getting this content out of WordPress the wordpress api and for the content fields you actually do get all the HTML that's included in those fields as well and it comes through with the json that's why we had to set it with dangerously set enter HTML because up here so that the tags actually rendered as HTML tags instead of just being printed out on the screen because we wouldn't want to see we wouldn't want to see those tags displayed on the screen we want them to be actually evaluated you know by the browser well Jeremy has got an interview tomorrow so it says thanks for the advice awesome really really happy for you so you'll have to let us know how the interview goes hope maybe if the interview is early enough tomorrow would you be able to let us know in tomorrow afternoon's livestream that would be really cool otherwise they can wait till next week but I'm excited so I want to know how it goes haha jonbi says one of these days you should just switch to a different editor just to mess with us actually I love so jahnvi I have an uncle who everybody calls him John be even like his kids call him call him John B or Johnny B sometimes so I I think every time I I see that name and say it there I always think of him all right so let's get back to this and we have a lot done already since we already have these cards made so all we need to do is put some data in there and we'll need C in this case we do we are gonna iterate over the column as well or we want to keep printing the column so we'll go at this point and let's see for a second I thought about doing a similar thing to what we had done on the resources page where you know we have all these different tabs and we're doing some pretty fancy stuff that I think it was fabian had submitted a pull request and did some cool stuff with the tabs and how that gets rendered out but since it's such a small amount of data I think we're fine just to actually render out the things for the for the tabs just right off the bat for both tabs so I think that should work and I don't think it warrants trying to pull in the code from the resources page and replicate what's going on there so for this one we're just going to just do really simply this for our data and we want to filter so everything needs to be filtered since we're pulling in these this big chunk of data that has multiple post types so the first filter we need to put on it is going to filter for the post type so we're gonna do post post type and we want the type that equals post and loose equals post and then after that we're going to do filter it further and we want the post that's gonna have the post a CF type of what is this one announcement and let me check let me check to make sure that that's the value we want yep announcement okay great and the other one is I think news right so our tights for getting announcement in news great okay so announcement and then after we've done that then we can map and go through everything so we're gonna post and for we're gonna grab all of this and on here we're gonna add a key and the key is gonna be our post ID whoops to put that in brackets if you're not familiar with react anything that you put in brackets inside your JSX which is basically this HTML looking stuff here that ends up it's JavaScript it's evaluated as JavaScript so that's why we're pulling in data and putting it in brackets like this okay so our title is going to be post oops title and our content our content is going to be post content rendered and actually I need to put render it up here too and the the reason these all have to be worded like this this is this is just how it comes out from the WordPress API and then for the URL it's going to be I think it's just I'm gonna double check that though all right so let's see oh we call it link now we didn't that's not it that would be the link for WordPress we don't want that link we want I hope we made a field for this because we need it otherwise you're gonna have to make one now mmm well that's no good I'm gonna doublecheck let's check out what it looks like in in WordPress so we have news if I see a description slug and we didn't put in anything for URL so let's make that post right now we'll make that that field no wait a second I remember why we didn't do it now okay because we want these to link to the actual blog post page originally some of them were gonna link to external resources but I don't think we want to do that now we want to we want this to work just like a regular blog so it's gonna link to a blog page alright so forget everything that I was just saying I've lost my mind for a second okay so wish that we're good so the URL then becomes let's see do we want to put this we don't really need the URL we need the slug let me check out the I want to check out this component just to see how what we're doing with that inside the component okay all right so then what we're gonna do is build the URL here and pass the complete URL in there because inside of here you know we're checking for a blank URL we're checking if so we're actually not gonna lame this is probably gonna be unnecessarily Vitt in here just for now just in case but it'll probably unnecessary to check for a blank link because the way we're gonna do it there's never gonna be a blank link but it's okay well no sense in like refactoring in the middle of this if I'm not a hundred percent sure that I'm not gonna use that so for this URL I want to make it I'm gonna use a template literal and I'm gonna say slash news and then so I can go back into JavaScript inside my template literal we need to put a dollar sign and then curly brackets and so now we can put JavaScript in and then I'm gonna say post slug and that's gonna put together that that URL will work because we're using parameterised routing for anything that's on the route of news so it'll just pass the slug along to our template for news which is our single news page template and then it'll use that here it will pass it along as ID so this is really the slug it will use the slug here to make the API call to get just the data that it needs for that particular post so we're good alright so we should be able to save that and I can delete the rest of these and I got a Hootie and the Blowfish is playing right now I totally forgot about them I used to really like Hootie and the Blowfish when I was in grade school we can also copy this now and with only one change use it down here and all what i have to change is this filter and then we can get rid of this and let's save it and refresh restart my search it's getting worse it used to be that I could code for a while without having to restart my dev server and now it's like very frequently oh man my timer ran out I didn't even notice it all right well I guess I'll start the showed up again with the break let's go down here whoa I'll shoot I had thought about that and then I forgot so this I'm actually kind of glad this has happened so this is what happens if you don't dangerous yet enter HTML when you're grabbing stuff from WordPress content the tags actually show up so you can see them there and you can see here the tags are showing up the good thing is what we did worked and it is in fact filtering things into the right spot and also good news is we know exactly how to fix this so let's do that now so we need to go into our text card before since we were manually typing in a string of what we wanted these to be I had never bothered with setting the inner HTML and probably lazily because I always knew this was eventually gonna be populated with other data so I should have just done it before but now we can just grab I'll just grab this I don't even have to type it out again so for the title and the description we want to do this for both of them so I'm gonna put this on the title and on the description and we're gonna change this to this drops title and we're gonna change this one this crops do we call it content I just want to doublecheck yes we did call it content here this props content okay now we can remove this okay we can remove this and let's save it just to make sure it works whoa all right this is I forgot that okay so here's what's happening here in this post I went to pages sorry in this post there's an image I had done this earlier when I was meeting with with Amy who does the content just to show her how to put an image in and I've forgotten about it but what we want to do is we actually don't want that image to show up so here's what I think I think we only want the excerpt to show up here we don't want the full text because it could be really big like this already extends out so let's let's change this so what we want to do we only have to change it here post excerpt and now let's check out wait a second let me check the check this I didn't think the excerpt kept images Oh actually no I don't think I want to keep the excerpt because it adds in this more this more link I don't want that and I know I can change this and the function is a PHP file but I don't want to go through all that so all right I'm gonna go since I had already used up most of my five minutes that I was gonna spend on a live chat I'm gonna go to lunch at now that will give us a minute to think about the best way to address this basically the problem is I don't have enough space here here to put everything so I need a way to just get some of the data also I need to strip out any images because I don't want images in here the simplest way seemed to be to get the excerpt from WordPress instead of the entire content but that's not gonna work because of the more tag so potentially I could use that and then just strip out the more tag either on this end with JavaScript or on the wordpress end with PHP so I'm gonna go back to the live chat and talk for a little bit with you all when we can all think about what the best way to do that is okay I did get a Sarah asked if I'd tried Visual Studio code yeah I have tried Visual Studio code I was using it actually used it on some of my earliest live streams so the ones I did on my own channel before I got invited to stream for free code camp I was using visual studio code on some of those so if you actually want to see me using Visual Studio code go check out some of my my first live streams the I will warn you though the first couple of streams are a little bit rough because the quality I didn't I didn't really have the hang of using OBS yet to do my streaming so the quality is not great and there were some streams where I had no one watching so it's just me talking no interaction with anyone but you will get to see me use Visual Studio code so I think the project I'll be working on after I switched from this one which will be like at the end of next week I think I'm gonna switch back to the project that was working on so I'll probably be switching back to Visual Studio code the reason I use Visual Studio code for that project is because a lot of it is written in csharp and when I tried to load csharp and Adam it didn't automatically highlight things for me but when I loaded it in Visual Studio code it did highlight things really nicely so instead of getting the right plugin for Adam I just used Visual Studio code because that was that was faster and I had been looking for an excuse to try it out anyway and so it was good I I liked it I'm not ready to switch from Adam but I do like it a new path says hi hey how's it going Ali says hi Sabir says hi hey everyone thanks for joining in wow this would already it's already 6 o'clock Wow hey I just checked my phone so a man at 6 o'clock I wonder for my wife's tried to call me she did not try to call me but she did ask me in the text do you know what happened to the sweet Italian sausages and no I don't know what happened to them I hope the dog didn't eat them we recently got a dog against my against my will we got a dog and basically I didn't want a dog because there are a lot of work and I knew that I would probably be doing a lot of the work and I knew that I would fall in love with the dog and there was a good chance that we wouldn't be able to keep the dog because the last time my wife wanted a dog it didn't get along with the kids and so we had to get rid of it it broke my heart so I didn't want my heart broken again but she brought on this dog and the dog loves me sorry for the little tangent but there was no questions in the live chat so I thought I'd just say it so the dog loves me and wants to be around me all the time and the dog hated my wife which was kind of funny because she's the one that really wanted a dog so the dog I mean literally that that if the dog was eating and my wife walked into the room the dog would leave the room wait for my wife to leave and then come back in and resume eating so I did feel bad for my wife because she really wanted that dog so the dog in my wife now get along but now my wife thinks that she's allergic to the dog so I think we're gonna end up getting rid of the dog I feel really bad for the dog because it just changed homes to us and now it's gonna change again and so anyway and then I'm gonna miss the dog so anyway the whole reason I even get onto that is the dog's been eating food off the table so if one of the kids has like a hamburger or something and leaves it on the table and goes in the other room when they come back in the room the hamburger is missing and the plate is clean it's because the dog eats eats all their stuff so now I'm gonna check the live chat really quick and then I'll get back to to what we were doing we'll figure out a solution to our little problem as youngbae said yeah blame it on the dog Jesse it's true I didn't he I only ate one sausage I didn't eat all of them Wow Sebastian scissors after midnight where you were you from Sebastian you probably told me before and I just don't remember alright okay I did have some other questions come in the live chat while I was telling a story about my dog so Jambi yes how long did it take you to learn react and basically anything I really didn't pay that much attention to react until last May so I went to a conference last May and everybody was talking about react and so that's what I really like seriously started thinking like that I need to learn about react because it looks cool I had like I had heard of react before then but my attitude was kind of like oh man another JavaScript framework like well we'll see we'll see if this one is sticks around you know because there's so many frameworks right so basically it's been about a year I haven't I didn't really try to build anything in react until probably like January or May so it wasn't until this year that I actually tried to build something in react I had done some tutorials in react before so I had watched some video tutorials I did the Khan Academy a tutorial for react but I hadn't really successfully built anything until until this this year so sometime in in the early months of 2017 I started like seriously starting to build things and learn more about react so I the first react site that I ever launched like for a client I launched it on April 1st of 2017 so that was my first successful site and so it hasn't really been that long it's kind of surprising now that I think about it that I've I'm building site so when I say like that I really had consider myself to be very new and still learning react like really it hasn't that long so I'm definitely not an expert at it Oh Jeremy's got a see you later Jeremy Jeremy says it's got to go thanks for the videos I'll let you know how my interview goes tomorrow if I catch it all right awesome yeah definitely want to hear about the interview good luck with that and yeah and thanks thanks for watching let me check I'm going to take a few more questions well Sebastian said you can add an excerpt field in WordPress so whoever adds the post can add a little excerpt with no image and then use the real post for the blog post yeah I can oh I'm gonna think about that I got to think I'm not sure if I want I can see pros and cons to that so definitely it would be cool for the content editors to be able to say exactly what they won on the front but it would also be a little bit of extra work I guess they could just copy and paste like the first paragraph if they really wanted to so we'll see maybe maybe although that is I kind of like that I do you know and I think about it more that might be the best solution here sirsir guala says it's five where I'm located cool does that mean like 500 a.m. or 500 p.m. if it's 5 p.m. then you're probably pretty close to my timezone if it's 5 a.m. then you you're probably on the other side of the world I encourage says it's 330 500 a.m. here in India okay cool yeah I mean I usually remember what time it is in India because I've had who is it Rohan always tells me what time it is in India so Rohan must have been asleep for this one usually he stays up to like 200 a.m. India time and I don't know how he does it and on couch how are you up at 335 a.m. watching this I'm glad I'm glad you're watching this thanks for watching but that's crazy all right Sebastian has a cat sitting on his lap right at the moment it's really hot in the house and the hairy cat is not helping yeah is it you know like pets pets and kids always want to like be right next to you when it's hot and like my son my oldest son Raphael like when I go to put him to sleep at night like he'll cuddle up next to me and we'll read a book or something and he'll say like oh I'm so hot and I'm like dude just like you're you're like on top of me you know you can't just scoot over a little bit it's not that I don't you know I don't want to cuddle with him but it's like doesn't help if the body heat is being shared okay Sebastian you're Spain all right awesome oh it's about Sebastian Asif if I saw what he said about what I asked yeah uh obviously I saw that now so I think that is a good idea and I'm probably gonna go with that dyad asks what do you think about the UJS I haven't used UJ s and I haven't learned enough about it to have a good opinion on it so I'm not gonna try to give you an answer that I would just make up what I will say is that I've seen a lot of people talk about it on Twitter so I mean it seems legit just from like the amount of buzz this getting and amount of hype on Twitter and the people that are like legitimate programmers who are using it and saying it's good so I can't say firsthand anything about it but it does seem like it's a legitimate alternative framework Andrew said I started at work to make an admin dashboard and react and react router and fell in love with it that's awesome I'd like to see that I don't know if you're able to share that share a coder there any anything with that or a link but that would be really cool to see Andrew John B says I gotta head out myself to hope you all have a good day have a good day Jesse and see you again sometime soon all right see you John B probably already left so I didn't read that fast enough but in case you're still here see you thanks for joining and contributing in a live chat really appreciate that on couche says I just came in what's the problem we were having okay so here's the problem he came in so basically you can see on the screen it's pulling in I'm pulling in some data but it's pulling in like an image and stuff and I don't want that I basically just want a little bit of text like the first bit of text so I think the solution we're gonna do is I'm gonna make another field for this post so I'll have another field probably up here down here somewhere that's just going to be for the the excerpt right so the content editor is going to type in just a little bit and that's here here and then the real content will appear after you click it will take you to another page and show it all Alberto says without giving it too much thought add a style for the card image to display none yeah actually that's a really good idea that would that would solve the image thing it still wouldn't solve the problem of trying to pool like all the the content but that's a really good idea for like a simple fix okay let me get back to this now that we've we've kind of decided on a solution let's do this I'm gonna make I know that there's an excerpt field that you can add that's like kind of by default comes in WordPress but I'm not going to use that one because I don't know I don't think that'll automatically strip out the tags and I want all the tags stripped out for this part because I don't want people putting like an unordered list or something crazy in here that's gonna throw off my formatting so I'm gonna use the custom fields plugin to make a field I already have the posts field and I'm just gonna add excerpt and the other cool thing I can do with this is that I can put explanatory text so let me make this a text area and I can also limit the characters so let me think how many characters would probably fit there there's anybody good with estimating characters so I wanted to fill up I mean it can go all the way down to here but I don't want it any any more so I wonder if I have all right this is about 30 characters across okay so 300 I'm gonna set a three hundred character limit because it's about 30 characters across and I'm pretty sure I could get at least ten lines on here so 30 or 300 character limit and for the formatting I'm gonna say no formatting so it's not gonna pull in any of the HTML tags for the instructions I'm gonna say give a little bit of instruction and it's just going to be required yes this will be required we need this otherwise we'll get nothing on here and that that'll be no good so not all the posts will appear here I'm just gonna grab the newest post so I won't actually need this for all of them but at some point probably every post will appear here unless unless like more than four posts get added all at the same time all right I'm gonna double check make sure I filled everything in and all right that looks good so let's update and I'm gonna go back to posts and I'm just gonna fill in some of this data so we have something excerpt and I'm gonna grab some lorem ipsum text or maybe I use bacon if some yesterday of the day before what's your favorite lorem ipsum generator I know I've seen a generator for samuel l.jackson it's just like Samuel Epson we could try to use that there's like a there's a generator that uses all like the bad language versions of it and then I think there's another one that just has the quotes that that don't have bad language in it so I think we'll use the stuff without the bad language I I gotta read the quotes first since I'm not you know this is a site for the University I sure don't put it anything crazy up here but this is a quote I think from the movie unbreakable I believe so this will this should work I do want to test out okay so cool so this did work so we have we stopped at 300 characters so that would definitely work out to give us an idea of how much the 300 characters are so let me update this and I need to update our code because we're grabbing the excerpts from the ACF field now and we might end up getting an error I'm just going to try but we'll probably end up getting an error because this field is not going to exist for the some of the posts right now we save not actually safe I just need to restart the dev server hmm well actually this is odd we're still if you notice like this is still the old data and nothing is nothing is updating I don't like that that's really weird wow this is so I haven't blocked this off so that it doesn't display anything this is what the site would look like it's not too bad but it's still showing okay now that is the right data that is still showing why is it not pulling in what we just did right content imposed a CFX oh yeah what's going on that's weird oops I was looking for content I meant excerpt here we go ACF excerpts all right so it's here we see it here okay so what's going on here yeah I'm thinking maybe it is the cash so Sebastian just said cash but the other thing is like I'm not there shouldn't be any cash when I'm running the dev server so I have it set so that the the cash is like one second or something so that shouldn't be the issue and then I haven't set up a cash for the WordPress API and obviously like we're getting the new data in the API as well actually I want to add a new post to okay so you check that out so we got this so it's not an API caching thing but potentially like I guess it could be trying to pull in most ACS excellent are we caching you check my server Dutch AS VAL to make sure i'm not cashing anyone so yeah so it should be yeah so the cache time it looks like I've set it to 100 milliseconds yeah so that that looks like it's set up fine okay so let's open up getting some requests to open up dev tools let's see I think I have it automatically set to disable the cache if dev tools are open so let's see if that fixed it just from being open no but it did freeze my desk for her again alright so we'll start that up again with dev tools open this is one of those unexpected slowdowns that I was worried about let me make sure that I have the cash disabled I can't remember where that what that is anybody remember where that option is in dev tools should I read through all the ones make sure I'm not missing it maybe it's somewhere else let me check oh that's in the network tab okay sorry I wasn't looking over there yeah okay cool I did have disabled cash checks I thought I always did keep that off it's such a huge here's what's weird to me so we've definitely now I know what happened man if you haven't already figured it out oh I feel so silly now okay so we only changed it here right our this is behaving exactly as we told it to behave because it's still being told to pull the content rendered for the announcements oh man see this there we go that's what we need all right that's it and that's pretty much perfect as far as the length goes we could increase it a bit so I can maybe go like three owner we could probably fit another line in there I don't want it to look too crowded at the bottom so maybe I can go like two 320 characters who ever really wanted to but I don't think that's a big deal we'll see if that's really something that's necessary I can increase it a bit okay so so this works and actually the cool thing is I wasn't getting errors I was I was thinking I may get an error because that field wouldn't exist at all in ACF but it seems like we're not getting the error at least it's not causing it man these things are coming from looks like we're not giving something in it a key somewhere so we need to figure out what's not getting the key and they say Oh since you won 34 in the blockquote that's weird because we're we're only pulling one thing maybe it still wants a key even though it's one thing so we give that a key these are caused by the YouTube embed so the YouTube embed seems to be working so I guess I'm not gonna worry about these is there any special thing that needs to happen with YouTube embeds and react that's gonna mess up the site if so you know about it please let me know otherwise I'll just kind of let it go and make sure that I test out that homepage on different browsers so let's put in the key and wish do like we've been doing and say post id loose post id and we can check to make sure I guess I didn't refresh great okay so we don't have that error anymore oh so let's I'm just going to go ahead so we've been working on this for a while and how long were you doing this I have at least done probably four Pomodoro sessions so far I've been streaming for what like two hours I want to say at least three or four I'm gonna say I've done three more sessions so I'm gonna bump that up to six because I have done some a little bit of talking so three sessions I'm glad that I estimated it at 13 because I'll probably need most of that time although we as we run into and figure out you know some of these issues it'll make each successive page a bit easier but anyway a home page just looking at looking decent now so this is everything that we wanted to do for the home page well with the exception of this what the heck is going on with this let's double check let's check this again for some reason oh you know what why is this a quote let's change this so I think I put I think I took out the normal editor and I put in this custom field here and that's probably what's messing things up because the original data probably had this in it and nothing else yeah so that's what's go into our custom fields and yep home barriner fields and we had the quote in alright so let's let's just get rid of that because I don't think we need yeah we don't need that this should work without it better to just simplify it if we don't need it now let's go back to the pages we'll see what's going on and if I'm correct yep there we go so once again it's doing exactly what we told it to do I was just confused about what I was telling it to do so let me grab what I have it I still have the development server open which does have the text that I want so I'll grab it from there here and then let's make sure yeah I want to get rid of that data JSX cuz that'll mess things up and update now we'll be able to see what it really looks like and if it's it's gonna look how we want it to look man this dev server is like stopping so often it might be faster to just not have hot module reloading and manually refresh the page alright cool so this is working this is how we wanted it to look awesome so that's the home page done and I forgot to start up my my timer again no let's I'm gonna commit this check out the status okay so we've edited what do we do the about I don't remember what we did to the about page it's probably just some sort of Auto formatting thing that that happened so I'm not gonna worry about it Oh enough to remember to push all these changes to the the dev server so you all can see this I'll try to remember to do that before I leave today okay so we've got the home page getting the data that we want from the API I'm gonna check the live chat and then I'm have to decide whether I want to keep working or go home since it's after 630 p.m. my time so it's definitely beyond the point at which I normally go home I've been here since 930 a.m. and I worked through my lunch break alright so I'm gonna scroll up a bit so you see what I missed okay Sara showed there's a Bible Epsom Oh seriously that that would actually be perfect for this site I'm gonna look that up on my other screen that would be way more appropriate than Samuel Jackson Epsom for this site like I wouldn't mind it for like a side project but oh really cool awesome all right cool I'm definitely gonna use the Bible if some now when I need lorem ipsum text the rest of the site I think the people who are in charge of catechetical Institute would appreciate that much more than the samuel l.jackson or even the bacon ipsum as awesome as that is okay it looks like some of you were asking about like to see things in dev tools and stuff but I think that was in reference to the problem we're having and sorted that all out it was basically just my fault and not changing what I needed to change so birdperson asked and this was maybe 20 minutes ago so sorry for getting back to you a little later but very person as Jesse can you advise starting point to study react what you read watch Thanks so my advice would be to watch just to get an idea of like the the whole philosophy behind react there's some videos you can watch from like the react conf like Facebook's react conference what do they call is it just called react conf I can't remember now but if you check out the react like the Facebook developers YouTube or something I can't remember what it is now what the YouTube channel is for sure but check out like some of the keynote addresses where they explain the reasoning behind it that's kind of cool you don't need to know that to know react but it's kind of cool to get in the mindset of like why why even make another framework you know what's this for so that's kind of cool some of the talks will be like way over your head some of the socks are still over my head so you know probably don't need to watch them all there's some stuff about react on will stern has a YouTube channel called learn code Academy I think that's that's what is called so he has some react stuff that's good the videos are a little bit older but they still work for an introduction to react the react documentation on like the official react website is pretty good code Academy has like an inbrowser react tutorial that you can go through this kind of nice because you don't need to know how to set up any development environments so that will be helpful and I think what else free code camp I haven't checked out the react section in a while I'm not sure that the react section is actually finished for like the the official courses right now the official challenges but the beta version of the challenges I think has more react stuff in it I I haven't checked that in a while so I can't say for sure so that those resources are what I would probably check out I think you could probably get some idea of what's going on and react from some of my past streams but my streams aren't exactly like a tutorial so that might be useful like if you were working on something else and just wanted to play it in the background and just like watch when something was happening that was useful that might be it might be helpful to you otherwise like it wouldn't be really efficient to try to watch my streams to actually learn anything because there's so much other stuff going on that it's not focused enough so you'll you will probably learn stuff but it'll be all over the place most of the time and the streams are brief can be really long so anyway I hope at least some of those resources are helpful to you and all right also I recommend starting out with something like an XJS or create react app just to help you get started building something oh also too if if you if you have money to spend on trying to learn react Udacity has a good react course they just started and I'm I'm taking the course right now and I've been impressed with it so far but the course is 500 dollars like so like in US dollars it's 500 dollars so not sure you know how much you want to spend on react but that that course has been good so far from me let's see okay it looks like Andrew sent an image I'm assuming this is of the admin panel that you made in react we'll find out in a second I'm going to open up on my other screen here and just say oops I say I think I put left this space in there there we go that's weird so anyway Andrew I tried to check out that image and it's it's giving me the error the error page for imager so Sara said in response to bird person's question about react the try level up tux or level up I'm not sure how you pronounce it it's level up to UTS which is supposed to be short for tutorials but I always look at it and want to say level up tuts and so I'm not sure how are you supposed to pronounce it yeah okay thanks everyone for trying to try to help out with the air I was having I can see now on the chat that you were all kind of asking about it but sorry about the silly mistake on my part okay so Patrick had a link that looks like it's gonna be useful so I'm gonna open this on my other screen real quick and if maybe I'll pull it over under my main screen so I get why they don't let you put links in the live chat but it ends up being annoying to have to copy and paste them and then take out the spaces and stuff so anyway this is the resource that patrick has just put in the live chat for learning react so this is the react redux length on github so it looks like it has a lot of nice stuff for getting started tutorials so nice that's that's this looks really good Patrick so thanks for this so this should be helpful to anyone it looks like to anyone starting out or at any level of trying to learn react this is really cool I'm definitely gonna star this hey I already started cool does that ever happen anyone else you find this really awesome github repo and then you go to start and you realize that you've already started at some point I need to go back and look through this stuff I've starred I'm sure I'll find useful stuff there that I've completely forgotten about but this one looks good it looks like it's it's kept up to date like I mean look this two days ago it was updated so that's cool sometimes you see nice lists like this but they're a little outdated but this one is kept up so thanks Patrick okay Sara also says for in terms of react courses also if you don't mind paying try West boss calm so yeah I've never taken any courses from there I've seen maybe on Twitter i'm not i don't remember where I've seen it maybe an advertisement or something for that so but I can't really say personally anything about it because I haven't haven't taken any any courses okay Sebastian says if you use map you need a key so since I used earlier I was getting the air that I needed a key but it was even it was on this block quote and I'm only pulling one thing for the block but quote but since I was using map I still needed the key which that makes sense I don't mind putting the key on there that will help me get used to putting the key in there all the time which I frequently forget to do so maybe if I make myself do it enough times I'll remember it Sebastien says by the way you get the solution to the warning in the warning itself yeah I know usually react is really good about providing really useful warnings thanks you wanna check that out now and actually didn't read this frameborder oh that's why thanks for saying that Sebastian because now I realized that I should have just read this oh man okay so let's just fix this right now I feel so so silly right now that I didn't just take three seconds to actually read that warning so basically in react it wants me to camelcase this let me see what's this when it wants allowfullscreen okay wants me to camelcase these I gotten lazy with this stuff because I have a NPM module that actually lets me use like class instead of class name and things like that but I guess it doesn't convert stuff like this let's see yeah it looks like I think this is new stuff here so it looks like it went away I I do want to double check just want to see that nice clean clean screen there yeah all right check it out now we only have I should get rid of this console log and this console ugh I'm gonna do that right now cuz otherwise I'll forget I think that's in analytic that's both in the analytics okay so I don't need this and I don't need this that now we're those the heirs all right those are the areas that I get when my my dev server fails all right so next time I see those errors I'm not just gonna get rid of them actually gonna read them and try to figure out what is going on but at least I won't it won't be quite so cluttered now that I've gotten rid of some of the logs okay Patrick says +14 west boss he's awesome okay so maybe that that resources we got two people in the live chat now recommending that resource so maybe I'll have to check it out I don't have time to take on another course right now since I'm already doing one well I'm already doing free code camp and Udacity on top of my other work and taking care of all my kids so maybe when I finish up with one of the things then I can do check out west boss how's the pricing on that is it like really expensive or you know compared to a lot of other courses okay Andrews asking about the Pomodoro Technique and the stuff in Trello I explained it like in more depth early in the stream so if you can check out the recording like you'll get a better explanation but basically the numbers in Trello or the number of Pomodoro sessions that each task takes so a Pomodoro session is 25 minutes so every 25 minutes I take a fiveminute break after four sessions I take a 10minute break it helps break up the work and it helps to more accurately estimate the time the tasks take so the the dark numbers in Trello or how many Pomodoro sessions I think it's going to take and the lighter numbers are how many it actually took me to do I see now that Sara already answered Andrews it's thanks there sorry I didn't see that I was anyway those those two cadets and Patrick answered as well to man ten as what software are you using for your dev server basically it's just like it's web pack but it I don't have to customize it myself because next Jas is automatically running it so that's part of the reason why I haven't even dug into the issue because I I didn't need to set it up myself so I know like I'm gonna have to learn how it was set up before I can even try to fix it so but basically it is web pack though Sebastian says I think you have some more posts with data JSX I think you're right because I was copy and pasting earlier in the day and I didn't remove that so I'm gonna have to go back and doublecheck everything well Andrew says in my country for West bust courses I get a 52% discount that's sweet wit what country are you from Andrew you probably told me before so sorry I don't I don't remember but we'll see if you if that 52% is a big discount it might be worth moving for I'm just joking it probably wouldn't be but maybe if you're gonna take enough courses Manny says have you tried fetching from Component did mount and saving your data in your app state object yeah I actually do that on some of the pages some of the components but the thing is with with next J s you if you want it to be able to render serverside you have to fetch the data from in here from get initial props so what I do if I want to put it into state is I end up in component did mount transferring the data into state so I still grab it here and it still goes to props first and then it goes into state and then I can you know manipulate the data use it after at that point so on this page I really don't have any need to save it the state because I'm not like I don't ever need to change it to make things rerender or happen so but on on some pages like the resource page I do I am doing that but it still I still grab everything initially with this get initial props just for the sake of the serverside rendering okay Manny says you Demi's modern react and redux is very awesome for starting out a very awesome course so albury person says thank you Jesse for the advice you're welcome I hope some of it is helpful to you and make sure like if you can come back some other live chats and let us know like how it's going and what resources you found helpful I think that would be awesome it'd be helpful for me and I'm sure would probably be helpful for some other people that are that are watching Manny says learn a lot from you awesome I'm glad I'm but glad that I could be helpful a lot of times I feel like I'm not really being helpful to you all you are teaching me a lot so it's nice when sometimes I I'm doing the teaching a little bit all right so Andrew posted the link again yeah me maybe I thought I got rid of all the spaces let me try it again yeah it did work I must have just left the space in there and didn't realize it oh very cool that's really cool Andrew I'm checking out on my other screen I don't know if you want me to show it to everybody in the live stream or not so that's why I open it on the other stream or the other screen that's really cool I like that yeah so if if anyone is sharing any of their own work by default I will just open it on another screen in case you don't want everybody to be able to see it in the stream you know and in the recording but if you don't mind that just let me know when you give me the link and then I can as long as it's appropriate if nobody's ever tried to share anything inappropriate but as long as it's appropriate I'll put it up there that's also another reason why I open it on a separate screen just on on the off chance that someone would happen to post something inappropriate actually that link the Heroku link is it's not working for me it's saying access denied for me why is it saying what are Y saying asketh access denied when I try to put the link in okay I see you posted another link a little a little bit after okay ceressus 72 and 98 so I assume that's in response to my question about the pricing for for West boss and Manny also recommends West boss okay that's not too bad actually oh yeah that's a decent price so 72 dollars 98 so it seems like West boss is the way to go I might even have to check that out I mean like I said I there's no way I could do another course right now but I'll keep that in mind for the future okay Andrew says Moldova cool so you're from so I have three three of my wife's cousins were adopted from Moldova so that's what I remember when they were adopted they were just really little and could barely speak English or anything and I remember visiting with my wife's and uncle and they live they live in a different state so went down there and stayed with them for like a week and helped out with the kids and everything it was cool when now the kids are like they're teenagers so it makes me feel old but anyway that's cool and I I get I know people from Moldova okay rich Rishabh I'm not sure I pronounce a so sorry but rich a vas hey I just came to this live video I want to know how we can link with react I want to know that suit actually says so in this video I'm actually linking WordPress with react through the WordPress API so I'm not dealing with a database directly there's like the WordPress API is sitting between the database and it's a different kind so I mean WordPress uses a sequel database which is definitely different than so at some point it's likely that I will do something that uses a database with react but I can't I can't guarantee when that project will happen so so I can't answer your question right now unfortunately but I hope that in the future I can do more streams with with and react okay see you later mani mandis gotta head out thanks thanks for watching I know you're contributing in the latch at Patrick says in response to the question about DB says I would expect you would want to write a backend service in something like no tour Express to provide endpoints for interacting with MongoDB yeah that's actually that's a really good answer so I mean that would be you know that wanting in specifics of how you do that that I mean that would be the way to go you obviously you wouldn't be reacting like you wouldn't be going directly from reacts like clientside directly to a database most likely you would have some sort of I get would you call that a middleware I don't know but but your backend node Express would be interacting with the database and then sending that so yes Sebastian says sorry about the language change Sebastian just started talking in another language in the live chat or typing in another language birdperson says thank you very much Jessy I was glad to spent this time with FCC campers jordan says shouldn't you be going home Jessie yeah I should I was just thinking the same thing so anyway you're welcome birdperson so yeah I'm glad you spent time with us as well so yeah anyway I think I am gonna wrap it up cuz it's 700 and I need to go home and put my kids to sleep so yeah so I kinda hope to get a little bit more done but unfortunately I did have some silly issues that came up and we're entirely just my fault for not paying attention more closely to my code so I need to commit those last couple changes we made to get rid of the errors and that's about it I'm going to commit that I'm going to push everything up to the dev server and I might check the dev server to make sure it does it quits just shutting down and then that way at least it'll be open to anyone who wants to see it and then I'll I'll be here tomorrow morning and I'll do some more work and I'll see you all tomorrow I'm pretty sure that I can do the stream at the normal time tomorrow I have a meeting with a potential client at 500 p.m. so it won't be a super long stream but I could probably do like an hour hour and a half stream and still have enough time to make it to the meeting so anyway it was it was cool I'm glad I got to do this and death see some different people probably because of the different you know time that I strained that so tomorrow it'll be at the normal time most likely 2 p.m. Eastern time thank you so much everyone for watching and for helping out and in the live chat is really awesome and really cool just working on this project you you all have been like kind of with this project for the whole time you know pretty much from the beginning so this is very much like I think our project together and it's really cool so I can't wait to like be done with it and move on but then you know have this entire project from start to finish like all livestreamed I think that's that's gonna be really cool so anyway good night everybody at least in my timezone good night and have a great night I'll see y'all tomorrow
