welcome back to the free Coke Camp podcast I'm Quincy lar teacher and founder of free Coke camp and each week we bring you Insight from developers Founders and ambitious people getting into Tech this week we're talking with Phoebe vong Fidel she is a proud mother of two kids and at the age of 36 as a stayathome mom she learned to code and she got her first job as a developer Phoebe welcome to the show thank you for having me yeah and uh real quick I just want to do a quick shout out to to the many supporters we have in the free Cod Camp Community we have more than 8,45 supporters who donate each month to Freo Camp to support our charity and by extension support the Freo Camp podcast and of course Phoebe you are one of those people who supported Freo Camp um and we greatly appreciate it you're welcome yeah well Phoebe uh we're going to get into your career transition and the many really insightful articles you've written for free Cod Camp about your journey and also your review of like Harvard cs50 and like all the new stuff you're learning as far as like machine learning and things like that continuing to refine your skills but I want to start by just going way back to your childhood and the origin story of phoe vong Fel sure sure um so I was born in the UK but um my parents were refugees from Vietnam well actually they were um their parents so my grandparents actually uh moved to Vietnam to escape the troubles in in China so both my parents were born in Vietnam and then the uh the war in Vietnam happened so then they were refugees from Vietnam to the UK um so uh my brother and my sister were uh with them at the time and my other brother U my mom was pregnant with with him at the time when she was um making her way over to the UK um so and then I was born a few years later in uh in Cambridge so yeah so that's where my family's all from so like two successive generations of refugees essentially yes yeah yeah and it's difficult for me to imagine like uh what that was like maybe you can give some insight just growing up in the UK um knowing that that toward family history knowing that you're like Riven from two different countries essentially like yeah yeah it was it was um it was really hard my parents um they came to the country with literally nothing um they were given like a a house by the local Council and it's literally like5 pounds and didn't speak a word of English so they took a big risk but they knew that they needed to escape what was going on in Vietnam so they they thought need to do that for the family um and when they sort of first arrived it was just you know survival really so they would do cleaning jobs my dad trained up as a chef um my mom would um sort of parttime work in the evenings and wherever she could get and my dad took English classes and they kind of just sort of gradually adapted to life in the UK um and you know I think they worked really hard as well and then eventually they start their own business cuz my dad was train as a chef and that's when things kind of got a lot better for my parents once they kind of established their own business and they they established what in the UK it's called a takeaway when in the US it's called like takeout restaurant um indeed yeah so they they uh set up a Chinese Takeaway in uh Gloucester so we moved from in from Cambridge to Gloucester and yeah so it was really hard work I mean it was originally a fish and chip shop and they started selling fish and chips kind of just to adjust to the business first and it wasn't doing too well I think you know um so my dad said okay I'm just going to start selling Chinese food so he adapted the kitchen um managed to kind of get a loan from the bank to do that um and yeah and it was just it was really hard in the early years they were open seven days a week really long hours and sociable hours um so we hardly ever saw a parents um but we knew that you know we understood why they were doing what they were doing and uh yeah know then eventually the business picked up and it became one it's probably one of the most popular takeaways in glester so it's been there for since 1990 um it's still going my brother runs the takeway now so my parents are both retired yeah yeah yeah and you at an early age you worked as a takeaway kid you sent me this BBC documentary which I'll link to yeah uh in the show notes for anybody who wants to to watch it uh about kids who grw up working in their restaurants exactly it's very common for the kids to help out because our English is a lot better than our parents so we would sort of be in the front house like taking the orders taking the money taking the phone calls so I started working Prof back at the age of 12 helping out and you know sort of doing things like in the kitchen washing up and like you know chopping a few vegetables here and there but then when I got AIT little bit older I would serve in the front I was kind of in the front and in the kitchen as well so and you know I would be doing homework when it was quiet at the till um reading books and stuff so yeah it was kind of like juggling working and helping parents with homework yeah it's pretty much my life yeah and would you say like your family was like did they emphasize academics um did they did they have like aspirations of you going to University yeah I mean they what they want to do was to ensure that we didn't have to worry about money and um they always said you know encouraged us to to study and just you know study really hard try and get to University I mean my my mom didn't go to school Beyond like her teenage years um there wasn't much opportunity for her my dad was like the equivalent I suppose of like you know High School um so they didn't have much qualification so they kind of encouraged us to to you know take a advantage of being in the UK you know education will take us anywhere that's what they always used to tell us yeah um and yeah we just tried to I mean all of us tried to fulfill that um three out of four of us went to University um my brother has a PHD so you know I think academically we all did pretty well so yeah and and uh you got into of course the very prestigious London School of economics and uh did yeah I mean was was it was it challenging to get into to that score yeah it's quite competitive um yeah I mean like it's one of those Russ I think it's part we call it Russell group and you know I suppose the equivalent in the US would be the IV League um so yeah I mean I remember putting a lot of work into my personal statement I did a lot of extracurricular activities I was part of like a um youth group with the council and I did like lots of like charity events so yeah I mean was kind of a lot of yeah I put a lot of effort in the studying alone I studied so hard for my a level so yeah it was yeah it was a lot yeah and the A Levels just for context for us like for an American I don't know what the a levels are is that okay so yeah I think it's a bit different because I think you you have high school and then you kind of have quite a general education in the US so you don't specialize and I think in the UK we have gsc's which is uh when we're 15 16 and then we do like a broad range of subjects science math English French Etc and then when it comes to a levels you specialize uh I did three subjects plus General Studies some people do now five subjects but it's very specialized from a very young age so I did English History and politics so very traditional kind of Arts sort of type subjects um and yeah and it's just based on those grades really from the three subjects that we do yeah so you had to make decisions about what you wanted to do from a very early age like even earlier in the US like the the real I think inflection point for a lot of people who are able to go to college is they'll you be like two years in and that's like really the last time you get in college to like change Majors before you have to do substantial additional cour work and potentially spend an extra year at school and that would like if you're a traditional student and you haven't you know done anything uh to derail your progression through like high school University everything uh that would be probably around age 20 21 where you'd have to kind of like decide okay this is what I'm goingon to do but it sounds like in the UK you have to do it a lot earlier yeah and it's it's it's it's quite daunting really because you know you're 16 and you can't actually probably have to do be 15 because you need to actually apply to do the A Levels before you get your results so you you kind of I mean I didn't know what I want to do when I was 15 so all I did was the subjects I enjoyed so I followed that kind of logic I guess I said what am I good at what do I enjoy and at the time it was mostly English in history so yeah that's what I followed yeah and what was that like studying those things like I I guess what did you learn uh during University that were you really interested in it did your interest in it fade at any point or are you still really interested in those subjects yeah I mean I'm still kind of interested in like you know history is a very Broad broad subject covers everything really um and it's definitely one of those things where I enjoyed just learning about new things um I think studying history kind of teaches you critical thinking how to research how to write there's a lot of essay writing and I think those kind of transferable skills are very useful but it doesn't necessarily lead to like a specific career you know I kind envy people that were able to like say oh I want to be a doctor I want to be a dentist and um for me I was like I don't really know what what I want to do but I know I like doing history and you know I like learning about things and reading um so yeah it wasn't necessarily the the kind of the most I guess Savvy career mve like you know in terms of um choosing that degree but yeah I just I just thought okay I'm just happy to study what I like doing um yeah yeah well let's talk about the kind of the moment that you're done with school did you have to get a job before you like were you working while you were going to school or yeah I was working at my parents takeaway so I would go back every holiday so it was kind of like a deal I had my parents so they would help out with like um living costs and I took out a loan I took out a student loan like most people to help pay for the fees and then um but every holiday I would return back so that's Christmas Easter and summer and I would just work um just to kind of make extra money and yeah so I would do that so that but then during term time I could just solely study and don't have to worry about money so it's quite a good deal yeah and at what point did you start thinking about was there do you remember a specific time when you're like in school kind of living this like campus life and and going back and helping your parents uh do you remember like a specific point where you're like okay what am I doing next like at what point did you really start thinking about the future and your like longer term career yeah probably like a bit late kind of in my final year start applying for some internships and stuff and you know graduate training schemes wherever I could and it was really competitive plus I kind of I think I just didn't know really what love was doing so um I guess it may might have shown through the applications but I end up doing um a scheme in the US where I was selling books don't know if I ever told you about that selling books for the South yeah Southwestern Company so and I was selling educational books like literally like door Todo sales um it was away for me to be in the US for a few months and you know you sell your books and then you can go on holiday afterwards but yeah so I did that for a bit and that was interesting is this was like kind of like encyclopedia sales or something like that like you saw bit like that but you know kind of with kids books and you know and you would carry around samples knock on doors see if anyone was interested but yeah and like it attracted like students from like UK or all over Europe I think it's usually like something that enabled um students to be in the US so a lot of people were just like okay I can go sell books for a few months and then have some fun yeah that's cool yeah I did that in my final year and then I came back and then yeah and then yeah still didn't know what I was doing sort of did some admin work work for a temp agency for a bit and yeah and it was just one of those things where I kind of thought okay I need money what do I want to do and then they end up working for a university so yeah fell into a career yeah yeah and you spent quite a while there yeah um do you remember how many years you were there so I worked at King's College first I think I did that for about six years something like that um I know which is quite funny I actually worked for the computer science department and I was the administrator to the scary person that you have to hand in your essays to and they would you know I would take them in so I was the uh admin person for the undergraduate program um and I did that so I did kind of University Administration um did that for a few years and then I moved to college thing that you you were in the Cs Department as admin yeah did at any point did it ever occur to you like hey maybe I could study computer science yeah yeah well I I personally I just didn't think I care I was like like you know oh I just I just didn't think there was an Avenue for me there I thought I would have to go back to school and studying then do another degree you know that was a game but it was it was quite good because I would have talks with lecturers and stuff and sort of I would did have some exposure you know to to what they were doing and um so yeah I've kind of but I just didn't never thought I was capable to be honest I thought oh wellow you know I come from a completely different background I don't want to do it and like I can't do it I did it did s maybe sew the seeds when I was working there um yeah but nothing sparked at the time thinking I got the transition yeah and then and then you continued working as an academic administrator at at a different school right yeah I looked after the MBA students so I wor I moved actually first of all I looked after Finance students and then so I kind of moved a lot I think it's uh in my link to but yeah I moved quite a lot internally so you know it's it was basically a very similar job but I would move to a different slightly different um program so but I stayed with the NBA program for quite a long time um so yeah looking after the NBA program and like organizing all the electives and all the admin work associated with that yeah and you know an academic administrator that's that's basically like an entire career in itself and you can go to a university at least in the US and you can see people who've been doing it for like the last 40 years and are getting ready to retire did you think that that was what you were going to do you were just going to stay an acemic admin well that's that was the thing I mean I was like moving up the ranks and I was you know doing a good job I would get really good feedback from my managers and then I think I think I had like a you know when you have like your annual sort of uh what it appraisal so I remember talking to my manager and it's like you know what what's next because we can definitely put you more on the management track and I was like I don't want to do that so I was like no I don't want to but then so what happened was I ended up moving back office so I switched over to teaching equality instead and that wasn't student facing and then I did like so I did the maternity I kind of did that to escape so I didn't have to answer questions about oh what are you doing and do you want to be a manager like I was like no I don't want to be a manager but I didn't say that because I didn't want them to sort of like disregard me I just wasn't sure about what I wanted do so I moved over to teaching quality which is way more back office um like hidden admin I guess um and did the maternity leave cover and whilst I was doing that I would um see loads of kind of inefficiencies and like things that could be automated I was like hey this could be automated okay I'm going to go off and do this and my manager was at the time was she was really supportive she go oh yeah whatever you want to do if you want to improve it really um yeah so she was like usually supportive and then I like basically um make things a lot easier uh for uh the person who I was Place replaced for maternity they to come back and I made their job a lot easier in terms of just streamlining things and make so less time some sometimes I just used to think why are you spending so much do time doing this we can automate this um so then my manager wanted to keep me so she created a position for me and and I was known as wow a special IT projects officer or something like that because that was my interest and said you you obiously want to do it um yeah so then I kind of went down the project management route for so I would find work in other words so she goes you find anything that you want to improve you know uh let us know and we'll see if we can get the funding for it um so I did all kinds of interesting um projects with her so I think one of the big projects I did was an exam marking system and um like like grading exams yeah because basically it was it was really inefficient the way it was done it was basically a lot of spreadsheets being passed through a lot of you know from one hand to another hand and I said there should be only one single source of Truth and that should be the marker inputting into a system so then from from that idea they said okay maybe we need a different system so we looked at like offthe shelf products and there was nothing that met our needs so then uh we worked with an external company to create a Spoke piece of software so I was kind of in charge of creating the the requirements for that interesting so so you're almost kind of like a product manager yeah yeah yeah I was and I was kind of responsible for the delivery of this product and yeah so I kind of like was on the other side of what I do now and yeah it was really interesting because it kind of gave me an Insight in how software projects work and whilst I was doing it I said yeah this is really cool but I kind of want to be on the other side actually she developing it and that's when it really clicked you know and then I said I want to do that and um so you want to be not not the product manager kind of like giving the the specs and and trying to like ask for specific features but the developer who's implemented those features yeah I thought that would be really cool I think that really i' rather build it to be honest than to give out the requirements I'd be really good if I could do it so I found myself kind of moving more towards that I was already kind of automating things and streamlining things at work um and it just seemed like more of the natural progression um yeah so yeah so that's kind of like really kind of roundabout way to to how I got here but that's that was probably uh in my kind of late 20s about then when I sort of thought no I really want to do something else yeah and maybe you can describe like what transpired from that point did did that spur kind of like a Renaissance in terms of like learning new things I mean did did you kind of refocus a lot of your free time to like learn more or or like how did you go from that to working as a software engineer there's still quite a bit to the story yeah that I want to hear yeah so we kind of in within like um the team at the business school we worked a lot with the edtech team and I had a word with one of the lovely um Ed technologists at the time and she recom I said said how do I said how do I get into more technical role she said oh well maybe you should start off with like HTML CSS you know see how web pages are built that's probably the easiest entry point so then I got sent off on a course so um a 3day HTML course and the instructor was my husband but he didn't know at the time so t t yes indeed software uh architect at Adobe currently yeah so he he was your instructor that's how you met him so he used to teach um you know web Technologies at the time JavaScript so I attended a 3day course and then we kept in touch and you know we emailed and then um yeah so it was kind of like all this in conjunction and you know and then uh but we yeah so we met and then then we started dating later on and yeah and it's kind of like from there he sort of became my guide in terms of like he said that hey you know what about you go learn with at the time it's like Co Academy go go Lear with Co Academy so I sort of delved a bit into it and like B my toes in and um did the you know few the exercise but never fully committed I just thought yeah this is cool but wasn't consistent kind of wasn't like 100% in it um and then got distracted by like you know because he proposed we got married had kids and then then the nagging feeling came back when I was thinking about returning to work what do I want to do so yeah so that's and you you talked in your article about how like you had two kids in pretty rapid succession you just had one and and finish your maternity leave when you realized that you were going to have a second one and um yeah maybe you can describe kind of that that mental process because I imagine a lot of the people who are listening to this have kids or or or are planning to have kids and kind of like what that Journey was like in terms of the substantial increase in responsibility associated with having young kids yeah I mean it it was it yeah I when with my first child so with Ramy when he was born I just had this I guess I had an idea of like it would be hard but I didn't think it was going to be that hard um you know he was he just was a baby that just never slept so I was very sleep deprived for the first six months it just it just went by really really quickly and I was exhausted and and um yeah and it just all I could think about was like baby looking after make sure I can you know he stays alive and I can keep him healthy and yeah that pretty much dominated like um my thoughts really um I didn't think about anything else and then um yeah when I went back to work I found out I was pregnant again so I had yeah two kids they're how old how many months they're apart so they're 20 I said two babies under 20 months so yeah they were basically like twins and that was just exhausting really so I had two kids and then when I had lanu and I was on maternity leave so that's my second so my when I had my daughter it it was probably when I sort of it was kind of That Time When I Was preparing to come back to work and I said either I can make a decision now and quit my job or I can actually return to work and just pay like a whole over child care and like move back closer to London because I actually moved away um I moved towards my parents to get help um so they helped me a bit when I had uh lanu and um yeah so I think it was that time when again it just kept me coming back what do I want to do I can take maybe the easier route and just carry on doing what I'm doing yeah or I can take the plunge and I just thought well I so I it was quite a pragmatic decision because you know we saved a bit of money um I had I knew kind of approximately how many years I could go without working yeah and you say pragmatic decision to like leave your career as an ed educational administrator I mean you you told me that like just the cost of having kids in daycare was so substantial that it's practically like eroded all the benefit from you working anyway yeah it was it's it's with with one it's manageable it's about uh one and a half thousand per month that's pounds that's that's about like $2,500 maybe let me just check 1.5k pounds to USD uh yeah it's about $2,000 for any of our International or us listeners I guess in this case um yeah that's substantial so of course it's twice as much if you have two kids right that's $4,000 a month basically that's a lot of money that's more than most uh most people I think working as administrators here in the US make um I would basically be working to cover the child care costs so I'd be working you know it would just be to like maintain my career I would have like no money at the end of it and so I don't think it's like a controversial statement that people working in child care institutions as as great as they may be at taking care of kids that's no substitute for the kids actually being with their moms right yeah yeah yeah it was it was just a chance you know do I want to kind of what's you know I'm paying for someone to look after my kids and whereas I could probably look after them and and there was no like benefit in terms of money so I so we talked about that and then I said so what if I do that I said to my husband what if we do that and then I can maybe look into the whole career transition he said yeah that's fine um so yeah that's what I did so I decided just to make that decision so that we can survive for this many years if you don't work and you stay living with with the parents um yeah so I was lucky because not a lot of people have that opportunity where they can have the sort of financial support in a way that I did um and and you moved back in with your parents as another kind of pragmatic Ed uh decision yeah so I kind of moved like next door to them so they had like a um the on top of the takeout there's a like a little flat so we stay like literally on top of the takeout yeah a single building a single structure like so much your childhood has spent working being there and now as a woman in her 30s you know with a husband and two kids you're going back like if you don't want me at cuz in the US historically there's been some stigma about living with your parents but I moved back in with my parents um during college uh to to also save money for example and I know a lot of people did and I think it's become much more common now and it's not stigmatized like it was back in like the the 9s and stuff uh you're like oh you're just living on in the in your mom's basement was what what people would always say to me when I told him I still live with my parents uh like um but but was that like how did that feel to move back in it was a bit strange I mean like I moved out when I was 18 and then to come back when I was in my 30s it was it was a little bit strange I mean I guess it helped that I wasn't actually living like in the same we had the same living space so it was a separate flat but literally like my my brother was down STS my parents went too far away it was like going back to Childhood because when we when we were when I was younger we in the takeaway we the takeway actually mov location so this is the second location when I moved back so it was like a bigger place but in the first takeaway we were literally living on top of it there was a house on top you know it was like four kids to a bedroom you know it was very tight space and it did have that kind of feeling again when I moved back in but more space so yeah I mean I mean I mean all my family are quite close together I was the only person that actually moved away from my family um so for me to return it was yeah it was but it was fine it was quite nice to sort of be with family again and reminisce and all the rest of it but yeah yeah so you're living in the same building as most of your family uh on top of the takeaway uh I guess the new takeaway the second takeaway um and you're taking care of your kids basically fulltime and yeah at some point there is a decision like I want to learn to cat yeah yeah how did you like what were the circumstances take us back to that moment when or maybe that that period of time in which you started to realize hey I can really do this I can really become a software engineer um so I just trying to think of thinking about 2017 I was like I told my work I said I'm not coming back but I had to obviously fulfill like three months of work so I would work remotely for them for three months um so I could benefit from the maternity leave that I had so I took off like a year which is you know it's really good in the UK you can that's quite normal after you have a kid but you have to return to work for a certain amount of time so I did that and my manager was very supportive and she said that's fine you know you know you got to do what you got to do um and then when I did did that I was like oh God I got no safety net I have to do it now because I've done it I've made the commitment not to return to work and I just thought you just have to throw yourself into it because you know it's not a decision to take lightly it's very scary um I had so T my husband was like a source of support so he said that you know I can mentor you I can guide you but you have to put the work into it you have to be committed and you know um it's going to be hard so yeah so that yeah yeah many conversations to reach that point um you know he said that I'm capable as long as you can practice and practice you know you're capable doing it you can code so yeah I kind of trusted his judgment awesome well I mean it sounds like you had a great resource in literally a a teacher of yours who was now your husband who was kind of helping coach you uh but as anybody who's learned to code knows like at the end of the day it has to be your hands on the keyboard you have to get in the Reps uh you have to learn all these different concepts yourself maybe you can talk about how you went about that massive Endeavor and what what your first thoughts were how you how you kind of got started so before like um I made the commitment to quit my job uh we decided to research platform and I said I mentioned before about Co Academy and then Tara said oh there's this new K block called free camp and you know it's it's really good heard some good things about it why don't you try it out so um he took off a week off work to hold my hand during the first week of study and he says okay let you go off try try doing the interactive exercises if you get stuck on something just let me know um but yeah I think so he says stick with this seems like a good curriculum you you know it's all the things you need to become like a frontend developer um and yeah so that's what I did I started off with Freo Camp um and started off with those exercises where you get a little green tick when you get it right it's nice like confirmation that you know you're doing well and then I remember like it was all going well and then uh I got stuck and I was like what's this what's a div I don't know what a div is and and then he goes husband said it's a container I goes but it's a container in the container he was like I was like what's the point that because you you you realizing later and then he says why don't you go off and research so you know try Googling it and you know because you I'm not always going to be here you know so if you don't understand something Google is your friend um so yeah that's kind of how I got started so I just carried on I persevered if I didn't understand something I would just go and Google it and became quite a good Google really um and uh so that was my kind of core curric was Freo camp um I did sort of offshoot and like because I kind of quite I like to learn through different sort of medium so I love like tutorials like video tutorials when you walk through a project and you can sort of see how concepts are being applied um so I would use a lot of that and also K Academy so for the fundamentals I would go back and use that platform as well it's a great platform but yeah but pretty much I stuck to it completed I think about the first three certificates yeah so you probably did the responsive web design yeah JavaScript algorithms data structures frontend libraries um and you might have done like the data visualization yeah yeah I did that one I love that one so yes I did all those and I just C on and I just you know I remember like just banging my head um against the W sometimes with some of the the projects like creating the Roman numerator you know number ber thing you know things like but I just sat there and I really didn't want to find out the answer I would just sit there and just persevere and yeah it was it was a lot of kind of nice but I really enjoyed it I really enjoyed the problem solving side of it so um yeah so it was kind of hard but I was very U fulfilled by what I was doing by the study and learning you felt forward momentum essentially you felt and that's one of the things I always tell tell people is like at some point you'll start to feel yourself kind of like almost your brain growing yeah if you will you'll feel the kind of like the the boundaries of your your knowledge being pushed forward yeah and it's a it's an really invigorating uh feeling it and so were there doldrums were there periods of time where you I I like to joke that like most people quit programming I quit so many times but I I quit learning programming yeah but I but I I would keep going back right did you have any of those moments where you're just like ah or yeah yeah the yeah I think I I wrote about it in my second article um so yeah I think it was the time when I started looking for work and I thought okay I'll just join all these like freelance platforms and you know do remote work it'll be great I'll be able to land customers and but it was just it just didn't work for me I wasn't able to land any customers and you talking about like Fiverr and uh like out upw work uh yeah those those types of websites yeah you know and I thought I'll be good just to get a bit of experience here and that but it just I think what it did was like it completely Dent my confidence I thought I can't even get any work I can't compete with I got zero ratings and how do I get a rating by getting work but no one would give me work so like a yeah the Chicken and the Egg problem yeah and then I just thought oh no I can't so so after that I thought it really the whole impostor syndrome just kicked in at that point and then I took a break from coding for about two three months um yeah and then I yeah so I did that and what was that time like what what were you if you don't mind me asking like do you remember what what your days were like when you did you feel relief like ah you know I resolved to not do it or or were you I felt really down I felt like a failure um because I set out to to do this and I felt like I can't do it you know and it's just all these like negative thoughts just kept it's just spiring um and I just needed to reset you know and sort of step back and think about what I was doing and so what I did was I stopped and then when um I think it coincided with a time with my my manager at Imperial she wanted like temp work so she said you can work remotely we'll probably need you like a couple of days a week um so I did that I just thought okay I'll do something different I'll just work and then that kind of distracted me brought back my confidence like I can actually do work I can actually work I'm worth something um and then I said thought what did I enjoy about coding it was studying so I went back to studying and then I continue with the certification misss I did I think I did the backend one with fre con camp and then I think the biggest gave me momentum again was doing 100 days of code yeah Twitter describe 100 days of code so you commit to doing a 100 days of code you have to code for at least an hour a day um so I did that I followed that model so I would and then I would put updates on Twitter and like use all the hashtags and like follow other people who are also doing 100 days of code and it was just a really nice Community because you sort of see other people's progress um people support you they give you like Yay you know well done and it was just really nice I got to know quite a lot of developers um and aspiring developers through the platform and yeah so that kind of brought back my confidence and gave me consistency as well because it you know I had sort of announced the world do 100 days of code I better you know make sure I fulfilled that um so yeah I did that and then completed certifications um also decided to not work for Fiverr or at work and uh created a a website for my um sisterinlaw's business so she started like a a nail business and she didn't have a website or any web presence so I just offered my services for free and said I can create a website free she willing to give me a chance and she did she said yeah go ahead I don't mind so I did that and and yeah create the portfolio you know all the things so I kind of had that momentum um after I did the 100 days code yeah you I mean you've got to start somewhere and uh I remember my first freelance project was my friend uh who ran like a consultancy and I was like hey can I create like he wanted me to develop some sort of simple tool it was like a basically a crud create read update delete I think yeah um the crud acronym that you hear like a crud app is what some people say like like very basic like interfacing with like the databas I think it was like a ruby un rails app or something like that and um yeah and my friend Jimmy erson took a chance on me and as a result I built that and I learned so much just having a project having somebody that you're accountable toward makes all the difference in terms of getting out of bed every day you know getting on the keyboard and pounding out some code and pushing through you know well I've got to figure out how to render you know this SVG you know table with all this stuff that like I'm pulling for the database I'm going to figure it out right like yeah there's no other option really I'm not going to I I can't let my friend down he's trusted me with this he he's paying me a token amount of money he was like a th000 bucks or something like that to build this for him so uh I need to do it right and it sounds like similarly once once your sister had given you that responsibility did you feel that that was like a proverbial shot shot in the arm in terms of motivation yeah and also it was just like I had to do things learn new things like how to host a static website and that's when I wrote the AWS article because I thought it I found it really difficult I was like I don't know what I'm doing this documentation like a you know so it's it's so complicated and I'm going around the circles and you know so I was I was also like writing like I wrote notes for myself and I thought okay if I'm having trouble doing this then someone else out there has got to have trouble and will hopefully help clarify how to do something which is should be relatively easy so yeah so I think it I learned so much doing that like I learned about like you know buying domain how to host a website um about AWS about S3 buckets and it just kind of took me down like a different like area um which I've never gone down before and it just like and it was good because I was thinking oh this is like great I don't know what I'm doing but I'm learning as I'm going and that's pretty much we development yeah even do that now so yeah but yeah but I was enjoying it and I think that was the key yeah and one of the things that you know is really interesting about your coding journey is because you did this kind of freelance you you were able to work with a lot of potential clients and build up your chops that way before you actually started applying for software development jobs do you remember how long you'v been coding before you even applied for your first developer job so I was coding at towards the end of 2017 um and so that's when I started to learn and then I created my first sort of website in April I think the following year 2018 and then that's after I did that I was still studying and then I decided to approach like people who I knew that needed help with creating weite so I would just say hey you want the website so and that was much better because they knew me um and they kind of thought you know oh that's really great I trust you sure you can build my website for my business so I did that uh for a couple of businesses and yes it worked out really well I just did word press sites because it was the easiest thing so that they could up dat um and you know they had like a a gooey and stuff so yeah it just um yeah so it made sense to kind of go down the WordPress route for those websites and it gave me the experience to then apply for Developer jobs and yeah that was my industrial experience you know because because I had actually work with clients got the requirements follow through deliver the product um but yeah it was really helpful for me that's how I kind of got my throat in the door I got my first job and that but that was like a like more than a year after you'd started learning the code that you even started applying so a lot of people I think maybe start applying for jobs way too early um and I always tell people if you can freelance first and just get a few projects into your portfolio that that can really dramatically increase the likelihood of people calling you back for interviews right yeah I think it differentiates you from those who are just you know got a few certificates if you can show that you've got experience and you got your track record and you can get references from those people it really helps um so I always say just do it for a friend just create a website you know you know so it's the best way to learn and it's the best way to kind of get that experience um you know when you're learning how to code so you're finally ready to apply for frontend Developer jobs and you've got you got this practical experience like how do you go about what was that decision like how did you know you or or think you were ready um and how did you go about applying um so so T at the time was saying to me you're ready to apply you're ready to apply but I was like I said no I'm not I'm not I'm dragging my feet I'm studying this I need to complete this certificate first I need to there always something you always try to uh put barriers in uh because I think I knew subconscious was going to be really tough but I read a lot of the cases like you know applying for 100 jobs and um so I think it was the summer of 2009 was it 2019 hold on let me so we moved yes so then um my son was starting school and it seemed like a good point to to start flying because you know kid goes to school technically got a bit more free time even though yeah like six hours depending on like the length of school but but it can like my kids are in school uh they actually just got home so if you hear like a bunch of yelling and screaming in the background my kids are very loud um they love to like s and you might even hear some piano later who knows or the software might tune it out but um but yeah like being able to drop my kids off at school I walk them to school in the morning and I just drop them off and I'm like for the next six or seven hours I can work right like yeah yeah so that had to be a massive change being able to drop your son off at school and like have that time yeah so I drop him off of school and then I can drop my daughter off at like um Nursery like daycare um and and then I could have like most of the day back uh so I used that to start applying but yeah I think the the applying process for me was um like I contacted recruiters I joined like you know I also look for jobs on like LinkedIn and I think with can't remember some some recruitment agencies like I think Reed um and that's how I did it I just kind of just applied the down the traditional rout and then um heard back and got a couple of interviews with two different companies wow so you you a couple com that's very hardening I guess like you're immediately getting positive feedback yeah yeah so do you remember how many jobs you actually applied for I think I put this in the article appli for four four jobs responses and you got two responses that's a 50% hit rate yeah so pretty remarkable like I I was interviewing Logan from open Ai and he said he measures job applications in the hundreds because it takes so so many job applications but but clearly you you were well prepared for the job hunt if you were able to get interviews from like two right off the bat I think you know because I was thinking am I just lucky I I don't know or maybe it's just a combination of things but yeah I mean I I had my CV ready I had um a friend review it I had T review it feedback you know kind of tweet my LinkedIn profile so it was all kind of a combination of things to you know give me the perect storm of preparedness yes I think that's what I'm going to say yes I I was prepared I mean I think I had mentally prepared for months for this and then but yes I was really surprised I mean the first one um the interview was you know it all went well the very curious to sort of like uh talk about my my background and like oh you're trying to transition that's really interesting so I think a lot of it was probably just um thought I was an interesting person like why would I do this um so that kind of came up in both interviews um and then yeah so I decided to it was it was really laidback it wasn't like anything tough with the uh the interview that I with the company I actually had my first job with um I met with the lead developer and then he said I reviewed all your your portfolio you know your websites that you've done you know and I think your so do you want the job and I like okay inter yeah it was like pretty much like talked about make you go up in like invert a binary search tree oh no no whiteboarding nothing so it was it was just like you know he had done his homework um and he said that you know I would like to kind of because I'm happy to like you know hire you um but you know so we just talked about the company what they were trying to do what I would do what the role involved um and then I also met with like the directors of the company it's a very small company and they seem that all like nice people so I was like okay oh like nothing that I've ever done before which was mapping never done anything to do with that yeah so G yes is where you're working with like Global Information Systems GIS G geographical Information Systems GIS I'm just going to look up GIS I'm sorry just for the sake of Cu I have this rule that if there's like an acronym I'm going to uh say it so it's geographic information systems yes yes I was yeah but everybody just calls it GIS like yeah everyone just called it JS so so I went with that um um so I created Maps so worked with local councils I was in charge of creating a drawing tool so whenever you kind of if you're like a resident and you need to get permission to create like an extension you would have to draw like on a map where you would like your extension so I cre an extension for like like a house or something like you for example okay yeah um so it was like a drawing tool for a map um and I used yeah it was just like huge learning curve I had to learn about GIS had to learn about like projections map projections and coordinate systems and I work with mostly um an open source Library called open layers open layers I think Le yeah leaflet's the other one which is probably a bit more common but open layers has way more functionality I think than leth so I worked with that and that was yeah very steep L really interesting though um and you know learned a lot in that role um I was so happy when we you know deployed the um the tool that I made and these counselors were using it and I was like Hey so it was just really satisfying really um when I finally did that but yeah it was It was a good role to have best role yeah well what was like how has your career unfolded since then like have you mostly just been working you're still working with GIS a lot right um not anymore so um I moved on to uh so I was with that company during the P pandemic the beginning of the pandemic so it was I was working remotely anyway so it wasn't too much of a change for us and then I was looking for my next role and decided to uh sort of incorporate a bit of what I used to do so in education so I work for um the national foundation for educational research nfbr and they do and that's that's a government agency no not quite I think it's it's a nonprofit charity and they do a lot of educational research so they work quite a lot with I suppose they do a lot of advisory work a lot of so they do education research for primary age school children and they had um so they were hiring Developers for um creating an e assessment system okay for primis children cool um I'm I'm learning a lot from just like what you're talking like obviously I got the last two like assumptions wrong uh but but working so working you know obviously precooking is a charity so I'm familiar with the charity world I just when you go across the Atlantic to the UK I have very little understanding of how things operate over there but but essentially like could you summarize the like the mission of the organization you work for like what what the the big goal is I think it's just um I think the big goal is to uh oh how TR how should I summarize it um it's just to kind of make the educational life of children better like how to enhance it how to improve it um they did a lot of research during the pandemic and the impact on children yeah there's a lot of interesting research that comes out of the um NF um but they also do like Outreach to Africa as well so I know there's kind of like assisting governments in Africa and how to kind of improve their educational programs for children and it's just it's just nice because you know I thought I'm going to be able to work on the products which potentially my children are going to use and they actually did you know they actually went through um so they were responsible so there's um sorry my airpods just come out um so um so for example in uh reception age children so that's four to five there's a test that you have to take which is called um the reception Baseline test and reception Baseline test yeah and it's um all children and all schools have to do it and uh NFR were responsible for um sort of developing and and deploying that test for all the schools so it was just it was just I I kind of wanted to do something think meaningful uh and uh this was like the perfect I thought it's the perfect role for me um I get to sort of increase my experience and also the mission you know trying to you know improve the the educational lives of children so yeah so you get to wake up every day and feel like you're helping in this organization's Mission and ultimately by extension you're helping a whole lot of kids around the world I hope so yeah and it's you know the the kind of so we haven't actually released the product yet it's going live in the summer the summer um but yeah so it's been a lot of work so I've been with them for almost three years and a lot of work has been has gone into it um and you know I'm kind of and I'm really kind of on the front line in terms of what I'm doing so I actually create the interactions which the children use to complete the test so I don't know if you know like like reading Eggs and those platforms Athletics so if you could see like um a question and you see where the kid has to drag or input an answer I'm the one who builds those interactions for the system so I would imagine you're doing a lot of like user research a lot of like accessibility considerations yeah performance like web performance compatibility stuff like that like is it is it going to run in a browser yeah it runs in the browser yeah so yeah all that stuff so I you know it has to be double A accredited and there's constant discussions because a lot of the uh the uh sort of researchers who want the interaction I'm not necessarily up to scratch with accessibility concerns so you know we've had to sort of really educate um a lot of staff on what to take into consideration um in terms of sity that the buttons have to be a s size the color contrast so yeah it's it's it's it's nice because it's a lot cooperation with a lot of teams um but yeah so I feel a lot of responsibility as well at the same time to make something really intuitive yeah I mean if you think about it not to put even more weight on your shoulders but like the work that all the people are doing is going to almost be interpolated through the work that you're doing like you're the front door through which all the kids are going right and if that front door doesn't open properly or the front door looks you know not like it doesn't have the curb appeal or something like who knows right so yeah it sounds like the because you're so close to the end user um but that's got to be really exhilarating at the same time yeah yeah and it's nice because I get to test it on my kids so I created like a uh another type of like you can draw shapes and things called Drawing shapes so um my first user was my was lanu so I got her to like control it and I could sort of see the trouble she was having I was like oh this is really good you know she can't Klick an adop too small you know so it was it's just really nice and she finds it fun she gets an idea of what I do for a living yeah um so yeah I get to test it on my own kids yeah that's got to be really cool experience like seeing the very work that you're doing and and uh her being able to look up to her her mom and and know that her mom's you know not just filing reports at some desk in some giant you know Byzantine you know structure but is actually like developing something tangible that she can see and play with yeah it's it's really nice and she's really interested and she sort of asked me oh have you done something new today you know so yeah I'm just quite happy that um what I'm doing has like a you know it's it's really important it's a really important key part of the system and um and it kind of makes me work harder because I kind of want to do a really good job because people like Dan you who are going to be using it and I just think well there's a lot of responsibility there yeah so yeah well amazing again I want to congratulate you on just that that Arc that Narrative of going from uh you know the child of refugees uh who themselves were the children of refugees um who started a small business and kind of lived like in America we would call it like the American dream maybe there's like it's like the the the British dream or do you have a word for that over there yeah yeah yeah it's a similar thing I mean yeah it's it's yeah I'm I'm yeah I'm really happy for my parents because I think at the end of the day they what they got out of it was Financial stability and um you know the business of was really successful and you know they lead a good life now but it was just a lot of grafting a lot of hard work and I think that's what they instilled in me I mean like working in the the takeaway like every weekend um in the evenings and it it was yeah and I think that how helped when it came to um the the career transition because it kind of gave me that tenacity to just like keep on going you know I kept on saying you've worked hard on this before remember the days in the takeway when you're standing for 12 hours you know so I think it gave me that that I think that work ethic um so you know as much as you know I didn't have the childhood which a lot of kids have when you get to go on holidays and you know have things what my parents gave me were the tools to succeed and really grateful for that um and they they yeah I'm just I'm still hardw workking to this day because of them um so yeah that's what they gave me yeah wow so having kind of completed that you know autobiographical Arc of the podcast interview I want to jump to practical takeaways for people uh you know especially parents uh especially moms who have young kids and uh a lot of people who might find themselves having graduated with the degree that they really enjoyed studying but isn't necessarily directly applicable to what they want to do next um and and so so maybe I can just fire off some some questions to you Phoebe to uh so what would be your advice looking back with everything you've learned if you were to meet someone who was let's say like you know 34 uh which I think was about the age that you were when you started learning the code right right uh maybe a 30yearold mother of two um who was living in the UK like very similar like uh maybe you could even think of this is like what if you could send some advice back to yourself just send send that advice back you know five or six years or how however long it's been since then um to to maybe cushion the process or or maybe even some tips to be even more uh steady in her Ascent yeah would you say to her um I think I would say that which I've said before on some other podcast is whiches don't compare yourself to others um I did that you know when you see stories of people getting jobs up after six months of studying and you know Landing a job at Google of six mon you know that that does happen and you know but that's rare and everyone's circumstances are different so you have to cater your learning schedule your coding schedule around yourself around your responsibilities you know you you can have young kids you can have elderly parents whatever that may be and you just do the best you can um and I say that you know even if it's just for 15 minutes a day it's something and as long as you've learned something new today compared to yesterday that's what counts you know and it's it's it's accumulative so you you kind of like need to make sure that you try and keep the consistency as well yeah yeah but in saying that like I was really inconsistent because kids got sick and I got sick and you know things come up but you just try not to become disheartened and try and jump back onto the wagon and start learning again so it's a lot of stopping and starting when you're a parent because something does pop up you know you're not in your 20s and you're single no responsibilities you got kids um it's going to be hard but it's possible it is possible yeah and it yeah I mean you're you're living proof that it's possible yeah and and I know many other uh parents who in their 30s um transitioned into Tech uh you know as I've written at length uh probably everybody listening to this is read my book or something where I talk about it but I I learned to code at age 31 now I didn't have any kids kids add an entire additional layer of you know complexity and and time constraint and energy level you know limitations I I guess how did you do it like were there any things that like really helped you gather like like uh G your loins like muster your strength so that you could do this so consistently over two years um I've had this discussion before because people say you know why did you wait until you had kids to transition um and I think my answer is that I didn't really value my time before you know I would like go off and play some video games and go shopping whatever you know and then but when the time was like taken away from me when I devoted my time to my kids I realized how valuable is and so whenever I could sneak in like half an hour here and an hour there I really utilize it and I think that's what having kids for me did it actually made me value my time all which is kind of ironic really because you have less of it but um yeah so i' would say that yeah when you have less of it you value it so you make use of the time and that's what I did and every time I just instead of like watching Netflix or something I would just go off and study um yeah yeah the the Temptation wasn't there because I just thought I haven't got much time have to do something useful just go and do it and then and I kind of got used to that I kind of got used to like just my life with kids and coding for a while do you think you built up do you think you built up kind of like more resilience over the process like each day like like you said said Netflix things like that distractions that you used to you know indulge in uh just kind of melted away and they almost weren't considerations do you think you kind of like built up this tolerance for I guess the the frustration and the potential tedium of learning programming yeah I think I I did I did I mean I remember like early on I used to get terrible migraines I think it was cuz the new neurons were like neurons in my brain so yeah I mean I did build up a tolerance and I used to feel so uncomfortable studying programming I just like and then you kind of get used to that feeling like feeling uncomfortable and you kind of end up just like I don't know for me it just you build up a tolerance and then you kind of you can study for longer and you can and it's it's weird because you kind of it compounds the knowledge so things are not so alien to you once you kind of learn the fundamentals um so I think that was the big thing for me and then I thought oh no I understand that I understand so it it took me less time to understand difficult Concepts as I was you know as I learned more and more was there an inflection point like where did you did you have like do you remember a specific moment where you felt like suddenly the wind was at your back and you were being pushed toward your destination yeah I think it was when probably this after my sort of down period where I kind of like just stopped cing and then after that it was like a massive push I remember like just being like really motivated and I think that second wind was like for me that was it and I knew that I was going to make it then I wasn't sure like the first year of studying whether I was actually going to make it and I always thought I can always go back to imperal college I can always go back to education it's fine it's fine but then I thought no I'm going to do it and then I like I really pyed myself up like mentally you have to kind of like build that up and and it's one of those things where you you're almost like cheering yourself on it's like an internal dialogue it's really strange that's why I did like kind of I can do it I can do it I can do it um and yeah and I just thought to myself also I can do it and then I can also write another article for you guys yeah I'm gonna get that job and I'm gonna write and I'm gonna like celebrate so yeah I think it was that win and it just yeah I was really motivated I don't know what it was I think it was doing that 100 days of code I was really psyched when I was doing it and yeah just having the support as well of other people and telling you know and they were in the same circumstance as you because as much as like having my husband there as a mentor it it's different from someone else that's also kind of going through the same process it's it's like it's nice to have that someone else doing the same thing as you and you're both trying to make it or a few of us trying to make it so yeah yeah someone who's like basically at the exact same point in their Journey as you are uh and and it's almost like you're on Parallel tracks like looking over highfiving each other yeah yeah that's so cool so 100 days of code I I feel thrilled that that was a big uh element in your uh your rise as a developer and uh I'm going to link to that uh we I I recently posted an article we've got 100 days of code going on on Freo Camp's Discord as well so even if you don't like Twitter uh you can go on Discord and do it because a lot of people are on Discord now um and you can meet lots of likeminded people and you can hang out with them and you know po pair program and it is finding kind of a community finding your tribe so to speak do you feel that that that was helpful for you like finding other people did you do you remember a period where maybe you felt like you were in isolation like was there a lonely period of learning to go yeah yeah indeed yeah I think I think that also didn't help you know when I kind of fell into that sort of like period when I wasn't coding and I felt really lonely because I was on it was either like kids or I was coding on my own um T was working away a lot at the time so he would be away for sometimes most of the working week so it was just me and the desk with a laptop and yeah I mean I suppose one of those Lessons Learned when you go back and if you could tell yourself go back and talk to yourself and say what you would do differently I'll would say probably not for me engaging with the community earlier I think that that's a key thing um so you know and you can do that remotely like I know other parents it's just not possible possible for us to go to meetups and um and there are different mediums so you can find your support not just in person you could probably find them you know I I found them through Twitter at the time um and yeah and I just reached out to people I think um Jackson Bates was one of the people I actually reached out to at the time very chill uh early contributor to Freo yeah so he was really nice he would you know he wrote a really long reply saying because I said that what I said I remember the question actually poed him I said I'm about to go on the job hunt like how am I supposed to get a job when there's a 21y old that will be able to work longer hours and like you know learn faster and doesn't have kids as responsibilities and I remember his response was um you know don't forget the experience that you've got you know you've got all that working experience it does count and you know don't compare don't compare yourself don't compare yourself to other people right yeah so that was um I remember and I you know he was you know we kept in touch actually um kind of back every now and again and yeah so he was one of those people where I knew that he made it because he used to be a teacher um and yeah so I kind of contacted people who made a transition and the number of people that actually replyed back is you know it's great you know they they always have time especially other Freo Camp alumni so yeah definitely yeah well Phoebe I really want to thank you for making time to come on the Freo camp podcast I've been meaning to have you on for so long cuz you and I have been corresponding for I think like I don't know like four or five years trying to look like yeah a long time yeah uh and and it's been it's been amazing uh to to watch your progression and uh from somebody who was just ambitious and learning the code to someone who now works at a big charity developing software that's going to be used by a ton of kids so it it's very inspiring and I want to thank you again also for writing these many articles you've written uh I'm going to link to some of them I'm going to link to your review of the famous Harvard cs50 computer science Course pro perhaps the most widely taken course on Earth at this point if it's amazing and they keep coming up with new additions every year uh so we just published like the newest version of the lectures which David men isn't wearing a mask anymore cuz cuz like the old one you had to wear mask the whole time because of the pandemic uh and yeah and your article about going from a stay home mom to Landing your first developer job I think it provides like a really good Rob Map for a lot of other people who are parents um to to follow so I'm going to include that as well and then I'm going to encourage people to follow you on Twitter um do you have any parting words wisdom for people before we sign off oh um I'm just trying to think now um just be consistent I think just try and be consistent be patient and um yeah and just if you got the motivation you can do it you can transition 100% well thank you again Phoebe uh everyone listening until next week happy coding
