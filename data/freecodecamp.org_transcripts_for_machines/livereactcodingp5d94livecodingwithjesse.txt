hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to work with react i wasn't exactly sure what we'll be working on so i left the title nice and vague and just said react coding so we're probably going to finish up or at least try to do a little bit more with that form that we were working with yesterday i uh i thought i might be able to get it finished before the stream but i wasn't really able to do that much so i had kind of a long meeting this morning and um but it was a good meeting though it started out with food so we had breakfast which was really nice and then um then we had like our normal meeting afterwards which took longer longer than normal but i still wanted to get a stream in so today's stream might be a little bit shorter than normal uh we'll see how it goes so we may only end up doing one pomodoro session of code so for everyone who's new uh this live stream is just me doing my everyday work i'm a fulltime frontend developer i work for a small university uh so this is not rehearsed at all i will make mistakes i think maybe one time i did a stream where i everything worked out well so but um i'll make mistakes we'll work through them i'll answer your questions and i'll try to narrate what i'm doing as we go along i break things up with pomodoro sessions so we'll do 25 minutes of just mostly coding and i'll i'll won't really look at the live chat too much and then i'll take a five minute break and i'll answer your questions in the chat and then at the end of the stream if there are any questions remaining i'll take as much time as i need to get through all the other questions so uh like i said for today maybe we'll just do one pomodoro session and the rest will be questions so i did get into work really early like way earlier than normal this morning so i'm going to be leaving earlier than normal so i don't want to do want to take too long with the stream and all right so let's get started i'm going to check the the chat first before we uh start our timer and do some code so hey a few people saying hi how's it going thanks for joining us um anna um is thr through the emoji that she's put on there is it thinks it's funny that i i put the description as i'm not sure exactly what we're going to work on today but i'm pretty sure it will have something to do with react.js yeah i mean that's that's the best i could come up with for the description because i i really didn't know how far i would get uh with what i was working on and um and noob says i have a static website in react which has clientside uh rendered which is clientside rendered i would like to know how i can convert it to serverside rendered website um if it were me personally i would just start up i would build a react project with next js and i would literally just copy and paste the components over then you're gonna get serverside rendering already built in the only thing that might be weird is like if you wanted to then use the routing from nexjs you might have to change some things that's what i would do there may be an easier way to do that but i don't know about it you know offhand so if i had a little bit more time i personally would probably research it first but if i needed to get it server side rendered as fast as possible i would go the next js route because i already know how to do that let's see we have a hive from guadalajara mexico awesome welcome um if i jesse you really like your videos because you're showing uh a normal um expert web developer would you recommend me to be a react developer in 2019 thanks oh yeah for sure i think there's a lot of jobs in react it's a lot of fun to develop with so if you're interested in react and you think you'll enjoy working with it then for sure go for it i see react jobs being posted like constantly i was just at react rally last week and there were a lot of companies there that were looking for react developers uh even like big companies were there like apple was there american express was there and then some smaller companies uh like formidable labs um that slip in my mind there was this other company that had this really cool like editor website editor product that was all built with react and i can't starts with a w man it's slipping my mind but anyway you know i believe every single like company that had a booth at react rally was hiring and wanted react developers specifically so in any case i think it's it's definitely um a good way to go i mean react is still young right it's it's only been out for i mean what like four years or something like that and you know during the first year everybody thought it it was crazy anyway so i mean it's it's still growing let's see we have hi from india uh all right cool i'm gonna get started so i've been spent about six minutes on the uh intro stuff so um let's get started if anybody wants to follow along with the code there's a link to the uh the github repo in the description and we are on the salesforce branch so make sure you switch it up from master brands to salesforce uh otherwise the code is going to look different for what we're working on today we'll be working on the component called inquiry.js let me switch my screen so you can see and i'm gonna make my font a lot bigger and so you can see here in the components folder or an inquiry and i have updated the github repo with the latest code i will say this the latest code has some errors in it but i just wanted to make sure it was all there on github so i i pushed it anyway but let me catch you up on what i've done and then explain what we're gonna do and we'll uh we'll do some code let me start my pomodoro timer so basically uh what i've added is a dialog uh component this is from material ui so we need to bring in a dialog and this will be basically like a little modal that pops up when you submit the form so i'm still not sure if i want to go with a modal or just some type of small loading indicator the reason that i thought of going with the modal is because well two reasons number one i already had the code for that ready from another project so it was easy to copy and paste it but also the number two reason is i may want to give the user more information and i think a modal would easily let me do that maybe prompt them to even do do more so i'm not exactly sure how i want to do that yet so for now that's what's going to be in there what would happen is the modal would open it would say that it's still sending the data and then when we get confirmation that the data has been sent successfully then it'll switch over and say success or something like that and then prompt the user to either like just close the modal or potentially i don't know take the next step give us some more info i'm not exactly sure yet it's going to be somewhat up to our admissions department here because they're the ones that need that data and are going to be acting on that okay um oh ocean asks for the dev site uh link yeah let's i wonder there we go let's start up and grog so ngrok will allow you all to see what i'm working on on your local machines so if you click that link or copy and paste that link you should be able to see the site and the stuff that we're doing will show up on the home page so you shouldn't have to navigate anywhere of course you can if you want to and check out you know other pages on the site and let me pull it over on the screen too and that way for those of you who uh who can't be at a computer right now looking at it you'll still be able to see what we're we're working on so i have it all on the other screen right now and i'm just gonna move it over here and show you what we have so here's what we have the um the form that we're working on is right here it looks really bad right now so we're going to work on the look of it a little bit but these are the these are the fields that we'll have so these are not likely to change we'll just have these four fields first name last name email and student type and you could pick undergrad graduate and online and then we have a submit button that right now i don't know what's up with that so we'll have to uh fix the styling on that also like the i don't know why this is all the way over here it's something to do with the container i guess so we definitely have some styling work that needs to be done and uh that might actually be a good thing to do like let's just style this a little bit better because even if i can't get it to work if i have it styled correctly by the time i have to present this it'll be fine right because if i'm presenting it nobody's going to actually be clicking anything right i'm just going to be scrolling down telling everybody what it does so it makes more sense to just kind of make it look good now and then we can make it work after so let's work on that so we have let me show you what how we're doing styling so we have this object it's actually um basically like css but you'll see there are some differences so we go with camel case instead of hyphenated terms here so you know font size is capital s right no hyphen and then anything that's a string needs to go in quotes numbers can just be numbers right but it's in the format of a javascript object okay so that's what we'll be using mostly for our styles here so first things first uh let's get that container into shape so our stuff's not like super spread out so i like the container size that we already have here right so we have some space on the side so let's just try to match that for now and then we can go from there and see see how it looks i'm actually gonna i'm gonna turn on my fan here and just keep it on low if it's too noisy let me know but i don't know if you can see like i'm super hot and i feel like my forehead is just super shiny because i'm starting to sweat so apologies for that it probably looks gross but uh it just got really hot in my office okay if you're just coming in you're wondering why i'm not looking at your question in chat i will look at your question as soon as this pomodoro timer is up so in about 20 minutes so just hang in there a little bit and i will be sure to look at your comment and answer any questions that you might have so we have this grid container let's see where that ends yeah you know what actually let's see where this is we need to go back to our index page right because that's where all the other containers are so this inquiry.js is its own component and we're just putting it into the index page here right here under inquiry and on the index page i think what we have is that our our main grid is not what's giving us our padding on the sides it's these grid items each have their own padding so i'm going to verify that in our our css object which let's move that down so we're currently moving all of our css to the bottom of our components that makes it a bit easier to figure out what a component does when you first open it so we're going to look at those grid as content we have a content container actually our content container should be regulating let's double check what class we have on here yeah our grid container does have the class of content container and our our inquiry is within that container so we're gonna have to dig a little bit deeper to figure out why this inquiry component is not fitting in there uh so let's see first off let's see what kind of styles we have here and we grabbed some of these styles let's get rid of because they were from when we we used a different component as our base and then we just kind of edited it so those styles were from a different component um yeah so we don't have any styles in here right now that i think would would really mess anything up i don't even think we're using this form control let's see if it's on the page i guess we are no okay we are using a form control somewhere okay uh so let's go back to let's go back to this and let's just inspect it see what's going on uh i will make this bigger so y'all can see and let's see what section so we're dealing with this section here okay so we'll just do a quick comparison here uh so we have this grid container and it's saying we have a width of 100 let's compare it to this grid container which also has a width of 100 percent but then it has a max width of 70. interesting great item you know what i think is going on let's look back at our index component i thought let's close this off interesting okay so i thought that this grid container was not closed but evidently it is closed and it closes here okay um that makes more sense now let's let's put another great container here i'm not sure if this is the best way to handle this but i i'm gonna try it first the thing i'm thinking is maybe we could just extend it and put this inquiry inside our existing grid container and we could probably do put this in there as well or potentially we could add the styles for the grid container on the container that's in our other component which i wouldn't like to do because that would make it a bit less versatile um and then the other thing i'm worried about is we're going to have a container grid container within a grid container i'm not sure how how that's going to work but we'll find out so for now it looks like it's okay it is within that yeah so it's staying within there in terms of the layout let's see what it looks like so we have this outer container and then we have a inner container and then we have another one so i guess it doesn't really matter uh it's just kind of like an extra unnecessary div which is not a huge deal so i think we'll go with it for now so that gives us a little bit of padding hey look our submit button now actually says submit that's cool i don't know what the deal was before but uh i probably end up styling that differently maybe to look more like like this button does but for now it you know we we get the idea that there's a submit button um it would actually might be nice if y'all let me know what you think about this so when the screen's small this doesn't look too bad but when it starts to get big this is just a huge gap between like all these fields so i'm thinking we need to do something about that uh so either we could go with the fields being like all on one line on a large screen and then starting to stack as the screens get smaller or we could set a like a fixed max width um so that we get the width we like and it'll never go bigger than that let's try both let's let's see though so let me know what you all think in the chat and then i'm just going to try both right here so you can see them and i'll be able to see them and see what i like so first first thing and uh it'll be really easy is let's just add in everywhere that we have this uh sm equals six we're going to switch that up and we'll leave it for for the small screens there's six but now we're going to say md for medium size equals um so we actually have five of these i think because if we count the submit button it's it's five so we could go with this is gonna be weird um yeah let's go with uh three let's have a take up three columns for now that is gonna leave that fifth one kind of like on the end there like down below but you can't really divide 12 by five evenly so we'll just try this first okay so now when there's a large screen it does go across i'm gonna submit button below i don't know i'm not sure that i i really love that either hmm at it just for a second let you all have a chance to look at it okay i think it potentially would look a lot better if we had it like inside um a section like this that had a dark background i'm not going to try it out right now though we could try it out maybe in a minute because i then i'd have to change the font color and everything so we're just going to imagine it for right now eventually i do want to do it though because i'd like to put the same these same fields in the footer and obviously i'd need to change the font color for that alright so the next thing i'm going to try is we'll switch it back to how it was and then we'll we'll just have a max width uh i get to the end of my playlist need to switch this up okay we're good now can't possibly code without spotify on right okay so we'll just undo all that and now let's put try to see if we already had styles on here but i guess we don't do we have styles on anything yeah we do just trying to copy and paste and avoid typing as much as possible so on our grid container let's add this and we'll just say container and then let's go down here and add a class for container and we'll say max with let's give it a max width of 300 pixels and that'll actually work no matter what even on mobile because as far as i know the narrowest mobile device still has 320 pixels so uh this should be good i've seen a lot of stuff down here what is happening oops forgot a comma so remember this is uh the same syntax as a javascript object because in fact it is a javascript object so we do need to have these commas in here so that should work yep that works now oh all right so first problem with that is that we have overlapping fields all right so it's not going to work being that small uh so let's go in here and see remember we're just trying to get a feel for what it looks like so what i'm gonna do now is just change things in dev tools just so we can see it without the overlapping fields so here's the container that we put that max width on let's bump it up to 600 pix yeah 600 looks way better and let's also give this a flex maps flex let's go with the flex um align items no that's not what i want uh justify content there we go so since we're using flexbox we can say justify content center on this containing div and this will move everything to the middle i just kind of wanted to see what it would look like in the middle i don't like that this is on on the side here um all right let me do a little bit with this just to see what it'll look like oops here we go so let's move this down all right so our container we're going to bump to a 600 600 pixels and then within that let's go justify content cfy content oops forget that comma again so we have justify content we're going to say center and then we're also going we're going to go up here and find that submit i'm going to find that submit button and we're going to switch this so that it takes up the full um amount of space and then i don't really want that to be centered either so uh well let me wait a second on that so i want to see what it looks like first so let's go back here to this containing div so verify that now it is taking up the full width right which is what we wanted uh and we could say let's let's say a line self and see what we can get here whoops is that the wrong one i wonder why it's doing that oh i know what um and so here's the problem is there an equivalent in flexbox to um a lion's self but let me justify i guess i can go with this div and let's let's just say um justify content i'm going to end that's weird yeah we should be able to we should be able to do this hmm uh what am i doing wrong all right about two more minutes till i go to the chat and answer questions so i'm messing something up here content in uh john hanson saying put the submit button in its own flex div what's the thing i thought it already was guess not reflexive reflex all right all right let's try that this will be the last thing that we do oops div styles let's go with display flex oops flex and then oops i'm gonna say justify content and what's up with this what's my problem here what's going on oops oops shouldn't have even say all right let's see what that did nothing hmm i'm gonna refresh to make sure we're clearing anything that might still be in here all right um oh michael cruz saying use flex end yeah maybe that's my problem yeah flex in it was that the whole time all right cool and then now i've lost my formatting for this for whatever reason this is not working now all right uh i mainly just wanted to see if this submit button would look better over here now that i see it i'm not so sure but my timer is up so i'm gonna put on this five minute timer just to see um if maybe we want to do another pomodoro session but for now i'm thinking maybe not we'll see how it goes in any case i do uh still want your opinion on what to do with with this form in terms of style so the only constraints basically are we need those fields and a submit button and it has to be like material design looking okay so other than that you know we do whatever we want with it uh so if you have ideas please let me know uh kyotik says react versus node versus angular so i would say node shouldn't be included in there because node can and usually is used with both react and angular so node is back end react versus angular i i mean it's really a matter of preference uh they're not exactly the same like comparable you know one to one they do some different things but i mean the only thing that i'll say in terms of difference is react is growing at a faster rate than angular in terms of like usage right but angular is still used so i haven't used any of the newer versions of angular so i really can't say much more about it uh john hanson also said oh okay so there was a question earlier about server side rendering with react john hanson recommends uh gatsby js so i had mentioned next js that's what we're using for this project but uh john says check out gatsby so yeah i haven't used gatsby on a project but i was pretty impressed with it when we we checked it out as a potential solution for this particular project uh lar lar says uh how to build a c plus website i have no idea i've never attempted to build a website in c plus in general though if you're going to build a website you're going to use html and css i mean html at the very least minimum right css if you want it to look nice if you wanted to do anything you're going to need javascript your any other language you're using is going to be backend so you can use whatever you want for the back end but you definitely need to know html css and javascript if you're going to do anything with the web carticas that says no air conditioner in your room yeah i mean there is air conditioning in this building it's just my room gets really warm i think it's because of all my my screens generate like heat so other rooms like other offices in my building are they're generally pretty cool but i just have a heat source in mine uh boo man says what do you think about redux is it needed for a small project no i generally i think redux is not necessary for a small project you usually the point at which i start considering redux is if i find myself passing props down like through a number of of children or like back up to the number of like parent and grandparent elements uh so if i need to pass things like three levels down or more i'm then i'm going to consider redux or something like redux otherwise just manage state the way react was was intended right just with local like component state um i think you'd be fine like that and you're gonna because like redux just adds all this extra complexity and it it will slow you down for a small project if you don't really need it if you have a large project redux will eventually save you time but there's a point at which it would actually save you time so if you haven't reached that point in terms of project complexity it's it's less efficient to use redux so hopefully that makes sense let me know if it doesn't okay my five minute timer is up but i'm just going to keep going with some questions right now okay michael krill says the form control is wrapping the select okay so that's probably why the select is not taking up this full space because it's inside of another container all right cool i'm glad you noticed that um anku says which language uh we're using javascript and michael cruz says i thought you said it was gonna end up being a modal the form itself won't be a modal but once you submit the form a modal will pop up john hanson says we can easily nest grid containers since they're uh flexbox um nested true css grids have a few gotchas okay cool so we should be fine nesting it i mean it looks a bit messy but you know not that many people are gonna be inspecting our code man my eyes look super red right now i don't know why i've been so tired i just can't recover from my my trip i i didn't get that much sleep like last week and i'm i'm still like exhausted all the time maybe i'm starting to get sick actually that kind of makes sense maybe it's like the early early stages of me getting sick i hope not but it's definitely possible uh williams says what program are you discussing uh javascript in particular react all right michael crow says you set a width on the items against uh the viewport set an absolute value for the container okay that must have been before we we did that so i think we that's in fact what we ended up doing uh williams says how can i become a developer i know the basics of programming which i studied uh in engineering um if you're very new to being a web developer check out freecodecamp.org and start to go through some of the lessons there they are very helpful and it will take you through a lot of the basics all the way into some more advanced stuff as you go on and that should give you a good idea of you know what you need to know and whether or not you even like working with uh with that kind of thing uh lenovo as how was your trip to new york city it was good so yeah let me i don't know if i said anything about my trip yet that or at least explain that much about it so last week i actually took two trips first i went to react rally in salt lake city and then i flew to new york in particular i was in williamsburg brooklyn brooklyn is a section of new york city and there was a free code camp top contributors party so uh i was was honored uh to be one of the top contributors for 2018. so went there it was really cool it was awesome to meet a lot of these people that i had contact with online and i'd never met in person so that was really cool and there are a lot of people that were doing things that i didn't even realize that they were working with free code camp and after getting to meet him and learning about what they were doing you know i was wow this is awesome you know i i know your work even though i didn't know you um yeah so i mean some of the people i met you know uh moderated the forum and some of them were editors for the medium publication or uh worked with a podcast or worked on like the actual code for free code cam so it was cool it was really cool it was a lot of fun so we just kind of hung out ate food and stuff and and the whole thing was live streamed so you can check that out the the videos available uh on this youtube channel so it was a good cool experience and then i just the rest of the time i that i was there i i just decided to walk around new york and see what it was like so i took like during the day i i walked all around brooklyn and and just checked out as much as i could i walked around until my phone died and then i charged it a bit and then that that night uh so this would be sunday night i went to manhattan and walked around manhattan for hours and hours until my phone was about to die um so that was cool so i mean i stopped at a lot of places got you know food or coffee or something i had the best ramen i've ever eaten in my life uh in manhattan it was awesome that uh tonkatsustyle ramen was so good uh but anyway yeah it was cool it was cool to just get see what it's like brooklyn and manhattan are super different um yeah it's just so so different so it's kind of cool you know like you go to new york it's not it's not just all the same not all one city like each part is definitely distinct um its own like type of people stores like architecture it's it's cool it was really cool trip and salt lake city was a cool place too uh way different from new york but um but also cool uh cool place to be so uh if anybody wants to know more about my trip or anything specific feel free to ask me in the chat here or at some other time i'd be happy to talk more about it otherwise i don't want to bore you if you're not interested uh strata says the code is so blurry so if your code is blurry i'm guessing that it might be the connection so it should be i'm streaming in uh 1080p quality so in 1080p and i think two and 720 the code shouldn't be blurry but anything lower than that it's blurry so if you're not getting a good picture right now you can wait and watch the recording and you may be able to watch in full hd if you have a good network connection you know later on the other thing it could be if you're watching on a mobile device it's really hard to watch code on a mobile device so it doesn't really matter how big i make the code it's still going to look kind of small alexi says how to master css uh work just practice work with it a lot so you can watch videos and do courses on it which is great uh but no matter what you do just practice every day or as close as you can get to every day i think that's the key to getting good at really anything so that's that's my advice for css and for pretty much everything else just try to do at least a little bit every day cardig says angular has mvc so model view controller which is not in react is it important uh it it depends on what you want to do right if if your project lends itself better to that kind of architecture the model view controller um then then go with that like if not it so i mean it's really when we're talking about let's say like angular versus react versus vue or amber or jquery whatever else you want to compare it to right uh a lot of times we want to say like and i get these questions a lot like which one's the best like like there's a best like that's the answer right but it's not that clear cut it it usually comes down to what are you trying to accomplish like let's pick the tool right trying to asking which is the best between like angular or whatever you want to ask is kind of like asking what's the best tool right hammer versus screwdriver versus wrench which is the best it depends entirely on what you're trying to do right if you're trying to hammer a nail obviously the hammer is the best all right but if you try to take a screw and drive it into a piece of wood with a hammer it's not going to be nearly as effective as if you had a screwdriver if you have a bolt right like you're going to want to wrench so think of frameworks in encoding like that right it's not that there's one thing that's better in all cases it's what is your use case and what's going to be the best thing for you you want something that's going to do what you need it to do but not come with all this extra stuff that you don't need so that it's bloated right it may take you a lot more time to set something up that has lots of extra stuff that you don't need sometimes the best thing is just to pick the most simple solution that fits your use case even if that solution in terms of total features is way less feature filled than something else right you also want to think about like on your team of developers what do they already know right learning something new even if that new thing might be better is going to take a long time is it is that better thing going to add enough value to the project uh to to make sense and like all that extra time that you're gonna need to give your developers uh to learn it right it it doesn't always pay off right sometimes it makes more sense to go with the older thing or the thing that's not doesn't have as many features if your developers already know it if you need to get that thing out quickly right because you get the product out quickly and it works then you can move on to the next product right and make a lot more money assuming that you can fulfill all your clients requirements it doesn't have to be like i'm using the absolute latest cutting edge perfect thing it's do i fulfill the requirements of the projects right and that's what should be your focus should be so for me react makes sense for a lot of things one of the big reasons is i know react right it would take me a while to learn something new but there are some cases where even react is overkill and i might say okay for this project like i'm just gonna do straight up html css if i need some interactivity i'll do vanilla javascript maybe even jquery sometimes it needs to get loaded for something else on the page anyway and in that case i'm i would just use it right uh so that's where i think we need to look at that question sorry for like the the rant on that but you know i get i get that question often enough that i think is kind of worth explaining this um that it's you know these frameworks are not it's not competition right they often borrow ideas from each other and build off of each other and they are created to solve different problems uh so i think the tool analogy is is pretty good here right you just need to find the tool that is meant for your problem right and and not think that somehow there's one tool that's going to solve everything right and and sometimes it doesn't matter if you pick the wrong thing it'll still work right like if you pound hard enough you can get a screw into a board with a hammer but it's going to take a lot more effort and it's not going to fit us perfectly but it's possible right so you know don't be afraid of am i going to pick the wrong framework just get started start working if it's really the wrong thing for you it'll you'll notice and hopefully you'll have time to switch but even if you don't you could probably still make it work uh let's see i lost my place it scrolled me down automatically uh david as his react is still an ondemand javascript library yes definitely i think i mentioned earlier i see a ton of uh jobs that are asking for react experience so um yeah so you're good if if you no react if you're gonna learn react there are jobs out there stephen says any plans for using graphql yeah we are using graphql on this project so we didn't work with it today but uh we will work with it again in the future and we have worked with it on on past streams uh schrada says how do i get this code from the start stage um i guess you'd have to look back at um some of the like the earliest commits and then view the repo at that point and uh the the link to the repos in the description somebody says don't die i would try not to die uh i guess because i mentioned i think i was getting sick earlier uh strata said is the session over sir um the coding portion is over i don't think i'm gonna do any more coding today because i'm actually going to leave the office really soon but i'm still going to do questions uh aj asks any tips uh for making a sticky footer uh any way to point me in the direction to the one you use on your current site um so a sticky footer you mean like all right so i'm not exactly sure what you mean by that do you mean that you would always be able to see the footer and it would always be visible as you scroll or or do you mean that the footer would always be at the bottom even if you were on a page that didn't have enough content to push it to the bottom so i guess if you wanted the footer to always be visible then i guess you're going to want to set it to something like uh absolute position right or i'm sorry a fixed position right and uh you're going to want to set a fixed position right like 100 oh actually michael michael creel has the answer here so um so just check out what he wrote i'll explain it for those of you who maybe can't see the live chat right now basically you would um set it at position fixed and then you would do for the value it would be you would say top right for the positioning and then you'd use calc so calc lets you do math inside of css so you would want to say 100 vh that's viewport height so that would position it with the top corner down here so you wouldn't actually be able to see it but then you would do calc minus the height of your footer right so whatever that might be and that would bump it up by the height of your footer so then the footer would always be there always visible as you scroll down right so that's that's how you would do that if that's what you mean by sticky otherwise if you just always wanted it to be at the bottom even if you didn't have enough content to push it to the bottom you would want to put your content in one container right maybe call it main or something and then make the minimum height of that container be 100 vh minus the height of the footer and then potentially if you might want to take into account the height of the header as well depending on what you have the header set at uh modina says hello from bangladesh hey how's it going thanks for uh for joining us um let's see louie or luis how do you pronounce that in france anyway says hi from france how's it going um thanks for joining us michael says it must have been nice when you introduced yourself on the stream hi i'm jesse and most of them got the reference so yeah on the if you watch the free code camp top contributor party live stream when they got around to me which was kind of when they were doing introductions i was almost the last one i got on the mic and said hey you know everyone it's jesse from live coding with jesse which is pretty close to what i say at the beginning of every stream and uh a lot of people did laugh they they got the reference so it was it was fun uh vamshi says do you use sass with jsx you can use sas with with react it's possible we're not in this particular project but we have in past projects uh if you're talking about actually having sass like in your jsx code i've never seen that happen it's usually in a separate file michael cruz says except so uh this is earlier i said there's not really one javascript library framework that solves all your problems right um that's always the best solution and uh michael cruz says except duct tape duct tape is always useful in any circumstance so duct tape is quite useful for many different things john hanson says duct tape works on everything is there a new dev platform duct tape js that's a good idea somebody better grab that domain ducttape.io or something put up like a placeholder npm package called duct tape uh mammy uh let me know if i'm pronouncing that wrong but ma'am he says uh hello jesse i listen because i see now i will not get good at this i have to see it even with the desktop too small for me and it saddens me because i want to uh legally blind oh no um hmm i'm not sure what i can do um do you think if i made the font even bigger it would help or does it not really matter what the the font size is uh i mean i could probably make it a little bit bigger than i have it right now it needs i mean there's definitely an upper limit to where we wouldn't be able to see enough on the screen to really understand anything but let me know i can definitely try to make it larger for you now bomb she says all right enough talking get to work i'm gonna get through all the questions uh alex says hello from brazil i'm not sure i saw that earlier so hey alex uh kartik says how do i get ideas for a project in react i'm not creative uh if you just check out like app ideas or something like that like if you google that you'll see there are whole lists and of and websites dedicated to ideas for for web projects so check that out and you can just pick whatever one you uh you like he says i did that footer it's just some flexbox the idea is you set display flex on your container and a min height of 100 vh then declare flex 1 on the main item oh okay cool so evidently nikki said to set this up for the footer for this site thank you nikki i that was probably one of the first things that we did so that was so long ago i i've forgotten about that but thanks for that and thanks for explaining how you did it um gnas nas i don't know if the g is supposed to be silent on that but his gnas says can you compare css animation versus javascript animation uh yeah from what i understand which maybe is limited uh if you can do animation css performance wise it's almost always better to do it in css versus javascript okay but javascript is going to allow you to do more than you can do with css right although there's a lot you can do with css right you'd be surprised at how much how much is possible with your css so uh but it as a general rule if you can do something with pure css and it's it's not going to be like ridiculously complicated and it will be supported in the browsers that you need to support then you want to try to do it with css otherwise i mean there's nothing wrong with doing it with javascript a ton of websites use javascript for animation but you might get a slight you know performance increase if you can do it with css uh alexis says do you use css modules and react components are they useful um in general basically the way you see us using css here is pretty much the way that we we always do it so we do some inline css we do css and in javascript as those objects and then we also have just regular css files that we we pull in uh just by you know putting it in that the head of our page components sorry sorry for the yawn i've been trying to hold him back so anyway that's what we do with css i haven't really messed with very much of anything else i have tried styled components um i don't really have experience using css modules though uh as as a it's easy not sure how to pronounce that let me know and i'll try to pronounce it correctly next time says hi from nigeria how's it going thanks for watching let's see all right so nikki uh posted a a link uh a github link to a sticky footer uh demo and it was held for review i just saw it and approved it now so if you scroll back up it's not too far from the bottom but you'll see nikki's link so that might help anybody who's looking to do a sticky footer with flexbox uh javascript is here hey javascript how's it going javascript jacks did you asks did you see the updates to javascript.af i have not i haven't seen in a while so um in case you wondering what that is i own the domain name javascript.af and uh some of the live stream viewers have been working on it on the side so um in particular harshit and nikki and javascripter have been working on it so i will let you know more once it's ready uh but it's basically gonna be a place where you can check out news about the coolest things that are happening in javascript and you'll be able to check out repos uh and potentially some other stuff we have some more ideas for it but anyway that's that's what javascript af is uh miami says uh so if you remember we were talking about font sizes uh for uh mammy and says uh it probably okay so a larger font probably wouldn't um what i'm pursuing pursuing is to keep learning um it says i'm i'm retired i will keep trying though uh i could finally get good with practice okay yeah um just yummy let me know if there's anything i could do you know to help and i definitely you could definitely get good with practice you know it's it's just a matter of putting in that time you know uh as a says do you see yourself using php ever we i do use some thp uh when i have to do wordpress plugins and i've done like some basic file uploaders with php before uh but mainly i want to stick with javascript uh so it php is not something i want to pursue further i'm comfortable with what i know about it right now um and i'm not i'm not really interested in learning that much more about it you know not that i don't have anything against php but that's just not the direction i want you know my my learning to go in right now oh okay michael michael reminded me that so when i say nikki nikki is rook in the chat so they're the same person so that may have been confusing cardig says how do you remember what syntax to use when coding up a project in javascript considering javascript is confusing language for many people um it's it's just practice right so uh i think any language is confusing at first some maybe more than others but if you use it all the time and you practice you're you're gonna remember things uh so i i think that's really all it is it's just you know you have the practice it's gonna be less confusing you'll remember more you'll have to look up less and when you do look things up you'll be able to find the answer a lot faster because you you'll know how to structure the questions you'll know exactly like you'll have a better idea where to look for an answer and you can only get that through using the language practice you know okay all right i've got to the the end of the chat and i'm gonna wrap things up here i'm gonna leave the office soon uh so thank you all so much for watching and i don't know i don't know if i'll be able to stream tomorrow night so i may see you all next week probably on monday uh so either way i hope you have a great day and and a great weekend uh thanks again for watching and uh i'll see you next time
