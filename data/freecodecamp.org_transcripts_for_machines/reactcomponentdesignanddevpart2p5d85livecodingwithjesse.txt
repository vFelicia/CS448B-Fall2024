everybody welcome to live coding with Jessie I'm Jessie and today we're going to finish that component that we started yesterday so if you didn't see yesterday stream don't worry we'll kind of go through what we'll go over a little bit about what we did yesterday but if you want to see it from the beginning you can always watch the recording later on but today we'll we'll finish building out that component a bit make it look nice and then we'll actually make it its own component right now it exists within a much larger component but we want to put it somewhere else and we'll also grab some some data and plug in some real data and see how that how that looks all right so let me get my my view situated here and I'm a paste in this link all right so just pasted a link in a live chat that link will take you to the website and so that you can look at what we're doing you know while you're while we're doing it so it's hosted on my computer and it's using a service called an grub so that you all can click on it as well Oh Aniki says in a live chat just saying hi gonna go watch the football match alright thanks for saying hi Stevens here sis what's up awesome Michaels here great I asked nice alright cool so it looks like yeah we're getting a few more viewers I didn't realize I'd be competing with with one of the football matches so who knows maybe I won't get that many viewers okay Phoenix says was watching the Elector skill dev livestream before oh cool how how was that livestream I didn't get to catch it live yesterday because I was streaming and then today I didn't get to catch it either is it is it finished drought I wanted to start when that finished so yesterday I didn't realize what was happening so we overlapped but I'm gonna try to avoid the overlap for the rest of the week for those of you who don't know what I'm talking about there's another livestream going on this week on the free code camp channel and that livestream is all about creating an Alexa skill so that's actually really cool I've done Alexa skill development before and it's super fun it's something I definitely wanted to want to do again and make new skills so I'm planning on watching that that series probably will get to it live but I'll watch the recordings alright so let me switch up my view there we are okay so the link to all this code is in the description to this video and it's on github so feel free to take a look if you do happen to go to get up and want to check it out check out in the pages folder the component called major J s that's where we'll be at and that code should all be up to date so it should look exactly like I have it on my screen and what we're what we've built so far basically is just this so pretty pretty simple we had some yet some issues yesterday where we're having some errors but finally got it to work and here's how it looks let's go over here and this is the wrong page let me go back and back and back here we go there we go okay so if you go to that link that Ida sent you and then put in slash education then you should see a page like this hopefully and this section down here is what we've created it's a tab section and we want to display classes so right now obviously it functions it doesn't have all the content needed and it doesn't really have very much styling at all so that's what we need to do we need to get it some data do some styling and it extract it into its own component so we don't clutter up that main component too much okay all right so I guess the first thing what should we do first let's let's Express command its own she put in its own spot yeah at this point I think we'll be safe to do that let's take this make it its own component and then we can start work on the styles this is just it's starting to get just a little bit bigger than I that I normally like so this is I think a nice size for a component if you have something really complex going on it's understandable that you'll get bigger than this but it's always easier to at least from my opinion it's easier to work with smaller file sizes and just switch back and forth between them okay all right so I'm gonna go in to my components folder I can find it let's shrink that up there we go all right here's our components folder and I'm gonna add a new file and let's call this sample schedule Dutch is yeah sample schedule j/s and I'm gonna throw this over on this side so we'll have them side by side and I'm I'm gonna start out by copy and pasting everything all right that might seem a little bit weird like we definitely don't need everything but I find it's easier to copy and paste everything and then remove what you don't need then to try to copy and paste piece by piece so what we'll do first is like we can get rid of a surprise yeah let's get rid of this first because we won't need that we'll keep state and with the syntax highlighting that we have sometimes it'll help us to figure out what we need and don't need all right so what can you take out here we can actually we can take out all this query stuff yeah all of that can go so you see it's gonna be way you know cleaner and we can get rid of this return and even that layout right cuz what we'll have is just this this div here that's wrapping everything and we'll keep these and we can get rid of this query and get rid of that and we definitely can get rid of this and in this layout and I believe we can get rid of this as well double check that yep so that that works and let's change the name of this to instead of major we're going to name we need to name this after the component so we'll call this sample schedule sample schedule we don't need a yes I don't know why it's like that alright so sample schedule I'm gonna save just so it'll give me the right indentation and get rid all that red there we go alright great and now like I said with that syntax highlighting it automatically shows us what what we're not using so now that I've taken out the stuff in the bottom it's easy to just remove these things we know now what we don't need right and there we go and I probably could do without all this they do with thongs hmm looks that's it say any expect consistent spacing spacing I don't know that we need this but I'm gonna leave it in there for now I don't think it'll hurt anything and we actually we don't need these styles right now like this root style but I'm just gonna leave it here because we're gonna be adding some styles in alright so now what we're left with is something that is a lot cleaner you know easier to deal with oops we can take this out too forgot to take that out and that since we've taken that out can we take this div no they will still need yeah we need that in closing dev there we go alright now we have nice and clean just what we need if we really wanted to we could probably extract out even more and we'll see what happens as we build this out if it starts to get big you know maybe we'll do it not 100% necessary I don't think at least not yet so now we have our component so for those of you who are new to react I'm gonna go really basic here for those of you who have used it before just you know bear with me and be patient but now that we have taken this out like how do we use it in this this other component which will be our parent component so the first thing that we can do and we will do is we're gonna remove a lot of this so we get rid of that and in its place we can just say sample schedule okay for now we're not gonna pass any props but eventually we will need to pass it some data and we have this little line depending on how you have you added or set up you may or may not get this line but for us we could get this line actually I think I'm gonna remove this link as well or that that little code I commented out so when I go here we can actually remove these because those are now in this component and we can remove these because they're no longer needed but here we're gonna import video we're gonna import that sample sample scheduled component from we're gonna go to components oops sample schedule so now we've imported that so all of that code is available to us and if we go back down that line is gone so now it will pull in all of this so let's save it and see if we've done it right if we've done it right we shouldn't get an error and we should see the same thing that we just saw at the beginning of the stream let's check it out and we get an error I'm gonna refresh just to be sure okay contra property value of no we got this we got this yesterday major ridges yes 24 maybe I left value in I think I did I need to remove it there we go there's one line I forgot to remove that we had moved over here and that line no longer made sense to be there so let's see if that fix the issue Apolo cannot be property apollo undefined and alright let's see maybe I do need to take out hmm I'm guessing it has something to do with what I put in it all right so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna look at another component that we've made oops that's some data may be making another component I just looked over I'm gonna look over at the chat and see if anybody caught my mistake yet before I try to fix it here Michael asked if I started the timer I do it's about 12 minutes left okay all right so I do see your comments and I'll get to them as soon as the timer goes up I didn't see anything about what's going on here okay so let me check let's check this again see if I can see what's happening hmmm alright what was my oh I know what I was going to do to try to figure out what to do so I'm gonna look at my components and I'm just gonna pick you know any of them really it doesn't matter and we'll see what we're doing here so it looks like yeah we definitely don't need a Paulo do we even need we don't need with roots and so styles do we need with data no probably not then get rid of these and then down here we can get rid of this there we go all right that should should fix it so we were basically importing and trying to do some things here in this component that we didn't really need to great okay now it works we'll scroll down hey we have the component right so here we have your three or four awesome awesome cool so now it's in its own component the nice thing about this too is if we wanted to we could reuse this today which I'm not sure where we'll reuse it right now but it's a large project so we may find a use for this at some point and if that happens all we have to do is just import let's get rid of this just import sample schedule and then pop it in so I I definitely if you're doing react I definitely recommend breaking things out into their own components whenever that makes sense to do it so now that we have this kind of broken down here what we want to do is we want to do next I think it's actually put in some data I think it's better to have real data or the least realistic data that's going to accurately represent kind of the amount and size of the data that you'll have before I go into styling because some things might change if we get a lot of stuff in there positioning a thing it just we're not really sure how it's gonna look until we get the data in there so that's the next step for that I think the easiest thing would be to use the WordPress REST API to just pull in some JSON data and I'll copy and paste that you know right into our component and then use that data okay that's not how we'll actually do it when we make this live but it'll be a really quick way for us to get get something in there and not have to type it out ourselves let's go over here and just close some of these out so we can go W key we should be able to know what is that WP JSON I can't remember what the end point is alright let's look up the end point cuz I just totally can't you know what we have in our code already we'll grab it from our code why is there an for just our search page where we are using the REST API there we go there's our end point so let's grab that and if we put in our end point into a regular browser will be able to see data all right so here's a lot of data way more than we really need but let's see if we can get let's see if it'll be on here already sample course great see so it this the screen that it gives you but you know automatically shows you all your routes and everything so we're gonna go to sample courses and that I don't narrow it down for us for a sample course and this should give us all of the sample courses all right great so you see we have our data and this is the part of the data that I'm really worried about here so we'll probably grab a little bit more because I'll need the title but then everything else you need to stay in here let's see yeah let's just grab this one grab the whole the whole thing and then once we paste it will get rid of what we don't want so we've we should be able to just go in here we'll make we'll call this course data and then we're gonna make it to make it as close as possible what we're really going to see it's going to be an array of objects why is it expecting oh you know what I accidentally I didn't realize that I was already pasting in this bracket so let's try that again okay great so even though we're only gonna have one object here like we may end up having more than one object so this is what we're gonna deal with so I'm gonna remove a lot of this just to make it easier to it to work with there we go we want that ACF data there we go and there we go you can get rid of all of that what's this do we keep we have one too many brackets here too okay let's close maybe it's just complaining about that unexpected so again okay I think he was just complaining about the trailing commas hopefully that wasn't no still mmhmm expected late they really expected the comma yeah I mean it looks okay in terms of how many brackets we have all right anybody see that what did I let me take my timer all right two minutes okay it's in about two minutes I'll go back and answer questions in the live chat for now let me make this a bit bigger here on the screen and try to figure out what my error is No so it's possible I messed something up when I was copy or when I was removing content ACF and within there's year this would be a bit better if the indentation was correct so let's see actually where is this okay year it is another array okay that works okay Julio says all shift f2 format thank you it's not working for me oh [ __ ] is it different for a Mac oh okay what do we have now that should match up spring semester there we go command shift P is for okay let's try that command shift P formats I what is this I never I do not know what these symbolize I can never remember what this okay Control Alt be great can't control I'll be I still not formatting it all right then oh well my times up let's do a short break I'll go back to the chat and answer some questions and then maybe I'll realize what I'm doing wrong here all right Albert Marsh says how long do you finish this project sorry if you answered this question before all you had no problem the project's not ever really going to be finished it's just gonna have a launch date and then after that we're gonna make updates to different sections so a lot of what we have on the site now is old fragments of HTML from from the old site it's not really ideal but we don't we don't have time to design and develop new suffer everything right so we want to launch first with the content as is and then develop but I'd like to launch by the end of this month or I don't know like early August so I'm gonna have I'm gonna serve you my wrist on the 20th of July I don't know what my recovery times gonna be like if I could have it launched before then that would be awesome but then if something goes wrong I don't really know how much I could do so I don't know if it makes more sense to launch before or after my surgery so I yeah so I don't really know but I would I would say it's it's going to be launched within the next month it's at some point and then after that we'll probably work on some other projects and this project and just kind of bounce around unless there's some other big thing that I'm gonna get assigned to work on which definitely could happen Phoenix says I'm competing with FIFA World Cup semifinal and the transfer news of Ronaldo from Real Madrid alright well I've no wonder I don't have as many viewers as I had yesterday right that's what I'm gonna blame on the lack of yours I'm gonna blame it on that and not at all on me hey in this year how's it going I feel like I haven't seen you for a long time maybe just because I had the vacation and everything and but I'm glad you're here how you doing oh let me answer your question I'm doing I'm doing it well I actually am feeling really well lately so but anyway how are you doing how you doing oh no Boone savage says hi started back on 100 days of code again last week awesome awesome good job with that keep us updated see Stephen says hi I'm new to frontin can I get started on react yeah it depends on how much JavaScript you know I feel a basic understanding of JavaScript you may be able to get started with some basic react and just kind of learn and build your skills up with JavaScript and react as you go you also want a basic understanding of HTML and CSS so the more you understand about JavaScript HTML and CSS before you get into react the easier it'll be to to learn it not impossible to learn without those things but it's you're just gonna have to learn them all at the same time Albert Maher says you should update visual studio code so you could get the outline feature I thought I was up to day off to check that will services this is in response to the question about getting started with react says if you are really new do the free code camp stuff then go do the 7 day free trial treehouse web design track ok cool yeah that's definitely good advice if you really are starting out yeah definitely check out free code camp I haven't checked out anything on treehouse so but I've heard good things about it so check that out as well treehouse is a paid program so you know you can do the free trial but free code camp if you didn't know from the name is entirely free all right I didn't get through everything but I'm gonna go ahead and put start this timer again I'll come back and any questions that I missed this time around I'll get you next time all right let's get back to this this code see what I'm doing wrong let's just try a deleting stuff and see what we can delete there we go this will simplify things so now we can see that we need a closing bracket oops no we need to close this and to close this right yeah okay not exactly correct do we need I think we need one more bracket here and that's gonna cover us here yep and so then the next thing that we'll need is actually a bracket a curly bracket then love a regular bracket right what happened all right and that's gonna be there can I read prep you know to undefined what are these areas for oh this is just indentation so I should be fine what was that thing was a ctrl alt ctrl shift B or something like that I'll control B I don't remember for whatever reason it's not Auto formatting for me but it looks like this will work since yes since that's all indentation I'm gonna leave it for now now we have course data so here's where we can do some fun stuff with the course data we can for now we're gonna cheat a little bit just to get some of this data in here so it'll be slightly different when we do it you know for real but we'll need that we have a spot for label no we don't okay so above all these tabs need let's do an h2 and this is going to be we're gonna say course data zero title rendered laughter right this course data oh shoot is it not of course they've there we go of course data zero right because remember that's an array and then we're gonna put its title dot rendered okay so this should display the title and we can I we can test that out right away just to make sure it's working cool here we go here's our title all right cool maybe you don't want it to look exactly like that but for now at least we're getting the data here right so we have that data and for these tab labels for now I'm just gonna leave them as is and what we want to go to now is this a CF year so we'll have this is gonna be a little bit tricky so within within each of these all right here's how we'll do it so let me let me make some some comments here to keep it straight so we forget that lets just code it alright so we're gonna drop it into into JavaScript script land here with these curly brackets so what we put in here is going to be JavaScript so we're gonna take course data zero and we're gonna say dot a CF and then within that dot a CF will have year spring semester forces that's actually kind of weird do I only have two years I must have picked one that only had two years all right not a problem we're only gonna have two years for this one we can always yeah let's just copy and paste this data more because I'd really like to have all four years so let's see there we go so let's just add in another two years there we go okay so we're gonna remove this stuff and in here we'll go dot year right and year is an array of objects so we can say dot map is that year years it is year okay so we'll just say we're gonna say year and we're gonna make an arrow function here and then whatever we have inside of this arrow function is going to be automatically returned so what we want to return automatically then is it's actually this this value equals right so let's copy this for now is it going to let me do that opening curly brackets let's let's put in see if this this helps so we're gonna put in some parens here which will basically keep up with this Otto returning let's see I put my friend in the wrong place so you don't want it there I want it we're here yeah and then one about this one oh man he's uh you're starting to get crazy all right so this should be yeah these two should match up all right I'm not getting the air anymore great who all right not sure what's going on there don't know why it doesn't like that might not be able to do brackets right after so and I might not I not need to do brackets right after I could do alright let's get rid of this for now to have is so within this arrow function I still need disprin all those formatting is getting me it's just like it's just crazy today to figure out okay so and then that we have and then I should have okay so these are reversed okay but then now I see no trailing spaces not allowed okay it's that work huh are we good all right all right cool okay so this is actually working it looks like it's not working but I'll explain this in a second so it's looping through each it's looping through that data and since we have four objects in the year array we have this four times right now why is it doing all the class stuff because we haven't actually plugged in any of the data yet right but this just shows our loop is working it's looping through the data correctly all right so it's always good to test things like as often as you possibly can because then it's way easier to figure out what went wrong if you know like okay I only changed this one line well if you go through and change 50 lines and then try to figure out where the problem was it's a lot harder to debug right all right so now that we have that let's change this to year and index so what I'd like to have in here is just call it index so it's really obvious so when you use map your second your variable whatever here is going to be your index number so we need the index here because we want to put that value in here okay so that's going to match up to each tab having its value and that's tied in with our state and that's how we know when we click on a tab it changes the state all right and that value determines what content is shown all right so each container corresponds to one item in that that index one item in that array so let's switch this up and call this index okay so that's going to get the index variable now and then down here we'll have this is where it's gonna get tricky we're gonna have some some nested Maps here so within this this container div we have to well within the the grid container actually which can we take out this div I think we can I think we needed this div before but we do not need it and great so we can just go with this grid and the lines are just for indentation let's pick there we go okay so within our great container we have two sections right to grid items and these represent our two columns so for each column this we're gonna have I I think that we're always gonna have these two columns so what we'll do is we'll leave the columns and we'll leave the grid items in here and we'll leave the section and we even you leave the UL and we'll leave the headers so we can then go through and say year and we can go with the index right all right so we want to use the the index value right to go right to that that object in the Year array that we're dealing with what is it is so sweet so good there we go and then within that let's check our data so we get the right place so right now we're in year and let's assume we're on 0 in the index so in this first object now we want to say fall semester courses right in fall semester courses actually you know what we right now don't have data for the titles all right so we can hard code these actually we're gonna hard code them now if we come upon a use case where we need to put something different then maybe we can we can do that but I believe we can hard code this so and I messed up the braces I just saw yeah so that wouldn't have worked as I wrote it anyway but we can put in for fall semester and then let's add let's add this here so we can do spring semester and like I said I think this should work for everywhere where we use this if not we can always go back in here and make these variables and add that in as an option for users to enter into our WordPress you know content management and then we'll grab that with the rest of our data as well but for now it should work now here is where we need another map okay so we want to map through and I should just get rid of all these we're gonna map through these these allies so we're gonna go back into JavaScript land and we're gonna say Year and here's what we're gonna want to use that index and then we're gonna say dot and what was it fall semester courses and dot map and now we'll say course all right of that arrow function and we can just have the Li and put in see the data course why is it like this missing key oh yeah I definitely need a key prop and for the key prop I'm just gonna put it in course because we don't we don't have anything else the courses should be unique they're not they're not gonna be unique they'll be unique according to that particular map right that so you can also you can do a lot of different things for your key but for now this is what I'm going to use for this particular key I guess it wouldn't be a bad idea to just do course and let's go plus index okay we'll do it like that all right great and then we can copy and paste that down here and just change this to your spring assuming I didn't a mess right yep spring semester courses okay let's save that see if I if I did it right and the layers down here so far that's good whoops fall semester courses of undefined all right what's undefined so year index and I forgot to put a CF so no wait no a CF is within the year so it shouldn't work it just should have maybe is that the first time we used our index I thought we use index here at words maybe let me check my timer only have another minute left maybe I have this backwards maybe index should be first I don't think so but don't take a second to try it yeah that was it I think well let me doublecheck okay well what am I getting nothing gave me no data all right here we go can are you property fall semester courses of undefined let's make let's clear this out and give it a refresh all right this week all right well my time is up let me give it a fiveminute break and then we'll go back to it so we'll debug that let me come back and I need to keep an eye ok I'm tying on on time I need to leave in an hour so I'd say an hour is plenty of time for us I'm gonna scroll back up to where I left off in the chat and just keep on going Phoenix's how do I get the difference between my github repo and my local repo I tried get diff master and they returned nothing and then get pulled two changes does it tell you if you if you do get status I don't know cuz I'm not I'm in sync with with this one otherwise I checked I don't remember offhand git status might let you know if you're ahead or behind the master branch but I'm not 100% sure on that Christopher says you should install plugins that automatically import files you need so that you do not have to keep looking stuff up all the time you know what I I have a plugin like that installed on my laptop I think so cuz I thought I had it installed obviously I don't here so it must be on my laptop so yeah I'll just I need to have that in there it's not a huge deal normally but it definitely does save a little bit of time Stephen says stop yawning get yourself some coffee I had coffee I just I drank the last bit of it but I also have G fuel so maybe I just I'll drink some of that right now Stephen says just Twitter message to you some of the sites that I built check them out let me know what you think if the stream sees it's cool alright cool off to check these up see the messages oh hey also I forgot to mention I was on my first podcast and it was they put it out today so I did the podcast interview last week but if you want to check it out just go to my Twitter I believe my Twitter is linked in the description go to my Twitter I did retweet the the tweet that announced the podcast so check it out if you get a chance let me know what you think it's the this old app podcast alright I'm ringing up some of those websites on my other screen here all right let me go through while those load let me go through the other questions world says why doesn't process and dot note him ever work for me I always have to hard code a port 3000 or something I'm not exactly sure I think I would probably need more information to try to figure out why that that's not working all right innocence I'm doing well I'm happy to see you yeah for sure I'm happy to see you in here to cat D says what happened to your wrist did you get carpal tunnel no it's actually I don't think it's carpal tunnel but so last July so a year ago I was in a swimming pool with my kids and I was throwing them like up over my head as high as I could right they loved it my wife did not love it but I just kept throwing them and throwing them and my arms are getting really tired so I went to throw one of them and my muscles were just way too relaxed and my wrist just bent back right so you know they were like sitting right here my wrist bent back and I just felt its pain and I'm like I'm fine you know so I just kept going right it hurt a little bit but I just kept throwing them and I let it go for a long time and thought it'll get better finally after like months I went to see a doctor got xrays they couldn't figure out what it was sent me to a physical therapy I did physical therapy for weeks maybe months I don't remember didn't get better they sent me for more I think it was an MRI after that couldn't figure out what happened gave me an injection that made me feel better for about two weeks and then I said all right well I'm just I'm gonna let it go I'm too busy now because the next step was surgery and I say love you know I have too much going on so I let it go for months before I contacted the doctor again it takes forever to get in to see this doctor because the doctor is in Pittsburgh and if I go to Pittsburgh to see the doctor my insurance won't cover it but like once a month the doc comes to where I live Steubenville and if I see him when he comes to Steubenville my insurance covers it so every time I go to make an appointment with the surgeon I have to wait like two months to get in so went back to him and finally said okay let's do the surgery so then to try to schedule the surgery of course took forever so I'd schedule it like I don't know like four months in advance or something crazy so anyway they're gonna go in and just try to figure out what's wrong with my wrist so I think they're gonna cut my wrist open put a little camera in there figure out what's wrong and then I don't know what will happen if it's if it's minor and they can fix it right then they're gonna fix it so I'm I don't know what to expect in terms of recovery time or because they just haven't been able to figure out what's what's actually wrong with it so anyway sorry for the long story of my my wrist hurting but I just I mean I it may be that I can type in everything after it I don't really know just have no idea what what to expect all right cool i actually got through everything i went over a little bit on time here let's reset this timer and we'll do I don't know if we'll need this whole Pomodoro session or not but we'll reset it just in case I can't get this working and I see gifted fingers says hello from Detroit hey how's it going welcome alright so we were okay it wasn't finding the data correct is that the problem yeah no we're not getting errors right we're not even getting errors are we getting errors here I thought we'd get an error message that's weird all right let me check what I have here okay so this part no it's not even working returned all right it did work before I put this in this in it it did work right it displayed things four times I see okay all right let me think about this okay so I don't all right let's let's see if there's anything there at all so inspected just went close to yours alright looks like there's nothing else there at all let's check react I so index sexy a little bit odd hmmm alright so I think the issue is with what we're doing here let's let's just take this out quickly just to verify that that is actually where the the issue is can I read fall semester courses I'm undefined Christopher Brown says you have index and year in the wrong spots okay so we did we did flip this oh that's right okay so I forgot that we flipped that just to test it out and I don't think that was the problem I was like that yeah the same same thing hmm missing key prop yeah I should put a key prop here and we can just call this I really wanted to be oh okay Christopher you you are right I don't think we need to do index so I'm not sure what I was thinking let's see if that makes a difference objects are not Valadez react shallow found objects with keys of course 48 oh okay that's an object can just do course it needs to be wait a second Oh course dot course I need to of course dark horse oh yeah okay so we got them now all right yeah good good eye on that Christopher I remember putting that year in there but I can't remember why I did yeah it's at some point I thought you're just gonna I don't know what I was thinking but anyway yeah we don't the whole point of the map is that you don't have to mess with like manually doing the the index on those things anyway all right so let's try what we had again over here which was value so we had this return and then with in the return we were trying to get value you goes index and and then we're trying to return whatever that is okay so spaces inside so we're trying to find out if the value is equal to the index then we're gonna render that now I'm not I don't think this is gonna work but we'll try whoa it worked awesome all right that's really cool what I was afraid would happen is that it would take when it rendered this it would just say the value of index is zero so we'll render here but then the next time through the value of index actually now that I think about it this worked out really well and I don't I don't know why I worked out so well you thought you lose index yeah I don't know anyway it works that's all that matters so it works how I hoped it would or not how I thought it would okay all right what's the key yeah all right so right now we are having an issue with with our keys with the same keys so that's happening because we we do have these duplicate courses so and you know we're not gonna get away from that because we have elective elective elective and I think we'll probably end up having a lot of stuff like this so we need to use something else as the key like what we could use you see in the data you know we're not really getting anything that could help us in terms of each each one of these like a unique ID or anything so we could do cages UUID you I there we go okay so we can use UUID to create a unique ID so let's try that and Wow there are a lot of versions of this anyway let's let's install this so let's go and for yarn add UUID and now we should be able to bring in UUID require I don't know what's up with all these different versions our version one is a time stand my name is phase version four is random he says what happened aversion to the 1 3 4 5 all right he says view has UUID built in each component oh that's pretty cool all right that's squares values and would you stir this in to the key see this works cool at work so we have unique IDs our unique keys let's check and react so our key is we've taken the name of the course we could probably get rid of that that's that's a loan key these should be unique so we can see each one of these so I'm looking up here in the corner each one of these is a unique ID so let's do it just to clean things up a little bit let's take out course and now we just have this unique ID cool and that gets rid of all those ugly warnings and in the console cool alright so we have our data the the data that we have here in this format is the exact format that we will get it and if we go with the REST API which is our fallback ideally we're going to try to get this data through graph QL but having trouble working with modifying the PHP of our plugins to make that happen so this is our fallback so we're pretty much all set the only thing that we'd really have to change is we would have to change the course data instead of just going with course state of 0 we would kind of have another layer of map right so we would map over every object in course data essentially we'd wrap this entire thing in another map and so we could have potentially have you know multiple of all of this you know on the same the same page so that would really be the only thing we need to change and so now let's let's get some some styling so I want to just shrink this down to a smaller width so we get an idea how this looks on mobile and the first thing I'm noticing is I I don't really know that I want this to be a in h2 I think that's kind of like overkill what's up here I'm not able I'm not able to move yeah let's let's switch it up and yeah that's looking okay there we go all right so if we actually do go into device simulator here all right it's it's better there we go so it just does move all right so here's what I'm seeing this could probably stand to drop down an h3 and then we could drop these two H fours and I think that would make sense with the the hierarchy of the of the page so let's do that now let's get rid of that I don't need that alright yes we're gonna make this in h3 and then drop these ones to H fours and let's see what that gives us now okay alright that's okay I think that's that's good I think this is way too much space in between these two so let's do that and I also want to get rid of these bullet points so now we're going to actually get into our styles so we can on these allies we can turn it's a style yeah maker Styles up here styles dot list item and now let's go up here and make let's remove this roots and make list item right so this is one way to do styles in react okay so it's gonna be a javascript object and we're gonna put in what is very similar to normal CSS but a little bit different so list style I believe that's that's what this is list outside none let's see if that works great that works so we've gotten rid of this and then we can see let's switch back to the element here and we can now see on our allies oops there we go upon our allies it has lists outside none so it's actually transferred that style to an inline style that's pretty cool and it's the fact that it's an inline style is really cool in terms of like performance when it when all this is rendered serverside and the user gets that first load and that that first load they get is going to be just serverside rendered straight HTML you know it's you're not waiting for a stylesheet to load to get this so I mean it definitely has some advantages that way and it doesn't require you to manually go in and add those inline Styles alright cool so we have that the second thing we want to do is we're going to reduce the the padding just kind of all around right I don't think we need we don't need as much padding here we don't need as much here and we don't need as much here so what is our issue maybe the section oh you know what I forgot to add in section here so we're dealing with different markup for these and it shouldn't be different ok there we go let's see if that made any difference doesn't look like it for style okay so let's make some some changes here in dev tools and then we can transfer them over in our component so there we go so these you elves have quite a bit of of margin or I mean sorry padding where are we getting that padding from there we go yeah we're gonna set that padding to zero and let's see what that looks like whoops yeah let's sit up adding to zero now for are you ELLs so it'll be the first thing we add here so are you ELLs are gonna get style just like the Allies then we'll say style equals Styles dot list and list see we're just adding another item here and so now it should apply to both of these yep there we go and what is giving us this huge amount of padding here on top of it's not section all right so ul does come with some margin that we could probably get rid of who wins that H tag has quite a bit of margin so I wonder what would be better you know what let's try to get rid of the margin on these lists first just because we have it already set up this new margin0 nope we need a comma okay so that brought us closer but I still think this h4 is just way too much padding both above and below I'm sorry margin both above and below so let's see margin let's say from like four pixels is zero that's better I think we might be able to go down okay what okay and then these these days which are grids they also have padding alright but let's let's throw that margin on here so let's say list header is going to be margin for see if we can do it like this for zero it's not working no it didn't work because I didn't put it on there didn't actually give any any style to this age for style Michael I just saw that you mentioned to me about the section tag thing I'm sorry I didn't see that but thanks for for letting me know about it okay so our style is Tedder oops I forgot the equals can always tell when you did something wrong when you get weird highlighting whoops and that's supposed to be Stiles not something just made a noise use messaging me make sure it's not for work I don't think it is so they were good okay whoa okay it worked but that's not exactly what I wanted Oh okay all right maybe we'll decrease on these on these grid items will decrease the bottom padding to zero see how that looks this grid this grid item gonna be that I was patty wasn't it paddingbottom this is easier okay all right it's better I I don't really like the padding here let's quickly check how this is affected okay okay so not not terrible probably just need a little bit more here but I think what I'll do to achieve that is add add to whatever this container is for our tabs and we'll add in margin bottom and let's say a pixels oh no did that move the it moved the underline down okay so that's not what we want what we need then is perhaps the container the grid container is what needs a padding top of 8 pixels there we go that's a lot nicer so let's do that this grid container it's gonna give we're gonna put a padding top of 8 8 pixels and there's that good there we go style Styles thoughtless gridded container all right I the only other thing that I think would be good to do is move these tabs over so I'm not sure what's no that's not it it's the the tabs and stuff there we are okay this is what we want yeah what is this oh it's a space for the button that's why the skier rid of this buttons and can I go none I don't know if none is the right thing to put on there we'll see in a second okay that's that's better okay this is acceptable right now I wouldn't say like it's perfect but it's definitely acceptable okay sorry about that I definitely went over my 25minute timer on that one but it was just so close to getting it to look I don't I I think presentable at least at some point you amazed my experience there's always something some adjustment you can make at some point you just have to say like okay this is good enough and and just stop because otherwise you like nitpick at these tiny details and if you have the time on the project to do that that's okay but I definitely don't okay great so before I go to the rest of the questions I want to commit this so we'll do it's good we we just worked on this file but we did also change these and we added this one so you'll get ad will do yarn CM and that's our little helper to help us make nice nicely formatted you commit messages so this is a new feature and let's say it is add create sample schedule component and no breaking changes it does effect an open issue and this would be regarding issue number 102 I think that's what we had yesterday we'll go with that and that's it it should run through all the tests do some Auto formatting some testing and then we'll be able to push that up and then all the code will be available and get up if you want to check that out it will be there for you all open source free for you to do whatever you need to with it awesome everything worked and would it get push and that's that the next step notice I didn't close that issue because we still have one more step and that's actually pulling in real data so that you know that was real data at least part of it what we got was real but we need to dynamically pull that in based on the URL so that'll be a little bit more tricky than what we dealt with today but that would be the next step so I may or may not stream that step we'll just we'll see how it goes alright let me get to the chat and answer all your remaining questions oh wow not that many questions that okay that's actually not bad because I do have to leave in maybe 15 minutes or less all right Michael Michael ed the same idea with as me add the bottom margin to the tab header yeah unfortunately it it didn't work and the reason being like this seems like it's a border but it's not actually a bottom border this is an entirely separate element HTML element and that's how we get this effect of it moving right if this was just the border on the bottom it would just immediately move there would be no transition but we're seeing this transition here right and that's because it's it's actually you know an element you're kind of moving through there so if it was just a border margin bottom would have actually worked okay let's see Stephen says two days of to our streams what what don't forget to check out my sites just want to know if I'm progressing well I do have a creative department so I'm strictly web design okay cool yeah well I'm gonna take a look at those maybe right now on the on the stream all right Christopher Brent brown said you should do a material list yeah you know what we checked out yesterday using the list component and material UI and we decided not to because it thought we could just use the simple UL li if there's some reason why using the list component for material you I would make more sense here I'm definitely open to it but for now I just didn't think that I I needed that okay let me check out these sites all right these are cool I'm gonna bring them over onto the screen so we can all check out these sites so this is these are Stephens sites let's just let's make them fullscreen this one okay cool so Wow I really like these alright and these are WordPress awesome so stephenie's are then like WordPress theme theme work very cool cool nice this is nice theme for for Pittsburgh new definitely has those Pittsburgh sports teams colors going on there like that and that's cool I like this map you know I noticed though I'm not sure if it's something up with with my computer or whatever but it does that there's no labels there's no labels to see what the fill in here which I mean I can based on the auto you know complete it does it but and then this text is really small but other than that I really like I like how this looks I love this calltoaction button up here the shadows on that are nice and I love this style button as well very cool cool icons I even like the e these have like a subtle shadow cool once I love these V style button I always call these inverted buttons I don't remember where I got that from but I always I kind of like that very cool that's a nice background I said that's a nice touch really really cool Wow so you did a site for a company in Houston Portland and Pittsburgh all over the place huh that's that's awesome anyway Stephen I'm super impressed with these sites they're beautiful they're really nice so that's great that's really great font size 16 the only thing I would say is maybe consider bumping the font size up a bit on maybe to 18 if it fits if it works out I know this I'm on a really big screen right now so this is probably not the same experience that most users would have on a on a standard screen if there even is such a thing but that's really the only thing that I would say is that the font looks a little small like I love this size font I think that's great but these fonts look at just a bit small wow so cool so I'm not gonna go through all the other stuff in the sites but usually you put the most work into the front page anyway but wow that's really great work that's great work I'm like I'm palm Doug I just I love those sites all right I think I've gone through everything if I happen to miss your question I apologize you can always ask you a question in the comments and I'll check that out I don't always catch up on all the comments as as much as I would like to so if it's a really pressing thing you can always DM me on Twitter or on Instagram or send me a message on facebook or whatever okay see this is the amenities page is another big one with a lot of customizations so we'll check that out oh nice look at that that's cool that's really cool effect if I would if I can recommend something with that effect I might just slow it down a little bit I really like it but I think it would be cooler if it was a little bit slower and that may just be like my extreme motion sickness coming into play here that it's just too fast for me but other than that that's cool I love that I'm assuming on mobile that it would be so I don't see how that how that works okay cool so it's touch nice cool that's really cool I like that alright see you said yeah I need to figure out the transition speed that's next on my list cool yeah and like I said I mean it looks good and it might just be me the mobile click but it's having some issues as well yeah I noticed it's yeah but I mean I think it's overall the look is just really really really good I think that's amazing look for like for those particular businesses and what what that type of business needs to convey to their audience I think it's perfect the sites look really like upscale very clean and I think that that definitely appeals to who it seems like they're their target audience would be oh I didn't even notice you could do open all that's cool I really love that feature that's cool I'm gonna remember this feature if I had to do any list like this of the open Hall that's super useful all right you know okay I definitely have to hit the quit this dream now because I don't want to be late actually I have a haircut that's what I need to go to have an appointment for a haircut so I don't not not the end of the world if I am late for my haircut but you know I don't want to be late for the haircut there's people that you know that are hairdressers like they have their schedule in their appointments you're late you set them back then everybody else after you is set back in there playing catchup so it's not it's not polite right to be late so anyway I'm trying to be there on time so thank you all so much for watching and for all your help definitely a lot of you were helping I know Christopher stood out today especially more than more than at any other point and in your help as well and there are a lot of you that are always that helpful that we're helping out as well I definitely appreciate that and check out my podcast so check out my Twitter and you'll see a link to one of my last Suites was about the podcast that I did and let me know what you think it was my first time on a podcast so I'm sure I could have done better but hopefully it's entertaining or informative for some people so I'm gonna try to stream earlier tomorrow so maybe like 1130 noon something like that depends on how my meetings go but I'd like to do something in that in that range and then get a stream in before that Amazon Alexa skills livestream that'll be at 100 p.m. Eastern time so hopefully I'll see y'all tomorrow and until then have a wonderful day
