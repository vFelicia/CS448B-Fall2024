hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse today we're going to continue on with what we did yesterday which was editing wordpress plugins to try to get data from our custom fields to show up in the the data we get from the wp graphql plugin so since yesterday i was able to get some of the data but not the data from the repeater fields so quick recap on what i've done since yesterday and then we'll get into the code i'm streaming from home and my computer is just kind of lagging quite a bit here so i've been rushing to close everything that i can that i don't need so just let me know how the quality is i'll um i'll close more things as i need to uh if it's if the quality is no good all right so since yesterday i've installed the wp graphql plugin uh so this was a plugin that was in really really early beta uh so it's it's not finished but it is able to give me data from some of my custom fields which is good it's good you know some data is better than none but the next step and what we were working on yesterday anyway was getting data from our peter fields so let me switch over to my code and to show you what i'm what i'm trying to do let's bring that down a bit okay so what i what i have here is that wp graphql acf plugin i've forked this and this is the fork that i'm working with i've started a test branch and this is going to be where i play around and see if i can get something to happen so far the only thing i've done other than just trying to figure out what's going on by looking at all the files is i've added that code that we had yesterday that we tried to put in our other plugin i've added that here and nothing really happened which was kind of expected right why would the same code do anything in a different plugin um but i thought it was worth a shot and i've continued to look through the code that some other people were using and so here's let me just tell you what i'm thinking of the next steps to take and then you all can weigh in as well so in this plugin they have types.ph all right so in types.php they're importing all of these that they've created in in this folder of you know all these um so field type field group type so they're all separate files and they're importing that uh so just first we'll just check out you know here's the things that they're bringing in and then they're creating these functions and it looks like all the functions are doing similar things uh this one's a bit more complex and then finally if we check out one of these types all right we can see what they're doing in here which looks a little bit like what we were trying to do right so we have our our name our description right so not exactly the same but we like i don't know i feel i'm getting a rough idea of maybe what we could do so let's maybe we could get a side by side and that'll be easier let's do that let's make some space here and just compare okay so here we have two parts to this and it looks like we also have that here in our in our definition um what do we have up here it looks like we have fields and type and we also have it here it's just flipped around right so i guess we'll go with fields first so fields and then so id so we've spelled out links here but this is id so our type description the global id for the field okay yeah the these are very similar so i'm guessing that this is serving you know the same function that this is the difference being that this one is is just targeting one specific custom field and i believe that this is being applied you know across the board to any any custom field let's check out that type for a second all right that's interesting so this this does have a lot more yeah quite a bit more alright so we may not need that much it may not mean that need that much but you know maybe this gives an idea of like what's the other stuff that we're missing that would make this work and i never forget to start my pomodoro timer so i'm gonna start that now okay all right so let me let me say hi to everybody in the chat how's it going um let's see okay so looks like the stream is starting and stopping the um the video so let me see i'm gonna shut down my terminal so i had some terminal windows open on my other screen i'm shutting that down i wanted to keep them open in case i broke wordpress through one of the plugins because the uh the only solution if you can't get in the admin panel is then to actually you know manually change the files so i would need to to uh ssh into the droplet and change them but i could start that up quickly enough so that's shut down and i guess i can i don't think i have anything else open that i could shut down maybe a few things up here um yeah i do have an instance of slack open i can shut that down looks like i have google docs open oh actually i had two instances of slack uh web version open so yeah i definitely don't need that and i had sheets open all right okay that's better so got rid of some tabs open that are notoriously heavy on resources so hopefully that'll help out a bit alright um christian just asked how do you go through a plugin for wordpress uh i'm not sure oh sorry i'm not exactly sure what you're asking so i don't know if you could um explain it just a little bit more i might be able to answer your question savager red savage red i can't believe i can read that savage red says i wish i could edit live video i would edit that out uh it says what what stack tech or technology should i use for a modern ecommerce website uh it depends on your skill level uh i would say the easiest way to set up an ecommerce website that i know of that i've personally used is to do a wordpress site and then use the woocommerce plugin very easy to set that up if if you've had some experience with wordpress but i'm sure there are other ways out there to do that i can anyway can you do ecommerce with i know there's like magento is you can do with magento um i've never used it so i'm not sure how but i've just heard about it um so that's what i would say but it really does depend on what what stack you're already comfortable with because that i mean that's going to make a big difference on how fast you can get it up and running okay so let's go back here and let's mess things up a bit all right what i'll try to do let me bring some some things over so we could check them out i'm gonna rearrange things just a little and all right the screen's about to get bright because for some reason my github dark theme no longer works so i'm not sure what happened but it just doesn't work i don't know maybe i don't know if github changed a class name or something and messed it up all right so i'm gonna make these should get bigger there we go okay so this is similar to what we were using it's actually you know what it's not exactly the same i wonder if we change some of this if it would help yeah let's do that let's do that okay so this is what i was really wanted to look at is we have some of these extra things here in in this just that you know i'd like to try to maybe just add you know this see what happens um yeah i'm i think it's worth a shot to do a little bit more but um right now what we the code that we have over here is similar but not exactly the same uh to this so i think i want to take this and let's copy it over uh for now we'll just copy it here right in the same file because i it it may be that some of the stuff referenced here didn't work yesterday uh because it was expecting this plugin to be installed that i had did not install yet um the best way to do this is probably i want to show this in both places there we go all right so we'll have the same same file open on both sides that'll allow us to everything normally you'd be able to see enough text to do this but since i have it displayed larger for the stream i think i'm gonna have to do it like this there we go okay so i think we can change stats we could even grab it up here and start to change it let's try to change stats to links in as many places as we can see links okay and then now we can check and see if we have any other uppercase instances of this but i think that's it so links okay and then in here we will just copy and paste what we have right because our interior fields here are different there we go and then let's just compare down here see this is the big difference i'm seeing um inside inside of here yeah big difference okay so let's remove this i think we have this still um available somewhere so i'm okay removing it and i'm going to save that i'm gonna get rid of that on that side okay so now that i've saved this let's go with let's make sure i haven't changed anything i didn't mean to um we're going to commit this you all right so that should push unfortunately everything's really slow uh but this should push up to our test branch great that's done that now we can pull this change in uh right into our plugins folder uh if we ssh into that that droplet that we had so did i close it all right i have to log into digitalocean again hopefully it didn't sign me out yet i have to go into digital ocean and just grab the ip address and then we'll go in and and pull the changes in all right with the other plugin we didn't bother to do that we would just copy and paste it because we had one file right copying and pasting one file is not a big deal you just copy everything and paste ever you know rewrite everything but with this plugin you know we have multiple folders and files in this particular case we only change one piece of it but if we're making major changes this is definitely the better way to go uh because you don't want to have to be copying and pasting a bunch of stuff and um yeah there's much much more potential for missing something all right and good news is i was still signed into digitalocean so i should be able to just go right in here yeah and i know i sign in with root not the best thing standard underfunded terminal psp slow in your computer dom based renderers may improve performance uh sure improve performance would be good okay so now let's just go back a bit and then we should be able to go into um www.html um wp content and then plugins and from plugins it'll be wp graphql acf nice all right cool all right so it's probably covered oh no it's you can still see the whole path so i was able to remember the path uh since i had just recently gone there so now that we're in here we can do a get pull all right and now we have the changes that we've made and next step is just to check out first of all we're going to check out wordpress um because we'll know right off the bat if we mess something up badly it just won't even work anymore page isn't working all right cool alright so we can verify that this in fact was our fault if we go let's do um get check out master and now let's try again it's slow but all right it's working now all right so the change that we just made has um has broken wordpress all right i'm not exactly sure what in here broke it probably this from getting in a red line syntax error unexpected all right why are they expecting another uh you know what i probably messed it up when i copy and pasted it so one two three four that's matched um oh fields project label why is it like that all right let's go back and look here it shouldn't be like that right oh i copied too much okay all right so i yeah i definitely copied too much and try to paste it in here so let me let me double check make sure i'm doing this right okay so i just need to take out this let's make sure all right so this should this should work now uh let me save it see if it [ __ ] there we go all right it went away all right so that was the problem copy and paste error on my part uh apologies if one of you uh in the live chat caught that and tried to warn me um all right yeah maybe now i'm gonna check the live chat just to see if anybody's caught anything else okay christian um said clarified uh an earlier question um says well you want to add some functionality to the wp graphql plugin how do you review the plugin and find out how it works oh um basically i just i looked at the files i read through the files um i'm i'm not going to claim that i know how it all works but was able to kind of get the basic flow of what was happening i'm not i'm not great with php but i'm familiar enough with the syntax that i can kind of tell what's going on so that's that's what i mean by review plugin oh john said we need to screen capture that long long frozen yawn oh i can't believe it froze on that part oh no christian says there are big issues with the stream today ah what else what can i close did it start getting worse when i um when i went into this uh digital ocean droplet so i don't really know what else i i would have done that would have made it worse all right well let me actually you know what what i'm doing a lot with get it does slow things down so that could could also be a problem all right so i'm going to save this verify that this saved git commit and then once that goes up i'll just pull it down and then go back to the test branch to see if it
