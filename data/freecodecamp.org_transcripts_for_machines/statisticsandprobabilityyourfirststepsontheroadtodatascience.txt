all right welcome everybody my name is joe merlo we're going to go through real quick some of the install instructions and then we'll get through and start doing some expectation management those kinds of things most of you have probably done the install instructions already so i'm just going to cover those briefly a couple tools we want to have on our systems i tend to prefer using a tool called conda to help me do package management some specific libraries that we're going to install we'll walk through those we'll go through how we test for installation and talk a little bit about why we're doing things with this way one of the things that i often recommend read all the steps ahead of time get a sense that you understand what the steps mean some steps may say install thus and turns out you already have it installed so you may not have to do that for this tutorial i highly recommend using cond as a package manager because there are some libraries that are kind of sucked into this process that are not necessarily python libraries so some python package managers may not be real good for this conda has a virtual environment manager to help manage your virtual environments we'll talk a bit about what that means the material for this has been tested using conda but it has not been tested with pip it has not been tested with virtual and etc if you already have conda installed you can test that by typing conda on the command line and if you get something back that says usage conda you're good if not the instruction should walk you through it for this course material we're using python version 3 dot x when you say python equals three and one of the commands we'll do in a minute it'll give you the latest version of python um from my experience the most common problem that i see when people start to do this is they they miss a step right our eyes tend to glaze over and we miss things so if you have a problem uh scroll back check to see if you've done all the things if not we have a set of mentors in the room uh and myself we can walk around and help you especially during the part where we do exercises all right there are a set of instructions for doing this in windows and mac and linux you can confirm whether conda's been installed by doing conda or condoles this is high tech guys all right next all right so let's talk a little bit about what we're doing when we're installing python and some of the other things you're going to make a directory called stats you're going to change into that directory so now you're inside that folder and we're going to create a virtual environment at the bottom of this material i have kind of a writeup as to why virtual environments are important and how they can be useful to you and i'll leave that up to you to read it but the the big picture for virtual environments and why you might want to use one is that it creates a sandbox some of you have python already installed in your computers and you maybe use it for work and you don't want to corrupt or mess up your existing version of python or your existing libraries that use with python so the virtual environment makes a sandbox what we do goes in the sandbox and it doesn't interfere with anything that happens right once we've made a virtual environment we have to activate it and if you've activated a virtual environment you're going to see these little parenthetical off to the side to say you're now using that virtual environment and now using the version of python that you installed for that environment and then next we can say conda install and you can tell it all the libraries that you would like to use in this case we have five main libraries that we intend to explore all right once you've installed those we'll type jupyter space lab and hopefully a lab environment will open up if you do not have one let us know and we'll get you get you taken care of you kind of raise your hand i'm going to pass out some stickies as well in a little bit all right next we have class material it is up on github i'll put the links back up for those in a second you guys can go look for that all right as we go through the process you'll see these green postit notes in the material all the stuff i want you to do basically stops there if you want to keep reading you can go ahead but you can typically stop wherever a green postit note is for those who really want to know more details about all of these things at the bottom of this lesson i have a big picture description of why we use virtual environments what is conda doing why are we using it and all that stuff and so you can scroll through and read all of all of that content at your leisure we're not going to go into it all right so with that in mind all right i'm going to walk you through a little bit about kind of how this class itself is going to play out and the types of things that we want to do all right first off i appreciate pycon my family friends who suffered through me trying to get this material ready my company that helps to get me here booz allen hamilton the pycon tutorial selection committee the mentors who are here in the room who are going to be helping you guys and especially you for being willing to come out and go through this statistics and probability exploration with me to give you an idea of what to expect and what not to expect right we'll do an overview of some probability and statistics print so it's a tough word right it's hard english is tough um we're going to do an overview of probability and statistics principles and techniques we will have some snippets of python code i'm going to warn you right now the code that chalmer wrote for here should never be used in a production environment the things that i wrote are more to demo principles to give you an idea of how things work kind of under the hood they are not for true statistical analysis and i'll prove it i'll show you why there's going to be plenty of opportunities for you to level up your skills we'll have exercises that you guys can walk through and we'll give you a certain amount of time in this tutorial to work on those myself and the mentors will help you i will highlight a few of the gotchas to look out for things that you might be uh experiencing as you go through this journey on your own when you get back to your house etc and we're going to provide some resources to help you continue your learning journey when you go home what are some good books to read or were some good things to look at et cetera so what not to expect if you think this through a typical college class is about 40 some odd hours of sitting in a lecture hall lots of homework in between sitting in lecture halls we have three and a half hours and if we bring biology and taking breaks and stuff into this story we have about three hours right so you're not going to get a whole lot out of this my hope though is that you will get a flavor and that flavor will drive you to go home and keep learning um you are not going to get out of chalmer robust industrialized code we spoke about that and in terms of deep dives we're not going to have the time so some folks may ask some questions like hey i want to know a little bit more about these types of distributions and how these are related to that we're probably not going to have the time for a lot of that we could have maybe conversations about that outside of this i really want to give you guys this nice high level overview in terms of logistics pair practice is used in some tutorials because working closely with a partner helps you kind of identify what's going wrong and helping each other out i'm not going to force that upon anyone if you want to work with someone who sits next to you and say hey why don't we work on the code together or why don't we work through these exercises as a pair i'll leave that up to you and your level of comfort we're going to distribute out some postit notes for you when you get to the end of a period of exercises you put your postit note at the top of your monitor so i can look out when i see a sea of green i know it's time to kind of move on if you run into a problem you'll have a red postit note that will hand out to you you put it on your monitor myself or the mentors will look out and go oh red post it red post it and we'll come to you right so you don't have to do this whole embarrassing hey i got a problem thing um there will be a survey and i'll get you the link to that later i really want to get your feedback okay so how do we get the most out of this experience um i love this picture and let me zoom down so you can kind of see it the top and i apologize it's a small font it says how do you actually learn any new programming concept by changing stuff and seeing what happens one of the cool things about python is that you can try something run it and see what happens you go wow that was cool let me change this number or let me do this thing and you run it again and you get an instantaneous kind of response so i heavily encourage you play with things when you do an exercise and you get done a little early try and go back and do it again tweak something you're gonna have questions that might come up like hey chalmer what if or what will happen if we do this and i love to hear those questions those are great i will caveat that though with i also love to see folks have that question in their head and they go try it themselves because sure i can demo it for you but man how much fun and excitement it is to try it and see some cool response some people say well i don't want to break anything i don't want to do it wrong and that's a legit fear so i'm not going to minimize that but generally with python you're not really going to break much and if you do you can kind of reboot and often if you do quote unquote break a thing there's going to be some error message and you're going to skim it and maybe it's confusing but you're going to see new words new terms and you're going to start to learn things because those error messages as scary as they might look will often teach you things especially when you see them over and over again so try not to be scared there's a couple other things in here and i'm not going to go through them in the interest of time but they're there and they talk about the psychology of learning stuff but this quote here is kind of neat being a programmer basically requires you to deal with these extended periods of feeling like a complete punctuated by very brief periods of feeling like a genius right um that's my life every day i'm standing up here trying to teach you guys a thing but most of my life is i don't know how to get my code to do this thing and i don't know why and then all of a sudden it works and i feel like that guy on the titanic no right and i feel great and then my boss is like we'll solve this other problem now that that's done okay so let's get rolling let's talk about statistics all right so this is kind of the the main meat of the thing um i'm going to disappear behind the podium and grab those postits and have one of my colleagues pass them around all right and then i'll come back i'm still here voila all right everybody gets one green one red not one pad one green postit one red posted you don't know what he's going to do all right so let's get started this first conversation is going to talk about statistics right and what we can do with that and then a little later on we're going to move into probability okay um our main goal right now for this first little bit is to understand you know some techniques for counting things determining what the minimum value is maybe in a data set figure out what the maximum value is and then we will look at these things that we call central tendencies that the fast version is what's the average and we'll explore different ways to look at at that and then we will talk about well how widely does stuff kind of deviate from that average is my data really spread out or not okay let me try and blow this up a little bit maybe okay um we're going to look at the data and we're going to look at these techniques and these processes through a couple different tools we're going to start off with some simple data sets just a couple numbers so we can kind of visually see what the thing is we will then go through a little bit larger data set a little more sophisticated we're going to have some hand developed code that's chalmers do not use this in production code and then i'm going to walk you through a couple of standard libraries that have some functions that do what my code does but does it way better all right to kind of get us in the right frame of mind i'm going to use a i'm going to use that big data set that i mentioned we'll look at it and we'll display it on the screen in a graph and then we're going to use tools to kind of figure out what some of those data points are okay by hand as it were all right so let's pretend i'm a manufacturing plant and you know every day i produce a new batch of stuff on some days my machinery is well tuned and the number of batches that i produce or the batch that i produce has very few defects in it but other days my machinery is starting to fall apart things are breaking and all of a sudden i get larger quantities of defects so i may want to track these on a daytoday basis all right so i have this data and it is this number of defects i purposely kind of organized it so it's kind of bigger numbers at the top smaller numbers at the bottom they're not quite sorted but so we see some things like there's a 99 there's a 52 there's a 42. uh at the bottom we have some twos and threes and fours i don't know there's like 208 or some some odd numbers we'll figure that out i will warn you we're not going to do a deep dive into matplotlib i'm going to gloss over this real quick i just wanted to give you a graph but i use matplotlib here to import some capabilities that will enable me to make a very basic plot i also have a tool called the counter tool and we'll talk a bit about it in a minute that's going to help me count things and now i want to make a simple histogram a simple graph what we're going to do is try and start off by making this display and we're going to use a tool called most common which is found in the counter object and you'll see how that works out all right so i start off by taking all of those values that i had number of defects and i drop it into my counter object and that's going to produce a thing that looks like a dictionary but it's not quite and so i call it defect counts and then i say all right show me the five most common values that occurred in all of my number of defects so we run that code and so the number 8 showed up 24 times the number 6 showed up 24 times and the number 7 showed up 18. all right i mentioned that counters look a little bit like dictionaries there's two nuances that you should know they have this kind of extra method that we just saw called most common that allows us to find out what are the most common things and i can tell that i want to see the two most common items and it'll give me that or i can say i want to see the five most common items it'll give me more right but one other nuance that is fun is that if you've ever played with a dictionary and you try and access a value that doesn't access a key that doesn't exist your dictionary will vomit on you and it throws up this little error and says hey you tried to look at something that doesn't exist counters are cool that they don't do that if i try to access the number 77 which is not in my defect count it goes that's fine and it just gives me back a zero if i try and access a number that does exist like an eight it'll look into the counter and go oh there's a 24 stored there and it'll give me back at 24. so this is kind of cool and we'll take advantage of that particular functionality in a second all right so i want to create a list of x values to go on the bottom of my chart and i want to see all of those y values that are in my defect count the 8 or the 24 and the 24 and those things and i want to store them in two separate lists so i can dump them into matplotlib so for those who haven't seen it this is a list comprehension syntax i'm not going to go into it but it's very useful for doing analysis i'm not going to talk about these these are all just the things that we use for matplotlib and it's going to take all of the x values that we just made and all of the y values that we made and it's going to plot them all right and so we get this nice little chart and a couple things that we can see right off the bat where are most of the things low end right there appear to be two little spikes do you guys remember what numbers those spikes were at what were the most common values six and eight right um when we looked at the data and i said hey i got this stuff kind of organized there was a big number at the front it was a 99 and sure enough we see there's a little spike over there by the 99 turns out maybe that's an outlier maybe not right okay so this visually shows us a lot of cool things i want to figure out how do we get to some of these data points using code we'll start off with using count maximum and minimum what function do we use to count things in python len right stands for length so if i have number of defects and i drop it into the len function it will tell me that i have 204 data points and you can essentially count just about anything in python using len all right if i want to find the biggest value in a set or the smallest value set what what functions do i use max and min all right so let's do that let's take number defects we'll drop it into max drop it into min and we get that big value of 99 and our smallest value happen to be a two sweet all right a lot of statistics is basically telling you stuff about your data how many pieces of data do i have what is the highest thing what's the smallest thing one of the things that we often talk about like what's the average grade in a class or what's the average weight of people in doing this thing right what's the average of age of folks in a particular group python has tools to to look at that and when statisticians look at that kind of information they typically point to three main things mean median and mode mean is also often referred to as average and it's probably the one you're most commonly associated with so i'm going to walk you through how we can calculate means medians and modes using my lousy code all right so here we'll start off with calculating a mean if i drop a series of values into this particular function it will try and figure out a what is all of the a values added together and then it will divide it by how many values do we have okay so do that and so let's just use a really simple set of values these four things the average should be like two and a half if my math is right and if i do this one the average should be three right pretty straightforward anyone want to take a guess what the average is for our bigger data set any thoughts wow that's amazing well done all right all right now i'll show you in a little bit some other libraries that walk you through doing means and we'll talk about some of the benefits of using those all right but now i basically have an idea of kind of where is the average number and it's somewhere in here between 9 and 10. okay now let's go look at medians so median is a little interesting uh the point of medians is to find the centermost value if i've got 11 things it'll find whatever's at position six if i've got five things it'll find whatever is at position three right it doesn't really care if it's big little tiny whatever it just says you've got this number of things let me find whatever's stored in the center all right but there's a caveat if i have an odd number of things like 1 3 and 5 the 3 is clearly in the middle but if i have 1 3 5 and 7 what's in the middle and how we typically solve this is we take an average of whatever the two things are in the center and so my code will do that the nuance here is before you find whatever's in the middle you need to sort them so we're going to sort all the values we'll calculate how many values we have we'll figure out what is the midpoint and then we will return it if we find out that there are an even number of values we're going to do this thing where we we average we find out there's an odd number of values we just give you the center point all right so i'm not going to walk you through the code in too much detail you can take time to look at that if you want but let's just see if it works sure enough it gives me a 2. this one remember we have to sort first so it's going to move the 42 to the end and it'll find whatever's between the 5 and 6 which is a 5.5 all right and i know this guy's already done the math in his head right he knows what the number of median number defects it's an 8. okay so we can take an average which you're used to we can take the median find the middle most point mode finds whatever shows up most frequently all right for this library i'm also going to use counter to help us with this we're going to count all the values we will find whatever value shows up most frequently how many times it shows up and then we will go in using another list comprehension and if you're not familiar with these i highly recommend you go figure them out because they're really awesome we'll go and say all right the maximum number of things was 24 things showed up let's go see how many items showed up 24 times and this list comprehension will give me every value that had 24 entries in my count so let's go take a look here the number four is going to show up three times so it will show up most frequently so we should get back a four um notice just a nuance here with mode i choosing to return a list of uh of items because sometimes certain things more than one thing may show up most frequently like this list one shows up three times five shows up three times so i want to get both of those back so it's going to return a list with both of the things that showed up most frequently the one and the five um just a nuance about that right we talk about kind of the average most the time in our heads we tend to think of there is only a single average when you start talking mode you can have bimodal or trimodal data sets where spikes of things occur there's a book that uh that i kind of like for folks who are new to statistics head first statistics and they talk about this ages for this group of folks in this class and it's a class for adults and children to do like swimming together or something i don't know and when you look at the ages the average ages you have these very young children and you have these older adults and so your average age is very different and it's split right so that's the thing that you'll see in many cases with mode all right so let's go look at the most frequent values in number of defects it was 8 and 6 just like we saw earlier all right so a couple of nuances of when we might use these and and some of the the benefits of using them i've got a little table here mean you do this sum of the values and you count how many values you have you do the math this is most commonly used when your data kind of has symmetry to it and it has a single trend one single spike the median is often used with data that might be skewed a little bit to one side or the other and might have some outliers it's kind of a way of of dealing with the fact that your outliers will throw off some of your results and then mode it's different from some of the others because you can actually use mode with things that are called categorical data and you'll hear that in statistics what categorical data means is it doesn't have a number value like if i had a list of data and the data just simply said male female or the data said you know part a part b part a part a part b part b those are all categories right and so modes can show us what is the most frequent part that showed up what is the most frequent examples of things and you don't have to have a number for them so categorical data can be done with modes and it's also good for things as we mentioned that have more than one trend all right we did a fancy histogram graph but sometimes just having a quick frequency table can be really useful and so a frequency table would be something like this where it shows hey the value 9 showed up 3 times the value 6 showed up twice it's much like that counter example we looked at if we look at our defect counts the frequency table is not specific to mode it is the counts of all your values mode is highlighting the things that show up most frequently the frequency table shows up the values of all of them notice where did it go in my frequency table it showed up that eight appeared only once where mode is going to show me the things that appeared most frequently mode would give me the value 9 showed up three times or would give me the value 8 and 6 showed up 24 times does that help good all right so what i'd like you guys to do and i'm going to shrink this down give you guys a few moments to kind of start to wrap your head around some of these things um i'd like for you to calculate and you can use my functions if you'd like they're good enough for government work here and go through this calculate the mean the mode the median do a count on these things and go through the exercises and we'll give you guys a few minutes to do this i want to caveat this for just a moment though some people may not finish all the exercises in the time allotted that's totally fine go home reread the material do the exercises again finish the exercises you didn't finish that's all good just a little back story here right and i'll show you my list of books that i've read i've read the statistics books of various sorts over and over again and even in the course of preparing this particular set of material last night in my hotel putting final touches on i was still picking up nuances that i had not seen before and still learning new facts and details that had kind of escaped me so there's a lot to cover as we get further on in this in this conversation so don't hand if you're like oh man i didn't get all of it i didn't capture it yeah i still go back and reread some of these books and catch nuances so all right um we'll give you guys probably about 10 minutes or so and we'll wander around and ask answer questions uh again if you guys run into any snags is sure so when you have just one heavy some of your things notes all desiring right so i think it's been about 10 minutes all right the little microphone appears to be back all right i'm not going to do the entire exercise i'm just going to highlight one or two things so mean let's see grab some of these guys and say values right and this was a nuance that i think jeff had mentioned right if you have two commands in a single cell both of the commands will run but only the last command will display to the screen so if you wanted to have both of these display you have two options you could either put each of them mean and median in two separate cells that works fine that works fine or you can do some of that extra typing and you can put the word print in here for the first one and it will print and you can put median values so it will print the first one and then it will execute the second one notice we get a slightly different output print actually displays to the screen median values actually executes and is released as an output but that's a nuance all right so let's see let's talk about measures of dispersion how widely spread is your data is your data really tightly clustered or is your data just all over the map okay you will sometimes hear in statistical books about things like measures of variability how much does the data vary or measures of spread they all essentially mean the same thing a fast and dirty measure of spread is simply let's look at the minimum look at the max and see how far apart they are right and so that's what this does my data range function just says what's the max what's the min and divide or subtract one from the other and so with my little data set five three four two and one the smallest thing was a one the biggest thing was a five and the spread is four points notice with my batch defects the smallest value was a two the biggest was a 99 so my spread is 97. that's a lot remember that 99 is potentially even an outlier or something so here i can see that my data is really far away from the median and the mode and the mean right so this may be a flag or maybe something of interest it will depend on your data all right a couple of the downsides though of using simple spread are the fact that they are very susceptible to outliers here i have two data sets that are almost identical except for the last two values the 8 and the 99 you would probably say these these data sets are are pretty much the same and so when i have this one thing with this minor outlier man it throws everything completely out of whack and it makes it really hard for me to realize or to know that essentially these data sets are basically the same all right so how do we get past that that's where things called quantiles and interquartile ranges come into play let me zoom in on this just to smidge all right so you're going to hear some of these words these are the words that that really bothered me i never knew what they meant for a long time um a quantile is it's a cut point or a dividing point right in a sequence of values and those cut points will break those values up into what we call contiguous intervals or intervals that butt right up against each other so they have a nice continuous flow and those cut points are de defined essentially so that they break up all of your values into equal probabilities the stuff in this lower quantile has as much probability as appearing as the stuff in the middle et cetera et cetera quartiles are values that cut your data into quarters they are essentially a quantile that breaks things up into every 25 percent an interquartile range is a range between your lower quartile and your upper quartile normally that's between 25 and 75 although you might see them with different values all right so let's put this into practice and see what we got all right quantiles so again these are kind of these cut points um if i have six values and i've got a cut point in the middle it breaks my values into two sections that middle in our case would be the median if i have a lot more values i have a value 1 and 62 63 and 64 65 and 70. this breaks up my range of values into 10 quantiles and potentially if i want to kind of weed out some of those outliers i could say i really only care about all the things that fit between this lower quantile and this upper quantile and so i kind of filter out whatever's on on each end and that gets rid of the one it gets rid of the 99 all right so let's make a function that helps us calculate where a given quantile falls so i make this very simple function give it a handful of values and tell it where you'd like your your quantile to break and it will then figure out in a list of values or sequence of values where does that fall what is the index of that point and it allows you to get back a value from your list or your sequence again this is not robust code do not ever qualify this or use this in production but it's good enough for for what we need to do here all right so i've got a list of like school grades there's 10 values and i say hey i want to find the break point whatever is in the middle essentially trying to find a almost a median it sorts everything first 55 ends up at the bottom 96 at the top and then it roots through i'm going to caveat this right this code was not sophisticated enough to realize that if i have even numbers i should take an average between the two this is again just to give you guys a demo if i had an odd number of values 11 in this case we can use that as well but again it's not going to be very precise all right what if i want to find those quartiles the 25 value and the 75 value i take these grades and i say hey look for whatever grade is closest to 25 of this sequence of values and give me whatever is closest to 75 and so 67 is kind of the lower lower bound of the lower 25 percent of my students and 91 is kind of the upper bound of the upper 25 percent of my students now all right if i want to kind of see where my defects break out using a variety of percentiles like the lower 10 percent the lower quarter the upper quarter 90 95 and 99 i can do that and so the value of 4 is right at the boundary of the lower 10 percent value of 6 is at the boundary of the lower 25 we notice that value of 99 is way above the 95 percentile okay so if i were to say i only want to see stuff between the 25 and 75 i filter out all the lower end stuff i filter out all the highend stuff and this is a great way to kind of get a sense of what the middle of the pack looks like so let's do that we'll apply what we just created to to look at some interquartile ranges um commonly you'll see like 10 and 90 20 and 80. depends on what you need in our case we'll have a lower quartile boundary an upper quartile boundary and i tell it hey here's the values we're going to give it's going to use my function quantile for a minute ago and say 75 is my default value 25 is my not default or my lower boundary and let's see how this works it says chalmer if you give me these 10 values 3 is roughly around 25 percent of the way up and eight is roughly 75 percent of the way up all right if i want to then do that math and say how big a spread is this i just subtract one of them from the other and we see that 8 minus 3 is 5. so let's do that with my batch of defects and it says hey chalmer if i'm only looking at 25 and 75 your range of values was only six it's only a spread of six right now that function i created seems a little weak because it's built in it hardwired in 75 and 25. so let's build upon our function a little bit and let's give ourselves the option now of adding an upper bound of our own choosing in the lower bound of our own choosing okay and so i'm going to look at my number of defects but this time i want to look at everything from 10 percent all the way up to 90 percent i'm going to see how big a spread that is and here that spread is a little bit bigger a little bit wider all right so what are the downsides of using an interquartile range it seems like hey i can kind of filter out those those outliers that's good interquartile ranges they only tell you really the difference between a high value and a low value how far apart are they they don't really tell you how closely they are knit to things it doesn't tell you how frequently those high values occur or how frequently the low values occur versus how frequently the stuff in the middle occurs so we would theoretically want a method to more accurately measure variability and we'll look at that in a minute so we'll give you guys a break if people need to walk around stretch whatever you can do that as well spend a couple minutes here say five walk through calculating a simple spread calculating some quantiles and then calculate an inner quantile range for these numbers and of course i'll ask questions or i'll answer questions one nuance for this second one you guys should pay attention here we're going to use the range function to create a sequence of values from 200 all the way up to but not including 300. so if you've never used the range object to create a sequence of numbers for you we have that here this is how you would do it all right and we'll cut you loose when you're done put up your little green stickies if your green sticky is still up take it down all right let's get started awesome all right folks so if i want to bang out an interquartile range for all these guys i can say range 200 to 300 with a step of 5 for those who are not familiar with the range function the second value that you put range will go all the way up to it but it will not include that value and this third number you can give the range function tells you what step to take and let's see to calculate my interquartile range i want a 0.25 and a 0.75 but those are the defaults so heck with it let's delete that and we should get back a 50. and that sounds about right because there's about 100 difference between the two all right so let's talk about something way more fun let's talk about variances in standard deviation all right so there's a couple of different techniques that we can use to evaluate the spread of data that's a bit more effective than simple interquartile ranges or simple spreads interquartile ranges is good for fast and dirty it's very nice but variance and standard deviation are one of the the workhorses for statistical evaluation um one thing that you may be tempted to say is well if i want to get kind of figure out how much things vary i could take the average of you know what is i take the average and i could subtract that from each of my values and i get this average difference from the mean and that may look like it'll work but what ends up happening is all of the things that are above your mean and all things that below your mean cancel out i'll let you guys read the details we're just going to skip right by that let's talk more about variances okay um with a variance we do something very similar we have an average and then we subtract the first value from the average the second value from the average the third value from the average and we square that to get some sequence of numbers the benefit of squaring which doesn't happen in that previous thing that i skimmed over is that these all end up being positive numbers now they can't cancel each other out because some are positive and some are negative and so in this case i have these three numbers one two and nine the average is a four i calculate what's called the variance and i get this number 38 and that gives me some sense of how much or gives me a total 38 and then i divide it by 3 sorry math is hard i divide by 3 and i get a 12.6 so it gives me some sense of what the variance is and you may look in your head and you go i don't even understand what variance means because how did i get a 12.6 to tell me how much stuff spreads when my numbers don't even get up to 12. i have a one two and a nine and you're going to tell me quote unquote the variance is this 12.6 thing and so some of you are sitting there and you have this quizzical look on your face and that's the same critical look that everybody has which is why we go one step further we use a thing called standard deviation before i talk about standard deviation the nuance here though that you can get is if i were to change these numbers and spread them out a little further potentially my variance may get bigger my variance gets smaller so if i have two sets of data and one variance is large one variance is small the one with a larger variance is spread out more the one with the smaller variance is spread out less so the number itself may not jump out at you and you go that means something but numbers or variances from separate data sets can give you a sense of one spreads out more than the other but again variance is kind of this nuanced thing like people like i don't even know what that means so we'll we'll do a function we'll look at this happening and working and then we'll move on to standard deviations all right so i calculate this by using the total number of values i have a function that calculates the difference between the means i square them i will let you guys do this again this is not production code this is chalmers sitting in a hotel room um all right well let's try and detect or determine what the number the variance is for our number of defects and we need some bizarre number our variance is 80 and again that means nothing to me right i don't have a sense for what that means because no one gets a sense some folks thought this through and they're like is there maybe a better way and standard deviation is a potentially better way and i'll show you some examples of why to get the standard deviation you calculate the variance and then all you do is you take the square root of it it's pretty straightforward so i calculate the variance same way i get 38 divide that by the total number of items i get a 12.6 and i take the square root of that and i get 3.55 and again you kind of may be saying in your head i don't understand what that means the nuance is that as your standard deviation gets bigger it means it spreads more as it gets smaller it spreads less but we'll see some graphs related to this later that standard deviation fits very nicely on your graphs in a way that helps you to get a good sense of how things play out all right when we use data sets and we calculate a standard deviation one thing that they have found is that on a typical kind of bellshaped distribution a normal distribution and a lot of data tends to fall into that category if i calculate the standard deviation kind of how wide is the spread away from the mean 65 percent of all of my values are going to be within one standard deviation of my mean 95 percent of all my values are going to be within two standard deviations and 99 will be within three standard deviations so let me shrink this down just a smidge so we can see this all on the screen there all right so i have an average i have a mean in the middle i've got some sort of bell shapish curve and if i can calculate my standard deviation right here standard deviation above the mean and one standard deviation below the mean everything in this gap is going to be 65 of all of my numbers will fall right there in that that middle zone if i stretch out two standard deviations above the mean and two standard deviations below the mean 95 of every one of my numbers is going to fit nicely in that little that little grouping and if i calculate out three standard deviations 99 of stuff say well how do i use this what does this mean well much like we use the interquartile range to say let's drop all the values that are 25 percent or below all the values that are 75 or below or above we can use standard deviations to say i only want to see the 99 of the values that are closest to the mean and any of these little outliers that are way out there in the far corners let's ditch those or i really want to get kind of a little closer and i want to see 95 of my values that are closest to the mean and so standard deviations can help us grab those when we're using something like a normal distribution this may not apply with other distributions but it works quite nicely with normal distributions these bellshaped curves all right let's see this first picture kind of spiky the data is fairly closely clustered on the average this next picture a little less spiky it's a little wider and in this case because the graph is a little less spiky my standard deviation happens to be bigger and so remember i mentioned that like if you're looking at two different data sets and a standard deviation is bigger it means that data set spreads out more and so because this spreads out more my standard deviation is bigger but the same rule applies even though this spreads out more if i want to get 99 of all my numbers and drop off the one percent outliers i measure out three standard deviations and boom i've got the 99 that i care about okay all right so i've got a fairly straightforward and let me make sure i ran the variance formula earlier let's see so i got a fairly straightforward standard deviation calculation here it uses my variance function that i created earlier does the math i have a fairly narrow data set all the stuff's pretty close together the mean is five we have another one that's a little bit broader it goes from one to nine but the mean is also still five and so let's look at how these two things calculate out the mean is five my standard deviation was 1.4 this is a little bit broader data set still has the same average but my standard deviation is a bit bigger so now i can immediately go this one is a flatter bell than this one potentially right all things being equal okay how do you interpret that what does it mean all right the nuance here essentially is that when you're looking at your data and you want to kind of know i have an average how much does stuff spread out on one side or the other or both the standard deviation is going to point you in the right direction to say this is really close to the mean or these are very far from the mean and so in this case you know my numbers start at three they go to seven they're all really tightly clustered around the mean this one starts at one it goes up to nine they're spread further out i can immediately tell that there's a bigger spread between two data sets just looking at one data set and knowing that okay the standard deviation is 1.4 may not tell me a lot about that one data set but being able to compare them is really useful another thing you know as that number gets smaller and smaller it means your your your spike is a little spikier right things are narrower things are closer uh and a key role for the standard deviation again is kind of helping you figure out how do i get rid of some of those outliers how do i look at my data set and say i only want to see the stuff that's from like one percent all the way up to 99 and not look at the things outside of it or where should my cut points be to look at just the 95 percent where should my cut points be look at just 65 percent of the data and so standard deviation can help you with that all right did that help good let's talk about how real pythonistas calculate standard deviations and variances and those types of things using real python libraries instead of my hotel code okay we're going to look quickly at four different libraries and i will highlight a gotcha that may strike if you do not pay attention and if you don't kind of dive into the nuts and bolts so the four libraries we're going to look at there is a statistics library this is brand new in python as a version 3.4 it incorporates a sequence of statistical functions and it comes with python so if you download python all by itself you've got it you don't need to get any thirdparty libraries which is quite nice we'll look at numpy numpy allows you to build these array objects and allows you to do various fist calculations on these types of objects that are very fast as techniques and tools for integrating c and c plus plus libraries and fortran code again to get closer to the bare metal and make your code more efficient and more faster it has techniques to be able to broadcast calculations and evaluations against large arrays of data without having to write for loops and stuff and it's useful for like linear algebra and those types of things scipy library has a collection of mathematical algorithms it's got some convenience functions that are built on top of numpy because it uses numpy under the hood adds a lot of power to your python sessions and then we'll look at pandas which is a common data science library does data analysis and those types of things all right so we'll start off by importing each of these for some of these libraries it's fairly common to import them with an alias like import numpy as np it makes it easier to type some of the commands you might want to use later all right i'm going to start off by creating a simple numpy array and we're going to use my defects batch file okay one of the things that i often mentioned to students who are using a new tool a new library and they're making new data types i often recommend to them that they do a couple of things when you make a new object often tell them go find out what the heck this thing is that you just made and so i say hey what is defects and it says hey chalmer defects is a numpy array and if i've never used a numpy array i maybe need to figure out what that means if it spat out and said hey chalmer you just made a list i'm pretty familiar with lists because this is a numpy array and i don't really know a lot about what numpy rays right i might want to try and get a sense of what types of functions or methods are available to me so we're going to use a technique called tab completion and this is really useful in jupiter notebooks i type out defects i put a dot and i hit tab and it brings up this list of all the types of methods and functions that are available to me all right there we go nothing like moving your laptop in the middle of a talk okay um notice this is in alphabetical order right so it says things like all and any and da da da and there now we're going to the b's and the c's and the d's and this is a huge list of things that you if you are mathematically and statistically minded can do with a numpy array you can't do these with lists etc um we are not going to go into the depths of this i'm just going to kind of scroll through get a sense there's a lot of things here notice they do have a method in here called std short for standard deviation they have a method called var which is standard for vary or short for variance all right i'm going to start off simple and i'm going to say hey let's use the mean function and so we'll calculate mean and sure enough the average is 9.96 as this fine gentleman mentioned earlier a wheel caveat there is no median function associated with an numpy array the numpy library has a median function and you can drop your array into the median function but there is no median function that hangs off of your array which i found very interesting as i was researching this um so we say give me the the median and sure enough it spits out an 8 and that's quite nice if i want to look up the variance and the standard deviation without using chalmers crappy code we get an 80.8 and we get an 8.9 awesome let's turn to scipy i'm going to run all four of those mean median var and standard deviation um we get 9.96 we get an 8.0 80.8 and 8.9 looks good one thing you should know as i mentioned scifi kind of rides right on top of numpy so if i go in here and i say i like this numpy mean method but i'm not real sure how it works i'd like to know more about it you can ask this question mark and you put the question mark in there and they'll give you the help file for it so look at that and now we have access to all of the arguments that i can give it i give it my array and if i want to do certain things i can have it change its behavior i don't know what any of these mean right axis d type what is all of that well i can scroll through and it will define for me oh here's what axis means and here's what d type means and so i can figure some of those things out tells me what it gives me back it says i'm going to give you back this that or the other and you can kind of get some sense of what's going on might give you some notes as to other things you might want to look at to see if other types of calculations might be useful to you that's cool happens to be really nice and give you some sample code if you tried to get it to work and it failed maybe you look at the sample code and it helps you out that way all right gives you some caveats in certain cases this might be slightly inaccurate buyer beware okay it tells you where it pulled it from and it said hey you know what we got this out of the numpy library and it's from this thing called fromnumeric.pi which is awesome if i were to do this same thing with scipy.mean we see i can call psi pi.mean but interestingly enough all the documentation is exactly the same and when i get down to the bottom sure enough it actually just calls numpy under the hood so um like i said your mileage may vary okay the statistics library statistics library has mean median variance and standard deviation notice the spelling is different right they actually call it variance instead of r they call it stdev instead of std all right and if i run that what's wrong my numbers are different in particular which two numbers are different the variance and the standard deviation here are not the same as the ones we saw before so let's go take a look 81.2 and 90.0 oh there's a lot of stuff here and we had 80.8 and 80.9 8.9 so they're different all right why anyone know why yes he mentions there's a difference between population variance or population standard deviation and sample variance or sample standard deviation all right so now that our heads explode let's go take a look at what that means when you calculate a what's called a population standard deviation you are looking at the amount of dispersion for an entire population and we use a particular formula for that this formula we take the difference from the mean for every one of our values take the square we divide by n and we then take the square root so n is this denominator and in this case for population standard deviation the n is a larger denominator than the next example we'll look at all right and for your convenience and later reading i spell out what each of the symbols is and why they're there let's go look at a sample standard deviation a sample standard deviation is just a sample that estimates what your deviation for a bigger population should be if we take a random sample out of that bigger population and it uses a slightly different var value as the denominator and minus 1. because n minus 1 is smaller than n the size of this standard deviation tends to be a little bigger than for populations all right so when do we use population versus sample we tend to use the population when we know the entire population we have all of the data in our hands we use the sample version if we are looking at a subset of a much bigger group of folks so if i'm a teacher and i have 25 students and i have all 25 grades i can use the population because i know everybody's grades if i am looking potentially at my students grades as some sort of a sample of the grades across the school or across the school district i don't have all the grades for the larger population i just have my sample so i have to use the sample standard deviation all right another example if i'm a researcher and i'm looking at the relationship between women exercise and blood pressure right i might use a sample standard deviation because i only have a subset of folks that i polled or surveyed or researched on i don't have all the folks in the world right okay so that's why we have this difference because that silly denominator at the bottom is off by a smidge because we're either looking at a sample or looking at a population all right the numbers are typically very very close together if you're doing comparisons one to another but you use the same formula your comparisons will give you an order of magnitude difference all right if you were in a competition like a data science competition and you need to have the right answer you may want to choose the right function all right so let's go look at one last example this is the pandas library and it has mean median var standard deviation notice they went back to this kind of spelling of var and std let's run these guys it uses that same version of variance and standard deviation that the statistics library did okay all right so just a nuance be aware that it happens oh sweet for those who don't know pandas in this library allows you to create a set of data and i take a list i drop it into this series function and i ask python what do i get back pd i say hey you have a series and you go okay so what is a series a series essentially is a column in a data set you can imagine a series being like a column in an excel spreadsheet so it takes this list of things and throws it into a column you say what does that look like in real world defects pd printed out and so it says hey row 0 had a 99 in it row 1 had a 52 row 2 had a 42 and it's got all 204 pieces of data this is not a pandas class but with a panda series you've got all sorts of capabilities like you can do aggregations and you can do groupings and you can calculate means and medians and all sorts of other things there's about 224 different types of things you can do to a panda series to help you do your data analysis you can break it up by quantiles they have a whole library for helping you with a whole module for helping with quantiles and stuff it's a lot of cool things all right did that help okay two more questions go how um so what if your data set for example doesn't fall into kind of a nice normal bellshaped curve all right so that's that's a really good question that i do not know the answer to of how well your data needs to fit in in the normal the normal distribution for that to work well um i don't know if alan has any insight into that the question essentially is yeah there's there's lots of curves but the question was when you have a data set if it's not necessarily a nice bell curve and i try and do a standard deviation how easy is it to basically shoot myself in the foot right if if my data doesn't fit a normal curve is my standard deviation just going to give me really wonky answers sure so that is one of those nuances that regularly using these tools and reading about it again this is a threehour class right right diving into this um one of the great things that you'll see when you start looking at research papers where people are using statistics to prove a point is they use statistics incorrectly and the point they're trying to prove is not what the data really shows right and it's not because necessarily that they're being malicious just because they're trying to apply a thing you know round peg into a square hole kind of a thing and that just doesn't work so it takes time it takes effort to dive into this research it figure it out i will show you some of the things that are available to us in some of the tools like scipy and just it is mindblowing the number of options that we have available to us and so that would play into kind of your question yeah you had a question too all right so if a standard deviation is larger it tends to be sample if it is smaller use population so let's go back and look right well if i if i dump the same data set and i'm going to let me get rid of this guy clear output if i have the exact same data set which i do i i'm using num defects and i drop it into scipy i get a slightly smaller value than i got when i put it into the statistics library so a smaller value means a library is using population standard deviation a larger value means as being sample but having said all that there are ways to tell the library to do the thing that you want so let's take a quick look at that all right okay so psi pi dot in the scipy library for standard deviation they have a thing called this delta degrees of freedom and it identifies the divisor that you want to use and so you can have n minus something and then the normal is n minus one right the default that they use is zero so if i needed psi pi to do the reverse of what it normally does i can simply go into the function and i can set this degrees of freedom to be 1 versus 0 which is the default all right so again it's just a matter of you need to know that it's there you need to know it's kind of a problem that you have to kind of answer um so all right let's see what else we got um i think in the interest of time holy cow how did the day go by this quickly we're going to skip the exercises here's a list of cool books and i start from the lower end of the scale to the higher end of the scale my first book i ever read on stats outside of high school was this cartoon guide uh it was a low pressure guide to statistics it covers way more than we're going to cover in these three hours the manga guide i got from my kid he liked it head first statistics by o'reilly is a book that um spells things out in a way that i find to be really really uh useful naked statistics is a little less about how one does it and the maths and more about oh my gosh how do you not do it wrong um and he talks about a lot of good kind of case studies and examples of people using statistics in the pros and cons he's very light on the math more on the this is awesome statisticness so this is a great read statistics in a nutshell that's fairly dense it's a good reference book i like it because it puts all the stuff in a small amount of space but i found that had i read it before i read maybe head first or even the manga guide that might have been a little too intense for me i think stats think python and think bays are great and for those who don't know that guy over there he wrote them and this one um is a little wonky and if you go to amazon and you look at the cover of this you're like oh my gosh but it is very compact and it spells out a thing called bayes theorem and it spells it out in a way that's kind of visual and it was quite nice all right and for the record uh mr allen uh who literally wrote the book yesterday we're talking he's like hey do you want a mentor in your class and i'm like yes okay so he's judging me by the way all right thanks um so let's move on to the next thing and let's cover this let's go through this we're going to shift gears we're going to talk about probability now the likelihood of something happen we're going to figure out how we can calculate the probability of something happening we will explore probabilities using what we call venn diagrams we'll explore probabilities using probability trees and we will talk about the principles behind the law of total probability and behind bayes theorem and we'll see a couple of examples of that all right uh i like the definition from sarah in statistics in a nutshell probability tells us how often something is likely to occur if we repeat an experiment right so let's expand our understanding of probability with a couple of definitions you'll hear reference such a thing called trials or experiments or observations a trial is some event where you don't yet know the outcome trials can be crazy easy i'm going to flip a coin i'm going to roll a dice or it could be someone has a low birth weight will they graduate from college 22 years later right sample space is essentially all of the possible outcomes of a trial so i have a six sided die i roll it all the possible outcomes are one two three four five and six say i drop four coins in a bag i've got a quarter a dime nickel and a penny if i draw one of those out my sample space will be quarter dime nickel and penny an event is the actual outcome of a trial events could essentially be singles or could be groups of things we will often designate an exam an event with an e so if i roll a die and my event is that i get a one on my die e would be this set with one in it if i want to specify that um my event is that i get an even number my e would be a 2 a 4 or a 6 when i roll that die so you can have more than one thing in your event now if i'm going to calculate a probability this is pretty straightforward i take how many elements are in my event divide that by how many elements are in the sample space and i get the probability so the probability of rolling a one on a sixsided die is one divided by six and that math turns out to be like 0.16 or something so let's throw together a pretty straightforward function that'll help us do this for those who do not play d and d in those types of games a d6 means that your die has six sides a d8 means it has eight sides so let's make a real quick function that returns a one on a d6 and so i would calculate 1 divided by 6 and i get back sure enough to do 0.16 and that's crazy limited you would never want to write multiple functions for every single case so maybe we want to expand this a little bit make our probability function better able to handle a large sample size or better able to handle an event so i set my count to be one and i divide it by the sample size all right so if my event was i roll a four on a six sided die the probability of a four showing up is this the astute observer though goes wait wait chalmer we dumped in event but we never actually used it that's screwy let's go fix that all right if my event is composed of more than one thing i want to determine if i get a 2 a 4 or a 6. we need to have a way to determine that all right so i'm going to make a small list let's say my event is i roll less than a four i roll one two or three on my die um i start off with saying hey let me check did chalmer just give me a list or a tuple or did it give me a single value if he gave me a list we'll count how many events are in it one two three and we'll use that to do the math if he gives me a single item then we'll just call it one it's all good all right so one thing that we often do in in python is alias things maybe give them shorter names i do not want to type probability a lot so i'm going to give that function a new name called p so it'll make it easier to type stuff so if i have a six sided die i have six items in my sample space and i'm looking for a two the probability is point one six on the other hand if i'm curious like what what is the probability of getting a four five or a six out of a sample space with six items that's one half all right if i'm looking for odd numbers on a six sided die one three and five again i have a 50 chance of getting an odd number alrighty out how many items are in a sixsided die is pretty straightforward but when things start to get a little more complicated that's where venn diagrams come in and you guys have probably all seen these we use these to represent elements in your sample space using very simple pictures so i'm going to show you a representation of rolling the odd numbers on a d10 all right so i've got a d10 it is fairly common in venn diagram land to put some sort of a rectangle in that rectangle represents all the possible values that you could have it is also fairly common to draw some sort of an oval or something or a circle to show the things that you really care about and in this case i only care about odd numbers and i go ahead and i label those one three five seven and nine um i meticulously went ahead and said everything outside of that oval is all the other stuff i do that for clarity but most the time we don't bother right it is presumed or assumed that everything in the rectangle is all the other stuff if i need more than one oval to represent two kind of related events that i care about i can put more than one over we'll see that in a bit um make sure to miss any of the things okay i'm going to have you guys go through your little notebooks etc um sketch out a couple of simple venn diagrams you don't have to make them huge or anything start wrap your head around this idea so this first one for example we're going to have one thing that we care about out of a list of 20 items on a d 20. and then i would like you to do is put together some python code that calculates the probability of getting 1 on a d20 this next event is a little bigger i'm looking at just the odd items on a d10 i've got an example i want you to consider what would we put together to represent i think it's all of the aces oh picking a single ace out of a deck of 52 cards right and so write some code to do that you have to figure out what your event space looks like or your your um your event looks like and what your sample space looks like so spend a few minutes do that and put your green stickies up when you get done there's about five or six i think what we'll do is we'll give this about seven minutes and then we'll roll on so i'm gonna set a timer seven minutes all right okay um yes got about two minutes left then we'll roll on don't panic right none of us is walking out of this room a guru except for that guy thing is though he walked into the room a guru so he had a leg up on all of us about 23 seconds all right so let's take a quick look at this i'll look at the one that kind of raised the most questions numerous people asked about this so p say i have 52 cards in my sample space and i have four items in my event number of people typed in 52 comma 4. our code is not yet sophisticated enough to deal with that our code blocks what we need in our code at the moment is to put in a list of items right so you know an ace of clubs a ace of hearts and ace of spades typing is a horrible thing in front of people and an ace of diamonds right and i'd say hey it's about a seven percent chance of getting an ace out of a 52 card deck right if i were to type in a four get a much lower percentage and the reason being if we go back and look at the code the code said if it's a list tell me how many elements are in the list if it's just a number we're going to consider that to be a one um so we've discovered kind of weakness in the code like hey this this doesn't quite play nice let's go fix that all right but the long story short of these problems here and these are kind of one dimensional style problems is what's the size of my sample space and how many elements are in my event space all right so let's go look at our code to do that though we kind of want to expand on a few other things and then we'll get there let's talk about exclusive events and intersections most of what we looked at are just very simple venn diagrams little circle with a certain number of things in it there are some cases though where as i potentially try to create a venn diagram i might notice that wait i'm looking at maybe two different types of things and trying to lump them together in my event for an example say i had a d10 dice and want to know the probability of rolling an even so i have 10 sides evens are 2 4 6 8 and 10. that's 5. so that's 50 chance of getting an even chance of getting an odd is also 50 so the chance of getting either an even or an odd is a guarantee if i roll my dice i will get either an even or odd and so i can very nicely add these two things together and boom i can calculate what are the odds of getting or what is the probability of getting an even or odd so yes i have my little odd circle my little even circle and there's a total of 10 things in it my s space has got 10 things so it's all good but what happens if i do something slightly different what is my probability of getting something that is greater than a five when i roll that ten sided dice i have a six seven eight nine or a ten what is my probability of getting a number that is even two four six eight or ten my sample space is 1 through 10. notice greater than 5 and even have these kind of overlapping spots where 6 8 and 10 fall into both of those ovals if my probability getting greater than five is fifty percent my probability getting even is fifty percent and i add those together that answer is not right it would say that i have a probability of getting or i have a guaranteed probability of getting one of those two things and we know that's not quite true the correct answer of getting either greater than five or even is actually about point seven and i use the word about and it's quite literally exact right i have seven things in this kind of conjoined event one two three four five six seven my total sample space is ten so seven divided by 10 is 0.7 so what went wrong our original kind of let's add these two things together ignored unfortunately the fact that there's a little bit of overlap so we have this very cool formula that allows us to account for overlap i have the number of things in one event the number of things in a second event and if there's any overlap i just subtract out how many things overlap so i don't double count that ensures that i single count those divide that by the sample space and i get the union or the or of a and b all right so that's generic formula you notice i have this kind of u shape thing and i've got this fun of uh upside down u the upside down u means the intersection where things overlap uh sometimes you'll see that referred to as a cap so the number of things that are intersected between a and b this u stands for union it's kind of an or this is the number of things that are included in a or b all right so sure enough we do the math greater than 5 is a 50 chance there are five elements there odd is five elements there's an overlap of three we do the math we get seven over ten okay so let's start to explore this in practice we use my little python probability function i put in anything that's greater than 5 anything that's even and we subtract manually the things that we know overlap and let's get an answer and sure enough we get 0.7 so what's the probability of drawing a single red card from a standard deck or drawing a king well if i were to put that into my probability function we would see very quickly that this would just suck because i'd have to type out this big giant list with ace of diamonds two of diamonds three diamonds four diamonds etc and nobody wants to type that that's lame so let's tweak our probability function to say my sample size is maybe 52 cards my event could be a single element or if i already know how big the event is i can give it the event size there are 26 red cards i'll just say that the event size is 26. and then we add a little nuance in here it says hey if event size is a list count how many things are in the list so we still have that functionality if event size is an integer just use that as my count so we used a 4 before right all right so let's run this boom probability of a red card or a king there are 26 red cards in a standard deck there are four kings in a standard deck two of those kings are red boom let's go take a look at the answer before we get to the answer though sure enough with 26 red cards out of 52 i have a 50 chance of getting a red card with four kings out of a deck i have a 0.7 chance of getting a king but that little bit of overlap that we kind of have to suck out of there that's 0.3 and i get an answer of there we go my chances of getting either a red card or a king are 0.53 it's a little bit above half which is what we expect all right so what's the probability of drawing a red card or getting a face card a king a queen or a jack well how many king queens and jacks are there in a standard deck how many jacks queens and kings 12. all right so i say hey i've got 12 here there's 26 red cards how many jacks kings and queens are red six so i want to get rid of those because we do not want to double count them and sure enough it's a little bit higher because now we're looking at a few extra cards all right now you might say but chalmer why do i want to do all this math and write all this code because if we think about it all i need to know is how many reds are there how many face cards are there and take away how many duplicates and i get 32. so i can actually just say my sample space or my my event space is 32 cards are either red or they're kings queens and jacks and so i don't necessarily have to do this if i can kind of do it in my head or or do it manually you just got to make sure that you get event a event b and you eliminate that duplicate and boom we get the same value awesome so i'm gonna for those who don't know pycon has open spaces where people can gather with folks who do things that they like to do and one of those open spaces is board gaming alright so here's a board gaming example i have three games i have pandemic i have clank and i have carcassonne and in my board gaming group we have a number of folks who play pandemic a number of folks who play carcassonne the pronunciation of this french word is probably mangled by me my apologies and then we have clank some of these folks happen to be players of pandemic and carcassonne some of them play clank and carcassonne i have no duplicates or overlap between these two games now everybody in this oval this 12 and this six they're all part of a group so there's actually 18 people in this group this group has how many folks in the big circle 16 plus 26 and then the clank group has how many people in it 12. right um when i was putting this example together in my head i kept forgetting that these six folks were with these six folks and so my math was always wrong it was very annoying um that's why i pointed out pandemic folks there's 18 of them there are 12 clankers but some of them play more than one game all right so what is the probability of finding a pandemic player in my board gaming group who is also a carcassonne player huh okay well there's 18 of the pandemicers there's 26 carcass owners and then there's this nice little overlap of six we do the math and about 86 percent of my board gamers play those two games um but again if i don't want to type all this nonsense as long as i do the math 18 plus 26 minus 6 gives me a 34. we're all good all right there we go and the math failed epically for some reason why did that fail 18 26 is 34. my event size is 36. there we go that didn't work either 18 is 26 minus 6. 18 plus 26 is what 38. all right this is awesome i'm gonna come back to this this is great all right based on the fact that the code may be horribly wrong in some incredibly awesome way we're just going to skip those exercises and move on let's talk about conditionals all right during the next break i'll take a look at that and try and figure out what what where where my math and and all of that stuff went to rye all right let's talk about conditionals because this is going to lead to some fun stuff um one of the things that we really want to do when we start looking at probabilities is not just know when things kind of overlap but we want to understand if one thing occurs what is the probability that something else is going to occur if i exhibit certain symptoms cough cough hack hack sniffle sniffle what is the probability that i have a cold versus i have the what's the probability of i have the flu or the probability that if i have a tummy ache and some cough cough that i might have um food poisoning or something right so if you have one condition what is the probability that you have something else when we talk about probabilities we often hear the word given so if i know that a particular card is black what is the probability if i'm given that it is black what is the probability that it is also a king so i take a card out of a deck and i say it's black you can tell me what the probability is that it happens to be a king if i tell you i rolled a ten sided die and the number came back and it was a an even number you can tell me the probability that it was a 10. right to help us do that venn diagrams sometimes break down a little bit so a really useful feature or really useful thing that people will point to is this idea of a probability tree so for example i have a deck of cards they have 52 cards total some of them are black some of them are red i know that 26 out of 52 are black 26 out of 52 are red if i tell you that a particular card is black and i want to know what is the probability that it is a king i know that out of all of my black cards i have some that are kings and some that are not kings there are two black kings so there's two out of 26 right and there are 24 out of 26 that are not kings so there's 26 black items and they kind of fall out in this way same thing with red kings a couple of things we often talk about kind of levels on the probability tree so we have one level of my probability tree we have a second level with any set of branches here or a set of branches here the math always has to add up so that the total probability on that set of branches is 1. all right so for example 2 out of 26 plus 24 out of 26 is 1. right 26 out of 52 plus 26 out of 52 you add that up you get one you can have more than two branches if you play roulette you'll know that the squares on a roulette table are red they are black and there's two of them thrown in there for good measure that are green so i could have a roulette table probability tree that might say black square red square green square and i could have three branches but nonetheless the probabilities will all add up to be one on any individual level with a grouping of of branches okay to solve kind of across a single branch to figure out what is the probability of getting to the end of a branch you multiply the probabilities together so if i want to say i have a deck of cards what is the probability that i will have a black king i multiply 26 over 52 by 2 over 26 and that will tell me the probability that i'm holding one of the two black kings so 26 over 52 times 2 over 26 and i have a roughly 3 4 chance of holding a black king and so if 52 items 26 multiply that by 26 and 2 i get this now the rest of the branches play out the same way black and not a king red and a king red and not a king the cool thing is the probabilities at the end of each of the branches the probability is way out here three percent three percent and then like 47 and 47 they all add up to be one as well right so 46 it's about three or four percent another 46. and so when we add this up and we round it because you know math being hard um the total probability for any single branch when you add them all up is a total of one and that makes sense right okay now when we draw probability trees sometimes we throw out generic probability trees that other one was kind of specific king not king so you'll see this kind of nomenclature and syntax if i care about all the elements in a group called b anything that's not in that group you'll often see it referred to as b prime you might also see tilde b it just means anything that's not b so here probability that i get a b probability that i don't get b this is b this is not b um there's an a up there not a a and not a let's shrink this down a little bit all right all right so you'll see b prime a prime um you'll also see this nomenclature here that nomenclature is read in the following way probability of a given b so what is the probability that i get an a given that i'm on the b branch is essentially what that means here what is the probability to get an a if i'm on the not b branch or the b prime branch right so probability of a given b given not b okay and all that's spelled out in the text all that leads us to a formula if i want to know what is the probability that i get an a if i'm given a b i can calculate for the union of a and b or the intersection of a and b and then divide that by b if we pull out our algebra hats and we spin that around the probability of a or b is the probability of a given b times b say okay what does all that mean all right if i want to know the probability across a branch i simply multiply one of these by the other and i'll get the probability for that branch and this is going to be really useful to us in a second but that's what this second formula means to get to the end of the branch i multiply the first level times the second level for the branch i care about now a lot of times when we're given data and we're going to try and make this really cool probability tree we're not given all the data that'll be way too easy so there's a couple of rules and helpful hints that allow us to build out a tree first rule is or the first step we want to take is try and define the level of the tree in my black card red card king not king my definition of levels was okay i could get a black or a red it's a first level i can get a king or not king i could get a king or not king and i defined each of the branches if i have facts go ahead and fill them in put them down on the paper i'll show you an example that with a couple of pictures here in a sec once i've filled in all the facts i know i can do a little bit of simple math and fill in a few of the facts i don't know and then i can start to complete the branch groups knowing that the probabilities always add up to one and i can use that cool formula to then figure out the last remaining probabilities so let's see how this works i go out with a bunch of my friends at work some of them eat burgers some do not some eat dessert some do not right so maybe i want to figure out the probabilities associated with each of the branches given that some of the folks in the company eat burgers or don't eat burgers eat desserts don't eat desserts and i'm given three initial pieces of information the people who eat burgers two out of every three people eat burgers given that somebody is not a burger eater and they eat dessert that happens in one out of four cases and given somebody eats burgers and dessert that happens eight out of 15 cases so let's start to fill this in all right picture probability of eating a burger given that they don't eat a burger that you desert and then probability across a branch they eat burger and dessert so as i start to fill this in probability eat a burger is twothirds probability that they didn't eat a burger but they ate dessert is onefourth and the probability that they had a burger and dessert was eight fifteenths we know that this and this have to equal one so i go ahead and start to fill this in we know that this and this must equal one so i fill in the extra value so we're moving along making good progress one thing that we're kind of missing is this guy out here i know this and i know this and i know if i multiply this by this i get that so i can back out and figure out what this piece is if i know him and him and it's just algebra and when i say just algebra some folks suffer with algebra in high school etc don't panic just takes a little bit of practice so i don't mean to say that algebra is crazy easy all right so my formula says if i'm trying to figure out what is the probability of dessert and burger if i know he ate a burger and we know that uh he hit dessert and we multiplied that by the probability of burger this doesn't help me because i'm kind of missing something in the middle right i'm missing this guy but i know 8 15 i know two thirds we can do the algebra flip this over and put him on the other side and now when i multiply 8 times 3 and 15 times 2 i round it all down i end up getting a 4 out of 5. so i put 4 out of 5 up here and if we kind of go back and double check our math right 2 times 4 is eight three times five is fifteen it worked out just the way we wanted i know these two have to add up to one so i figure out what that is now i have all of the probabilities for every single branch i know i can multiply this by that to get here this by that to get here and there so now i can fill out the probabilities all the way across the branch okay so this is useful i now know that if somebody bought a burger and they didn't have a dessert that happens 2 out of 15 of my friends if somebody didn't buy a burger and they didn't get a dessert three out of 12 of my friends are in that horrible horrible group where they don't eat burgers and they don't eat desserts all right okay so let's do some math here with our our script right here i pulled all the values off that chart and i started to drop them in here for branch one probability of burger knot burger was two out of three so two out of three one out of three probability of dessert not dessert four out of five one out of five one out of four three out of four and if i add up all of these it should turn out to be one and sure enough it does all right so i have a reasonable level of confidence that my numbers came out the way we expected all right and this is going to set us up for a situation in a little bit where we can now move beyond this and we can answer some really interesting questions all right but for now we'll take a little bit of a break you guys kind of turn through this um what time does this thing end i always forget 4 20 for something 4 40. sweet so we have a little bit of time all right so i'm going to turn it over to you folks all right i want you guys to take some of these pictures i produced for you and this is going to mirror exactly what we just went through you'll have some data i want you to maybe put on a piece of paper or whatever start to sketch this out fill in the things that you know start to fill in the things you don't and then we'll go from there meanwhile i'm going to go back and look at those those two functions and figure out why i suck at math okay why did this fail 52 sure supposed to be a 46. you are totally right i could have swore i changed this because i saw it and i could have swore i changed it yeah that's it i'm good thank you sir so everybody just fled the room but they left their laptops which means it's open season on unattended laptops pick the ones you want and i'll come back with your question turn this off two thirds the reasons um this is uh right okay oh uh um foreign um uh so the whole way down wouldn't i wouldn't give for microsoft paint all right so when i first started going down this road um i'm gonna be perfectly honest lots of swiggly lines lots of slashes parentheses crazy letters and numbers and things that mean absolutely nothing yeah my mind exploded um it took doing this multiple times over and over again reading the topic in book a rereading the same topic because they didn't understand it in book b and then maybe sometimes rereading the same topic in book c and going ah i see what you did there right um so having said all of that right if you're trying to go through things and maybe you're drawing little probability trees and you're like i don't know what number goes where you're in good hands half the people in this room might have been in that very same same thing and be willing to admit it there's a bunch of other people in the room who are in the same boat but we're not willing to admit it okay in some of our examples thus far right we were given things here's a probability here is a probability of something happened given that i have a precursor i have a condition and then we have the probability that two things happen this n is kind of like an intersection it means and probably the guy had a dessert burger and a dessert if we picture this and this just those two for right now single probability and a probability with this given symbol in the middle of it and we scroll back up here when i just have a probability it goes first when i have a given it goes second and so this given probability is up on this upper branch because it's telling me this probability of not getting an a only applies if i'm on the b branch this probability of getting an a only applies if i'm on the not b branch so this given statement helps you figure out where that particular value fits in any one of these four things and then the intersection of hey my friend adaberger andy also or she also ate a dessert that intersection is at the end of our chain if i know the probability ate a burger and i know the probability had a dessert given that they had a burger i can figure out that intersection so kind of mental model where these three things fit probability probability given that i'm on a particular branch and then the intersection and so hopefully that will help you start to flesh out where these things go but again i read book after book looked at it multiple ways some authors are really horrible at explaining stuff some authors are really good some authors are genius all right so yep right there this picture yeah yes the reason they would equal one is i have four possible options there's no other options that my friends could have went down they had a burger didn't have one they had dessert they didn't so four possible options i have to fit into one of those four categories and so the probability of getting any of them is going to be one all right and here when i solve for the probability of branch 1 branch 2 branch 3 and then i add up all four probabilities sure enough i get a 1. all right so that's that so let's wrap up this conversation here with this idea of the law of total probability and the law of bayes theorem our bayes theorem all right when we looked at those first probability trees it was fairly easy to kind of hop from one step to the next um hey my friend had a burger and you know 10 of my friends who ate burgers all ate desserts that's great but how do i reverse that question if i'm talking to a friend and my friend says to me you know what man i went to the restaurant i had this awesome dessert it was crazy good a little pecan tart how do i figure out whether my friend ate a burger or didn't how do i determine the probability of whether he ate a burger or didn't because if he says or she says i ate a dessert i may know this value like my friend is either on this branch or my friend is on this branch but i don't want to pry i would like to just kind of figure out the likelihood that they ate a burger how do we get back to that and that's where the law of total probability and bayes theorem come into play so let's start with looking at the law of total probability i'm going to apologize right there's lots of mathy symboly things so again you're going to have to go back review this look at this and kind of work through this i'll blow this up a little bit so the font is slightly larger okay so let us presume that i want to solve the following problem given that my friend said yep that dessert was tasty how do i determine the probability they ate a burger all right we know that to solve for this i need to know these two things it's a formula we had further up on the page what is the probability of the ada burger and dessert divided by the probability that they ate a dessert we may look at this and say well chalmer already gave us a formula to kind of figure this out if i want to know what that is i just need to figure out what's the probability ada dessert given the head of burger times burger that's exactly what we just did a few minutes ago so okay check we can we can solve this it's going to take a little math but we can solve that how do i figure out the probability they had a dessert so that's something we're going to have to kind of figure out if i take that little bit and replace whatever was in the numerator before okay if i replace this with this so we're going to make a little bigger formula but again we kind of know all of these values here we still don't know what dessert is quite yet um but we're getting there we're filling this in with things that we can answer i can look up the probability one of my friends normally eats burgers and i can figure out what the probability is that they had dessert if they had a burger to figure this part out i simply go out to the ends of each of the branches and i look at the two branches that say dessert on them and i say what's the probability that somebody had a burger and had a dessert what's probably they didn't have a burger and they had dessert and just add those two things together if i can add those two together i can get the overall probability that one of my friends ate a dessert now the magic becomes these break them out a little bit and we can solve for what the probabilities they desert and that is the law of total probability all right let's take a quick look at this for a sec so knowing what we know we can go through and do the same process and start to fill in the little blocks we can start to multiply things out we figure out the probabilities that i received spam or didn't receive spam probabilities that there were keywords in the email or there wasn't keywords in the email probability that something went all the way across a branch when you figure out these numbers at the end and with all of those things i can go back too big and i can start to fill in this part of this this equation and figure out what the probability is the guy had to desert okay once you know that we can take that value probability they had a dessert replace it with all this nonsense and now on this side of the equation i can essentially go and look at my chart that i sketched out and i can start to put a number in every single one of these spots hey he had a burger i know what is does how much a probability he had dessert i know the probability they had burgers these two guys are exactly the same i know he didn't have a burger and i know the probability they had dessert et cetera and so you can start filling all those things and if you can get those six values i can now tell precisely the odds that my friend says they had a dessert i know they had a burger it didn't right so let's put this to the test there's a lot of things going on there let's take a quick look given that a spamish style keyword was found inside of a message what is the probability that is classified as not really being spam right so given a keyword is present what is the probability that it's not classified as spam you say well that seems kind of weird if there are bad spanish words in there doesn't that automatically mean it's spanish not necessarily my friend says hey chalmer here's a great book on getting rich quickly right um he's not spamming me he's sharing something that he found whereas if i got an email from somebody you know in a foreign country hey you want to get rich quick maybe that's spam okay so you could have keywords but the email may not necessarily be spam all right so i start off i've got some values we know from some of the research we've done that seven tenths of the email that comes in is going to be nutspam so i have a number to go with not spam we know that if something is on the not spam branch the probability that a spammish keyword is there is onetenth and if we know that or we can also calculate that given something is spam and doesn't have any keywords is three out of a hundred things so let's start to fill in that a little bit all right so we start to put numbers down seven tenths of my emails not spam three tenths of spam uh something was classified as spam but it didn't have any keywords maybe they're starting a new spam trend to write only three out of ten things are spam but don't have any keywords um this one is keyword given the fact that it wasn't spam only one tenth of the things that aren't spam have those keywords so now we do all the things right make sure each of these branches is equal to one these branches are equal to one these are equal to one we back this number out from there and we start to fill this in all right and then we do the last bit of the math we multiply this times that so 3 times 9 gives me 27 10 times 10 gives me a hundred 7 times 1 gives me 7. 10 times 10 gives me 100. fill in all these all right with every one of these values filled out like this and it's as we practice and as we get used to it it becomes fairly straightforward to get to this point apologize for the small fun i can essentially pluck values right off this chart and start going boom boom boom boom boom boom boom and i can fill in all six values and now i can tell you if i got an email that had some really cool spammish keyword what's the likelihood that it really isn't spam all right so let's blow this up a little bit so on the top i say let's go find out if it isn't spam and there's a keyword present what is that so that is one out of ten so i put my event size is one i have 10 items uh if it is not spam that's a 7 out of 10. this is a 1 out of 10 7 out of 10 and i fill in all six of these and there we go if there is a spammish keyword in my email inbox get rich quick uh cialis viagra the odds that it is not spam in this made up example is 20 percent and so with bayes theorem this is a way to answer questions that might otherwise seem very difficult to get to my friend tells me they had a dessert what are the odds um another place where something like this might be used would be maybe like a b testing i give you one version of a website i give somebody else a different version of the website and we get a sense of if they picked something here what is the chance they were using this version of the website if they bought a thing or they clicked on an ad what is the probability that they were looking at a particular type of ad so here's an exercise for you folks i give you basically the same three types of data sketch out your little probability tree start to fill out the tree until you have all the values populated and then much like we did up here go ahead and work out those six items in the formula and answer the question after some of my friends played two different versions of a board game talking to my friend the friend said hey i really want to buy this game what is the probability that that tester played version b of the game versus version a i'll give you guys a few minutes to go through that give you about seven eight minutes all right oh my gosh you you you if you get this finished put your little questions okay all right okay the big sticking point here is figuring out what each of these things are just as i kind of walked around and talked to a couple people and listened to some of the comments right the process of getting from point a to point b is essentially the hard part and how this will normally play out in these types of examples you will potentially be given one of these two values on a branch so you have to do the math to get the other you'll be given two values here and you can get the third you'll be given two values here and you need to get the middle one those kinds of things and so as you get practice and you get practice by doing right you do this over and over again um you will grow accustomed to oh i've got these three facts or these four facts and i can start to fill in and then once you get this down and things are working out really well then you can start to apply this to real world problems okay but once this chart is filled in the next step becomes take each one of those things put them into the six spots and then the math should theoretically work out all right i'm going to let you guys read this section on independent events and we're going to move on to lesson 3 in the interest of time so you guys can go back and read that on your own we want to look really quickly at what we call discrete probability distributions and then we want to understand a little bit about factorials well permutations and combinations and what those are for and what they mean in the middle of this we're going to do a field trip i'm going to take you guys out onto the wild wild internets and we will look at some things that are out there that might be of interest and use to you and we'll talk a little bit about how this discrete probability distribution can apply to other things but let's get started with the discrete probability distribution one of the kind of the classic i guess examples of a discrete probability distribution is related to slot machines by discrete we mean it's broken up into individual components as opposed to like a nice curve right with this slot machine example i have three slot machine wheels every wheel has certain symbols on it it might have an apple it might have an orange it might have a quarter might have other random things depending on how the slot machine plays out if i were to get an a and a and a and apple and apple and apple on the three wheels i get four dollars i had to pay 20 cents to play so my gain is going to be 3.80 if i got an apple apple orange they give me three bucks but again i spent 20 cents to play so i really only gained two dollars and 80 cents orange orange orange i get two dollars i want to highlight this bit this apple apple orange is any order if i got an apple an orange and an apple that still qualifies i still get my three bucks woohoo all right they're still ripping me off okay now on any given wheel i have a certain number of oranges i have a certain number of apples a certain number of quarters and stuff on that wheel and the probability of getting an apple is one in ten the probability of getting an orange on a single wheel is going to be two out of ten probability getting quarters two out of ten and all the other symbols the cruft that's fifty percent probability of getting some other random symbol okay what i'm going to start doing here is i'm gonna start building out a table of details i'm going to go kind of step by step building out the table and it's going to take me to a point where i can figure out what is my average win at the casino air quoting the word win what is my average loss at the casino so here are my wheels here's how much they pay here's how much i get or how much i pay so normally when i screw up and i get nothing none of the wheels helps me i'm gonna immediately lose 20 cents if i get three quarters i get back 80 cents because i've spent 20 to get there um we know the probability of getting an orange so 2 percent or 20 probability of getting an orange 20 probably getting another one 20 probability getting a third the chances of me getting three oranges in a row is eight out of a thousand um similarly i can do the math to figure out what is the probability of getting all apples that's one in a thousand probability of getting all quarters is eight out of a thousand and the probability of being a sucker is 996 times out of a thousand i lose cash straight up all right if you are a gambling aficionado please don't be insulted when i say sucker that's a colloquialism all right so if i translate gains and losses um we can assign a probability of getting any specific gain and here i'm going to stop calling them gains and losses i'm going to say x so i have a capital x and a lowercase x x is this random variable um and the little x is any individual item and i've only got four or five options here so out of these five options that fall into this big random variable and so i know the probability of getting any of those five options and i know how much money i get and that's going to help me figure out my average win or loss all right in our previous discussions we talked about averages we use the word mean when we talk about these distributions we use the phrase expectation little mood lighting sweet is somebody leaning on a light switch all right it was getting crazy cozy in here all right so given any particular trial i might lose i might win is there a way to figure out my average and that is using expectation to figure out our expectation we use a formula much like we had before we say all right if i have a particular x what is the probability that i'll get that x and let me add up all of those and that will give me my mean e x is called expectation but we also often call it mean so you'll run into it as both and matter of fact we might use the symbol for mean which is this uh this greek mu all right so for starters i multiply the probability times the the value of the variable and i get these results a bunch of them come out positive and then we have this suckers category which comes out very negative and if i do all the math and i add all five of those results up my average loss every single time i play this game if i played it a lot of times my average loss will be 16 cents every time i play this game all right sure i might win four bucks once in a while but on average i'll lose 16 cents every time i play all right now knowing the mean is kind of cool but we also often want to know how broad that spectrum is is there a possibility i might have a really broad spectrum and maybe i'll get really lucky on one end of the spectrum to solve that we essentially solve for variance right so the variance of any given probability distribution is the expectation of the value minus the average squared right so let's get in here this is essentially the same chart we had before but i take the value minus the average remember the average was negative i'm losing money on this so i subtract a negative value and i get this um once i have taken the average and subtract it from all five values i'm gonna have to go back and square it so we jump in here we take each of those values we just calculated a second ago we go ahead and square them all and once we have a square we multiply it by the probability and we get all these things again you go back reread this kind of absorb it take your time but ultimately once i've multiplied the square value times the probability i can get a variance and i can tell with this particular data set it's wide it's narrow things are really close to the mean a lot of times things are far away from the mean a lot of times but again variance is such an ugly number nobody likes variance so we have standard deviation and that's just the square root of the variance all right so your first question might be holy cow how do we write code that does all of that well we're not going to we're going to skip that part right and we're going to go on a field trip we're going to look at some libraries these are your takeaways these are things you can go home and play with and explore and consider i'm going to look at a couple of libraries and figure out how the pros have put these things together for our use um the first place we're going to start is the stats field trip and for your reference don't try to like read out the the url because that's that's just going to like blind your eyes all of these are linked at the bottom and so i have all the urls to get to each of these down at the bottom okay so let's start with the scifi stats library load this up a bit okay the scifi library itself has some tutorials that'll kind of walk you through a series of things certain basic functions they might have or statistical functions that are present etc i'm going to dive into the scipy.stats library i'm basically going to kind of scroll through this and point out a few things the nuance here that i want you to walk away with is there's a heck of a lot of good work that's been put into solving some of these statistical problems that i should take advantage of instead of using chalmers crappy code all right we mentioned a minute ago discrete probability distributions where things take certain values a 3.80 return a 2.80 return well there's other distributions called continuous and so i'm going to kind of scroll through this right they're all alphabetical order a so we got alpha arcsin these are all continuous distributions and a lot of work has been done to try and create these objects in python that you can use to look at distributions of data in various ways and we'll dive in on one of these in a few moments but there's a lot right so when we talk about you starting your statistics journey this is step one this is the first three hours or something of a 40 hour college class on intro to stats and this is you know graduate level whatever right but there is a destination you can get to and in many cases you don't have to go all the way you don't know and memorize every one of these none of us have that memorized we build on the basics and then when we need something particular we go and try and hunt down the thing that will help us we have what's called multivariate distributions that look at various types of multiple variables that correlate with things we have some discrete distributions which is what we were looking at a moment ago there's various ways to handle particular types of discrete distributions and then of course they've got a whole slew of statistical functions like mode and calculating for skew and for variation and standard deviation etc so let's go dive in on one of these this is in the stats library and this is related to a particular discrete random variable it's called the binomial discrete random variable and the way to calculate certain values that come out of this they have this really funky formula we're not going to spell that out i'll let you guys figure it out but you provide it with a couple of values and it will allow you to build kind of this body of information that you can then go and explore and your exploration might lead you to making graphs that kind of show patterns in the behavior and if you want to know specific details about the data that you could use to make that graph they have a whole slew of additional kind of nested functions that allow you to dig right into that distribution and understand more about it etc right i'm not going to walk you through all these things but they're there so that's the first part of the field trip scifi stats the next part of the field trip we mentioned a library called numpy numpy's got much like the scipy library an incredible set of documentation where you can start to dive into particular things that interest you and we're not going to explore this one the way we did sci pi stats pandas also has again kind of this incredible wealth of information about how you can calculate information using data the python statistics library a couple of us were looking at this a few minutes ago there's really only about 10 or 12 different types of functions here this is more the uh the meat and potatoes kind of things that you're most regularly and frequently might use this does not get into any of the details like scifi stats and and numpy and stuff will allow you um but it's there and you don't have to import it you don't have the weight of importing a lot of things from thirdparty libraries so this is still useful for the things that show up most frequently all right so with that so that was our field trip i mentioned this idea of these discrete probability distributions you go home you start to wrap your head around that one of the really cool things that you can do once you have a good understanding of a discrete probability distribution is that you can apply what we call transforms in order to get to kind of this point i had to multiply certain things by hey this this is the probability that something's going to happen or this is the gains and the losses et cetera well what if my slot machine owner says hey we're going to upgrade your slot machine and it's no longer going to be four bucks if you win this but everything is going to be increased by a quarter you'll earn four dollars and a quarter three dollars and a quarter um instead of having to go back and redo this these transforms will allow me if you guys study up on this to very simply reevaluate my variances without having to do a lot of crazy math so that's pretty cool um so you'll want to research transforms on discrete probability functions so we've got 10 minutes i'm going to walk you through combinations and permutations with a sprinkling of factorials if you recall a few minutes ago i said hey look at this if i get an apple an apple and an orange i'm going to win something but i also illuminated the fact that it really really wasn't just apple apple orange it was any order of apple apple orange so i get orange and then an apple on the second wheel apple on the third wheel and when i calculated the probabilities for this i took that into account so i got apple apple orange plus apple orange apple plus orange apple apple say that three times quickly um this was easy because it was only three things i only had like kind of three combinations of this or three arrangements of it sorry it's probably a better term but what if i had lots of things and i had all sorts of arrangements is there a way to do that mathematically and do it easier that's where factorials combinations and permutations come into play all right we'll start off with factorials you might have seen this button on your calculator never known what it does there's often on calculators a button that will have something like x with an exclamation or an n with an exclamation that represents a factorial and what a factorial is is simply i will take whatever number you give me and multiply it by all the things that are decremented down by ones so a 2 factorial is 2 times 1 a 4 factorial is 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 10 factorial is spelled out it's a nice way of very simply creating very large numbers that are composed of things you might say well what kind of use would this be let's say that i have four books for example um and i want to put them on my bookshelf and i'm kind of particular about what order i put them in with the four books in my hand i could pick my first book i have four choices and i throw the first book down how many choices do i now have left in my hand i have four books to start with and i put one on the shelf how many choices do i have left how many books do i have left in my hand three so now i pick one out of the three and i put that on there how many choices do i have left in my hand two right so these factorials are often used in these kind of things we need to organize and arrange things if i have a bunch of horses and they're in a horse race by the way chalmers not a gambler but yes say i have horses and they're in horse race i have 20 horses which horse could come first have 20 options which horse could then come in second i only have 19 options which horse could come in third i only have 18 more options right so that's where factorials come into play a great thing about factorials is that if i have to do division of one factorial by another it's pretty easy because three times two times one over three times these cross out and i'm just left with five times four so it makes the math pretty pretty straightforward um i've got a little function here we'll calculate this calculate that and so i'll let you figure out the details of the function but i've got a function that will calculate factorials for us i want to highlight in vivid terms what i meant by chalmers code sucks and other code is better by looking at a realworld solution the calculation of factorials looks like it's pretty straightforward but there's a lot going on to the hood for example if you're on a 32bit piece of hardware the size of an integer maxes out at about 12 factorial if you're on 64bit hardware it maxes out around 20 factorial maybe your computer might want to build or calculate something larger than that so you might use floating point approximations or representations of those values and that will nudge you a little bit past those points or maybe in terms of speed you don't want to calculate 40 times 39 times 38 you might want to have a lookup table for certain low level factorials and then do the calculations on higher ones or you may not want to do the calculations at all so you might use an approximation like sterling's formula to figure this out so real world functions not chalmers will do things to help improve the speed or the reliability of it and i just want to show you what we mean by the speed of it so i created a factorial function we just looked at it a second ago but there is actually in python's math library a function called factorial and i'm going to import it as f so that the two names don't don't overwrite each other and if i calculate the factorial of four it's going to give me back some number and so let's go look at that make sure we get something back we get 24. returns 24 as expected there we go if you've never used jupiter to do this it's kind of fun there is the ability to time certain um statements or expressions etc in in python so i'm going to say use chalmers factorial function and calculate 40 factorial and time it and show us how long it takes to do this and then we'll use the library in or the function in the math library and we'll see how well it works so we'll run that the time it functions kind of cool it will run this multiple times and every time it runs it it will do it some number of times like a hundred thousand times so it took about seven micro seconds to do it with chalmers crappy homegrown code and it took 300 nanoseconds to do it with legit code that is really good at this and optimized for this right that is a massive difference like a thousand times difference right something like that or ten times difference whatever it is math is not my thing don't trust me for your maths all right three seconds or three minutes to go good grief we'll talk about permutations combinations and products um with permutations we will look at how we can arrange things for example how many ways can i arrange four out of five books on my shelf got five books i only have room for four let me figure out which four i want to pick or if i know that i care about three of the ten horses that win because i'm going to bet on three of them how many different options are there that three will cross the finish line right combinations on the other hand are things where we don't have to worry about the order of them with the horses right if if sally blue finishes in front of you know denver dan versus denver dan finishing first the order was crazy important with that permutation but with combinations order doesn't matter what did you have in your salad i had walnuts i had romaine lettuce maybe i didn't have iceberg had croutons the order doesn't matter if i said croutons and iceberg lettuce it doesn't matter products are a lot like permutations but you not only care about the order but you start to replace things so for example i pull a ball out of a lottery cage i read the ball i throw the ball back in and i have the chance of pulling that same ball out again but the order of the numbers matters and then combinations with replacements it's the same as combinations but i put stuff back in the pool so i got a handy little chart here do i replace stuff yes or no with those books i couldn't replace them because i only have one copy of each book um with the lottery balls i could put the lottery ball back in the in the in the bucket right order matters order doesn't matter right so we can calculate permutations combinations products and stuff one thing that i'll leave you guys with and then we're pretty much done again rolling your own not so good there is a library called intertools that has a function built in to do each of these and real quick we'll look i have three things i want to figure out kind of groupings or arrangements of them two at a time when order doesn't matter i only have three possible arrangements but if order does matter did one come before two or did two come in front of one et cetera all right i'll skip all of that there we go and those are the links to all the libraries you folks have been amazingly patient through the day brains are all fried by now i'm sure i'm glad you came i appreciate any feedback i will get a survey link up on the screen here i urge you to go to this particular location and give me feedback because feedback is something
