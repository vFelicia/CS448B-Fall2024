the window object is supported by all browsers it represents the browser's window all global javascript objects functions and variables automatically become members of the window object even the document object from the dom is part of the window object so if you look here document.getelementbyid and we have demo here this is actually part of the window object because the word window is implied it's actually window.document.element demo each tab in a browser contains its own window object the window object contains many properties and methods in this video i will go over getting a windows size and opening closing and moving a window in other videos i will talk more about other things you can do with the window object so you can already see this code here where you see the only html is just this p tag with the id demo and we're gonna get that tag here and then we're going to run the update function and also we have a window.addeventlistener on resize we're going to run the update function so in the update function we're just going to set the inner html of this element here this demo element we're going to set to be this text right here you see part of the text is window.enter width and window.enter height so that's how you get the height and width of the window and because we have this advent listener with resize anytime we resize the window it's going to update those numbers so if you look here as i resize the window those numbers are are updating to the actual height and width of the window okay now i will show you how to use the window object to open a new window so here we're going to create a variable called new window object and we're going to run the window.open command so we're going to pass in three different arguments to this function first argument is the web address that we're trying to open and then it's gonna be the name of the window that we can refer to later and then it's going to be the options so there are a lot of options you can set and i'm going to try to run this so it will it will open the window okay you can see it popped up this window right here i'm going to move it just to the side here not all the options are available in every browser so even though it says resizable fall scroll bars false well there is a scroll bar here and look i can resize this but in some other browsers these would work but some of the things that do work are the width and height 400 pixels and 300 pixels and in the top and left that's where the window originally showed up so if i change the width to 500 and the height to 600 i can change the top to 100 and the left to 400 and we'll just see what happens here let me close that and run this again okay so you can see it pops up in a different place this time okay well let's change those back for now though and now i'm just going to add something right to the html right in the html code i'm going to add this button with value of close window and on click it's going to call new windowobs.close so this new window obj is the name of this variable here and that's how it will know which which window to run the close function on so let's try that if i hit run it's going to open the window now let me just move the window over here so when i click the button you'll still see the other window in the background click close window and it closes now you may be wondering here we use this new window object comes from down here but what about the name over here the new window name well that's what you use if you're going to target a link so let me put in a link here and you can see we're going to go to this other website that's my my website and i'm going to target new window and that's where that name comes in down here so let's try that i popped open the window move this aside so you can see it i'm going to click the link and it updates the web page in that new window the last thing i'm going to show you in this video is moving a window so let me add another button here so you can see on click is going to call the move function so we have to create the move function down here and when the move function runs it's going to call new window ops dot move by and then we're going to put how many pixels we're going to move by so it's going to move 50 pixels left and 0 pixels down you can also do move 2 and then we'll go to an exact coordinate on the screen this focus command here that's just going to pop the window up to the top of the screen so if the window is behind another window focus will make it pop up to the top of the screen when we first try this though it's not going to work if i click run to pop up the window and i'm going to move this to the side if i click move window it's not gonna move that's because of the cores error if i open up the javascript uh air console you'll see it's it just just says block to frame with origin code pin because i'm using codepen from accessing a cross origin frame so this would work if i wasn't doing it through codepen but there's a way to just demonstrate this and not have the error so what i'm going to do is i'm going to close this window and here where i'm opening a specific address i'm just going to delete that so now it's going to open a window but it's not going to load a website into that window so let's run that and see it opens up just a blank window and now when i click move window see it moves over and you can see that when i when i click the this website it has the move window button the window goes behind this window but if i click move window it moves and it jumps into focus here so it pops back up so if i move it here you can maybe see it move better so it just keeps moving and then we can still load the website and we can still close the window well thanks for watching the code to this video is like always in the description stay tuned for more videos about the window object my name is beau carnes and remember use your code for good
