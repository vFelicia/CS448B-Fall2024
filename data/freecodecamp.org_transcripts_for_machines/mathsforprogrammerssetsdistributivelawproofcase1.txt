in my previous video on subsets and supersets i stated that to show equality you have to prove that each side of an equation are are subsets of each other so to prove the distributive law we're going to have this video we're going to have the next video in this video i'm going to be showing that a is a a intersection b union c is a subset of a intersection b union a intersection c so let's start the proof suppose that x is an element of a intersection b union c then x is an element of a and x is an element of b union c by definition of d intersection so we still know that x is an element of a and by definition we know that x is an element of b or x is an element of c from this we can deduce that x is x is an element of a and x is an element of b or x is an element of a and x is an element of c now by definition we can put this or rewrite this as x as an element of a intersection b or x is an element of a intersection c and finally we can deduce that x is an element of a intersection b union a intersection c so there you have it we've shown that since x is an element of a intersection b union c and x is an element of a intersection b union a intersection c uh x is in both of these and therefore a intersection b union c is in fact a subset of a intersection b union a intersection c
