In this video we are going to talk about collision detection and collision avoidance. So before we do that, let's imagine there's a room and there are, like, three different people and when two people are talking, the third person, if he tries to talk, the conversation becomes difficult for the other two people. In the same way, let's say we have three different computers on the same network. Now if A was talking to B and C suddenly transfers data to A there is a collision and when this collision happens the original message from A to B becomes garbage. It's of no use anymore because there is interference. So when there is a collision that happens A detects it and it backs off before it tries to send a message back to B again. So this was in the original days of the networking but later what happened is, they added the concept of collision avoidance. So in that, what happens is C, before it actually starts sending data to A, it tries to see if there is a conversation going on already before it sends. So that's CA or Collision Avoidance.
