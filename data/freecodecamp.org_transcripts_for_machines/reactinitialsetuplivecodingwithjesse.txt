hey everybody is Jessie my streams a little bit there's something on my stream YouTube's telling me that it's bad so let me know if the streams not working I could try to restart it I think what happened is I just had way too many browser tabs open and my computer started to to lag a little bit and slow down at that point it started to tell me the stream was bad so I was frantically trying to close tabs before two o'clock hit so hopefully it'll start working again pull everybody everybody's saying hi in the live chat so if you've been watching the last couple of days seems like every day I get a question from somebody in the live chat about react what are we going to do react and I've been saying we're going to do react and we're finally doing it so as you can see if you saw yesterday my my Trello board here where I keep the track of everything the done column has a lot more things in it yesterday I put in an epic day of work thirteen and a half hours of work most of that time was actually spent on this site I did have some meetings and things like that so I didn't code the entire time but I got the site to a point where everything is pretty much in place aside from some minor minor details there's still some demo content that I just don't have yet there's some images that need to be resized but for the most part everything everything is pretty much how it's going to be when we go alive I'm sure they'll be some lastminute changes there always are Internet is paid for today so close for you okay sorry I had some people saying they couldn't hear anything some people saying the Internet's very for other people were saying it's okay so all right just just let me know if it sounds if it's really messed up you know put it in a live chat the the control room on YouTube is still telling me that my stream status is bad but my computer seems to be running okay again this happened one time before when i refresh the page I stopped the stream and started it it said it was good again I don't want to try to do that right in the middle of the stream now normally I would figure this out before I started the stream but it this actually have in one minute before the stream was supposed to start so as long as it seems like mostly you're having an okay time with this dream it's it's working so I'm just going to leave it alone for now um but anyway yes so the site's pretty much where it where it needs to be I'll give you just real quick I'll just go over some of the stuff that I did you can check it out all the links are in the description uh I added a couple links for for react and for next yeah that's what we're going to go over today so the home page pretty much the same as it was I added this here at the bottom these are little tabs these tabs this kind of style of tab that comes built in with materialized it's the framework we're using these cards are going to be clickable links and it'll switch back and forth between these two categories we have the the footer is now populated with the things it needs to be populated with I added this in the top this was a mandatory for me to add in we tried to add add this into a lot of our websites to have you know at least something uniform branding wise on all the sites you see the other page I'm not going to go into all the pages I'm afraid if I start going into it I'll spend half the time just going over the site when you guys can check this out on get up right now so let's jump into react so today I'm going to be working on the command line a lot which I haven't done previously so this is item 2 is what I use for the command line I'm on a Mac so I just all I did there was just open up a new tab so we'll start fresh on this side of the screen let me know if any of this is too small I can make it bigger I'm just going to increase the font size a bit on everything okay so we're starting out blank slate command line I've had a lot of people request to start out from just totally from scratch so some of the things that I already did do so it's not completely from scratch so let's say you just got your Mac or I mean these could probably same steps would probably work on Linux as well it's slightly different for a PC but not too different so you should be able to follow along for the most part let's say you got it fresh which you would need to do is install obviously I installed item 2 but you could just use the regular terminal that comes with mag and you'll want to install node.js so you just go to the node.js website there's instructions for downloading that so you have node and then you'll need NPM I think NPM comes prepackaged with node but it's been so long since I installed it on maybe it's a separate install but if you have those two things that's pretty much all you need to get to the point where I'm at today so not exactly from scratch but pretty close so right now I'm at the command line I'm going to go in I keep everything in projects so I'm gonna go to my projects folder and I'm going to make a new directory and let's call this CI for catechetical Institute that's the name of the site and we'll call this react okay so let's CD into that that directory okay so now we're in in the director we need at this point we're pretty much ready to go into the directions for next jazz okay so if you're not familiar with next basically it does a lot of things but the reason I'm using it is for his two main reasons one it handles your server side server side rendering that's important for search engines to be able to see your content the second reason is it just lets you jump start react development it loads a lot of things for you so that you don't have to do it one by one there are a lot of other things that do something similar react actually has things create rack react app that does the same thing and you can see more about react here's Facebook github dot and the links in the description so you can learn more about react from the website and I'll probably do some videos some prerecorded videos on it when I get a chance but we're starting with next this is just its github page so let's let's set this up I'm going to use instead of NPM I'm actually going to use yarn it basically does the same thing as NPM it's just a little bit faster and it has this lock file that that has some other benefits I personally have never had any issues with different different repos and NPM like the conflicts between packaged versions but yarn takes care of all that for you so you will have to install so yarn I link to that in the description as well alright so I'm just going to go yarn so I wonder for NPM it would be NPM what is it in it let's see if I just go yarn if it'll do it nothing to install sorry I can't remember would be okay so we're doing a yarn in it basically this will create the package.json file that we see here so we need to add this script to package.json I guess I could have they could have just installed this but let's see CI react that's a good name when you do this it'll just ask you a couple questions you can actually just skip most of this and I will for the for this video I'm just going to skip most of this but you can fill it out if you want you can always fill it out later too okay everybody follow somebody mentioned UJS I haven't used view jazz yet I keep seeing it a lot come up in articles and things I'd like to learn more about it at some point okay so we have let me do this okay so now we have this package JSON file I'm just going to let's go yarn add so with NPM you go NPM install with yarn is different you say yarn add and I'm going to add next react and react on so now a yarn is doing its thing I've no idea how long this will take it's been a couple months since I've gone through this process also it's been a few months since I installed next and it's exchange just it's a couple versions ahead so this is unscripted and live so if we run into any issues sorry but that's kind of the point of the videos just to show you what I do even if I mess up alright so you see how fast that was that was actually faster and I thought it would be and all this stuff got installed which is pretty awesome because I would I don't know how long that would take me to install this one by one so everything is installed we can see we have a few more things here we have our node modules our package JSON and we have our lock file we'll never directly edit the lock file and probably never even look at it occasionally we'll need to edit our package JSON and we'll never directly interact with node modules but for now let's open our package JSON file so I'm going to I'm actually going to go Adam dot and that's my my code editor and if I do that it will open up my code editor in this case I'll topping out another screen I'm gonna have to pull it over in a second alright so let's pull this over and we'll just make that fullscreen for now so here's our package JSON file you can see it tells us we have this is some of the stuff that we skipped over and didn't fill and it just gave us default things but then here's our dependencies this section will tell us everything we've installed all our packages so we have next we have react we act on them here and this tells us our versions okay so we're good the next step we'll go so I let me organize this a little better for us okay never mind I see where it went it went behind so I'm going to minimize that there we go okay so we need to add this section and these are going to give us some commands we can use straight from the terminal to start our react app to build it to get it ready for production and then to start it as a production app so let's put that in put it down below here and actually I don't think I need these tags do I there yeah that's why I was discovered yeah so I copied in some stuff I didn't need okay but these scripts basically what I'm going to be able to do is just type in yarn dev and it'll automatically run whatever I have on this side of the colon same way with your unbuild yarn started you can chain together things maybe later on we'll get into some more complicated things with this so let's save that and let's see that is that's it I mean that's all you need to get it to get it running okay basically well we need an index page so we'll just use their default index page for now just to show that it works to make sure that it works but we need to make a pages folder so right now we have nothing let's make direct three pages and let's okay so I've just made that file let's go back over to our editor and see we now have pages let me increase the size here okay we have pages on size my size of the code is increasing but I'm not getting this to increase I'm not sure why off to try to figure that out after the video I wonder if yeah I'm not getting an increase so if you can't see this basically I have a folder called pages and now I have an index file index j/s let's let's make sure this is what we needed okay that should be all we need for now we're going to save that I'll explain a little bit more what's going on in a second let's just get it get it started okay so now we're gonna do yarn where's my command line so I just type yarn run dev and that that runs that will run this command here next okay so basically what happens here is it's just started a server okay it's using webpack and it's just started the server and it says it's ready on localhost 3000 so we should be able to see something here I'll bring this up hopefully I don't have anything else running on that port right now her don't mess it up I've had that happen before all right this one this work let me bring this over really small I'll make it bigger okay welcome to next jazz okay so it doesn't seem that impressive we just have one line of text on a page but this is I guess technically a react up the minimum react up and you can see I have a browser extension to show we're running I guess the u.s. not work here we go so it shows we're running react and webpack so this is this is react hey guys sorry I'm annoying the live chat a little bit I just wanted to to get through that without messing up the install so I'm going to scroll through real quick to see if I missed anything important in the live chat it's like hello from Poland Montreal Brazil through Peru Sao Paulo Guatemala LA Italy well awesome gone to bed somebody's from Narnia that's great I love that Ukraine Russia Kansas Pakistan Netherlands wow we got people from all over the place awesome okay so I'm going to explain a little bit about how reacts specifically next j/s with react works and if I'm losing anybody if you need me to go over something more let me know in the in the live chat there's a bit of a delay so I may not see it right away but I'll try to get to it and if I miss with something that you ask in the live chat put it in the comments I always go back and read those comments and I'll respond as soon as I can ok so basically when you're using next let me move this out here and let's let's check out the structure so when you're using next anything you put in this pages folder will be a route that will actually be a page in your app and you are in your website and we next takes care of all the routing for that so it's definitely can only appreciate if you're done without an extra create like that anytime soon okay so I got distracted by the live chat again someone had a good comment in here so you can only appreciate it if you it without next or trait wrecked react app it can be really timeconsuming so yes that is definitely true when I first was trying to learn react and I'll say right up front I am nowhere near an expert at react I'm still in a learning process but when I was really really a newb it react I attempted it several times to do it from scratch with no help and pretty much failed I don't even remember what the result was so it was it wasn't memorable at all but I tried create react app and that was awesome and then I found next and basically I went with next because of the serverside rendering became you know out of the box because I needed that for a project I was doing a few months ago so most awaited video yeah I know everybody wanted the reacts though so anyway yeah I mean at some point if you have the time go ahead and try to do react just straight from scratch there's value in knowing how to do that and how to set things up exactly like you need to but the reality is you just don't always have time I don't know about you but a lot of the projects that I work on just there's just really tight deadlines and I don't have time to do it exactly the way I would want to if I have you know all the time in the world so this is a great timesaver let's go in and let's let's make let's make some other pages and I'm going to duplicate this tab so this is kind of cool about item two I'm sure other terminal applications do this but since I'm running the server now I can't type any commands without stopping this so I just open up a new tab and then I can still check on how the server is going and I have this new tab here so I'm just going to I'm going to CD into this pages directory since we're going to do some stuff in here and let's just make some of the pages that I know we're going to need and you notice these aren't dot HTML all these are dot j/s so you're not going to have any you got HTML pages and your react app about what did we need a team and I'm going to bring up on my other screen all the all the menu links that we'll need I don't need to add them all right now but it would be good to get some some examples okay so we have team we need courses advanced resources okay that's good for now okay so now if you can see all these have been created and I'm going to go in and let's see I should be able to let's just pop this same code in there and we'll just change one word to let us know that it's actually working before we get into action you bring it over content the next couple videos are going to actually be converting that static site that we built the last week converting that into react components I don't think we're gonna have time to get into that now we only have about seven minutes left okay so sorry arranging some stuff on my other screens here let's switch back here and we'll just fill this in I guess we do this one first just to make sure it works and I'll just write about okay so I'll bring this over so check that out I've typed in it might be hard to see here at the top but I've just it's just localhost 3000 slash about and that's our page that's what we built so all that routing is totally taken care of so I don't know if you've ever tried to build a routing from scratch either server side or client side it's timeconsuming and it can be buggy if you're doing it so I I definitely recommend going with this I once did a project where I made a custom router completely myself and then I totally redid it and went with something premade even after I built everything because I realized that this is going to be so hard to maintain I'm I should go with some premade thing that more people are going to know how to use except for just me hey guys get a couple people saying hi alright so what we're going to do is let's try to bring in some we have time let's try to bring in some code alright I showed you the pages let me do show you where the components can live now with next the only folder that you absolutely need to have named something specific is the pages folder so you have to have pages and that's where the default routing is going to take place in you can name your other folders whatever you want I'm just going to name a folder just kind of the default components folder so I'm going to make that folder now and this will this will be where I keep most of my components if you had a really complex site or app you probably would want to break it down into different folders for right now I think this should work we're not going to need a ton of different components so and the components folder let's just make some of the components we know we're going to need so we're going to need a header let's let's call it a home header and let's call the convention home header so I guess it's been about a month or two since I've actually worked with react probably like a month and a half at least at this point the convention I believe if I remember correctly is that your components are all that they're capitalized so that's why I'm capitalizing this so we have the home header remember we had two different versions of the header and then let's have I'm just going to say header for the next one actually let's call it nav I've been calling it nav throughout this whole video series so let's not change it up now and now this just call this regular jeaious we have a that stinky nav is called a sticking up we have that sticky nav we're definitely going to need a footer and so we have all these components let me think we have cards for the team members and that'll be good for now we're going to have more components than that but now we can see we have our components I had learned weapons okay we had another good comment someone said they had to learn web pack to set up react tab they did learn web pack in the process though which was good but they said it was painful I'm definitely with you there for me coming from using it from first using grunt and then moving to gulp and then trying to transition a web pack it was a tough transition for me that's that's why this you know next Jas or something like it like create react react add it takes that off of you so you don't have to learn web pack just to use react if you want to just build something cool and react just to learn it or to start out with then you can just skip that I recommend learning it at some point though but it doesn't hold you back from me being able to do something with react okay so let's bring up let's bring this up so we have our components now and we'll bring up the footer and let me grab I'm going to try to grab some boilerplate here for a component hopefully they have one probably skipping over something this will probably work this is a little bit more than we need but I think this should give us what we want okay so with a few minutes okay I have one minute left I'll just pop this over that's extent actually that's not exactly what we want yes that happens but like I said this is unscripted it's not rehearsed beforehand so I may not be able to get a component built today although I did get a little farther than I thought I was pretty sure that I would mess something up when I was installing everything since it's been so long but I'm not seeing it I'm just going to have to go back to one of my previous react projects and copy something from there it's a good whip it someone says there's a good web pack tutorial that helped them out a lot if you could go ahead and and link to that that might be helpful for everybody if they don't they're not familiar with web pack yet need some extra help let me go the last thing I'll do in this video I'm going to go real quick to one of my other repos and I'm going to just grab some code from a footer component that I did for that repo for that project and I'll pull it in and I use next for that as well let's find this footer okay all right so I got it let me copy this in its going to be a lot at first but let me show you the basics so um importing react component from react in this case I'm importing this let me take this out because I don't have this component now edit mother flip project I'm calling this footer and so and then at the bottom here I'm exporting footer that's the basics that you really need and let me just let me take this out over low so plugin error because I don't have that component let me just real quick double check to make sure that okay I don't think I'm using any other components but this I do want to keep this in basically all I'm doing here is just making sure that that copyright date at the bottom is always current and I guess I don't I don't need this right now this is my Google Analytics tag so obviously I'm going to use a different one and I don't need that right now so let's say that and let me try to bring in into one of our pages so let's try about let me import see if this will work let me see how I do this and I'm going a couple minutes over I apologize for that but since we kind of started this I'd like to just finish up and get one component linked up here alright so yeah I'm just trying to copy and paste some stuff so I don't mess it up and so I can go a little bit faster okay so I'm going to import footer from footer and let's let's actually bring this let's see if this work I'm not sure that this will work but let's try it out all right it worked great let me bring this in everything worked out for me today I didn't mess anything up so it's a good day yesterday I was a little off I messed some stuff up I didn't do my usual pre stream routine yesterday so I don't know if you tuned in yesterday I I don't know if you caught it but I just felt kind of really off but anyway that footer component that we made this is for another one of my my sites that I did so it's not the same info but you can see it brought in everything now what it didn't bring in where any of the styles because we didn't bring that in so try to adjust quality video the screen so blurry by someone saying the screen is blurry credit risk quality yeah on my end it does look like the stream is good at least YouTube's telling me stream is good it should be a 1080p if it's blurry for you is possible that it's a it's your connection I'm pretty new to livestreaming so I might be mistaken but alright so that's that's pretty cool so within basically a half an hour we went from pretty much nothing to installing everything we needed for a serverside rendered react app we created about what like five pages in that app and one component we linked that component up to one of the pages so we did all that now granted I copy and pasted a lot of stuff but you can see how how easily it is to get started with react it looks good okay sorry distracted by the live chat again okay it looks like the video is looking good to some people okay 728 no problem yeah as long as you can get 720 it should be readable anything below that I would think it would be too fuzzy to read the code and I'm sorry for that if you're not able to read it right now it'll be available in about five minutes to watch the the replay maybe you can get it to come through better for you on the recorded version and so thanks for tuning in everybody I will be back tomorrow at the same time next week I'm going to have some some different times I know I have some a meeting on Monday at 200 so I'll have to reschedule that and then I'm going to go to a conference at the end of the week so we'll see maybe I'll do some video from the conference I'll be a syntactic on in Charleston South Carolina so we'll see I guess let me know if anybody's interested in seeing video from that conference maybe I can try to stream something from my phone or we'll see how good the WiFi is but I will be back tomorrow let me know if you have any suggestions for me or if you need me to go over something in more depth and tomorrow we're going to really get into making a lot of components and making some pages so it should be fun all right you're welcome see you guys
