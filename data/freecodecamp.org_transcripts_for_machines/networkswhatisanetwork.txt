Hi, I'm Rouli from Free Code Camp. Today we are going to talk about what is a network? So, before we answer that question let's take the example of two people who are trying to communicate with each other. So what happens here? When one person talks he's creating vibrations in the air which is the medium and these vibrations reach the other party and that's how two people communicate. So one person talks and the vibrations travel through the medium and reach the other person who is listening. Now, in case of two computers how do they talk? They don't have mouths yet or they can't create vibrations in there in the air, so how do they talk? So, here what we have to do is we need to create some sort of connection between these two computers. So, a connection between two or more computers, or more devices, to communicate between them is called a network.
