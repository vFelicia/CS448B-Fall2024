hey guys benjamin's back here again doing another resume review this time we're taking a look at wakara mohammed's resume and i'm also going to do a portfolio review that someone else had provided but i'm going to put that in a separate video and probably put that on my own channel i'm going to reserve the resume reviews directly for my channel and for resyndication on free code camp okay so i have this basic intake form set up you guys can find the link to this in the description as well and basically i just have a little disclaimer saying hey make sure you're removing phone numbers uh your address email address from your resume unless you're comfortable with the email address being included and required did that so that's great you know he does have his email address and he's comfortable sharing that uh let's see and then he also wanted to share his twitter profile github what he's interested in and which industry is interested in okay didn't fill out an industry but that's fine uh let's see wants to be a junior web developer and okay we have his social media profile here for twitter so i'm just going to go ahead and open all these up we also got github so we're going to do a resume review going to take a quick look at his portfolio site but not really focus on it because that's not the the focus of this video and then that's just a link to our resume cool just going to take a look i do like that the the contact info is up here i dig the layout nice thick horizontal lines uh same thing with the text used and great contrast of text colors as well you know definitely with the orange getting all of the pertinent details popping out and different font faces love that great design overall really dig the layout uh let's see yeah so overall i love the layout let's let's just go from the top so let's see as a highly motivated and result oriented manager within the tech field i have a proven track record of providing exemplary levels of service along with high quality technical and digital content strategy yeah i think that that's a solid intro one thing i think i would maybe focus on a little bit more is highlighting some examples of high technical quality um you know you mention a proven track record so perhaps put in some metrics there but i'll continue reviewing uh the resume and then we'll get back to that same thing let's see digital content strategy i would recommend maybe some digital content projects that you've worked on listing those or perhaps listing different types of let's say digital marketing like search engine optimization for example or conversion rate optimization or analytics something a little bit more specific to include concrete details again i think a lot of people may disagree with me on this but i definitely think that you should have longer than just a one pager i think you should have and this is just personal opinion have your relevant skills kind of near the top relevant projects near the top especially if you're a junior dev uh you don't really want to be leading in with experience that doesn't necessarily tie into the web development job that you're seeking ideally i would you know like in this publish article section have a few of your github repositories or projects and have those kind of near the top maybe under the overview in between experience yeah probably in between experience and then maybe moved articles up a little bit because honestly in my experience a lot of uh recruiters that i've worked with and hiring managers haven't really ever asked about my education or skills the only exception to that is they'll just say hey do you have a fouryear degree but they never ask where's the fouryeardegree degree from they never ask what's your gpa so one thing to keep in mind there i would recommend putting your education and skills near the bottom and highlighting your projects because essentially you want to be saying to the hiring manager look this is the work that i've done i can complete projects and here are the um the projects that i've completed so definitely you know check them out and you know showcase your work that way anyway i feel like i've kind of covered that quite a bit uh so let's see we have signature design consultants ltd uh company director okay providing consultancy and technical support to sme i'm not sure what that means on digital and web strategy for web and mobile applications and digital marketing um okay well out of curiosity this isn't something a hiring manager or anyone like that is probably going to do again i mentioned they only review a resume for probably about i would say 30 seconds or so if you're lucky um okay so this probably stands for small and mediumsized enterprises or small and mediumsized businesses cool cool got that instead of putting sme i would recommend maybe listing a couple of clients they're proud of working with you know a couple maybe say two mediumsized businesses and one small size business you know i just use that general rule of three to really market to um you know people's mindset and kind of short term memory uh so that those few clients that you've worked with stick in their memory i would also elaborate on consultancy and technical support like what sort of projects did you consult on uh what kind of technical support did you provide and i know you mentioned web and mobile applications and digital strategy but i would recommend mentioning one some of the clients that you worked with as i mentioned and two some of the projects that you worked on for those clients so again you're just really highlighting the projects and work that you've done like i said i really do like the layout i really do like the use of fonts and i really do like the color contrast that i've used okay and then total airport marketing consultant you know make it make it past tense and kind of uh break this up because this is just kind of one like runon sentence you could either break it out into a couple different ways to display it you could break it down into say bullet points like say there's a bullet point and then you know that next part is a bullet point for training and then the other one is you know the amount of sales that you did then boom you got three solid bullet points you're using the rule at three and uh then you're also providing your facts and figures it's easy to read and it's in past tense um so yeah overall i think good content in there can be rewarded a little bit and instead of doing these uh kind of like runon sentences where you're trying to smush everything together just break them out into bullet points it'll be easier for people to skim uh let's see stansberry supermarkets department manager okay cool so i imagine here you're trying to highlight some of your managerial experience i'm looking at it now this is october 2013 was the end point and it we're already in november of 18. typically i wouldn't uh list anything later than you know five years ago in the past so honestly i would recommend just removing this uh adding a little bit more allowing it to free up a little bit more space and then as i mentioned earlier uh providing some of those projects that you've worked on and listing that there you know as you as you can notice you can probably spot a trend here i'm just trying to highlight projects projects projects skim ability okay cool and then you have some of your skills web related skills now i understand probably why you kept it this way you wanted to make it clean and skimmable yeah honestly i would recommend adding in more skills here strike that balance between keyword stuffing now if you're not familiar with the phrase keyword stuffing is basically just that taking these keywords or these phrases and putting in things that are relevant to the audience that you want to get in front of and then just kind of peppering a bunch of those in putting putting a bunch of those in so i would recommend writing down some other technologies that you've worked with like css great but maybe put css and then css3 if you've worked with sas i would also put in sas you know a css preprocessor if you worked with html i would also put in html5 uh also anything that goes along with laravel since that is a php framework i would recommend putting in php uh putting in any package managers that go with that i believe that's symphony if i'm not mistaken uh same thing with javascript if you've messed a little bit with uh node you messed a little bit with react go ahead and list those you want to be transparent and you don't want to lie about the amount of experience that you have with a particular technology you also though want to make sure that you're giving yourself a running start you're making sure that you're giving yourself a decent chance of getting in front of the right people listing every technology especially when you're starting out listing every technology that you've touched it's marketing cool and this is where you highlight on ppc seo sem and digital content okay so that's what you alluded to up here um yeah so let's let's go back to the the overall uh overview here so as i mentioned you may want to put in uh pick one or two of these that you feel that you're the strongest with and pepper those in and kind of put those about your your overview i feel like we we've covered the the resume pretty pretty well i'm just going to go ahead and pull up these articles yeah this is good i mean it does show your kind of political slant as it mentions down here business models politics also shows your interest in entrepreneurship and kind of by proxy your interest in the entertainment sector which is fantastic i think though as i mentioned i would probably save this for your cover letter because on your cover letter that's where you really want to showcase your personality and other aspects of what make you up as an individual whereas the resume is more so just kind of the down and dirty uh here's what i can do here's what i have done um you know that sort of thing your experience your skills your projects like a few uh different articles that i think kind of show your personality in general so i would say one about kind of startup culture one about um social media and then one about say security uh then that will kind of give a decent holistic view of the things you're interested in and with those you just pick the best ones and present those at the top of your cover letter but since you have two profiles you have this one here this one's political politics religion i would just avoid that in general and go with this you know this looks like a solid you know code related profile you know you're saying you're a lawyer previously and now you're focused on software engineering you like javascript and laravel perfect this is what hiring managers really like to see and you can even include this in your cover letter and you can elaborate on that a little bit with a couple more sentences if you want because people people love that they know that lawyers are diligent they know that you have to be focused you have to study hard i'm not sure if you had to pass some sort of a bar exam or some sort of a you know like entry level exam but that's also another thing you can kind of put out there there's usually a good connotation associated with lawyers this is good you have a sense of humor if i were a hiring manager i'd want to see that i think you had shared this with me today this is you on dev2 and you're basically talking about the frustration between learning a i think was a solid language and learning a framework and you also have decent engagement here with uh some of the commenters which is fantastic this would be an article honestly that i would also put on your on your cover letter the hr professional isn't going to probably look at that the hiring manager is more than likely going to be looking at tech related content that you do share especially on twitter okay and you're also staying culturally relevant to the overall developer community you're talking about hacktoberfest could be part but felt like i couldn't this year not only did i take part when i bagged a tshirt oh okay so you did actually complete it yeah dude so highlight that too i mean like that that keeps you relevant that helps tell a story it shows that you're interested in open source that again goes to some of the projects like highlight some of those open source projects on your resume the the hr professionals may not fully understand what you're working on but if they see those projects they'll at least have a general idea okay this guy can do something let's get this in front of a hiring manager and get a second opinion get an informed opinion and then when a hiring manager sees it and he sees that you contribute to open source and he sees that you're culturally relevant to digital ocean and hacktoberfest and you're overall in the larger ecosystem of development and you're engaged that's gonna earn you a lot of brownie points but yeah all together man love this twitter account definitely highlight the open source projects that you worked on definitely highlight your sense of humor and i would say definitely highlight your your accomplishments with oktoberfest because that's that's no easy task so great job with that you have your portfolio we're just going to take a quick look at this okay so you have your social media links i'm not going to click through those click on here awesome that's about your focus okay cool credit apis in laravel framework and then you're talking about creating three applications uh crud and apis yeah there you go dude like that's that's some of your summary that's that's some of your project bullet points like seriously boom you got a highlight right there you know that's your that's your highlight reel man you gotta put that on the display front and center on your resume um okay cool and you're also talking about doing blogging and basic video tutorials um yeah then you can basically use this as your highlight reel to kind of start off the section for your articles on your cover letter okay and then you're also talking about your work with free code camp uh you're talking about your future goals fantastic as a junior developer people are really going to want to see that you still have plans to continue to grow and continue to improve yourself and that you're worth the investment of time and money that they're putting into hiring you as a junior asset definitely include something like that in your cover letter and i know this is controversial i would recommend including the photo in your cover letter or in your resume some people will strongly disagree with me on that but i think it's it's worthwhile uh you know maybe get one that's facing directly towards the camera and you know maybe wear like something relatively uh professional but overall this would be a fine photo as well okay but again yeah highlight reel men projects you've worked on but i'm front and center on that resume okay and yep you also have a portfolio looks like all of this is pertaining to the free code camp challenges cool but yeah i would definitely recommend putting in some highlights of the open source projects that you contributed to for hacktoberfest okay and then you have the contact me cool and that's nice and simple yeah in terms of the layout of this love it man nice and responsive you know this is definitely something i would also highlight in your resume probably near the top with some social media links and if you want to double down on that also highlight that on your cover letter because you want to get uh you know the these projects and these um bullet points that you you know that you've worked hard on in front of the the hiring manager and the hr professional cool it looks like you are uh highlighting things that you actually have worked on here and making use of the popular repositories so that's great you do have a fairly active graph here that's nice to see and cool and then here are some of the pull requests that you're working on for hacktoberfest with free code camp and these these other profiles i'm not too familiar with but yeah definitely as i mentioned highlight those i think we've covered all the bases i just want to thank you for sharing this resume i know it's uh can be a bit nervewracking to not only share your resume with someone else and not only share your social media presence with someone else but to share it with my audience and and everyone on free code camp so hey big shout out to akar muhammad for sharing his um some of his contact info guys definitely reach out to him his social media links are in the description below give him some kudos if you really like his portfolio as much as i did give him some kudos on this layout he did a great job same thing with the the color contrast and font use solid men i really dig it um so yeah you got a few things that you can punch up make this a little bit more skimmable add in some more skills maybe push these articles to your cover letter highlight some of the other uh work that you've done but i did do a deep dive and it looks like you've put in the work you you have solid content out there and you have a decent head for design and for layout you just need to make it pop and showcase those skills and projects a little bit more and i think you'll be a shoein for landing your first junior developer position or maybe one of your first if you if you've already landed a junior dev role so yeah thanks again uh my name is benjamin spack if you'd like me to review your resume review
