into trouble progress bars animated bottom infinite progress bars nice hi everybody what's up welcome back to css3 in 30 days today's day number 19 and we're gonna be coding in css three only some animated progress bars let me show you what we're going to be making here in the final result you can see we got two examples we got example one and two we got uh this really interesting looking nav a progress bar that slides up to about 60 in fact it slides exactly to 60 percent and it has this like kind of like uh barbershop you know stripey animated effect going on and it's it's set within and uh kind of looks like an inset like uh parent container with an inset shadow so it has this really cool threedimensional effect some rounded corners it slides all the way up to sixty percent goes back resets and then example two the interesting thing about this one is that it goes to one hundred percent uh but the thing is it has a little tool tip that follows it to let you know it's loading or whatever you want to put in that so we're going to be making those it's relatively straightforward we're going to be messing around with some animations again and some keyframes so hang tight let's jump in our code editor open up number 19 animated progress bars get yourself set up and ready to go and let's hang out for the next 20 minutes or so and see what kind of trouble we can't get ourselves into alright so here is the index file i'm just going to show you the markup real quick it looks a little bit like this so example one we got animation bar one that's our class in there we have a span with a style of width sixty percent simply just means the width of that container is sixty percent going to be animating it to its its maximum width and example number two we have a span with a data label attribute uh that says loading we could have made that say just title or even alt but we're going to be using data label instead and we're going to be using the text in there just saying loading it could be whatever you want it to be so that's it for the markup jump into the sandbox and get started let's start out with the animation bar one we're going to say position relative display block there we go padding 5 pixels font size 16 pixels again this is all just housekeeping stuff line height 16 pixels border radius we're gonna make it 30 pixels so pretty rounded background rgba and it's going to be zero zero zero zero point one so an almost invisible black box shadow inset and we're going to say 0 1 pixel 2 pixels rgba 0 0 0 0.25 okay but we're out also going to add another shadow to that if i left it like so let's see what happens so it looks pretty good as is but if i were to also add zero one pixel rgba and then two five five two five five two five five and then zero point one see what that does that adds a it's hard to see but what i'm doing here is i'm adding a little bit of a highlight on the bottom maybe if i make it more prominent you should be able to see it so let me just make it like one so it's a straight up white line at the bottom you can see just gives it a little bit more depth so let's make it actually i kind of like it pretty bright let's do 0.8 on that one okay that looks pretty good now what we're going to do is we're going to style that span within it so we're going to say animation bar 1 span so we're going to style that up we're going to say position relative display so this is the progress bar within the container that we're styling up here inline block we're going to say vertical align middle want to stay in the center there height 20 pixels border radius 10 pixels on the top zero and zero so that's zero on the right zero on the left zero zero on the right zero on the bottom ten pixels on the left so 10 pixels of border radius on the top and on the left and we're going to say overflow hidden background color we're going to say f5 6982 background size 100 we're going to be playing around with a background image which is why we want to use background size okay now we're going to create a gradient so let's just let me just take that out for a sec and just see what we've come up with so it's just a like a pink progress bar the border radius is on the top and on the left because if i take it out it looks like this it's a square and i don't want it on the right side so i'm gonna put that back save it and i'm gonna keep the right side square the left side around it so it fits nicely within its parent container and uh overflow hidden because we're gonna have a we're going to have something going on within the inside of that so i'll show you in a moment background size 100 because now what we want to do is create a gradient background image linear gradient function and we're going to say two bottom it's going to go from top to bottom comma f2395a comma and then the next color will be b90 c2b okay save that check it out now it's got this nice gradient it looks very rounded that's a very interesting looking um progress bar static progress bar so far and now what we want to do is we want to style we're going to we're going to animate it so we're going to leave a little bit of space for that but right now what we're going to do is we're going to style animation bar 1 span after sudo element we're going to go position absolute top 0 left 0 right zero bottom zero we're going to say content empty string so it appears background size 100 percent and now we're going to create that that stripey barbershop pull effect background image linear gradient hang tight 45 degrees so we want that on a 45 degree angle we want the next color stop to be uh white i'm just gonna say triple f 25 so at 25 color stop it's gonna be white so if i save that you probably shouldn't even really see anything okay good and now what we're going to do is i'm going to put a comma and i'm going to go down to the next line and line it up here and i'm going to say rgba zero zero zero zero i want it to be totally transparent so for the next 25 i want it to be just uh invisible just like a chunk of invisible black that you can't see and then now the next line rgba the same thing in fact we're going to copy that and we're going to paste it out and it's going to be at the 50 percent color stop okay so now if i were to just close that up and save it let's see if we see anything so you can see the angle and things are looking kind of odd here but uh trust me this should work out let's see let's go back here put a comma and we're going to say triple f at the 50 mark triple f at the 75 mark rgba we're gonna do that zero zero zero again but at the 75 percent color stop and last we're gonna do rgba invisible close up the parentheses of linear gradient semicolon save it let's see what we've got okay so we've got ourselves a two line so it kind of looks like a candy cane actually it's around christmas time so this is kind of a nice little effect and you can see that it's got uh so it's got the angle red angle so you can see how this works so from 25 to 50 percent you've got the white and then from 25 sorry from zero to 25 percent white and then you got 25 to 50. it's invisible so you can see uh you can see the the red and so on and so forth so that's what we created there but now we need to change the size i don't like the size of that remove that comma so i'm going to go all the way back here and i'm going to overwrite background oops that overwrite background size and say 30 pixels and 30 pixels so so that should give us something like this okay now we're on to something here but i don't like how uh candy caney it looks despite enjoying the christmas season i'm going to say 0.3 and just make it a little bit more transparent there we go so it's a little bit more subtle of an effect so we're also going to animate that so what we're going to do now is we're gonna go back up to the span and let's animate that one so we're gonna say we're gonna say animation let's say progress dash bar one over the course of 10 seconds infinitely and um let's make it ease and now we have to go down and make a keyframe keyframes and we're going to say progress dash bar dash one and here's where we're gonna start creating that animation at zero percent we're gonna say the width is twenty percent so it starts at twenty percent you can start it at zero if you want uh we're going to say 50 in the timeline the width will be 80 so it's it's going to be making it to 80 uh we might even be able to make this a little bit more simple let's say 100 percent zero to 100 and this is going to go up to 100 of the width let's just see what that does let's save that and let's just see so it animates it's got an ease it goes it's going to 100 percent see how it really slows down at the ease there we don't want it to do that we actually want it to only go to that 60 let's say that's the width that it goes to and then it goes to about 60 ease is too slow for me you can make it linear if you want i'm going to say linear or ease in and it will be linear essentially for the rest and over the course of let's make it six seconds a little bit slow for me and it's gonna ease in it's going to start speeding up to the 60 mark and it stops like that uh interesting i don't really like how that looks let's go with zero percent it's going to start at zero percent i'm going to go to 60 and let's just make it straight up linear let's see what that does so it makes it to 60 percent and then it starts back so now if you want it to be a no if you wanted to to go back i know it doesn't really make sense so it's loading and then it goes to sixty percent and then it would just it just jumps back what you could do if you really wanted is you could say at the 50 of the timeline it goes to the 60 and then it goes back to with zero percent if you want it to be more smooth of just an animation like this it's going boom 60 and it's gonna make its way back it doesn't really make sense for the progress bar to do that um because that's kind of a tease you're like i'm loading i'm loading i'm loading and then it's like no never mind so i'm actually just gonna go back to our original style here and at the 100 mark go to 60 and then it restarts and i actually kind of think ease might be a good choice here so it's actually a little bit more of a it slows its way to the boom there we go that makes sense that looks good to me so let's keep going now what we want to do is we want to animate those little angled white candy cane bars i'm gonna call them barbershop pole candy cane bars uh let's go to our uh or span after here and we're gonna give it an animation as well we're going to call it progress dash bar dash after dash 1. clunky name but we're going to say 0.5 seconds infinite and it's going to be a linear animation that means we need to create a keyframe so let's say keyframes the name of it is progress dash bar dash after dash 1 and the animation will look like so at zero percent it's going to be the background position is going to be zero and 100 percent and at 100 percent of the timeline the background position is going to be 30 pixels and 100 let's see what that does so see how it's now moving it looks pretty cool so let's see what happens if we change this value background position to like 100 pixels let's just see it's moving its position a lot further so it's going really fast and it looks kind of weird and if you did something like 10 pixels it's going to move to a lot slow like a lot slower of a distance or smaller of a distance rather so you can see it's moving 10 pixels as you can see and if i if i move it 20 pixels you're going to see again it's going to look really jumpy that's because it's not making the full width of of that that bar we have it set as a background size of 30 and 30. so if we say 30 pixels as a background position it's going to look like an infinite loop and that looks nice awesome okay so that's it for that progress bar i'm liking that and now let's move on to the progress bar number two which is this one right here so now we're gonna say animation bar two so animation dash bar dash two we're gonna say position relative display block font size 16 pixels line height 16 pixels we're going to go a background rgba that's going to be a 0 0 0 and 0.1 box shadow is going to be inset at zero one pixel two pixels and rgba we're gonna go zero zero zero and zero point two five okay see what that looks like uh you can't see it that's because there's no content within it there's the the span within it there's nothing in there so it's collapsing and there's no hardcoded height so that's why you cannot see it so let's just for the purposes of this testing let's give it a height of 20 pixels so we can see it there it is uh we're going to take that out in a moment but i want that same effect as the example number one so that bottom gradient so uh sorry box shot i'm going to copy this box shadow all together i want the same box shadow style yes that's what i was going for we got that white highlight at the bottom it looks good okay so we know that's there let's remove the height hardcoded height we don't need it we want it to be a dynamic height based on its child element so now we're going to say animation dash bar dash 2 span and we're going to say position relative display inline block vertical align middle height 20 pixels background color let's do double o e 6 background size 100 because we're going to do a gradient here using background image and we're going to say linear gradient it's going to go to bottom that could be 2 left to right to top however you want it to be it's going to be double zero b so comma double zero b three b four comma and then double zero eight zero eight one that's the the two colors you need for the gradient save that let's check it out of course you're not going to see it because it has no width right now let's give it a width just to so we can see there we go 20 width you're going to see the gradient top to bottom it's that green to dark green looks pretty good i like that style it fills out the the parent element uh it looks nice i like it okay so i'm gonna remove that width because i don't actually need it now we're gonna use the before and after pseudo elements to create a tool tip uh that you can see right over here so let's jump down here we're going to style those up we just did tooltips yesterday so this shouldn't be too crazy for you animation bar 2 span before pseudo element we're going to say position absolute right it's going to be zero positioned absolutely on the zero bottom 100 display inline block width 0 height 0 now we're going to do basically what we're doing is we're creating the the arrow 10 pixels solid transparent border right which is zero border left no border bottom width is zero and then the border top color so the one we want to appear will be rgba zero zero zero zero point i know zero zero zero one and then content empty string now that should give us a little arrow as you can see just like that so it's actually looks like it's pointing in the top right but it's actually pointing down because relative to what you'll see here we want that little tiny almost like a little speech bubble so that is what we want i'm liking that so far and now it's time to style up the animation bar dash 2 span after pseudoelement so this is the tool tip itself position absolute right zero bottom here's here's f here's the fun part calc we're gonna do what we did last time yesterday 100 so 100 down but plus 5 pixels to give some space sorry bottom is going to be 100 from the bottom so it's going to move up 100 plus 5 pixels for to account for that arrow is that index just one just to keep it above the parent display inline block content we're going to use attribute and then select the data label so that's another fun thing whatever the attribute name is and that's what you can use for for the attribute there okay padding so it's going to pull out the text of that attribute is what i'm trying to say padding 5 pixels border radius is going to be let's do 5 pixels you can maybe do less if you want 3 pixels font size 0.8 m so pretty small based on its parent background color it's going to be rgba it's going to be that 0 0 0 1 again and the color of the text will be triple f for white save that check it out here in the browser there it is that looks good loading it's pulling that text it looks really good now all we got to do is animate the actual span so where's the span up here animate bar 2 we're going to say animation the name of it will be progress bar two it's gonna be over let's do six seconds infinite and ease so now we have to create a keyframe and it should be pretty simple it's gonna be keyframes it's gonna be progress dash bar dash two at the zero percent we're going to say width is 20 we're going to start there and at 100 we're going to do width 100 very very simple save that check it out in the browser so it starts ah started at zero so maybe so you could see it and then it would animate but check it out there we go it's loading it's looking good it's easing it's easing it's easing just to about 100 boom done restarts the animation that is it for our animation of the progress bar we kind of ripped through that one so feel free to go back and check it out again if you need to do that uh animation progress animated progress bars are a great thing to use if you're loading a website or loading a loading screen or anything like that building applications i hope you enjoyed today gave a few ideas i'll see you tomorrow when day number 20.
