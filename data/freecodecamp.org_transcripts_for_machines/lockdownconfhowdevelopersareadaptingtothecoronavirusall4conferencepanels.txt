hey everyone i'm quincy coming to you from dallas texas uh united states of america i am thrilled to be here to open lockdown conf and we have some amazing interviews uh some amazing panels with some really incredible developers from around the world today we are also going to be delving into four different topics that i think are very near and dear to all of our hearts these days continuing working from home effectively finding a job during this pandemic this unprecedented change in lifestyle for pretty much everybody around the world this is massive economic shock and finding opportunities and we're going to find that there are many many opportunities out there even in the tragedy uh the human tragedy in the chaos of this pandemic so first i would love to introduce fuzzil he is uh the cofounder of hashnote which is an amazing developer community where you can go you can configure your developer your dev blog you can have a blog running right on your website uh on your own domain you can set it up really quickly you can customize it it's really powerful tool and just so just check out hash note if you haven't i created the astronaut blog a while back i think it's amazing uh and then of course he's going to be with me the entire time coemptying fielding questions from the audience from both twitter and from our live chat as a spam counter measure and also to support the free cocaine nonprofit i'll just be completely candid about that uh we are limiting the chatting on the youtube video uh to people who are willing to become members on youtube uh i think it's it scales with which city you're in so if you're in india i think it's like the equivalent of two us dollars i think in the us it's closer to five dollars um i'm not sure what it is in other cities but those are the two prices i've heard um and this money goes to funding free code camp uh which is creating lots of free learning resources for people around the world so uh first i'd like to introduce angie jones she is a quality assurance engineer expert she's been doing this for a long time she is a developer evangelist at appletools and she's also the director of the test automation u learning resource i strongly recommend you check her out follow her on twitter her information should be in the description as with all the other uh panelists today in the description down below you can just scroll down you can just command click or control click open up all those awesome people on twitter follow them there i follow all of them they're all super interesting on twitter uh so thank you very much for joining us angie um next emma bostian coming to us from karlsruhe uh in germany i hope i pronounced that correctly thanks um she is a uh prolific developer and podcaster you may have heard the ladybug podcast uh i strongly recommend following her on twitter as well uh she is constantly doing exciting things and then of course dalwah shah uh the founder of classcentral.com which you may very well have used in the past month they've been growing very rapidly because they have indexed i don't know thousands maybe 100 000 reviews at this point of different free online courses and paid online courses like udemy courses and stuff it's a great place to find courses to figure out what how you want to learn what kind of resources you want to use which universities are putting out the best courses so it's a great way to just find the best courses to learn so welcome everybody thank you quincy it's a pleasure to cohost yes thank you yeah great to be here all right so first uh i think we should just open it up this is the topic of this first panel is learning the code during the pandemic uh during the in the age of social distancing i think the first thing that's going to be on pretty much everybody's mind is you know how should they best use in just general terms how should they best use this block of time that fate has handed them uh assuming that like activities that used to occupy a lot of their their free time are now just spent sitting at home uh how how should they best use that uh in your opinion and we'll go ahead and start with angie what are your thoughts on that yeah let me let me start off by saying that you know this is a trying time for everyone so um personally i've been you know having ups and downs as far as my moods and um the time this this time that we feel we have available some days it's not it's just a myth right um it feels like i have this extra time um but you know i have i still have my job to do um if you have kids at home that's additional work as well and if you're just not feeling up to it you're just not feeling up to it and i think that that's okay so i just want to preface anything i say with that all right for me i love learning new things i'm a teacher at heart as well so i'm trying to produce lots of content for people who are at home and want to level up during this time as far as my own learning my own uh productivity i i use my updates right so the days that i am feeling good and i'm feeling productive and i'm kind of tuning out the news or the days that i'm able to delve into all of the things that are out there there's so much content free code camp plenty of content there just all over the web there's all of these courses and things like that um that you can take a lot of them for free so that that's my recommendation like find what's the skill that you want to learn don't try to learn like all the things during this time but pick like one or two things that you would like to master during this time and find the resources to do so okay awesome thank you for that comprehensive insightful answer angie and and i just want to echo what angie said it's totally fine during this unprecedented time especially if you have family members who are sick or if you're concerned that you yourself have become sick uh with kavit 19 or or if you have other medical issues and you're just anxious about not being able to go to the hospital like normal or see a doctor like normal uh please don't make learning the number one priority like staying sane and just having a healthy lifestyle and having serenity those are the top priority and thank you very much for uh coming right out and saying that at the beginning angie because that's one thing i want to uh definitely emphasize everybody like you don't need to make personal sacrifices significant personal sacrifices i mean you may have to give up playing fortnite or watching netflix for a few hours but you but you shouldn't be giving up sleep you shouldn't be giving up uh prayer or meditation or however it is that you stay centered um emma uh what are your thoughts on prioritizing and figuring out what you want to learn during this period definitely i just want to reiterate what angie said because i believe that that is so vital right now is you can't learn new skills if you are not okay as a person so first and foremost take care of yourself um you know i've been struggling with motivation the past few weeks i was actually supposed to go visit my family for the first time in over a year and i had to cancel that trip so i won't see them for another year and so for me mentally that was really hard but i was also in the midst of preparing for technical interviews and so i had to balance studying and learning new skills with the emotional distress of living in a foreign country and being isolated from my family so it kind of all depends on your personal goals so if your goal is to look for a new job because many of us have been laid off which is very unfortunate kind of come up with a plan for yourself you know looking for a fulltime job is is a fulltime job so figure out what you need to learn and kind of chunk those into digestible pieces every single day don't overwork yourself but if your goal is to improve your skills and your day job or to learn something new find what you're passionate about or pick one skill to learn really really well this is the time to become tshaped so having you know vertical knowledge in one area but also branching out to new areas and just picking up tangential skills is really important and uh you know not to just be uh totally all about free code camp even though i'm a fan girl um i did use free code camp a lot the past several weeks and it landed me a new job a dream job so i personally would recommend it to anyone looking to improve their skills and web development okay thank you very much uh for the uh we're so thrilled to hear about uh your new job and and we're excited like of course whenever you get a new job you want to like focus on getting that but at some point we would love to have a writeup from you about your your path to getting that job and the decisions you made and how you did it along the way um absolutely thank you emma uh that wall so you have a really deep knowledge of this but maybe you want to say something about uh balance because i know you're very athletic and a lot of the things you enjoy doing you're not able to do at the moment yeah i usually love to play badminton and that's i've been doing remote for a few years now and badminton was my one contact with society so i tried to you know work out at home or in uh for a long time uh while working on class central uh badminton was the only thing that got me away from it so i think you should there are other things that you can learn which are not stressful which are not job related so you can also start learning just for fun so that it does so there is no pressure that you need to understand the material i would specifically recommend a course called learning how to learn which also sets you up for like other courses that will do in the future and it's also very entertaining and a light course that i took a few years ago and it's some of the techniques that i learned in that course applies to uh every day awesome yes uh barbara oakley she's an amazing uh university professor but also just teacher and she's very passionate about learning and that really comes through in that course and i believe that's the most popular course on that's the most popular mooc of all uh massive open online courses uh is it still i think it's one it's it's that one or it's andrew ing's machine learning course one of those two yeah and by the way just to reiterate if you ever wondered about massive open online courses like these free university courses you keep hearing about uh double is dare i say one of the world's foremost experts on this having run class central for how many years at this point seven eight years eight years eight and a half yeah eight and a half yeah so any questions anybody has about university courses this is a perfect time to ask them i'm just gonna very quickly read a couple comments uh from the chat uh uh catalan pitt uh uh said coming from someone who suffered from severe anxiety and burnout nothing is more precious than your health take care of yourself everyone and beth jackson said i love how angie and emma uh started with uh just giving us all permission to check in with ourselves and how we're feeling so there's uh i i've been gathering questions uh from both uh the hashtag lockdown conf and just monitoring the chat uh and if anybody asks the question that i'm like oh this is a great question i'm going to feel that uh i will i'll do so so be sure to ask in chat or tweet with the hashtag lockdowncomp uh but i'd like to know a little bit about time management so high management slash procrastination management uh let's start with you angie because i know you're uh precocious and you learn a whole lot and uh you're constantly learning new things um how do you manage your time and how do you keep yourself moving forward even without like some structure to impose upon you to force you to perform and learn new things yeah um it was really difficult for me for a while because i i am ambitious and i want to learn like all the things and do all the things and it was really difficult to keep up and i'm sure we've all been in a place where you start some tutorial and you never finish it or you start some side project and then it starts collecting dust i'm known on twitter for spanking people's hands when they buy new domain names that they're never going to use what i've learned to do is uh is form systems for example my goto is trello so i use trello to manage everything my work my side project my side projects my learning everything like i make cards for them and that was working for a little while and then it stopped working um and so i went a step further just to be a little bit more rigid and actually put like dates on all of the cards you know like at work and um you know here here's where i'm slotting out the dates some people also use their calendars in a similar way like okay let me block out this time for learning or whatever right um and so i'm i'm not that structured like i don't like oh at six o'clock i have to do x y and z um so i i do it in the form of days so today here are the five things i would like to do and i have that today column on my um trello board or whatever and so i kind of plan it i might take like a sunday or something and plan out my week um and that way i'm making sure i'm getting done the things that i want to get done including the things for my own professional development okay awesome it sounds very organized and a systematic approach procrastination yeah but there's one issue with that uh managing the trailer board is people often forget to revisit that board uh like once you move with your daytoday uh life uh you get you come across something which is more important than what you had actually planned so how do you manage those how do you try to stay uh in the same schedule that you had actually planned what's your trick angie yeah i live out of this board so i don't know about you all but in the world of so many distractions even before covet um you kind of just get sidetracked a lot like what am i supposed to be doing what was i working on you know um so i live out of this board so i never forget to come back to it because i forget what i'm supposed to be doing and so it's like oh let me go to my board oh yeah yeah this was the task that i needed to do next and you're right things do come up my boss might contact me like angie i need a blog post asap it's like that wasn't really on my list of things today so you kind of you know reprioritize and and although it sounds structured trust me i'm like very kind of fluid so um i don't mind like changing the date on something like okay well i guess i'm not gonna be able to um read emma's new blog post today let me put that for tomorrow or something great yeah and how about you emma what what approaches have you used um so i think my biggest um i'm taking notes because i don't want to forget this point i think it's really important so i'm going to start with the fact that i am definitely one of those people who like takes a ton of courses and like has to finish them i can't start one and not finish it like it's the same with reading books so i like waste a lot of time and i'll honestly taking courses that i don't need to be taking but in any case um i like to think about learning as kind of like from the financial world perspective i do a lot of learning about finances and how if you're going to buy something large think about how much time you have until you need to buy that thing and then kind of amortize that over every single day that you have until the deadline so if i have an interview coming up in two weeks what are all the things that i need to learn and let's amortize learning all of those things over every single day let's break it up into even pieces so you're not completely overwhelmed so i did that when i was studying for technical interviews but i never pushed myself so if i mentally was not in a place where i knew i could digest information i wouldn't i wouldn't learn uh it's just uh it's not practical to push yourself if you're not in a learning mind space um but that being said there's also this concept of intentional procrastination which is something that i practice so it's pushing tasks off um to a later time but in the in the back of your mind like your subconscious mind is putting pieces together um so if i have a big project like i won't start working on it right away because likely all of this that work i'm going to be doing is going to change over the course of a week so as opposed to doing all that work i'm actually just processing it in the back of my mind push off the tangible work until a later date and by that point i've kind of worked out the kinks in my head but there's a really great book called um uh why we sleep and it talks about how we form new connections when we're sleeping so make sure you're getting enough sleep it's more important than you think you can't actually build new not new memories but you can't build new synapses create new synapses in your brain to learn these new concepts if you're not sleeping enough so that's my my biggest tip right intentional practice procrastination did i get that right yeah that's definitely the term of the day for me because it seems like almost yeah it seems like a selfcontradictory term but that makes so much sense because you're right so much of the work is gonna is gonna change down the road thanks for sharing that with us and and just to be 100 clear the name of that book again why we sleep um why we sleep yeah there's another one called make it stick that i haven't read yet it's next up on my docket but it's about how different learning styles uh kind of work the the most efficiently with you and your preferred learning style so if i'd like to watch uh video tutorials that might actually not be the most efficient way for me to learn so i'd also recommend that one awesome uh thanks for the book recommendations just a pop quiz what time did everybody go to sleep last night in your local time zone 3 am no that hurts me i did 11 11 pm okay great so yeah [Laughter] i usually sleep at 4am so my goodness well to be fair everyone's like uh what are those called your cycles i'm losing my english uh everyone's circadian rhythms are different especially through ages but like i'm usually in bed by 10 not gonna lie that's great no it's great to hear both angie and emma are uh early sleeper or relatively early sleepers um yeah no i just knew i had to be here at the crack of dawn but you just so just for some context for everybody tuning in you may be wondering like if you're in california why is this conference so so early well we have lots of friends in in asia and uh and uh eastern europe uh we just wanted to make sure that especially down in australia oceanica like we wanted to make sure that they were able to to come as well and the the best time to do things generally it's like really early u.s time it kind of inconveniences americans but it's it makes it possible for everybody else to attend without having to stay up super duper late so uh thanks if you're one of those people who like woke up super early to watch this we appreciate it uh you're taking one for the entire global team and uh dawal let's talk about you like time management uh and managing procrastination what are some uh insights you've had on that yeah i mean i'm very similar to emma and uh what she talked about intentional procrastination uh or uh barbara oakley actually calls it like diffused mode of thinking so what are like some of these uh concepts are you see them across different productivity books so like learning how to learn is what taught me about a refuse mode of thinking and it made me comfortable with procrastination so i don't really do a lot of time management right now i just have a simple sublime text list which keeps growing and if it's not important i don't come back to it you know so and i try like i think my biggest step has been for me is not to feel guilty about procrastination so especially when you're creating something new it's you know i think procrastination is natural and yeah i usually sit on that let it sit in my head for a while and it's usually when you get to it you do it much faster i think it has such a negative connotation classically and i i would love to change that stigma i think it can be used as a tool if you use it properly right procrastination can be kind of a compass needle that shows you where you actually need to go because the one thing that you are procrastinating is probably the most important thing that you need to do right yeah i also really quickly i'm going to throw out one more book recommendation because it's great in terms of achieving your goals especially when you're trying to learn and that's atomic habits by james clear and i promote this book every chance i get because it's my favorite but essentially it talks about instead of setting goals just make sure you're on the right trajectory to achieving some sort of mindset but also change your mindset so like if you are trying to quit smoking for example identify as a nonsmoker as opposed to saying i don't smoke or i'm sorry as opposed to saying like oh i quit smoking so i'm not a smoker and changing your mindset and saying i am a full stack developer that will help you achieve these milestones and make sure you're on the right trajectory that that's great very practical advice uh just a very simple little mind hack that you can do to overcome imposter syndrome and one of our uh you know our prolific contributors and and community members over the years danny with gdg memphis was just asking i'm going to quote his question verbatim is very well phrased with the current times and with mental health being a big subject how do you deal with imposter syndrome and how do you deal with the doubts that you're facing especially during the lockdown and i'll just open that up to anybody who wants to jump in and has thoughts on that it's really long so i teach like an inspired workshop on like combating imposter syndrome i'll try to be very brief here um focus on the things that you know you know um imposter syndrome is something that people of all levels of success suffer with right um what really hit home for me is a quote um from maya angelou who is you know just profound and world renowned and uh she was like yeah i've written x number of books something like you know 19 books or something and every time i write the next one is when i think that the world is going to figure out i'm a fraud and it's like wow somebody who clearly is an expert um an inspiration to an entire generation feels that you know she's not good enough and she suffers with imposter syndrome as well so um it really just helped me like okay this is a thing it's a goofy thing and um and we gotta get over it right and so some i'll give you one trick that um i use with people who i know suffer with um imposter syndrome and it could be like um like just write down take maybe 30 seconds um give yourself 30 seconds to like two minutes and write down 10 things that you're good at right and that timer there is going to help you cheat the imposter syndrome because it doesn't have time to get in your head and talk to talk you out of it you're just writing it down quickly before you can second guess yourself and then at the end of that you look at that and reflect on it and it's like wow i have 10 things that i'm pretty good at that's that's really great you know um kick that imposter syndrome out yeah i love that i want to reiterate what you said about the fact that everyone regardless of where you are in your career how much money you make where you come from how many followers you have everyone experiences imposter syndrome and me personally i don't think i'll ever get over it people ask how do you get over it i don't think i ever will um but i don't know that that's a bad thing because it keeps me working hard um i will say try to recognize your small wins if you can recognize all these small things that you do that will compound over time you'll recognize how far you've come but i also kind of just want to challenge the question of like what is an expert like there's no definition of what exactly you have to have skill set wise to be considered an expert um and you don't need to be an expert to have valuable information so you know your your journey is unique and no one will ever walk that same journey as you which means you are viewing the world and your experiences through a different lens of someone else so your information and what you're teaching even if it's been done a thousand times if you want to teach react hooks um do it like absolutely because the way that you've learned it might resonate with someone else who was struggling with the concept so i would say you know recognize your small wins and just try to realize that everyone feels this way it's not just you can i piggyback on what emma said real quickly on um owning like your expertise and your your voice is so important um like emma said there's going to be dozens of blog posts tutorials or whatever on a certain topic and maybe you want to speak on that topic because you just learned about it and you want to write on like you know a hash note or something like that um and you're like oh well you know the the great expert has already written about it who am i to write about it let me tell you um when i'm learning trying to learn something and think about it from your own point of view you google whatever the topic is and you find like a bunch of results and you go to like one of them right and that one's not clicking for you so you go to the second one and then maybe you go to the third one um there's sometimes it's not until like the fifth or sixth one that i go to that is like okay this is speaking to me and how i learned this is great the other ones are in a different learning style are taught in a different style that doesn't resonate with me as well right so don't be afraid to put out content um that is already out there your voice and your approach is the differentiator so what other thoughts you all have as far as uh just using that confidence that you're getting uh these these same techniques that you're using to overcome imposter syndrome in terms of uh approaching the you know the meta of learning the code and going out and getting new developer jobs and working as a developer how would you use those same or similar techniques to learning a new topic for example it is very common for people to get stressed out about learning new mathematical concepts like if you wanted to learn linear algebra for example and you wanted to get uh it's a very commonly used uh form of mathematics and software development especially these days with like all the machine learning uh tools out there and and how would you yourself pump yourself up if you wanted to sit down and like i'm gonna learn some linear algebra this weekend what would your process be i think you need to find your why this is another book i could just open up you know a conference to talk about books find your why is start with why i'm sorry by simon sinek um he talks a lot about the reasoning behind why we do things if you can sit there and tell yourself i want to learn linear algebra because it will help me get a job at nasa i don't know maybe that's one of the requirements um as opposed to i need to learn this it's going to change your mindset um and it's i get to learn this right like i have the ability to learn this that's not something everyone get you know has the the privilege or the ability to do so for me it wasn't uh i have to study for technical interviews it was i get the opportunity to interview for an incredible job and that is my driving force great so um i would like to bring uh focus on like how do you measure success like you have talk uh you have spoken about how do you manage your tasks uh how do you pick books how do you pick resources how do you stay motivated but during this pandemic since a lot of things are happening at the same time you're hearing news from presidents you are hearing news uh breaking news from so many different areas how do you measure your success like how do you measure what you have learned and what you have not learned and because right now nobody is validating those things you are not attending interviews so how do you measure your success during this pandemic time i take small wins i'm going to focus on the learning piece of it um so starting a course yay me like i i am my biggest cheerleader right um and that helps fight imposter syndrome as well so yay me i started a course yay me i finished a chapter and you know i got a pretty good result on the quiz there um gay me i've actually finished this course you're going to hear about it on twitter yay i did it and then i take it a step further as well right because we all know that you can watch a tutorial but it's especially on coding but until you actually code yourself it's really hard to retain that information and so um then i want to go build something you know i'm going to take it a step further and it doesn't have to be a big huge app just something that's exercising what it is that i learned and yep i'm going to have to go back to that tutorial because some of the things i forgot i don't quite remember the syntax i don't beat myself up about that that's normal right we're i'm new to this um and that's okay forgive yourself yup that's why the resources are there keep consulting it right and it's not just one problem i might say okay now let me do another problem and after maybe two or three of those i'm not checking those resources as much anymore that's a win i count those small wins all day long absolutely yeah go ahead oh class central was a side project for me so it was the same thing i was trying to get better at php and i started it as a side project a onepage site to list all the courses from stanford and i just happened to be at the right place right time and for the first two years it was a side project and i kept adding new things just for the fun of it and i'm lucky now it's my job but i think finding a project finding some sort of thing that you're passionate about and then building something around it is is a good way to sort of implement what you're learning courses sometimes can give you a false sense of learning so trying to do something that's not following a script of a project or that somebody else gave it to you can be a good way to actually test yourself and figure out what you have not learned right right i um i just quickly wanted to mention a couple of things so for me success is success is subjective um but for me success is not a salary or a job title it's a mindset and i for me i realize i'm successful if i post a piece of content and it helps one person that makes me feel successful um but just to kind of visualize these things print out uh like a chart or whatever and you've got like different values on there and you every time you complete a course for example you color in a square or something so i do this when i'm paying off all my medical debt but i still have in the us like fill in hundred or thousand dollar increments right and every time you pay off a thousand dollars color it in you can apply that same thing to taking courses or um you know having successful github repos that aren't half alive like all of mine are i mean every time you take a course or you uh close a pull request like color it in and those visual reinforcements will help you stay motivated right awesome so visualizing your learning it like mapping it out uh do you all use any sort of tools to build like road maps of what you're going to learn or to how would you organize okay let me just ask a very openended highlevel question okay you decide that you need to that you've always been relatively weak in mathematics uh maybe you got through like the high school stuff and you kind of dodged or took the easier math courses in university the the easiest required ones uh you know or you didn't even go to university and like basically your math stopped it like high school geometry or trigonometry or something i mean if you're in the us i know in like china you would learn way more than that by the time you finished high school but um let's say that you want to go back and fill in the gaps how would you just using what you already know about learning lots of about qa or learning a whole lot about uh you know software engineering concepts uh learning new programming languages using what you know from your years and years of actually learning things new on your own and on the job how would you go about tackling that task how would you decide what to do let's just start from from day one you sit down you decide that you need to learn this new thing and we'll just say like you need to learn linear algebra since that's what i mentioned if you already know linear algebra don't worry about this maybe you can choose a different math this one and we'll go ahead and just start with uh we'll start with emma yeah so first of all i did terribly in math like i basically failed calculus if you're also bad at math it's fine i just want to throw that out there but um what i like to do is on one piece of printer paper i write down everything that's related i create almost like a graph structure where i'll start with the main topic i'm going to use data structures and algorithms because for me i can talk about that more freely so if i need to learn data structures and algorithms all right what data structures do i need break that down okay i need to learn things that are already built into javascript arrays objects sets things like that well what other things do i need to learn that aren't built into javascript linked lists uh you know hash tables i don't know whatever other ones stacks cues and kind of just create a little map of my for myself on one piece of paper and then based on those things what are the things i already am confident in color those in um and for the things that i need to work on what resources can i use to learn those and i create like a playlist i saw someone in the chat mention notion i use notion all day every day i also use the things app to create different lists like a to do application um and between those two i just kind of keep tabs on the on the different resources that i would like to watch to fill in those knowledge gaps okay awesome and how would you tackle that angie yeah i'll be honest like sometimes when i'm about to learn something new i'm not quite sure of um what's what am i supposed to be learning exactly right it's a new concept i just know let's say i'm going for a job or something and i need to know react right given that all i know is the word react i don't know anything about it i don't know i don't even know how to examine the courses that i could look at to see okay what does this course cover versus this course i don't know what i'm supposed to be looking for so in um situations like that i need to figure out like okay what's the best course for me what is it that i need to learn here and with that i seek out other people right um you don't have to do this all and figure it out on your own i'll give you a little tip though don't send people like generic questions of um hey i want to learn react where should i start right because that could be a really big answer and people if they don't know you might not take the time out to answer those types of things so try to be like very specific i need to learn react because i want to do x y and z maybe here are two or three courses that i'm considering do you have any opinions on you know which one of these would best get me to point b where i'm trying to get to right so that's a more specific question so figuring out like okay what is it that i even need to learn i'm finding that course again i have to block out the time otherwise the day gets away from me so i'll say okay i'm gonna take this course it says that this course is six hours long um okay where can i squeeze six hours in and i'm scheduling it out like maybe i only have 30 minutes or an hour that i can devote to something a day so okay let me make my little trello cards with 30 minute slots i can probably squeeze it in on monday and then again on thursday and then maybe you know tuesday or whatever so figure out and be realistic with yourself don't try to squeeze in more than you know you have time for um space it out if it takes you three weeks to get through six hour course that is okay you know you've done it you've gotten through it versus trying to do six hours and one day which is not that realistic for a lot of people yeah i just i wanna i wanna say plus one to everything angie just said 100 because like half the time i have no idea where to start and it's just a dumpster fire but secondly um don't memorize solutions understand the concepts and it's gonna take longer to do that but if you're interviewing for example um if you just memorize solutions but can't under don't understand that underlying foundations it's gonna be nearly impossible for you to explain this to an interviewer so be patient with yourself because understanding concepts takes a lot longer than memorizing but it will go a lot a long way awesome and i just want to highlight what jillian keenan said in chat uh she said i think a really good way to determine knowledge gaps is to ask yourself can you teach this to someone else maybe if you i mean there's always the rubber duck method if you're if you're social distancing completely by yourself but if you're with your partner or if you've got kids around you could try to teach them a little bit and and uh you know there's the saying i can't remember who said it but it was in my email blast that i sent last week it says teaching is learning twice um and you know you figure out the gaps in your own knowledge when you try to teach someone else i want to make sure we get an answer from daw although because i know he's just this is what he does he eats sleeps and breathes uh continuing education uh dal wall how many moocs have you completed by the way at this point you think probably a dozen not too many okay yeah but still i mean that's like the equivalent of like doing a graduate degree it's like 12 12 courses right uh but yeah how would you how would you tackle learning a big ambiguous new field of study i think i would try to find a starter course that allows me to put like five to ten hours and just making sure it's good enough and try to do a speed run through it basically understand like you don't have to understand everything but just to know what you don't know and i think that will help you understand then from there on it would help you plan out better i think we sometimes try to optimize things that we don't even know so i think just getting started as quickly as possible is something i would uh try to do instead of because you can go down the internet rabbit hole for of the best courses uh reddit comments you know like everywhere and then you might actually spend up more time finding a course then doing some sort of a short course that uh could take a few hours right right and uh i would like to bring focus on uh something that's uh happening in the internet right now that most of the companies like coursera and egghead they are opening up their courses they are giving the courses for free so what are your thoughts on that like do you think this is the right time for developers to grab this opportunity and learn as much as possible or should they focus on picking the right topic on these platforms and just completing few i think definitely picking the right topics um like places like free code camp always have free content i run test automation university we have free courses on programming and testing and all the things uh development um and yeah i think it's great that other platforms like pluralsight and things are opening up their content right now for free but i wouldn't recommend like oh let me start all the things right if you have 10 tutorials going the likelihood of you finishing them all is very small even the likelihood of finishing one probably goes down when you've started so many figure out what it is that you want to learn and i'm sure a lot of us have like backlists of things that we've always wanted to do and now maybe we have a little bit extra time and so it feels like we should probably tackle that entire list no think about like i don't know what are you most passionate about or what do you need right away for your current job or your next job or you know what's just something interesting that you would want to learn and maybe pick one and start that i don't know do any of you do like multiple tutorials in parallel i i personally have to do like one at a time yeah don't do it um i learned this the hard way um i your time and your willpower are depletable resources so you need to use them efficiently and effectively and i'm the kind of person that has shiny object syndrome like i see a tutorial i want to take it and i start it but what that means is i'm actually learning the skills that are relevant to me right now so um i would definitely recommend sticking with one because human beings like to think we can multitask but we can't great yeah i mean i would agree to trying to i that's why i usually prefer like full courses which are like almost a month long or something so once you start something you don't have to think too much in terms of finding resources you just do one single curriculum it's like what it's one storyline so hopefully it's coherent so you're building on top of the knowledge week after week and that's why you generally have a preference for university courses uh if i can jump in and just say like the reason free cocamp is a single linear curriculum is precisely to avoid what angie and emma are talking about shiny object syndrome historically universities just had a single major everybody just studied liberal arts and that was like you learn greek and you learn latin you learn math and you learn all these different topics but everybody learned the exact same thing and everybody in the world who went to college essentially learned the same general body of knowledge and we've gotten away from that with like all these different electives and it makes sense if you're like learning nursing that you shouldn't have to necessarily learn um you know i'm i'm trying to think of a good a good analogy here but but you wouldn't necessarily need to learn uh a lot of different skills if you were going to become a super specialist but i would argue that we should have a more generalistic uh you know university experience and then people can specialize on the job but anyway to to try to blunt the uh the power of shiny into object syndrome of grabbing your attention pulling you away from what you need to do and ultimately serving as a tool for procrastination we decided very early that free cooking would have a single linear curriculum and people would work from the top to the bottom and there wouldn't be a bunch of forks in the road uh because generally when your university is asking you to choose electives they're they're basically asking you to make a decision in a relatively uninformed way um yeah i like that free code camp is linear but it's kind of like a la carte in a sense because you can start anywhere you don't have to start at the beginning um which is really invaluable like you have a clear path but you don't have to follow that path if you don't fit into it yeah and i i don't want to talk too much about free code camp on this because there's no way you're here like everybody watching wants to hear from you all but i will say like it's highly informed from like video game design and i think the future of education you can see it in video games uh that that it's not only fun but it's almost addictive if we can make learning addictive then we've truly won and uh we're truly gonna have like a really uh enlightened uh populist so we still have about six minutes five and a half minutes left uh fuzzil do you did you have any closing questions that you wanted to ask to the panel yeah i'm just going through the twitter feed and uh someone uh recently asked one question uh which is like really interesting and something we keep on seeing on astronaut every time which is like uh oh my god uh like how do you uh overcome uh the um that someone else is doing better than you uh has learned something really good and has created a really popular open source project and i am some and i am somebody who is lagging behind so again like as emma has spoken about the selfmotivation so what tips do you have for beginners who are feeling this way i always tell people beginners experts anybody there's a philosophy i follow where i think about it as running a race right and when i'm running my race i'm looking ahead and focusing on my own path and yeah i might glance over to other people who are running but my focus is on my race right and if you stare too hard at other people think about the momentum that you're losing because you're not focused ahead and that's true in life if you're so focused on everyone else's journey that's time and energy and momentum and selfconfidence that you're losing focus on your own race everyone has different circumstances right i'm at home i don't have kids my job is very flexible so i probably can do more than someone else who has five children at home and a partner who is sick and you know their fever is running high and you know it's just a lot of different circumstances don't focus on other people's journey you don't really know their story you don't know how many times that they've fallen down this might be their third attempt at the thing that this is your first attempt at right and maybe that's why they're moving a little faster it could be a million different reasons don't focus on it because you're losing momentum in your own race focus on your race i also think too this is an important message which is computers are binary but humans aren't and so you're and you mentioned your journey is not going to have feature parody with another person so focus on who you were are today and compare that to who you were yesterday right right so here's a tip for all the big nerd developers don't get intimidated by someone else's success focus on your own journey yeah yeah i know i know i don't want to monopolize this but someone else's success does not take away from your success so you know unless you're applying for the same job but don't compare yourself to anyone else um focus on yourself and be genuinely happy for others who are doing well because again it doesn't impact your success right yeah i think so many people get in this kind of scarcity mindset where they're like feeling like they're competing with other people that are their peers but the reality is you know the world is a big place i mean we can't even fathom seven billion people like our brains can't capacitate those like that scale of numbers and uh you know nobody understands how everything works nobody understands how the market works how different companies are able to bring in revenue and survive it's a complex ecosystem and uh within all that ambiguity you can be assured that there is a tremendous amount of opportunity uh i mean we've somehow managed for most of modern human history to keep a bulk of people employed after this pandemic passes there are going to be new opportunities out there and you're not going to be competing headtohead with people around you in some abstract way you'll be competing in the sense that the more entrants into a field potentially you know the the more uh supply and demand uh demand uh is met and price goes down as a result but that's only going to have a very small marginal impact on you in practice all these people that are here in this chat room with you that are watching this video with you they're your allies and you have so much more to gain from collaborating with them than you have to lose from them also succeeding i mean it it really is true like other people's success is your success and celebrating other people's success is a great way to build rapport with them because that's the moment that they really are proud of and that they want other people to jump in uh any closing thoughts before we end this panel just there have been so many great things that you all have said focus on your own race your own journey is something angie said and just a minute ago emma said your journey is not going to have feature parity with another person great great use of uh software uh analogy there all right well we are going to uh i just want to thank everyone for joining we're going to take a five to ten minute break there are going to be slides playing there's going to be music from bass rebels which is this great youtube channel with with copyright free music that we can listen to uh while and jam out and just chat uh tweet questions for the next panel the next panel is going to be um how to work successfully from home without going crazy and i just want to thank our phenomenal guests for everything that they brought to the table here and that they've shared with us angie uh jones up in san francisco uh be sure to scroll down in the description there again there are links to everybody's twitter you should absolutely follow emma you should absolutely follow angie and dal wall uh of course uh emma thank you for joining us from germany congratulations on your dream job we're all excited you know a few weeks after you've settled in maybe months after you this is what you're going to be doing you're going to be learning all the different uh tacit knowledge associated with working at that company so that's what you're probably going to be doing but once that slows down and you have time we'd love for a check in on the free code camp publication you got it and then daw all thank you again for everything you are doing with class central you're taking all these huge you know this huge volume of free online courses and you're making it uh searchable and you're giving people qualitative feedback on you know like you can read the anecdotes from somebody who actually went through the course what they thought of the course and then you can see like it's just like amazon like you know the star review system so you can find the best courses for different topics and of course dawa also frequently publishes lists of the best courses based on data so thank you uh everyone for joining fazel and i will be right back in about five minutes with a new panel thank you thank you for your time it was nice talking to you all bye thanks for having me bye bye bye everyone have a beautiful day hey everybody welcome back uh i'm quincy larson with free code camp uh of course joined by my uh comc puzzle with uh hashnow.com and hey guys hey um and we this panel is about how to work productively from home and stay sane and we're going to be talking with three people who probably have a combined total of at least a decade or two of working from home uh tons of wisdom here if you're just starting working from home this is the panel for you you're gonna learn all the little tricks and hacks that these people have picked up over the years uh so i'm gonna go ahead and i'm thrilled to introduce you to our guests these are prominent developers from the community uh many of whom uh i've interviewed on the free cocaine podcast where we publish like videos of their workflows and things like that so i'll start with uh colleen schneidel schnetler and and she is a freelance developer in the arlington virginia area she has three kids and she manages to work from home while her three kids are not like barging in and completely disrupting her all day which is quite an accomplishment uh we also have jessica chan from the austin area in texas um and jessica is the coder coder you may have heard of her or checked out her in incredible instagram which is just filled with programming tips and it's just it's one of my favorite instagrams i strongly recommend you all check it out and uh and then of course we have sid who's in uh he's in amsterdam and he works for code sandbox which you may have heard of it's a new relatively new coding playground where you can go and build projects right in the browser he was previously at off zero again both jessica and sid have extensive experience working remotely as well so uh welcome thank you yeah so uh just just to start off like what has changed over the past month and a half for each of you maybe you could describe how the pandemic is affecting your your daytoday life and and we can we can start with uh jessica sure well i have been working remotely for maybe the past four years or so so it's kind of weird because on a daytoday basis even before this all happened i wasn't really i didn't have like a huge active you know life outside the house i would you know stay indoors do my work and so day to day a lot of things have stayed really the same but obviously i think just knowing what's going on in the world right now and you know not being able to say visit family and friends in person that's definitely been a huge change and just kind of moving from inperson meetups with friends to you know house party or you know different hangouts with friends instead so it's just kind of moving into the online virtual space like we're doing now awesome uh and how about you colleen so our lives have been completely upended because of the the children are no longer going to school and in the state of virginia they have cancelled school for the rest of the school year so it's been a month now my kids are three six and eight and none of them are um in school we don't have any child care options so it's i mean it's been really hard i've got to be honest like it has been okay i have a second grader so he should probably learn something the kindergartner and the threeyearold like they'll be okay um so trying to balance like this homeschooling which i am not a teacher um i've challenged i've been very it's been very challenging bad and like still finding the time for work yeah i can only imagine i i have two kids and it's it's crazy enough but yeah again they're they're not schoolaged so we don't have to really worry about teaching them um and sid how about you how how's uh calvin 19 impacted your daytoday life out there in amsterdam so i'm closer to jessica on this one that on the surface it's kind of the same like i was working remotely the whole team works remotely but i want to say that it doesn't feel like the usual at all like it feels very very weird um at home there's been like some tiny changes we have to make because my wife also works at home now so with like this this is the meeting room and the dining table is the coworking space so it's like we can't have like we can't sit at the same place and have meetings at the same time so we're like constantly booking the conference room uh but other than that it just it feels weird but like it's my life overall probably hasn't been impacted as much right i don't know about you guys but do you feel like like i feel like just the stress of the whole situation has really impacted my ability to focus too so there's been kind of third order effects like checking the news and seeing what's going on and then trying to work definitely right right yeah i've had to push myself back from keeping up to date on the news because it was kind of getting a little too much and just affecting your mental state right right so as you know like there are a lot of companies who had never heard about work from home concept so this is like the first time they are introduced to and i keep getting complaints from my colleagues my friends and they are saying like none of the work is happening is actually happening so things that were supposed to take one day of time it's like they're taking seven days of time to finish so what advice do you have for developers who are introduced to work from home environment for the first time so yeah i said you can go ahead first i can start i kind of feel bad for them because this isn't remote this is like this is not how remote jobs usually are so they've kind of been thrown into this without preparation without being set up for this so i'm feeling like and to be honest it's not just them even remote teams like mine are probably working at like 50 percent productivity right right now so i'd say that's just kind of the way it is right now because of like the stress and like it's just hard to focus and get things done right um we can talk about tips soon but i just want to like start by saying like it it would be harsh to like force productivity on anyone at this time and what's been really useful in our team is just kind of having that conversation where like i have a lot of guilt about not being productive because that's something i struggled with anyways so just having that conversation in the team has been has been kind of like comforting because i realize nobody is at their best right now so people are more forgiving than you would imagine right right yeah i do think it comes down a lot to just your company culture and how maybe empathetic or sympathetic your manager as well as the higher ups your company can be so i think you know this unfortunately might be one of your these your miles your mileage may vary situations um you know if your company is really understanding and they they know that you know there's parents having to homeschool their kids and there's more understanding in terms of having expectations but it can be difficult if you're working for a company or a manager who's expecting you know the same or maybe even a higher amount of productivity out of you at this current time which is just not really possible i just wanted to um just kind of like this is a great panel but i just want to come out and acknowledge the fact that we're all five developers like everybody here on this call we're five people who can work from home and i think it it we should it it requires saying that we are extremely fortunate in this regard many many people uh cannot work remotely like many people have to go and deliver packages or they have to work in a logistics center or they have to work in a hospital to help people who are sick many many things do require physically reporting to a specific location at a specific time and there is a tremendous amount of risk associated with that and so i just want to make sure everybody watching realizes that we do feel grateful for that reality and and that uh i i don't want anybody to get the impression that we're you know a bunch of entitled developers talking about how our our productivity's gone down 30 or something like that when people are out there like subjecting themselves to incredible risks uh them and their families uh so um this should not be a dour panel because we should be extremely happy i'm extremely grateful like i i look at like what i was doing before i was running a school i was a school director before i learned to code and became a developer and i had students from all over the world and they would fly in and help with their their visa paperwork and help with you know just monitor the the teaching staff and we had inperson instruction and i think about how that would have completely turned my life upside down like i was working like 50 60 hours a week just making sure all my teachers were happy all instruction all the admin staff were happy have you all worked in fields other than software development where working remotely would not be possible and how do you envision the difference between what life is like right now for you as a developer and what life would be like if you stayed in your old field um so i used to work uh in defense and that was a job where we had to go into the office because of the things we did and you know it's interesting you brought this up because i was just saying to my friend the other day i was saying like i hate to complain at all about the situation because our situation is better than 90 of the people in the world right now um just because of everything you said like i'm so lucky that i made this transition i mean at my old job like i assume we would have lost our jobs like they can't pay you if you know if you can't go to work um and just just even now like because i'm a consultant contractor um i don't know if i'm gonna have a job in three months like i don't know if our current contract our contract was supposed to be renewed but now we're waiting so we don't really know what's gonna happen happen and that's stressful but my partner also works so between we are so we have that safety net of a dual income household but i have so many friends who are independent consultants and contractors where they have one spouse that stays home with the kids and one spouse that works and that anxiety and that stress of like am i gonna have a job in three months like i have to support this family like feed these kids is it can be i mean i just feel like it can be overwhelming yeah i can i can relate to that a little so my first job was in the environmental physics setup so my job is literally to go fill in tests there's a stuff on it to see like how much like co2 in the atmosphere and all of that this was before like i decided that i don't want to do physics anymore uh but what's interesting is like i can't imagine doing that right now because it's like it we needed like these giant instruments that were only there in lab it's like you you just can't have that anymore and like being the most junior person over there i'm pretty sure i'm the first one that would lose the job right if the labs like labs work on like funding and they have to publish research and in time like this there is no research happening like you can't publish anything so if funding gets cut it's it's the it's the people who put the test tubes that lose the job first yeah i used to work in higher ed in just doing like administrative uh office type work and i'd imagine as you know many schools are either closing closed or trying to go online like my job probably would have been eliminated at some point or would be kind of on the edge so yeah definitely feel very fortunate and it's a tough situation for a lot of people in terms of their their work situation yeah and i i know that many people watching this many of your jobs may have evaporated and i just want to emphasize that we uh we want to do everything we can to help you find a new opportunity and i'm hopeful that this uh this conference that we're doing will be helpful in that regard um somebody in in chat uh just said he was laid off two weeks ago uh but that the benefit of being a developer is that he can take an idea or a problem and he can build something that could potentially replace that income so let's talk about work from home tools because that's a huge area of interest right now in terms of like like if you look at the companies that are hiring right now many of them like focus on remote productivity like microsoft teams or slack or zoom or some of these tools what is your work from home tool chain like and and how do you stay productive and work with your colleagues remotely what are the main the main tools you all use well my uh my workpiece is slack for everything so everyone's on slack even before this all happened i think they were they have offices in different parts of the world so they had already kind of had this system set up where everyone can communicate pretty well and everyone sort of knows how to you know do project management and other things um on online which has been pretty great so i think yeah some chat tool whether that's slack or discord or you know maybe even google hangouts i think is super helpful yeah and how about you sid what are you using over at code sandbox um so i guess slack is the common one view is zoom and we've recently gone through a bunch of pair programming apps because everyone that we used was having scaling problems so like our default choices kind of went went away but we've like settled on tuple.app which i think is new to maybe it's not as popular so it's working great for us that plus zoom plus notion it's i i feel like it's mostly communication tools and we're doing a lot of asynchronous communication these days like a bunch of writing more than they've ever done i think this has just made us like better at being remote than we were already interesting so just just to highlight what you just said there working remotely is is kind of increase everybody's average level of communication skills you'd say i mean we we were already remote so we had to communicate a bunch but then you always had the option that you know you could ping someone and you could say let's let's chart it this time or let's get on the zoom call right but even though we're like relatively close by like i think everyone in the team is in europe they're kind of working different time zones because somebody has a kid and then they have to you know sometimes they have to take the morning while their partner takes the evening so it's like everyone's schedule has kind of been just thrown off so now it's most of the conversations are asynchronous and i think we've gotten into a good habit of documenting and just like passing on thoughts processing them and then sharing them otherwise we would just like get on a zoom call and treat it like a tap on the shoulder yeah and how about you colleen what kind of tools are you all using so my teams use slack and zoom and whereby and google hangouts if we're feeling lazy um so just just those kind of communication tools i think because i this one team i'm working with um i i agree that this has actually helped us become more communicative which i think has been great for our team we're more likely to kind of jump on a screen share than we were before this happened which i'm not exactly sure why um but but that yeah so that's worked pretty well for us okay awesome it sounds like somebody might be washing dishes in the background uh if if your partner's washing dishes please mute um so uh one question we have from uh uh chat that i really want to highlight elliot sanford uh long time freako camp uh remember i think he's at a coding bootcamp right now too um elliott says how are you able to cope with being a parent and spouse but also able to learn and work from home and what do you do to keep work from taking over i'm struggling here so balancing familial obligations with um just uh work in general and the diffuse nature of working from home i should say yeah i i mean we i'm i'm struggling with this right because usually my kids are in school um and so it's been a month we've been on lockdown here for a month and at first i tried to like set the kids up with their work and work on my laptop by then but i found that my children are i guess too young they need more focused attention so for me it's really about managing my expectations so part of the reason i'm a contractor so i have free time to work on side projects as you mentioned earlier quincy someone said he got laid off and he was going to start building something that's amazing and that's what i do for fun and i have just accepted the fact that until we're out of lockdown like i just cannot do it i just don't have time like i will lose my sanity if i do it i mean you know i have to let some do you just have to let something go i think and so what we do here is i take the kids except for today of course i usually take the kids from 6 a.m to 1 p.m and then my partner takes them in the afternoon and then i supplement work in the night you know after hours um as needed but but it's hard and i think you know we don't know how long this is going to go on for so i think it's it's really important to although you have to work nights to probably meet your deadlines and continue your learning like don't burn yourself out um try to remember to take breaks try to like block i think it's about expectation management too like if you're gonna do kids from six to one like block out that time for them and just accept you're not gonna get any work done during that time but i mean i don't have a great solution like i think you know i'm just figuring it out yeah how about you jessica inter i know like how are you coping with the balance the worklife balance when work and life are happening in the same space yeah i mean my husband and i don't have kids so i think that's one i think big difference from my situation but i do know that when i first moved from working in a physical office to working remotely that was like a huge transition and it honestly not to like scare people it probably took me a year before i felt like comfortable and productive i was just like supe i felt very unproductive um and i felt like during work hours i would be distracted and i wouldn't really be able to focus on my work but then i would have to catch up on my work during the evening time when i should be sort of relaxing and getting ready for the next day so and kind of what colleen was saying in terms of time blocking is you know even if it's not nine to five hours try to when you're working be 100 working as much as possible of course and then when you're not working try not to let work sort of creep in but even if you're catching up on your work you know in the evening times i think you can still at least try to whatever current task you're doing sort of try to stay focused on that as much as you as much as possible yeah i can relate to that so um i had to learn the same way like when i started working i was either totally unproductive or i was working all the time i kind of like juggled between the two before i found a balance and what's been interesting is that like last month when i when my wife started working from home all of that balance kind of went out the window and we had to discover it all over again and i saw her working all the time and i was like what do i do so i also like the options were look at twitter look at the news or lose yourself and work so i think the first three weeks we just worked like all day all night but recently like with finally like it took three weeks to adjust but i think we've found a balance where uh we have a few things to work like we have certain workers and then we also know when to call it a day and that's the funny thing with remote like you don't see people walking out of the office or you don't like nobody tells you that it's time so you kind of just have to set a boundary for yourself and if you're in the floor if you're dealing with like a bug that you just can't fix and you want to get it done sometimes you just have to say it's 6 p.m i did what i could do today i'm gonna try again tomorrow and one thing that has really helped with this which which is new to me like i i did not do this earlier but it's new now because i found these escapes right and it can be like a productive escape like a side project so i've started working on a side project i'm super efficient with that now or it could be something which is not so productive like playing animal crossing right but just having something to look forward to in the evening like when you say like people talk about blocking time for work i started blocking time for not work so like three hours in the evening i'm either gonna work on my side project or play video game and because i'm looking forward to that i'm more motivated to finish my work during the day so that we can you know do stuff do something in the evening like we've been so many shows on netflix and it's it's fine like that's what helps the rest get done exactly my pet is super happy right now i'm spending more time with my cat taking her to walk so it's like no lockdown for her but it's locked down for me so yeah uh developers uh need to uh utilize this time that they have got uh and then they make best use of it and also balance it out between work and the home life right yeah and let's talk about time and the temporality of working from home because a lot of if you're no longer in an office you're no longer like how many of your meetings are synchronous where you're all talking like at the same time uh where you have like a scheduled meeting like what percentage of your day would you say is is actually has to be a tackled at a specific time versus like just an openended block of time that you could potentially shift to nighttime when your kids are asleep for example uh or other times like uh yeah we'll start with you uh colleen like what percentage of your day is strictly regimented to specific times um very little in terms of my work like we have um you know so most of my coworkers on for this team i'm on now on the west coast um so i prefer to you know kind of it works better for me to work later hours but we're completely asynchronous with slack so um i'm totally flexible there okay and how about you um jessica most yeah most of the communication with my team is probably asynchronous as well but there are i do have a few meetings per week where we try to be it has to be everybody at the same time but we're in relatively all the same time zones so it's not too much of a problem yeah and instead with uh yeah i mean how big is the code sandbox team because i talked to the founder of code sandbox like a year or two ago and it's grown so much yeah i mean i mean so much is relative i think when you talked with four people now it's nine but it's still a pretty tiny team uh what's been interesting is that we do the we do a daily stand up every day i've done it since the start and it's one of those like it's super optional oh i love this this reminds me of the famous kid walking sorry i knew this was to happen that we just moved into a new place and that door doesn't lie did you find this hang on it's very appropriate this is what we're all living with right now okay this is real life yep okay he's gonna hang out he's not gonna touch the keyboard or anything um he'll just be here for a few minutes until he's bored okay so um sorry for the interruption i i anticipated that might happen my wife has been kind of like on standby to prevent that but the kids are very wily it's very welcome i've met like my in my team i've met all the kids all the pets like this is like if a cat comes crawling here you just let it be it's fine this is part of the part of your team now yeah yes i was talking about the standup so we decided a long back like a while back they do a daily stand up and it wasn't so much to sync up on work it was mostly to see each other's faces and now more than ever that's been really useful that i think we've increased our meetings now because it just kind of helps to pair on something like we had so many meetings where we just spare even if it's like anyone can solve the problem we would just pair to do it together because it's like a it's like a reminder that we work together and honestly it's kind of nice to fade into like api details and not worry about like the looming thing in the background of your head yeah and we have a question from the chat for you sid uh uh leonardo uh gallante is asking uh what is the pair programming tool that you all use currently um so we use code sandbox uh paired with tuple tuple okay cool and code sandbox of course i think does it support uh multiple people editing uh a sandbox at the same time yeah you can invite someone and then do the dual cursor thingy yeah yeah so your whole team remote okay i mean there are three people in amsterdam but then right yeah so you're able to dog food your own product dog fooding being like you eat your own dog food you're able to use code sandbox to work on code sandbox yep yep that's somewhere it gets hard sometimes yeah all right so what advice do you have for companies who are trying to get used to this work from home environment so as said you have spoken about standups so how can companies effectively do standups should it be like 15 minutes 45 minutes one hour two hours because i have heard companies staying online and coding live so is that the right thing or what is the right thing here i i can start so yeah i don't think there's any right or wrong per se right like i think like standups are great to just get everyone in the room uh where standups i've seen gone wrong is where you just start trying to solve problems in the standup itself right right it's nice to just catch up with everyone which for us with like super tiny so it takes 10 minutes but like depending on how many people in the room you can go on for like 20 25 minutes uh but then what's useful is that you don't try to do things there and instead break out into different rooms so a lot of times our standups end with somebody saying somebody asking the other person to stay back because they have a question for them and everyone else just says buys and goes away and the two people stay on for the call for longer yes how about you jessica um yeah i mean i think this is one of those questions where the the correct answer is it depends but you know i think um yeah i think just trying to effectively and efficiently run your meetings whether they're in person or online is really important because you know if you have a giant zoom call with like 25 people i think you may not be able to be as productive as you could if you you know um split up into different rooms and also maybe being mindful of the the amount of bandwidth that's available for zoom worldwide and other places so yeah yeah and colleen did you have anything you wanted to add on this oh right i believe in over communication in this situation um now our team has always been remote but like i i liked i love sid actually i love the idea of a daily 10minute stand up because i'm an extrovert and like i've been in this house for four weeks so i'm like talk to me someone talk to me um so i love that but uh we're trying to move towards more towards a more communicative model because we've just i mean we also have a really small team and the code base is small so we're like stepping on each other's toes sometimes if we don't communicate enough um so i just think it's a situation where you over communicate i love the daily standup idea i'm gonna suggest that to the guys i work with and um you know the the slack messages and just just a lot of communication because you're not there you can't go look over someone's shoulder and be like oh you're working on this i'm working on the same thing well that's you know project management so so how frequently do you think companies should uh discuss um their updates with the developers like in a day like is stand up the only thing like calling like how what process do you follow in your company like do they meet multiple times in a day or do they meet twice like in the in the morning or and once in the by the end of the day so we don't do daily meetings um we just do all our communication on trello and slack and a call like if necessary um but i like i said i would actually i'm actually going to push to do a little bit more because i think it's hard to manage you know you guys know like you have github issues you got trello issues you got jira who knows where interests are so i i think it's better i mean i think like maybe even a daily like we don't have um someone that is just a program manager so everyone manages their own issues and so we only have we have maybe like priority issues once a week where we get together and talk about like is the priority still the same coming from the customer um so that's kind of what we've been doing great yeah and as far as uh like physical space so i know you all are working from home uh in some cities people are fortunate enough to be able to have like multiroom setups i used to live in san francisco and we lived in a uh and like maybe 700 square feet with uh with the two with the little baby and it was uh i can only imagine what it's like to be going through that sort of situation right now during the pandemic hit the pandemic just had the dice rolled differently in the pandemic hit when i was still living in there my life would be very different from being in kind of a texas standard issue house but uh but for those of you who do have you know more than one room or different spaces around the house do you delegate a specific room for like okay i'm in work mode now uh and how do you go about deciding which space you use for what and do you have any hard and fast rules that you apply for that sure yeah i mean i i also am fortunate to live in a relatively low cost of living part of the country and so i do have a dedicated office which i'm extremely fortunate to have so yeah as much as possible i try to limit myself you know in the physical space to just do work in the office so like i'll i'll never do work on my couch or my bed of course part of that's probably because i have an external monitor that i'm completely addicted to but you know i think i think it is important to you know if you're working from home keep have a dedicated area even if it's just like your dining table um during certain parts of the day dedicated to work yeah that that's been interesting so like this room is was used to be my office and i've i'm the same like i've been lucky enough that i was already set up for this so i didn't have to change much what's different is that now this is also my wife's office right so then we have to take turns so now the dining table has kind of become the other office and the couch in this room has become where we have dinner right so it kind of had to repurpose the house because it's either the dining table or the bed and i know i'm not gonna get anything done from the bed like the dining table is the office desk now and the couch is where we have our dinner so you have to like change it up a little but i think like just just defining those spaces was really helpful um because it takes a while like it took us two weeks but now we're now i sit on the dining table and i know it's the place where i work and not where i eat food so that helps me get into the zone as well right so one question uh that somebody has asked me on twitter is what do you think that companies are uh actually cautious about their ip being late uh their ideas being leaked because as cdo said like you and your wife are working in two different companies and uh so the projects that you are working on so how do how do how should developers manage this like how can they take care of this thing because sometimes companies are very cautious about their ideas their projects that they are currently working on should not be linked to others so what do you have to say about that are they concerned about leaking by like someone talking to their friend about the project or is it more like a security like a hack type i i don't know just the idea being discussed with someone else or a person from another company yeah so i guess a lot of discussions might have previously taken place in secure rooms especially like you know colleen mentioned she was in defense and i imagine they have all kinds of additional layers of security there but uh if if you're at home there could be like an alexa unit that's just passively listening and we don't know like whether that is actually being transcribed somewhere same thing with like people's phones and stuff like all the traditional security when you're on a meeting you know things could be said that uh could be recorded somewhere else or people could hear about or if you and your spouse are in the same industry then you know competitive information might inadvertently be shared that uh you know so i guess i'm not sure if this affects any of you all but uh d do your companies have any sort of policies or are they even thinking about these things at this point i imagine there are lots of other things they're thinking about i mean i i guess it's brave to assume that my wife already doesn't know everything about my work [Laughter] like being at home it doesn't really give an advantage but i do understand where the question is coming from so like uh before this like a long time ago i used to work for a healthcare startup and there were a bunch of rules about uh personal information like health data is kind of like very private and stuff so uh just for like for checking off all the things in the security audit we were supposed to have uh like what we call fingerprint scanners in the office and you weren't allowed to take any hardware outside of the office so there's like a bunch of rules and i imagine any company that requires you to like log in from a certain terminal all of that now is up up in the air right you work with whatever thing you have at home and like i like if i was still at zero maybe they would have a very good answer because they kind of are a security company but with code sandbox like the more we do in the open the better it is for us so i it's something that i've just like forgotten about yeah well let's talk about let's move to the staying sane part uh of working from home productively because i think it's clear that you all are working productively it sounds like things are still getting done uh most of you were already working from home before so it's just the same routine probably just compressed time i would imagine with uh other responsibilities and also i guess one question is like a lot of you have colleagues who weren't working from home uh and now they are and suddenly they're having to rapidly spool up on what you all had already kind of intuited about successfully working from home what would be your advice to your colleagues uh and have you given any advice to colleagues or that who've approached you and said like oh i know you work from home like how can i do this right like what would be your quick and dirty tips uh for successfully working from home if a colleague approached you and asked you colleen so i have a lot of tips because i feel like jessica it took me maybe a year to kind of like figure this out um so i think you have to remember to we're in the middle of a pandemic so as we discussed at the beginning of this your mental and emotional state aren't going to be what they would be otherwise so you need to be mindful of that but like practical tips are this um you're at home so you don't have the natural breaks that you would have in an office so do a pomodoro timer you can actually see my yoga mat behind me because i do 25 minutes of work and then five minutes of stretching um and i do that all day but um i would recommend that to force breaks first give your eyes a break just give yourself a little break i also recommend during that time do not get on social media because that will distract your brain from whatever you were working on before so i like to take those five minutes of break time and like i said like do yoga or you know throw a load of laundry in or something like that um and then the time blocking we talked about earlier i thought was um was really good that really helps and then so what i do kind of like the office i also have an office and i use my noise cancelling headphones like you guys have on and that kind of puts me in like the mental work state like when i even though i don't always turn them on like if they're on my ears like i know i'm supposed to be working so i think actually someone in the last chat talked about atomic habits but um james clear talks about that in his book as having these habit cues and so for me one of my habit cues is noise canceling headphones so that really helps okay awesome noise cancelling headphones pomodoro technique um having something you can do during that that uh break time during the pomodoro to and and staying away from social media during breaks because who you know for the second you landed twitter trending it's just it's all over like you're like what's that oh my gosh is that really happening is is the real world really this horrible now um how about you jessica what would you how would you advise a colleague who just realized that they have to work from home uh for the first time yeah i think i mean colin has some really excellent tips i think just to add to that i'd say maybe one is take breaks like i tried to get out of the house and take a brief walk a couple times a day obviously you know following whatever guidelines are in place for where you live and i think it's really hard for people who were working in a physical office until recently to feel connected especially if you're more on the extroverted side so one thing that i've been doing with colleagues is actually doing zoom meetings just to kind of catch up so like we'll do like a virtual coffee break a couple times a week if any of you have played jack box it's like a game you can play over zoom relatively easily if you share your screen just like a group game everyone plays um on their phone and so it's just kind of a fun way to have a little break in the day kind of get maybe some of that energy the social energy back okay great um and uh how about you sid yeah what advice would you have for a colleague everything jessica and coin said uh the only thing i'd add is like i first of all i really like what jessica said because it's something that i have started doing too and it's like i'm not extroverted but this is also not my happy place right like even as an introvert being logged in your house is not what introverts want right like i like the choice of going to a party i just don't like going to parties right but what i've like what i've been enjoying which is new for me is exactly what she said just calling up your coworkers just to have a chat which is not about work right just asking them how they're holding up what are they up to and just just the fact that we're all doing this together at the same time kind of takes away a lot of guilt that i get for like not being efficient or not working and i think more than like getting the work done getting away from the guilt has been really helpful for me and that kind of motivates me to get back to work uh practical tips what i like is like i'm kind of obsessed with blocking time so like early in the morning or like the night before i'll plan out what do i want to do the next day and then in the morning i'll just have blocks of time like this is this is when i make lunch right this is when my meeting is this is what i try to get done and then just making sure i have at least a few giant chunks of time where i can actually write code uh is is kind of crucial for me and the the last thing i would add is having like a ritual almost like a habit thing like we we think that we can hustle our way through this right like we all we lack is motivation to work it honestly like our brains are stupider than that so we really have to like pull them into it so i really like having like a morning start work routine where it's like i open a notepad i look at my tasks and i just write for 15 minutes and that kind of gets me in the in the headspace to start work instead of you know thinking about twitter or recently thinking about tick tock because that's what it has come to and in taking a walk so this was like my pre uh lockdown routine where i would just to end work i would go for a 15 minute work now that 15 minute has become i just like stretch on or do some exercise on my wife's yoga mat so it's like just having these tiny events or like tiny actions that kind of say that okay this ends my work day and now i'm ready for like the other stuff has kind of been useful to fool my brain into it like stop thinking about work start thinking about your wife now right on well one thing that i think we would be remiss not to cover is how is this pandemic going to affect the future of work um how is this experience of social distancing and basically all of us working from home during this period like do you think that people are going to go back to offices everything's just going to go back to normal and snap back the moment that a vaccine comes out and is widely available and we're all safely able to just return to the office like do you think that that is going to happen or do you think that this is going to cause some permanent waves well i think it will cause permanent waves because i think without a pandemic generally obviously depends on the person but working from home is just so much better so you know i'm in this social slack group with some friends and one of the guys is disabled and he's been telling he was telling us like for years he's a web developer for years company with companies wouldn't hire him because they said you can't work remotely and now surprise everyone can work remotely so you know that's frustrating for him but he's also he also thinks it's wonderful because he's like the whole disabled tech community now has been given more opportunities to work from home something they were told they couldn't do um and i mean i think for everyone most people again remote work is just it's just better so i think a lot of people are gonna push to keep it if they can and it's cheaper for the company right like office space in manhattan you know right many developers are going to realize that they are actually more productive now and hopefully after the lockdown they are going to request their employers to like allow them to work from home yeah i think so i'm kind of like double minded on that because i think a lot of developers would like it because it kind of takes away the skepticism they had right like i've talked to a bunch of friends who said this would never work right are they like no i'm an extrovert i need people around me but now that they're forced into it they were forced to also look at the good sides along with the bad side so i have a feeling like at least a bunch of developers would want to do it yes i'm also afraid that a lot of like higher ups in the team right would look at this and say we tried remote work it wasn't as productive right like this was this would be the bad case study yeah where the truth is like nobody is productive right so i think i think it would definitely increase the number of chances so if you're a company that can go remote i think you'll just there would be more demand for remote work and you can just capitalize on that by all people to work remotely and your folks would like having the choice i think would be the difference yeah so i have a question for you guys for uh do you guys have people in an office anywhere press both for sid and jessica are you is your company fully remote because i always have i have this theory that a pack of people are in the office and you're remote then it's bad for the remote person and i'm wondering if that's true right i think it depends on the company my company is majority in office so i was working remotely even before i am a minority but um i think that it really depends on the company they've done just such a great job of making remote remote employees feel on the same level as like the in person obviously you know we miss out on some of the water cooler chat and some other you know talking about projects that might come up but for the most part it's been done well so i think it may depend on the company yeah i can relate to that so i think it depends on like how how seriously does the company want to take it so at odd zero i was working with a i want to say 13 our time difference um like most of my team was in the honor service in argentina so even though they were all remote they were kind of in the same time zone um so what was interesting was that the team kind of had a rule that if they're having a meeting with one person remote they'll just go sit in different corners of the office and all join by a zoom so i think just having it's like treating everyone as equal was kind of the point and even if a decision is made in person where for example like a lot of time people would meet in the office when i'm just sleeping but they'll make sure they document it and they put it in a dock where we just like chew on it for a while and comment on it to to get the conversation so i think a lot of it is like i'm sure a lot of companies are bad when they start and then they learn this through the times and then like just having a mature process around it really helps uh right now at code sandbox we do have an office which is like it's it's we call it an office it's a room in a coworking space right so sometimes when we feel like seeing each other's faces we just end up going there so like we have three people in amsterdam including me so we end up meeting each other once a week and then every month one or two people from around europe just like flies in to spend some time in the office and that's more of like a social thing than uh it's like like there are there are coworkers that i've never met in person which kind of feels weird so this helps that once in a while you just get to sit next to them and you know i don't know look at look that they actually have legs an artist just an insight from chat jesse weigel uh frequent uh youtube streamer here on the free cocaine channel on a prolific dev he said uh he often feels that uh it's difficult to participate in a meeting when he's working remotely and everybody else is in an office and and being the remote person is kind of like you're you're the outsider and there have been studies conducted i think stanford did a study of remote work in china and they found that it's harder to get like you're just as productive as everybody else or maybe more productive because you don't have to spend a lot of time commuting but uh you are less likely to be promoted because the work you're doing isn't as visible as the people in the office so we could talk about this for another hour uh this has been fantastic i've learned so much i've gotten so much insight and i i think it's going to change how i personally work from home especially a lot of the insights i've gotten you know from uh from colleen who's done this for so long and it's great hearing how uh how sid and how um jessica's organizations are approaching this as well uh this is almost a reckoning for everybody who is previously like uh not working remotely and working with other people remotely now there's going to be a lot more empathy i think going forward when they're working with colleagues who work from home because hey everybody's going to have had that experience right it'll be it'll be kind of a permanent uh memory uh that will persist and hopefully you know make people more empathetic going forward so um i'm hopeful that that is one silver lining that'll come out of this i just want to thank you all uh all three of you for coming on it's been phenomenal uh as i said i've learned so much i've been sharing some insights in chat and over on twitter and everybody who's watching this and hears like a you know a really compelling thing like the point colleen made about people who were previously told they couldn't get a job because they couldn't work remotely because you can't work remotely if you're if you have a disability that requires you to stay home hey like there's a proof of concept now that work can be done remotely so therefore hopefully this is you know a huge boon to people in the disabled community who are who are interested in uh getting more job opportunities so yeah there's a silver lining to every cloud even a cloud is as black as this one so again i want to thank you very much uh jessica colleen sid everybody scroll down click on their twitter follow these people on twitter they're fantastic i don't regret it all following them i've learned so much from them and be sure to check out jessica's uh fantastic instagram thank you everybody we'll be right back in about 10 minutes everybody stay tuned and uh just keep each other company in chat cheers thank you we are going to be talking all about the post coronavirus pandemic uh developer job market essentially uh what you need to do to be able to get a job during this pandemic uh what your prospects are uh how you might want to change your approach and like what your odds are who's actually still hiring what kind of organizations are likely to grow during this period where opportunities are going to come from we're gonna be talking about all those things and more and i am very proud to have gotten three amazing guests who all know quite a bit about this domain um first alien learner she is extremely learned as her last name may suggest she studied at mit and is an engineer and a developer and she also worked as a recruiter and she was unsatisfied with the way uh technical recruiting worked and she founded a company called interviewing.io where you can go and you can get uh interview training and you can work with real people to get uh interviewed and you get a job through there too and maybe she can share some statistics about like the number of people who have gone through later but uh we're we're thrilled to have you with us thank you thank you andrew brown uh from toronto uh and he is a super knowledgeable guy he's worked as a developer for years and years and now he runs exam pro dot co which is a website where you can go to get uh comprehensive aws certification training and he's been working on getting as many people as possible through these certifications so they get certified so they can get the many many cloud engineer jobs that are out there and probably growing as a result of this pandemic um and so andrew brown thank you very much for joining us oh thank you and laurence bradford uh you have probably heard her if you're learning the code uh learn to code with dot me is her website it is an amazing website that she she's got a blog she's written a whole lot actually everybody here i'll just say everybody here on this uh panel has published extensively with free code camp so if they're if they seem familiar that may be one of the reasons why alien learner has written extensively about uh the job market and uh the technical interview process and shared tons of data that she's gotten from her platform andrew has created uh at least three i think four major fulllength courses that are on free code camp's youtube channel including an aws for startups and also uh through three different aws certifications and laurence has done so many amazing articles on freecodecamp as well and she has uh one of the longest running programming related podcasts out there it's the learn to code with me podcast so uh if you go into itunes or wherever you listen to podcasts just search learn to code with me and you will find her podcast and she has done 120 episodes she's she's getting ready to head into i think season uh season seven season seven okay yeah so these people are extremely prolific and knowledgeable and i'm super excited to hear their insights about uh the evolving job market so as i started with the other panels i just want to it is strange to be talking about opportunity uh in a time of death and despair and disease and i just want to emphasize that we are aware of all these things we are not physicians we're not frontline workers we're developers we're all doing the best we can we can take as a given that life kind of sucks right now for a whole lot of people and we can be empathetic about that at the same time i'm optimistic that you know 12 18 months from now there will be a widely available vaccination and life will go back to some semblance of what it was before and this is a good time for us to be thinking about that and thinking about what the world might look like coming out of that and also figuring out what we can do today to you know create a positive influence on tomorrow so uh i just want to say that right now it may seem crass that we're talking very uh transactionally very um bluntly about the developer ecosystem and the job market and all those things when people are out there dying and i just want to say that we we do care about that we're aware of those things but we're gonna we're not doctors we're not gonna give you any medical advice or anything like that we're just gonna stay focused on what we know what we know is helping people advance their developer careers so thank you with that note uh i want to go ahead and kick it off and just uh ask aileen how's everything going with you how's everything going with uh the developer job ecosystem in general at a very high level in your in your thinking yeah um things have changed quickly in some ways and they've stayed the same in others so my my whole world is my company and i'm very heads down in that but fortunately what we do is very tied to the subject we're talking about so i'll just share what we've seen and hopefully that's useful um as kind of a microcosm of what's going on everywhere everywhere else in the world so um interviewing io does two things we help people prepare for technical interviews and then if they do well regardless of how they look on paper we actually let them skip a lot of the stuff that happens at the top of the funnel like applying online or talking to recruiters and they can like directly book technical interviews with engineers at companies where they might want to work so what is uh what are the implications of that um on one hand uh we've seen a lot more engagement among our existing users right so i think people are home now more than they used to be which means they don't have to go hide in a conference room to do an interview during the work day so we're seeing people interviewing a lot more which also means there's more competition for potentially a smaller number of jobs i'll get to that in a moment we've also seen and i'll just be transparent about this um a good chunk of our customers freeze hiring and it's sort of it kind of came in this sort of um uh normal distribution like at first it was this trickle right and people are like yeah we're just gonna freeze for a week everything's fine and then you know a few days later no it's we're gonna freeze for like two or three weeks and then more and more customers came in and started freezing um those tended to be if we were to put a category there companies that are probably series a and um earlier so those companies i think are the ones that tend to have the most uncertainty and the most instability um and in some cases less runway so of course uh makes sense that they're being conservative um some of our larger customers we've seen pick up on hiring i think in part it's a response to the increased inbound applications that they're getting and in part i think it's because unless they're very very stable right let's say you're a series b series c type company right you're probably going to start seeing a little more attrition right now because some portion of your engineers are going to proactively go to the most stable jobs of all which is probably fang right facebook um apple amazon netflix google and microsoft potentially um so uh we have seen a shift to to more people applying there but we have seen a pickup in hiring especially among um these sort of larger companies that are doing things that are in some way related to solving the problems the world is facing right now maybe it's remote communication right maybe it's healthcare and healthcare is a very big umbrella that covers a lot of different things but in general we've seen that that space pick up um maybe it's logistics right uh maybe it's delivery of food uh so there have been these sort of spikes and then there's been a lot of drops and i think net if we were to average out the whole thing there's definitely been a slowdown in hiring um but it doesn't we were expecting to see maybe you know half or more of our customers freeze and that absolutely has not happened and our overall interview volume like how it's what it's constituted of has shifted but it actually hasn't dropped very much okay great so just to be clear like the number of opportunities may have decreased but it's not nearly as big of a decrease as you might think yep and who knows i mean i don't know i basically stopped trying to predict the future right uh things change so quickly like in a matter of days and our strategy has changed like three times internally now so it's a hard time for us but um so far it's less bad than i think anybody internally thought it would be okay awesome and uh alien if you could just kind of hold your mic slightly off your shirt it's just it's pushing your mic which is creating a little bit of clicking so exactly yeah no worries i didn't want to like ruin your flow or anything yeah just when you're talking and you can just mute when you're not talking so you don't have to worry about it but that's like a frequent thing i'm sure laurence has encountered that when she's doing podcasts like the itu the apple headphones always had the mic rub against the shirt collar i get very animated also like if you have jewelry on i do this like sometimes it can bang against the table and i realize that i'm like oh i'm probably so loud like right near the microphone but yeah yeah well laurence uh so you're experiencing this from a from a different perspective you have tons of friends who are applying for jobs uh what has your experience been like anecdotally yeah so my experience is really different because i'm not um working with directly people who are applying to different companies i'm not working with companies who are interviewing candidates but i've been hearing from friends and also just my own research honestly the last few weeks i don't i don't know why but i've been very into following who's hiring who's laying off um like these shifts and where like people are spending money the new york times actually published a really interesting graphic yesterday that showed it was like this really this bar chart that showed where people are spending less concerts uh restaurants a few other things that just like aren't really a reality right now when we can't go outside and be in groups but then it showed this like spike in spending in other areas like delivery services groceries i mean i know personally as a household we spent twice as much last month on groceries like going to the grocery store buying food or delivery stuff than we did the month prior and i'm so yeah i've just been fascinated with this shift and like where we're spending money how we're spending money the company's laying off the companies who are hiring more now and as you said quincy i've had friends who have been laid off or on the other hand friends that are completely overwhelmed and really stressed out with work right now because they're having the most work that they've ever had in their life and specifically the two friends i'm thinking of work in like shipping logistics ecommerce uh my my like childhood best friend growing up she she doesn't work in tech but she works in like shipping logistics for dhl which is a really big like shipping company and she has huge clients all around the globe and she's like this has been the craziest week i've worked here for five years and this the craziest few weeks has been absolutely insane but turning the conversation like back towards technology i've been really following a lot of the news again of the companies that are laying people off which there are a lot i feel like if you look at the headlines or you turn on cnn or what have you another company is laying people off and other companies laying people off but then on the flip side there are a lot of companies that are increasing hiring another friend of mine who used to work at a cannabis startup of sorts i don't know exactly what they did but i know she got laid off and i know she very quickly got an interview at a life insurance company because it's not really shocking but life insurance sales i think they've doubled or something since all the coronavirus stuff has been happening so there are these industries that maybe isn't talked about as much that are seeing an increase in demand because of all this um and as you said in the beginning quincy like it is really unfortunate that so many companies are going under or laying people off and then there are like these winners and losers but it just is i don't know the way it is right now yeah and andrew what's your experience you're you're coming to us from uh north of the border uh yeah yeah i can give you the canadian experience and i do know a little bit that's going on uh to our our friends to the south um and i would i would agree with laurence um there are industries that are definitely taking off and ones that aren't i can specifically say like if you're looking at edtech med tech or stream tech uh those ones we're seeing uh that they're uh that they're thriving because they're going virtual or you know it's direct to the pandemic or the fact that everybody has to uh now uh work virtually um other industries that uh the technical demand is growing i wouldn't say they're thriving but the the demand is there is insure tax so lauren's just mentioned that that's a really good uh point and delivery tech that's another one right how to get stuff to people or logistics uh so you know if you are looking for a job uh you know consider looking at those industries and trying to tailor tailor your resume or tailor your skills for these industries in the short term because i think that's going to help you um to talk specifically about the roles that we're seeing that people are getting laid off for for those who don't know like um you know i wasn't just a developer i was a cto um for multiple startups prior and so i'm very fortunate to be part of a network of ctos in canada and so when people say that um that companies are laying them off i literally see the ctos and the slack group saying i had to lay off these people and then what they're doing is they are trying to mitigate that by helping um uh or finding other companies to help hire these people back okay um but to talk specifically about the actual rules where i'm seeing um uh that are being deprioritized and the ones that are now scaling up on i actually made a little list here so there's there's uh what i've been seeing for people getting let go for is sales and business development digital marketing ux and web design uh in some cases uh uh uh data analysis uh and and that's why i like to think of it as that there's growth aesthetics and and analysis which are being cut down on because that's really when you're focusing on the growth of your business and right now people are being more conservative and so they're looking uh more for security reliability and support and for those kind of roles we're seeing a huge increase in a general technologist if we're talking about from the cloud perspective that's called a solution architect uh project management's very important uh cloud engineer so that's a hybrid between web developer and cloud skills virtual assistants i even have to get a virtual assistant because the increase in this um this market has been uh crazy social media support so we might have seen a decrease in people doing sales and marketing but we're seeing an increase in support uh for uh existing users uh and that stuff like that data engineers so we saw a drop with um uh data analysis but we're seeing now data engineers will become more popular site reliability officer that's someone that can make sure that the platform is running uh stable and security engineers so you know listen to that uh that list i gave you i might share it uh later on into the free code camp discord as a as a conversation after after there if you want to know a little bit more about those roles but that is my take on it and that's me looking at these lists that are coming in who's getting laid off and that stuff and by the way uh these lists are actually public um i just don't feel like they're publicized very well and so i was able to grab those links and i have a list of lists of places that are are are hiring and a list of lists that are layoffs you can go through there and you can see what's being hired for and what's not and there's another list of of of people that are getting uh that are looking for work right it's called the helpless dot ca um and i i think there's other countries doing it i just know i just know the canadian space um uh but but you look at those lists and and you can even get a feel of you know how you can align to that market to get a job uh so you know there i think that's a a bit for now so i'll tell you yeah i mean that in the background fantastic and it sounds like you have the making of like a big you know like a major article like or maybe even a regular article like hey here like this this week's update uh during the uh uh pandemic pandemic job status anyway any way i could help i'd love to write an article it's just it's people just have to ask me right so yeah right yeah well consider this a request for another there you go then you get and you'll get an article and and laurence i know you've also been trying to assemble as much information as you can and get it out there in the hands of people as far as like uh i mean we could we could absolutely run like some sort of survey or something i should actually put together a survey for this conference sorry i didn't think about that until now uh but i will i'll get that together and i'll shoot that link out through twitter so just follow the lockdown conf hashtag and look for a post conference survey a lot of people are watching live right now we're getting some questions i'll go to those in a moment thank you everybody for asking your questions please just pile all your questions in there we've got experts for the next uh 30 minutes or so and we want to get as many other questions to them as as we can and then a huge number of people probably like ninety percent of the people who are going to watch this are gonna watch this after the stream ends and just watch the uh you know the the edited version where we're gonna edit out the breaks and everything but um so uh i have a very very quick um question that i think uh i want to ask to my coemcee um how are things going in bangalore and what's the indian experience like because india is a massive country with tons of tech companies and i just heard that the uh lockdown was further extended today yeah yeah yeah the lockdown has been extended uh yeah the lockdown has been extended till may 3rd we just got the news from the prime minister this morning and uh the companies are taking it slow here from what i have heard most of the companies like food delivery companies and hyper local markets and all those companies have reduced the number of hiring here at the in the current time and most of the hiring that are going on as andrew said are on the nontechnical uh jobs right now so so yeah um it's it hasn't impacted um like some anything different from the rest of the world okay great and uh this question comes from the audience uh from elliot sanford who as i mentioned earlier we had a question from him uh he is a boot camp student and he's getting ready to graduate it's kind of like the university graduate in 2008 right like coming out to a fairly tepid job market a relatively tepid market coming out of a coding bootcamp in 2020 uh what would be uh his question is how should i as a boot camper near graduation combat negativity and what things can i do to compete against the more experienced developers in the hiring pool oh i'll start great yeah um so there are two things that make coming out of a boot camp really hard and i think these things were always hard even in a great market and they're going to be extra hard now so the first thing is even getting your foot in the door so as you probably know there is a somewhat potentially unfair bias against boot camp grads um and what makes it even harder now is that one of the other groups that we haven't talked about who's experiencing heavy layoffs is recruiters so recruiters are getting laid off like crazy which means that a company that previously potentially had a whole team dealing with junior hiring might now have just a handful of people that are scattered between sales recruiting ops recruiting um and engineering recruiting and some of them might not be domain experts in those fields because they're just being grabbed and that's what they're doing now um so it's even more important now than it ever was before to find a way to get noticed and stand out and if you apply online and i've said this before about applying online even in the best situations it's kind of like screaming into a black hole like the abyss will probably not answer you uh so if you can um just bypass recruiting entirely find an engineer that works at that company find somebody even if you don't know them maybe they wrote a blog post about something you're interested in just get on hacker news get on the company blog get on linkedin make a list of engineers that work there that you have something smart you can say to or something that you uh can talk about a shared interest you know maybe maybe you know somebody in common and just treat it like a sales job so pretend you're a sales development representative and you have a funnel and it's your job to just reach out to engineers at a bunch of companies that you want to work and to each one say something that doesn't just say hey i graduated from a bootcamp and i'm looking for a job talk about something they've done you're interested in talk about something you've done that is related to the subject matter and you're going to get a lot of you're not even going to get rejections most people will just ignore you but this will probably improve your odds of getting noticed by an order of magnitude if not more so that's the first thing the second thing that makes graduating from a boot camp really hard is being prepared for technical interviews now different companies interview differently not everybody does fullon algorithmic interviews but depending on where you're applying chances are they do and you can probably find out one of my personal biggest pet peeves with i think every boot camp under the sun is that they do not do an adequate job of preparing you for this and they also deemphasize how important it is so i would get on starting your funnel doing all your outreach to everybody to get your foot in the door and in parallel i would start heavily preparing for technical interviews code camp has a free code camp has a lot of resources of course my company does this so we'll encourage you to go to interviewing i o but there are books there there are a ton of resources out there um and i would spend weeks if not months and i'm sorry this this is going to sound discouraging but weeks if not months working algorithmic problems uh understanding data structures and filling in those gaps that your boot camp probably left in your education it's going to be hard but if you kind of embrace the idea that it's going to be hard and make peace with it you'll be successful just sort of say it's going to take three months for me to find a job maybe more i'm okay with it and in the meantime i'm gonna go heads down and focus on these two things cool awesome advice and i'm actually typing up verbatim a quote you just said aileen uh so uh andrew did you want to talk about this a little bit too oh yeah i would love to talk about it so it uh so for those who don't know i'm in the uh the greater toronto area and i actually do a lot of mentorship with boot camp grads from a variety of different ones here so we have general assembly lighthouse labs uh we cloud data and juno and so there is a bit of a difficulty getting the job at the tail end there um the career services for every boot camp is different some are some give you a lot of support afterwards um some uh put on you to to do that effort but i can give you a couple of hacks of what you could do to try to get a job in the market um and so there's there's two ways we can we can take the friendly way or we can do the cold call way and so let's talk about the cold call way um and this is my approach and i could do this today and get a job uh in a week and so so this is what i would do i would go to angel list uh camera if it's dot say or whatever the or dot io i feel like it's a dot io but if you look up angel list it has all the startups uh in the world uh per country so i would say okay what's my closest uh tech hub it's toronto or what's in my time zone as long as it's my time zone or near me that's great i'm going to sort by the greenest greenest meaning the newest startups on the market i'm going to go down the list i'm going to try to guess who is near raising money to get uh their their their it depends on what kind of risk you want to take but if you're if they're close to getting their seed or their series a i'm going to find those green companies i'm going to look at them and say um what do they do and what impact can i make on their company and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to reach out with them and i'm actually going to build them something and i'm just going to ship it to them because if you show up and hand with some something it's very hard for people to say no if you can guess what it is that's going to really help them uh it's it's very unlikely they will will turn you away but i think it's a better method than applying to 30 40 places if you uh it's better to build 10 apps that are for very specific industries and then you get to keep those apps and also um you get faster and faster building applications so you say if you think it takes a lot a lot of time that is the number one thing i find boot camp grads coming out of their curriculum is that they do not have the the technical speed um so they might have the skill but they don't have the speed and so you should be able to build out uh small applications whether it's five or ten in a week and ship those things out and you'll get a much greater response and the thing is people are always worried about giving those away for free the reason i'm not worried about doing it is that if somebody wants to utilize it they need the person that built it to maintain it and you have them on the hook so they're going to want to bring you in the door for that you've really thought about what the problem is for the business owner and a lot of startups just do not post their jobs online because they do not have time or uh there's such a small team it's just like they feel like they're wasting their time so they're gonna wait till they get to a certain growth before they post that stuff out and by taking that initiative that is a great way to get your foot in the door and also to get a role that you normally wouldn't be able to get and then quickly move up the ladder okay so that is the cold call way the other way is the friendly way and i find this works for medium to large companies and uh the idea is that you want to become friends with whoever it is uh that works for that company so if you want to work at aws you better go on linkedin you better add everybody you know that works at aws um and and be authentic and and try to be as helpful as you can and document your journey that is parallel to this company and uh you know hopefully what they'll do is they'll take notice of uh of it they'll like your stuff i never tell people to go message people directly on linkedin i say go add somebody you don't have to message them and then just if they'll see if you're active they'll see you in their stream if they're interacting with you that means they're aware of your content and then you can go reach out or you can go on linkedin say boy i wish i had a job like this and those people who have already seen it and then they'll reach out to you um and and that's the friendly canadian way to get a job i don't know if it works everywhere but it definitely works really well here so those are my two hacks for you one thing i'll quickly add if that's okay i strongly advise not messaging engineers on linkedin or adding them on linkedin because they're not they they hate it because all they ever get there is recruiter spam right so sorry so i would say that in context it depends what it is so if you want to add engineers just add them if your profile looks and by the way i have an article i think called linkedin for losers i don't know why i named it that but because it's like ll but i i agree with you i think you're right i get so much spam it drives me crazy but if you just add somebody what they're going to do is they're going to look at your linkedin profile they're going to say what is this person's motivation what why do they want to connect with with me and if you look like that you just you're interested in the same space and you're going to share cool content and you're not going to be like like spamming that person trying to get a job then they're going to add you and then down the road when you build up that friendship then you can message them or or do that subtle thing saying oh boy i wish i could work here yeah um i guess both approaches can work i in my experience i found that just figuring out somebody's email address and writing them a highly personalized email that touches on something they've done before and something you're interested in is much more effective but i uh i have not tried uh sort of the add me and then i'm gonna post interesting well i'll tell you i'll tell you the other day i got an email from somebody and and they sent me a really long email and it was great but uh it was so long and especially like when you're uh like a developer you're busy you don't have time to read long emails your brain just turns off so if you do want to take that approach make sure it's concise but the only reason i stuck with that email was because the person who sent me the email their profile was was star trek themed so they said so that is a big long thing and i'm going to read this going oh man they're just trying to they're just trying to like uh uh game me you know like trying to trying to uh build that relationship really fast um but that they had that that uh personal biased uh and that that got them a personal response back for me i wouldn't say uh that always works every single time but it just that time it worked so yeah personalization is key i've gotten so many emails where people just rehash everything they've ever done and it just reads like a generic cover letter i get dozens of those a day and i tend to ignore them i would say oh sorry about that i would say um i would say that it's not just being personable it's being authentic and i think as humans we can tell when something is off so so even if you think you're being personable it's like we know you're up to something right so personal so something that touches on something you've done something i've done something that not just friendly but something that that draws on a shared interest or or something useful that isn't just networking i think we're saying the same thing oh you don't know for certainly i'm just i'm just trying to to iterate that uh being personable is not the same thing as being authentic totally and i think that you know you can be personable but we're like okay great but we see that there's an agenda behind it um you know and i get just to interrupt like i get a lot of emails uh and a lot of them address me as sir like sir and i immediately know okay this person's probably asking for something if they're calling me sir right off the bat if that's how they address me uh and also if i get an email from you and it's in a like a nonplain text font i'm just gonna automatically archive it like i won't read it because the quality of the emails that i get that are not in like just the standard text that have some sort of formatting on them is always very low uh so it's just like pattern recognition don't use funky fonts don't use like a lengthy signature um those kinds of things are tells that uh you're not human yeah okay i had one thing oh real quick about that for the boot camp grad so i think both of your answers were fantastic and i always tell people like it's never too early to start practicing for a technical interview like yeah months in advance like even if you're not even thinking about getting a tech job yet um pandemic or not like start practicing for those technical interview questions for sure super important that can like literally make or break your opportunity of getting a tech job and competing with other people who do have computer science degrees however if you're a coding bootcamp graduate or soon to be or someone else looking to get a job in tech and you're feeling a lot of pressure because it's like wow i'm going into the job market in like the worst possible time like literally when was the last time you had a major pandemic like this affecting our lives like i don't know like like what this uh in 1918 or something so years ago yeah so yeah so like give yourself some grace like like realize that these are crazy unforeseen circumstances and if you're in a situation where you need a job to support yourself or your family it is completely okay to have a temporary job plan even if you did just go to this coding bootcamp even if you did just graduate from a degree with or a school with computer science degree uh of course go after those positions but do something else in the meantime to make ends meet and there are companies like i know instacart is doubling their customer support um staff by the end of may so i think they have 1200 now and they're going to be uh going up to three thousand like but yeah by the end of may so like six weeks or something maybe a customer support role at instacart isn't your dream job but nonetheless i think it could even be a step in the right direction depending on what industry you're coming into because instacart is still a tech company maybe you you know again maybe it's not exactly what you want but it could be a step there you could get your foot in the door at that company or maybe you could leverage that experience in the future to get a job at another delivery company of sorts but as a junior developer so give yourself some grace this is a really hard time right now and like just take that in as you you know go about your job search i would like to bring to this something to the focus here like what advice do you have for developers who are planning to uh land a job uh in companies like facebook and google because today morning uh cheryl from facebook announced that they are going to hire 10 000 people in engineering and product by the end of the year so what advice do you have for developers to apply for these companies and also crack those jobs for oh i i actually i'm not sure if i would be the best to answer this because a lot of my experience is like at startups and whatnot but i did see this statistic you're talking about as far as um facebook playing to hire 10 000 more developers which is like literally five times the size of my college that's like a town of how many developers that they're hiring i know they have a lot of employees though but i feel like eileen maybe you'd be better at answering that and like approaching um a big tech company like that yeah i mean my uh my advice is not going to be that different for those companies than than for other groups again um right now those companies are getting hit really really hard because everybody views them as a stable place to work right so uh they are some of the only ones that are advertising loudly that they're hiring during this time they also pay more so even even in an easy easy economy it's hard to get noticed and here it's going to be even harder so um if you can try to get a referral in try to um chances are a lot of them one thing that people don't know about recruiters at these companies is that most recruiters are contractors and i'll explain why i'm talking about this in a moment so um what can happen sometimes is you get reached out to by a recruiter if you're fortunate enough for that to happen and then by the time you see it maybe you missed it you reach back out to them and they're no longer there these people are usually contractors that work at these companies for six months stints and then they move on to the next place um so again i would try to forge a genuine authentic relationship with an engineer at one of these companies maybe an engineering manager maybe think about which teams might be hiring more than others you'll still have to go through that like centralized interview process but at least you'll have somebody um put your hat into the ring um so that's that's one i know that's not super useful advice the fact is like it's really really hard and it's gonna get even harder but if you are fortunate enough to get in and this is um extra important interviews at these companies are very very difficult and they tend to follow a very very specific pattern and you really only get one shot one one piece of data that we've seen on our platform over and over is that the same engineer can do very very well in a technical interview one day and then the next day absolutely bomb even if those interviews are of comparable difficulty with engineers who are comparably strict it's because the interview process is just fundamentally nondeterministic and there's just so much room for error the best thing you can do once you get your foot in the door is to spend even longer than i advise before preparing for interviews so that when you do get your opportunity you don't screw it up here's another thing that i've seen a lot of people do wrong sometimes somebody is so happy that they finally hear from one of these big companies that the recruiter who's incent i mean recruiters are incentivized to make hires as quickly as possible because they're compensated on it and they're they're uh generally uh that's like their um their bar for performance that doesn't mean that you have to interview immediately if facebook reaches out to you they get back to you and they say okay great get on the phone with a facebook engineer next week if you're not ready just push it out and they're gonna be okay with it don't panic don't say okay this is my only chance i'm just gonna cram the night before it's gonna if you've never done these kinds of interviews it will take you months so accept that push your interview off schedule it a few months out and then spend hours a day preparing so i might be able to touch a bit on the like fang or large companies there so um one of my friends he wanted to uh work at google well i don't know if he wanted to work at google but what he did was uh he was reached out from uh uh from recruiters uh within google and he went all the way he went all the way and they offered them the job and then he said no so he didn't really want the job he loved the challenge and now he he makes video games he lives on an island uh and but the thing the thing about that is that he's they said okay well who should we uh who should we hire since you're so great who can you recommend and then they reached out to me and so i was going through the process and then i did the same thing i went yeah you know what i'm having fun doing this but really i'm not going to see to the end so i'm going to stop here and they went to me and said who can you recommend so um you know if you if if you know any friends who've gone through the process um or or make friends with other people that are going through it because maybe they can pass you along and and the process is very uh uh uh random so like i was going really uh really well through google i cannot get hired at aws to save my life and it makes no sense because everybody around me you'll be able to work at says you are qualified um the process is crazy i've had like senior senior develop developer advocates reach out to me and say to me you know i had to apply five times to work to work here before i got in so you just have to take your bumps and realize that it's going to be a very difficult process i can say that you know for any of these companies assist well depends for the job but systems design is a very important thing so understanding how to build a complex systems so or looking for a systems design engineer if you google those terms those might help you understand conceptually how to put things together and obviously there's algorithmic challenges interview preparation if you could find any good services for that that would be great too um you know so that's just my two cents on uh on that part uh just one more thing to add there um if you are from india and you're coming to canada last year we started fast tracking visas to india because we really want more talent here um so so there's a lot of opportunities uh there as well if you want to work at a big company but not necessarily one of the fan companies uh there's good recruiters like uh vanhack i always hear really good things about them and you might think that right now there's no opportunities because there's no way to uh there's no way to bring people actually into canada but what what's happening is that these companies are hiring the remote and they're waiting for everything to blow over and then they bring them into canada so we're not seeing a drop uh drop in there uh if uh if you want to get into cloud jefferson frank is a really really good recruiter if you want to get in into data science roles or anything data in canada we career is really really good they're not a recruiter but they they know a lot of companies uh that can get you placed um and those those are the three recorders that i like generally i don't have a good relationship with recruiters um so i do like to mention the ones that i feel that uh do care about you and are trying to do a good job and they're the ones that are working on contract and they're trying to push every person every applicant uh into that into that uh that box you know laurence uh do you have any friends who are applying for like large you know that we say fang but that could also include you know shopify could include infosys and microsoft and a lot of other big companies that are actively applying not that i know of um i feel like a lot of the people that i'm around either well actually honestly don't work in tech because i grew up i was not in tech at all right so a lot of my friends from college and before that are not in tech uh or like startups like my husband um just like we met actually at the last art that we worked at and now he just started his new startup i do this um so a lot of like the people that were kind of around a lot of the time are more so in the startup world but i have been reached out by or i have been reached out to from recruiters from google definitely and um one of the things that you're saying andrew in your example i know that at least one of the people it was because someone else i know that he was working at youtube he gave her my information because i also do think please correct me if i'm wrong um but say if i did end up working there he would get a referral he would get like a bonus right yes so like they really incentivized employees for good people yes yeah i i'm not sure if it's the same with candidates as well but yes yeah i don't yeah i'm not sure about that but yeah for the people who work there it's like good so they a lot of times will like share qualified people that they know of to the recruiters that work at those companies so yeah but yeah well so there's a pretty big gulf because a lot of people are in kind of startup land and other people are in like big company land like their they've kind of got their sites set on working for a big known company um uh elene what would be your advice to somebody because we already heard a little bit from andrew about applying to smaller startups uh but what how would you vary your approach if you were going to go on the job market today as a developer and you wanted to work at like a small upcoming company like for example code sandbox uh sid from code sandbox was on the previous one and they're they're growing they're still very small it's like i think you said like nine people maybe a company that has closer to like 50 people like how would your approach be different there than applying to a microsoft or an amazon yeah depending on the company size let's say it's under 20 i would probably reach out directly to a founder and ideally the cto right that person is the one that has the most leeway to make exceptions companies of that size are typically biased against hiring junior talent because uh when you're that small you don't always have the luxury of thinking months years ahead you're often kind of thinking uh just a couple months ahead and that means that you may not have the bandwidth to train somebody up and depending on the constitution of your team you may not have the mentorship ability to get somebody from a to b right but rules are meant to be broken um people that are not the founder will probably be more riskaverse about breaking those rules because everybody has some amount of social capital at a company or and you use it you like you get a few shots right and you you try to spend it on things that are going to have the best outcome but if you're a founder you can do all sorts of crazy right so um i would i would probably reach out to a founder and um you know write the best most concise most authentic email that i can if i can get an introduction to them even better understand that founders are very very busy they're probably not spending more than a few seconds on any email so just say in the first two sentences who uh what you want and then explain why you deserve it and that's the whole email right maybe link to some things if you've done cool stuff uh for a slightly bigger company um who probably is hiring juniors because they do have that mentorship and within the ability to think ahead more um you may want to reach out to say a director of engineering um sometimes you get lucky and you find stuff they've written about hiring and if you can find something they've written about hiring and reference that and of course tell a compelling story about how hiring you fits into their world view and thesis that's a win they will definitely they might not hire you but they will at least answer you and once you have your foot in the door then it's just on you to show that you're capable um but you know uh in in this climate if you have a limited amount of time and i would probably not spend it on applying to very small companies because they're dropping like flies all right well that's some really good advice just just to recap what she said there a lot of people are proud of their hiring process and they will publicly write about it like i don't know if i've actually written about how free code camp hires but like if you want to work at free code camp you just have to be a prolific volunteer contributor and 100 of our hires come from people who are already essentially working as volunteers in the develop the developer community so if you can find like how they hire that can be huge information because you can just kind of go right into that flip stream and uh present yourself as an ideal model so knowing a lot about the interviewing party and their uh their thinking on things and how they think about yeah yes and we have been getting a lot of requests from twitter uh andrea would you mind resharing the recruiter's lists so i absolutely will yeah you should open source on github make a list or something and then share it with everybody oh yeah people tell me to do it i'll do it yeah and and laurence if you want to write something we would happily propagate these kinds of things because this is precisely what people are looking for is just some some information that they can go on uh but the one of the big takeaways i'm getting especially from hearing aileen uh talk is we should be practicing as much as possible and this might be a really great time to just really go deep on learning algorithms data structures design patterns and just getting really good at programming so that you can really nail those interviews you can apply to hundreds of jobs and you may have to apply to hundreds of jobs anyway to actually get uh interviews and get offers but that process will be much easier if when you actually do get those interviews and when you you know you're prepared what yeah so in terms of just very quick advice for like what people should prioritize and you know let's say that they have been handed this block of time that they you know had previously eight hours of sleep eight hours of work eight hours a leisure very few people actually had that split it's probably closer to like four hours of leisure maybe seven hours of sleep but if people do suddenly have a few extra hours a day what would be the most efficient allocation of that time and we're just going to go once around and that'll be our closing question uh we'll start with you aileen great so um if i it's going to depend on your seniority level so for this i'll assume that you're junior and you haven't done a lot of this before there's one great book whose name escapes me but that i will get after this and tweet it out the theme of the book is basically algorithms and data structures for nontechnical people that just learn to code so it breaks it down in this very approachable way and isn't super mathy is just mathy enough um i think it's exceptional so i will get that uh that's step one is to just get your head around what you're dealing with step two is to work problems on your own there's leet code and then there's a great repository of problems that actually shows you exactly the steps that you would take to solve them called interview cake big fan of both of those step three once you've read a read a little bit about this and then actually work some problems is to start practicing um we are not the only practice site out there i think we do a great job but even if you don't use us if you go to interviewing dot io slash recordings or just go to our main site and then in the nav bar there's a link called watch interviews you can actually watch other people practicing it's kind of like a boring twitch if you will but if you haven't seen these interviews before you're just going to see what interviews are like with google engineers and microsoft engineers and linkedin engineers and airbnb and a bunch of other companies so just watch those and then once you get over the shock then start practicing because working problems on lead code is very very different than working a problem while somebody is breathing down your neck and watching your every move it's really really nervewracking but the good news is once you get used to it and once you get used to thinking out loud it gets better and then of course um potentially one of your practice interviewers who's probably from fang can refer you into that company so there's there's a journey if i were to do it awesome thank you alien uh and uh laurence if you were if you were going to go apply for a job and you had some time how would you how would you spend that time preparing for a job application spree yeah i think i mean everything that she said about interviewing was great information i think beyond that though just trying to build a community and build i don't like to use the word connections because it feels so like oh yeah i'm like going networking events which we can't even do right now can't go to meetups or networking events but just building friends essentially that work in the tech space so obviously free code camp is a great resource for that there's also a number of different slack communities for developers or for other folks that work in technology or design um there are online events like this and i know because i keep seeing a bunch in the news there's other kinds of online conferences and i imagine they have like maybe like virtual breakout groups of sorts where you can meet other people and i think that is just like a great way to spend your time right now and as you were i'm chatting before about getting jobs at startups i just remembered i had a flashback to someone i worked with at my last company who studied philosophy in college he was the company's first customer support hire he wasn't great at that role but he taught himself how to code on weekends and nights and he ended up building the first internal staff app no one asked him to do it he just did it on nights and weekends super helpful for the company he then became an engineer and now to this day it's like six years later he's leading the entire internal tools pod and has people reporting to him and this was someone who learned to code on nights and weekends has a philosophy degree and he just kind of showed up put himself out there did things on his own took you know initiative and of course made connections with people at the company or made friendships and he's still there to this day so i think just making yourself useful and building um or building friendships okay awesome and andrew oh cool yeah so i would say uh you want to build and ship and document okay so build applications ship them off to small startups document your your journey so so people can uh can find how you're doing stuff i believe there's a lot of startups small startups that are are hiring you you can uh create yourself your own role that is irreplaceable uh and i think there's a lot of there's companies that are going away but there's a lot of companies that are are thriving in this industry so look for those particular techs and try to focus your energies uh there and i think if you do those three things i think that's gonna be a lot more valuable than anything else because if you can produce a value or result for a company in the form of an application that is your proof right um so that's that would be my approach awesome well i want to thank all three of you uh everybody watching scroll down follow these people on twitter they're super interesting check out interviewing.io check out exam pro and of course all the awesome free courses that andrew has already published on freecodecamp for aws certification check out the learn to code with me podcast and laurence's blog there are a ton of resources out there everything you need to prepare for the developer interview process is out there just explore those resources i hope you all learned a whole lot from these three people who've been there and who've done that and are kind of sending information back through time to you at your earlier stage in your careers um thank you all and we'll be right back with our final panel of the day which is around finding freelance opportunities so don't go anywhere uh enjoy some slides and some some music for the next 10ish minutes and we'll see you in a sec thanks thank you everybody thank you hey everyone welcome back this is the final segment of lockdown conf 2020 we might do another one depending on uh feedback uh i am going to get a survey out uh shortly after the event with the hashtag lockdownconf uh so if you all have feedback on ideas you'd like us to discuss for future events let us know but i am thrilled to introduce you all to three prolific uh freelance workers very experienced in this field they're also people who have contributed a great deal of uh lessons and and courses to frico camp over the years uh first bolaji uh from nigeria he is a seasoned freelancer and most recently he's working at hashnode as a developer and uh he knows quite a bit we're going to hear a lot from him hello how has everything going with you bolaji hi quincy how's it going great to have you here uh next we have phoebe faddell she is a developer in the uk and she has also worked extensively as a freelancer and now is working fulltime at a company as a developer um welcome phoebe thank you quincy it's good to have you here and we have luke siciliano who literally wrote the course and the book on uh freelancing and he has uh done an incredible amount of freelancing over the years he i believe has done 25 years worth of freelancing and running a consultancy that does freelance development work and seo consulting and things like that so we're privileged to have with with us this walking talking repository of freelancing wisdom so thank you very much for joining us luke oh well thanks for having me it's honestly it's my pleasure to be here so yeah well uh we are going to be talking extensively about freelancing this is a time when many people are looking for work uh many people have unfortunately lost their jobs just in the united states alone uh unemployment claims which is just people who can actually successfully get through the phone to claim unemployment benefits uh 16 million people over the past three weeks so this has been absolutely devastating uh to people here in the us and i imagine also in in nigeria and in the uk and europe uh and we are going to um we're going to delve into all that but i just want to preface this with everybody who has who's listening here who has been laid off or has been furloughed we're very sad about that situation we're gonna do everything we can in our power to give you the tools that you can go out and you can find other organizations in need small businesses large businesses uh nonprofits other organizations and that you can help them solve their own problems uh through technology as a as a freelancer so um my first question to all three of you uh and and we can start with phoebe um what is freelance software development and how would you describe the field of freelancing as far as you know doing software development um so from my experience i i freelance for experience because um i'm a career changer so i went from one industry into another and a lot of what i was doing i was learning at home and i wasn't having that kind of sort of more practical experience so i started freelancing and the easiest thing for me to do was to do wordpress sites because it's you know it's very low cost for the client and so from that point of view i kind of approached um sort of local businesses and family and asked them if they wanted websites so i started quite lowkey um purely for experience um and it kind of like snowballed from there really because i just did one site and then word got around and then it kind of you know kind of had a life of his own so um yeah so i think for me it was started off just to get some experience but then it kind of became a bit of a side business next to my studying and also i was looking after my two kids at home because i was a stayathome mom as well so for me you know you know i i wasn't aiming for something that i was going to do for long term but it kind of ended up that way yeah and if if anybody is interested in phoebe's story it's really remarkable and uh she's written about it at length uh if you just google from stay at home mom to freelance developer i think is the headline you'll pull it up maybe somebody can share it in the chat for everybody but so phoebe used freelance development as a way to transition into tech and i think that's pretty common uh bolaji how about you how would you describe freelance development and and your experience freelancing in the past okay um so basically i've been freelancing for like two years now and at the point when i started i was just possibly a beginner and like you know before you get hired you have to get a point where you're really experienced at least um surpass the interviews and all that right so at that point i wasn't really so good but i knew what i was doing and so that's one of the best way i could practice my skills you know try it out with friends families and know hey i can do this i can do that and all that so and then people were really interested in help having me build stuff for them and then through that i was able to get started with building projects and all that and i was able to build stuff like a lot of stuff and then i had um so many clients around me and then while growing i was learning more and then i eventually um got hired and started working professionally but still i still feel as even up to now like a few days like virtually every month because like i started with freelance and like it's really cool awesome and uh luke tell us a little bit about your experience in 25 years ago how you got into freelancing um i would say more than anything it really just started by coming across a few people with some problems that i knew how to solve the specific answer to your question is i got asked to write an app for a local deli that wanted to have a street fighter 2 tournament back when playing games in the arcade was like actually a thing so i wrote an app so he could track that and then one thing led to another i would really just define freelancing more than anything else as as an individual solving other people's problems i mean and as long as you just keep doing that people are going to keep calling you okay awesome and uh let's start with talking about what kind of how the market may have changed for freelance developers because prior to freelance developers you know we weren't in a global recession like we are now a lot of people had a lot more cash on hand now things may have tightened a little bit the kind of people who are looking for freelance help may not be looking anymore others may have new problems that they're looking for freelancers to solve perhaps you could talk a little bit about uh the kinds of new clients you're getting luke and and how they're approaching you um right now i would say it it's the markets definitely changed in number one like you were saying earlier i mean we're all really fortunate to be in a spot where we can keep working right now as opposed to being furloughed and so i'm just kind of trying to make the most of that opportunity in terms of clients right now the first thing i noticed is quite a bit coming in from current or previous customers just to give an example i built a progressive web app for a small church about a year ago and because of what's going on they couldn't hold services so they wanted to integrate video streaming into their website so getting a surprising number of calls from either customers i've been helping on an ongoing basis or previous customers just needing something else done in some regard in terms of other business beyond that i think that this has really created possibilities while i know a lot of people may look at a time of crisis like this and think that possibilities may be decreasing it's true that a lot of possibilities decrease but other ones open up because anytime anything creates a problem for small businesses that's a problem that needs to be solved and nine times out of ten or a lot of i shouldn't say nine times that temp a lot of times developers can solve those kinds of problems so it's definitely creating opportunities anything ranging from for example um the small local restaurant that knows they've needed a new website an app for the last 10 years and they've just never gotten around to it now all of a sudden they're prioritizing that so you know people can order online um you know the consulting firm that's used to dealing with people oneonone now they've got to deal with everyone virtually so they need a mechanism where people can securely submit documents to them um things like that this has really changed the business needs of a lot of different types of companies out there now that those are problems that developers can solve so those are the new kinds of customers i'm largely seeing as people that now have a problem that they didn't have before and they need that problem solved and like i said that's after just doing things for previous customers yeah and that makes perfect sense so your previous customers are proactively reaching out to you because you're on their radar right and and they know that you have proven that you're capable of solving the problems in the past so they're reaching back out to you um phoebe if you were to uh like not magically not be working in your current job hopefully that doesn't happen but let's say hypothetically you were to go back on the market as a freelancer like how would you reestablish contact with past customers and let let them know like hey i'm i'm back in business and whom would you approach and like what would be your general strategy for that um well actually i maintain contact with all my clients a lot of them um i have like a care package with them so i maintain their domain and their hosting and i get in touch with them you know once every couple of months and sort of say is everything okay just checking in so i kind of maintain that relationship with them anyway um but in terms of sort of finding new clients i think it's just um usually actually i get approached i get approached now um even when i'm working fulltime um and with the pandemic actually i think people have had that kind of downtime when they start thinking about um i should really get back into looking into that website i need to update so i've had um actually a few contacts that i've got in touch with me saying can you work on the website so a lot unfortunately i've had to turn people away but i've referred it to other people i know in the field um so it's kind of it's kind of a strange situation because i noticed that the work stopped and then the moment that this horrible situation happened people started getting back in touch so um i guess like you know i would probably approach local businesses see if they're okay and sort of say do you need any kind of updating um and that's what i did when i was freelancing anyway i would sort of make contact and usually through my existing networks so it doesn't come across as cold calling i guess so you know say hey i know this person you know heard that you might possibly need a website updating and i think that works best kind of building that trust um and you know having that kind of credibility already so it's you know if you get referred on by someone else that really helps so awesome and it's great to hear both of you have existing relationships that are continuing with these people and a lot of things that if you're new to freelancing you may think oh i built that and it's done but it sounds like a lot of your work uh as a freelancer is maintenance of code and making sure that things continue to work would you would you say that's accurate phoebe yeah i agree yeah definitely and it's just you know a lot of time you know um some of my clients don't have a massive budget so they say oh i want this and i said but they can't afford to do it and i said well that's fine you know we can build features on top you know once you get the budget um so it's it's you know so it's kind of prioritizing what they want and what they need and trying to differentiate the you know rather desire versus what they actually need to get the website off you know so um yeah so i say definitely maintenance and just adding new features as well um it's just kind of a continued relationship awesome and uh fazel uh within the hashnow community what pro what proportion of people would you say that are really active on hash node are interested in freelancing or doing freelance development um i would say uh we don't get a lot of questions or discussions specifically for related to freelancing so uh i'm not sure that we can i can come up with a number on number of people who are actively looking for freelancers on hash product because uh we don't get questions on those uh on on this area okay well well do you uh have you noticed any discussions around this uh yeah uh with linking yes yes uh one question that i have um like uh often come across is people like there are developers who are uh trying to get into freelancing for the first time there's maybe there's maybe new new uh developers beginner developers or experienced developers so what advice do you have for people like this how can they start their freelancing career okay awesome uh and uh have any of you found like aside from uh luke's comprehensive course by the way uh it's right here on this youtube channel you can check it out after this if you're interested in freelancing uh it's several hours long and it he also has like a lawyer like a small business lawyer and like an accountant uh so it's kind of full spectrum small business advice for people who want to become freelance developers and i strongly encourage everybody to check that out aside from that what are some other resources you all have found over the years that you've found helped you a lot communities or other learning resources that are useful for premises that they should be aware of i would i honestly think the things i found most useful are not necessarily even uh related to uh working as a coder or freelancing in general but just uh general business books uh general personal finance books things of that nature um i strongly strongly and a whole bunch of stronglys think that you know working for yourself as a developer or working for yourself as an independent baker or working for yourself running you know as an independent auto mechanic really aren't all that different i think you know a lot of it just kind of comes down to the same ideas and some same basic principles um so i think anyone who is trying to strike out on their own right now in addition to just reading as much as they can about uh you know i guess i'm trying to say don't limit your reading to how do i start up my independent dev shop or how do i start making money as a freelancer start reading as much as reading and absorbing as much as you can about being selfemployed in general i would say that that's the probably the best resource that a lot of people could engage in a couple of books i would probably suggest just off the top of my head um one is called the millionaire next door um i actually think that should be required reading in high school so that's just you know my personal opinion which you know it doesn't count for much obviously that one a book called the innovators by walter isaacson is you know like a really really good one and a book called profit first which is really just about managing the finances of a small business profit first might even be the first one i would say somebody should read right now yeah and i haven't read the millionaire next door but my understanding is it's an older book and it it really uh the book's core thesis i think is that anybody who's working like a middle class type job and this may not be completely true in 2020 where we've got you know a lot of people working as contractors and having limited access to opportunity but people who are making like the median level wage for an american which would in america it's about i think it's like sixty thousand dollars is now the median wage it's gone up a little bit um if you can figure out ways to cut costs and save a whole lot of money you can use that as a nice cushion and you can invest that in the stock market maybe not the stock market but you'll you'll get enough recurring revenue from that that it just keeps reinvesting and i think it's like the benjamin franklin quote about like the most powerful forcing the universe's compound interest right uh yeah actually that may have been einstein quote because it doesn't sound as profound coming from somebody who's focused on money but from somebody who's focused on science i think that compound interest is so powerful uh so so just to to process a little bit about what luke said there general business books can be just as helpful as anything else because a lot of what you're trying to do is figure out the physics of business uh so that you can keep your organization alive and that ultimately you can provide your for your family and uh you know keep the the cash coming in which is the lifeblood of any business um so so thank thanks for sharing this uh yeah so one question that we have is how can uh freelancers market themselves developers developer freelancers can market themselves during these times right if they are starting out what uh do you have any tips for them and it'd be great to get uh your perspective on this belagi if you have advice since um i know uh nigeria is very competitive market there are a lot of really skilled developers there yeah yeah right so when it comes to marketing it starts from your network itself um it's much more like internal than external so marketing starts from your small peers like your friends your families your neighbors and all that so like you start marketing from people around you um like your closest sphere should understand that this is what i do and then they are the ones who like go out and market you external and say oh i have a friend that does this so you possibly might not be able to reach out to someone um let's secrecy i might not be able to reach out to chris's friends but quincy knows me right and he knows i i do the stuff and i do it well enough so quincy can go out and talk to his friends about me and say oh i do this stuff and then that's it they reach out to queen c and queen c connects me today i'm like i've done like huge marketing right there like without having to um do a lot of marketing strategies and all that like i just work with my peers and work with my friends right and another great option you might want to try out is social media like that's a really good place to like market yourself one thing you should note about marketing is people would um love you if they can see what you're doing right so like i'm not just marketing and saying hey i can view this stuff and then that's it no i told you i can do this stuff and this is the stuff i've built right and then i look at it and i'm like wow this is awesome i like it like how can i reach out to you can you do the same stuff for me right so i am marketing with like proof i'm showing them samples of stuff i've done and then through that i can get more um clients and more returns from that so it's very simple start marketing from your peers like your small friends and families and then as much as you're trying to market on social media or other platform try as much as possible to show samples show them stuff you build like live projects and all that and through that you would be able to like get a lot of clients that would be interested in you and even if they would not be interested at that moment like it's more like stored in their catalogue and they're like ah there's this guy i saw like one month ago oh i'm used to this awesome stuff right and i want to reach out to him so like just by doing that alone you're preparing like more clients for yourself so that's it basically awesome and uh one question that we have from chat is uh how do you figure out how much to charge as a freelance developer and uh how do you triangulate prices that clients will actually pay you that's a hard one yeah i mean like i think for me um because i was new to the scene and i hadn't had much experience um i kind of just did it as i'm starting from the bottom i'm just going to charge my time because i'm getting experience people are taking a chance from me and i kind of took it from there really and also with demand so the more demand that came in i kind of adjusted my prices accordingly because you know um so i i kind of like response to market almost but at the start i did kind of offer a i built um my first site for free because i wanted the experience i kind of want to do a real kind of client relationship but not have kind of pressure on myself and then um and then from there i kind of did what i would call the equivalent of minimum wage um and then once i kind of built up my confidence and i thought ah okay and now i can start charging kind of more the rates that i i think equate with my skills so it's just kind of building up from there really and you know it's it's a hard one i mean like it also depends on your clients budget and you kind of don't want to undersell yourself but you also have to sort of if they say we've only got x amount of pounds to do this site you can say i can build this this and this for you and you kind of prioritize what can be built so i would say it just depends on your experience and and just take it from there really the more you build the bigger your reputation becomes you get more kind of clout and then you can probably just start charging a bit more so i kind of adjusted as i went along and that makes that makes sense and that's a really reasonable way to approach it um and how about you luke like how have you negotiated uh price elasticity among your uh your clients um fortunately right now i'm kind of in a phase where my price is my price and i don't don't negotiate it down too much to be frank um now if i wasn't in that situation um i think what phoebe said uh just said hits the nail on the head more than anything when she said uh when the client says here's my budget and you say i can do a b and c um to do i just think that's an import just such an important part of selling something and coming up with the right price if you know if a customer says you know i want items one two and three and and the developer just says here's what it's going to cost and they say that's not what's in my budget that that's kind of the developer saying too bad and then you know the person's obviously not going to buy the services and it's not good for anybody another way to think of that is don't end by telling somebody no right if somebody says i need one two and three and this is my budget and you just say no then that's just the end of the conversation whereas what if you say here's what i can do for you so it's kind of like well um you know i can't build you your own uh you know i can't you know i can't build your own uh video player but i'm happy to embed youtube for you so you can stream it live so in other words end with what you can do for them as opposed to what you can't do for them and then they suddenly feel like they're getting a deal within their limited budget and it helps make the sale helps keeps the price down it just works out better for everybody and a lot of times uh clients may not know what they want and they may but they do know what the problem is so they're the stakeholder they can describe what the problem is and as a freelancer you can interpret that problem into a potential solution and right size it and you know make it like like you just said the cost of creating your own video streaming stool and uh having your own video player and all that stuff may be prohibitive but the cost of embedding youtube may only be you know a day's work uh to be able to have them have a tool where they can update the video and everything right so yeah yeah i think what you just said is actually really really important um i've finished uh two sports related apps for different clients i would so doesn't matter let's call it within the last 30 days and um you know and everybody else on the panel will can talk we'll say this too that you know when we get clients that call us a client will say you know i want whatever it is they want and it's really important to give those clients feedback you can give them possibilities that they didn't know they had in front of them they obviou they'll instantly see how those possibilities can you know help their business and it's also important to give them feedback if they're saying they want certain features or functionality that you know from having done something similar is probably a bad idea it's important to in polite terms explain to them why it's a bad idea why they shouldn't you know spend the money on that and um so on and so forth and that also just really goes a long way towards a getting people to sign up for with you be you know helping them you know get the most for you know like their money and and things of that um you know it's really important as a freelancer to think yourself as a problem solver and it's hard to solve a problem without giving feedback to somebody right um so i just i just think you really just hit the nail on the head that's really important to not just take a call and say someone says to you i want one two and three and you just say okay it's really important to give them that feedback um i just want to add to what luke said um yeah i mean i completely agree about giving the client feedback because a lot of the time they don't know what they want or they don't know how the best way to solve the problem so um and i find that you know some people probably think oh i shouldn't really say that i think i'm being critical but in fact they appreciate the advice because you're you know you you have more experience that you know what you're talking about so um they're like i never thought of it that way so actually giving back feedback is is probably a good thing and you should be honest as well i think that's that's another thing don't just keep on saying yes yes i think that's a great idea i think being honest and they actually do appreciate that so yeah i just wanted to add that to luke's comments awesome uh i have an interesting question for luke uh look if you had to start freelancing today what are the three things you would not do what are the three things i would not do if i had to start that list is probably a lot longer than three things first of all um and it would also include a lot of the mistakes i made early on um if i had to start over today um i would say some of the things um that i would definitely stay away from and this is going to sound counterintuitive to a lot of people i wouldn't focus on trying to get as many sales as possible on day one i would really focus on trying to get that first sale and doing as good a job for that client as i could in other words get that first product in and probably just focus on that until it's out the door because then not only have you been paid for a completed product you've got someone who's a potential referral source now because you've just done a really good job for them um so one thing i think a lot of people a big mistake a lot of people make early on myself included is how do i get my name out there to as many people as possible on day one it's like no no get your name out there to one person who will hire you today you know that's that's probably the first thing i would do the second thing i would definitely avoid and this is going to sound counterintuitive to a lot of people is i would avoid going to a lot of networking events which is another mistake i made early on um you know once when you go to a networking event there are so many hours in a day and that time is gone forever and for the most part it's all they're all a little different but for the most part you're hoping to meet people that will connect you with other people at networking events i think if you're going to go out and try to sell yourself to people like that it's you can just as easily spend that time walking into the local bakery and saying hey you know i notice you don't have online ordering i notice you don't have this let me solve these problems so go out and try to meet your customers one on one as opposed to trying to meet them through other people that was another mistake you know i made early on um and i would say the third mistake um that i probably made early on that i would uh definitely not repeat is and this may sound like i'm on my soapbox but you know definitely learning as much as i can about the business issues from day one getting set up for proper tax structures and things of that nature um because kind of what quincy was saying about compound interest earlier is really true and if you start off with some bad structures in place and by structures i mean how you've structured your business for taxes um how you've set up some of your workflows and those kinds of things if you start off in a bad spot those things are just going to compound as you start getting uh more customers and more and more money bleeds out of your business as a result of it so you know in not necessarily in those orders in that order those are the three things i would really not do is you know and again i think what i did early on is what a lot of people do i thought oh boy i'm in business and i just went plowing out without thinking about how do i structure things for taxes and you know like like things of that nature and at the end of the year i regretted it you know like way back when so wow that's a great list how about you phoebe um i would say yeah i mean it's it's it's different from because i used to work for a company they took care of you know paying me or the taxes and there's quite a steep learning curve when you go selfemployed you know you have to you know you have to do selfassessment in the uk you have to be aware of you know you have to have um insurance to make sure that you know that you don't get if you get sued you're covered you know things like that that you don't necessarily think about because you you haven't had to think about it yet so i think it's like what luke said it's just kind of having that infrastructure in place you know using kind of an online accounting tools um so i started using wave which was an invoicing tool rather than producing them um you know things like that just kind of learn as you go on the job um but it is quite hard i mean i think you have to have to be prepared for that you you know you don't have someone else taking care of that you don't have like a hr department you don't have a finance department you know so it's all you so if you are going to freelancing just just kind of be aware of that and um read up on it make sure you're aware of what's you know you need to do to to um so that you don't get hit by the tax man and you get fined etc so um yeah i mean i think for me i didn't realize how much was involved um and i wish i was better prepared for it at the beginning but you know once i did learn i i made sure that i caught up with it so awesome and uh bolaji what are some things that you made mistakes you made early on that you've uh kind of learned from okay yeah um so the first thing would be understanding that i'm freelancing it's not just about writing code like it's way much more than just writing code like it's it decompasses communication marketing and so much more so like if you focus at the early stage is just writing code you would miss out from so many goodies i've had times where i had to write like serious complex features for the clients but meanwhile they really don't want all that and then at the end i have to like cut down most of these things and i'm like what this is really good like you need this you need and then like i don't need it i know that's right so um the ability to communicate well with your clients it's very very essential because like luke said like most of them don't know what they want and most of when they have ideas of what he wants but like not like the full idea and then when they tell you i want x and then tell them oh you can you can get like an x y z or something like oh this is cool and most time you can tell them um you can get like an x y z and they tell you um i don't really need that that's too complex for me at the moment and then you have to go back and forth i'm trying to communicate with them it's like first of all on the standard it's not just about writing code like it's way much more than that so if you're working for a company you have tax and also you just go just pick a ticket and just work on your tax for freelancing you're trying to build something for someone who is not you it's like you have to put yourself in their position and try to understand what they want and this also leads to like my second um regrets that i would like which i never did is try as much as possible to give feedback to your clients like um let's say weekly okay let's say the deadline for the project is like one month try to give like demos in like maybe four times in a month because like if you wait to the end of the one month you might present the entire day when they're like wow why this why it happened you have to go back and revert so many things like right so you can do weekly demos with them and then the first week you look at it and tell you what um i change this and change that and you can easily revise because it's not going so far but like imagine you've gone like one month into the project you have to go back to like three weeks ago like that's really really stressful so the ability to give feedbacks to your clients like um weekly or like three days it's very very important and i think the last one for me would be to automate stuff like i made i always tell people like as much as we are developers like we have so much to do like there's so much to do you have to install this installed and like the tooling we use is quite much more than the code we actually write so like one thing we should try to do is um automate stuff and that's one mistake i never did so like the time i spent trying to do some basic stuff if i had automated them i wouldn't have to spend that time doing those things so like you can use aliases and and so much more like try to automate some of your toolings and workflows so it makes um it gives you much more time to like do more works like that's it awesome that's an excellent answer all three of you have a lot of wisdom on this topic um i want to talk a little bit about the experience of trying to because a lot of people ask like oh i'm in india specifically trying to find freelance opportunities and i realize that's probably very different from the us in terms of like we have completely different types of businesses here in the us and lots of different opportunities are there any is let me just say is there any advice that you think specific to people in your country or your region uh might be really helpful for uh finding freelance customers uh and because i i'll just say that like a lot of people a lot of times i'll give people freelancing advice i'll be like oh well why don't you try talking to this and this and they'll be like well it's a little bit different in india we don't have that like uh i i realize this is a really really vague question but i'm just curious if there's some insight that i as as an american uh am missing out on that in the more global freelancing field might be like super actionable i think um it's something i mean i don't know if it's specific to the uk but i found um that kind of um approaching people face to face i mean i know we can't do that now but during the pandemic but just kind of all picking up the phone um that really helped kind of having that kind of onetoone relationship um and i noticed that when um you know particular clients they kind of wanted you more local so uh they didn't want someone who was abroad they wanted someone local that they can sort of go to it's kind of like even though you can work remote they kind of wanted that safety net like you know we want to be able to you know call you or you can come to us and you know you can talk it out so it's kind of um i don't know if that's specific to the uk but i found that with clients they kind of it does help kind of being in that local area and having the option to to kind of get in touch with you when they can on their time zone and um or in person or on the phone it's just that kind of availability thing i don't know if it's if it's kind of a specific uk thing yeah and i find that too that of the new customers i get who aren't you know existing i mean i get them from all over but i do get a surprising number just from people that are looking for somebody in their local market the one thing i'll say wherever anybody is is yeah it try to approach people from a problemsolving standpoint i know i keep saying this over and over and i i don't mean to sound like a broken record um but like right now you know like here in the united states and here in dayton i think just about everywhere in the united states uh most restaurants for just as an example most restaurants can only do you know like carry out so instead of you know if you're gonna call let's say you're gonna cold call people instead of cold calling you know just random businesses you know the restaurants have a problem that needs solved you know they need people to be able to order food online and schedule a time to pick it up and things like that so instead of saying i'm gonna instead of taking the approach of i'm gonna look for work and i'm just gonna call every business in my neighborhood you know like let's say or something of the sort what i would say is identify a class of customers and under the example i just gave restaurants and you know then say here's a class of customers what problem are they having specifically right now especially right now with everything going on and when you call them you know you're not going to have to tell them they have a problem they know they have a problem and you know i think a lot of people would be surprised at how often they are pleased to be getting a call from somebody you know is reaching out with a problemsolving standpoint you've got an issue let me fix it for you and so i think whatever market you're in whether it's a state somewhere in the u.s whether it's a another country like india whether it's a place like the uk or just pick a place try to identify what kind of problems people in that market are having and present yourself as someone that's solving them and i really do think that's the biggest answer to the question and one of the things that you touched on there is because we're all trapped in our homes uh due to the pandemic and and doing the responsible thing in social distancing and in virtually every country i think in some places like south korea they've got the testing so on lockdown that they are able to release the lockdown that was really bad sorry um but what i wanted to ask is what are some strategies because you know there's of course email there's calling but what are some some ways that generally seem to work for contacting people virtually when you can't just walk into a bakery and and say like hey i've been using your bakery like buy something and then like use that as like a reciprocation technique or something like that by the way i can build this for you you know when you can't actually talk to people face to face and you have to rely on email communication or other modalities what are some tips are there any specific platforms that you found really helpful for finding clients anything like that i mean honestly i my first suggestion would be to just call people on the phone and and if you call and leave someone a voicemail or a message on their machine and you know say you're calling a local business and they don't call you back don't be shy about calling say over the course of a week or two don't be shy about calling two or three times now after a while if they don't call you back then obviously you stop calling them but don't be shy about you know call you know calling two or three times um getting someone on the phone is just a lot more personal than you know an email or something of the sort um so a i would say get people on the phone but also as soon as you get people on the phone you know uh pres i would say present it from their perspective um you know like let's say uh uh like i just built an app for a laundromat in my local area and uh what's a dry cleaning establishment and just because of the situation he doesn't want people coming up to the window you know he wants people you know scheduling stuff and so when i call him and uh talked to him about i know you you know you um i know you're preferring to just do scheduling like etc etc and i said let's build something so people can just schedule online with you okay um so for example if you're calling a restaurant you know presented as i would like to help your customers be able to order food from your restaurant online you know not i want to hire i want you to hire me to do something though presented as here's what i want to do to help you improve your business here's what i want to do to help your customers and i think that's just a in just my personal opinion i think that's a way better way to approach somebody versus um hi i'm a web developer um i'd like to talk about building something for you which says pay me some money whereas let me help your customers says let me help you make more money yeah and i guess you can always pitch it as like look you're gonna make a whole lot more money the money that you're ending up paying me will just be a drop in the bucket compared to the additional business you get uh so so like the benefit to them is going to completely offset any cost to them and and ideally there won't be any risk either right so um how about you phoebe do you have any tips for uh how you in the past to have you how did you find your clients and how that would be different today when we're all under lockdown um yeah i mean it's a hard one because um i did kind of rely more on the facetoface and i think i built a lot of kind of clients through that medium but um you know i guess you can just transfer that to more kind of video conferencing um i mean like it's strange for the younger generation i find that they kind of prefer to be messaged you know kind of like whatsapp and things like that initially um so i i mean i would move it more to kind of having regular meetings but instead of facetoface having the video conferencing using google meet or something like that um but yeah i mean like it's it's kind of in a way it's it's no different um you know you're just using a tool to talk to them but um i think uh if you are going to approach clients like what luke said i think it's you have to approach it the right way you you want to become across as the problem solver and i find that if you do your research on the business it really helps so then it looks like you've put the effort in so you know i always look at it to see if they've got an existing website how can i improve it and then you've kind of you know and usually they kind of appreciate that so kind of not just cold calling said hey i'm a web developer what do you need built you kind of say i've looked into your website i think you can improve this you can improve you know you look at the analytic you know the um you can look at the speed of the website if you can look at you know the accessibility you can go into uh the chrome dev tools and have a look um through lighthouse and you can sort of you know you can do things like that and then approach them so um but yeah i think it's just kind of getting your foot in the door um you know getting them to respond to you and you can and i would say be persistent email you know phone calls you know and and yeah and i say utilize your network as well awesome and balaji how have you found your freelance clients in the past and how would that be different now uh in light of the pandemic okay um so for me i i never really went out to look for clients at the early stages i much more got more referrals than me looking at clients and i never used emails because like emails doesn't work for me i only use emails when i have to like maybe um communicate like send files and all that like i think to go more personal with my clients like check them out and then we have video calls more often than normal and then we have phone calls because that way i can communicate more with them and understand their needs right so i do that a lot i call them and then we chat and then you get to understand okay this is what you want and um just what you need right and that's worked very very effectively for me and like one other thing i would say is trying to build up like your um your portfolio like your your appreciation because at the early stage um no clients will come up to you if they don't see something good enough you've done yeah it's like that's really strange like it's really rare for you to find out like while you're starting out you need to build more stuff because like you get more clients when they see you done more stuff because most often clients would reach out to you either from seeing um your work from somewhere else and then like reach out and like i want the same thing right so try as much as possible to like build up your portfolio like allow your clients to see one or two or three projects you've done that are really sexual and that way you can easily um communicate with them like it's not like saying i do this for this person and this is these are the results from um what i did and then here's what i can do for you also like i'm fully said like um reaching out to them by telling them you want to improve something from their already existing products is an effective way to like get them to use you i know i've reached out some clients and i'm like oh i checked out your website and then it's not really accessible and they're like what's accessibility like i now have an opportunity like to explain to them what it really means and then tell them why they're losing out and why they're losing some clients and then i tell them your images are so large or like your your website is not optimized and they're like what's all that and then i i break it down to them and let them understand why they need to optimize stuff and why their website needs to be accessible right so them understanding those concepts they're not like oh wow like i really didn't think about this right so they now have to like um go to the resources i sent to them when they say okay okay um i'm really interested in this and then how do we go about it it's like i've done two things now i educated them on why they should solve this problem and then i can now come in and say oh now i'm here to solve the problem for you so it's much more than just um using a product for them like it goes beyond just trying to understand the problem that comes from the existing project like luke said also when you understand um what problem they have already based on their existing project you can reach out to them and explain how they can improve it based on your own experience oh no go ahead luke can i add just one thing to all that i mean sure i completely agree if every in this more just of an ad to what everybody just said but the one thing i and to get back to it is in terms of getting business focus on your existing customers first and a lot of people may sound feel like oh i've only got this one customer i've got to go out and get some more and just to give a personal example call it 18 months ago i built an app for a realtor when she was out showing houses to her customers one of her customers uh like the user experience on that and he needed something she referred him to me i built something for him he has since referred me to more people so again that all came from that one project i got for the realtor so it's as crucial as it is to get new business and to how you sell yourself to people the best way to sell yourself to people is by doing a really good job for the people you're already working for that's just the most important part yeah i agree with that yeah i agree and that's an excellent takeaway to end our conference on everybody you heard that right from luke the best way to get new business is to focus on your existing customers dazzle them they will send more business your way definitely resonates with what i've heard and both phoebe and bolaji just agreed with that so uh i want to first of all i just want to thank uh phoebe luke bolaji thank you so much for being on this panel uh your cumulative decades of freelancing experience are extremely helpful and we've learned so much from your insights so
