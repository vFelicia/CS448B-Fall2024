welcome to this exploration in the ethics as it relates to artificial intelligence and machine learning as AI becomes more and more useful it becomes imperative for us to understand not only its technicalities but the profound ethical Dimensions surrounding it should AI have rights similar to human beings is there an inherent bias in the algorithms that control AI systems these questions and many more will be addressed in this course from Seth golden Seth will talk to you about the societal economic and philosophical aspects of AI Seth is a software engineer and data scientist and in this course he also is joined by a few important guest speakers hey everyone welcome to the ethics of AI and ml my name is Seth golden and I'm excited to be your guide through an overview of AI ethics and machine learning should AI systems have personhood is AI biased as AI permeates every facet of Our Lives from health care and education to finance and entertainment the significance of AI ethics becomes ever more Paramount the potential consequences of neglecting these ethical considerations can range from Mere inconveniences to severe societal ramifications our journey together will uncover the foundations of artificial intelligence its applications and the ethical questions that shape this transformative field along the way we're incredibly lucky to be also joined by a few guest speakers including okezway Bell from an organization mobilizing over 1400 people for Tech issues the development policy and education and sneha ravenar from encode Justice a youthpowered movement for humancentered artificial intelligence and of course a huge thank you to free code camp for supporting the development of this course let's begin in this video course we'll Define ai and its various types in delve into techniques subfields ethics and real world applications we'll examine not just the tech itself but also its implications on society economy and Global development this is not a technical course there's plenty of amazing incredible AI programming content on free code Camp if that's what you're looking for instead we're going to focus on how AI is currently being used how it might be used and how we can ensure that it's employed in a way that benefits Humanity as this course presupposes no prior knowledge of AI or ml we're going to define a bunch of terms and Concepts like Ai and ml if you're already really comfortable with topics like neural networks or natural language processing you can feel free to skip part two the basics of the AI and ml so what are you going to get out of this video our journey is more than just talking about technology it's a holistic broader view by the end of our time together you'll have a groundnut in the basics of AI from the algorithms that power it to the applications that make it so revolutionary we won't stop at just understanding the mechanics it's about ethics values in the real world implications that make AI not only a scientific Marvel but a philosophical moral and societal challenge hi everyone my name is okazley Bell and I'm a student at Stanford and the founder of fitter Tom one of the world's largest Civil Society groups working on the many limbs of building and regulating responsible technology especially AI I'll be speaking on a couple of topics in this course with arguably the most important question to start off with what is AI a common misconception is that the term AI is typically confined to high functioning systems like chat GPT for example but in reality it can be as simple as a preprogrammed chat bot as complex as Google or tick tock's content recommendation algorithms or as consequential as disease or Grime risk prediction systems while the connotation of AI varies across Academia and Industry it typically refers to systems that use math to provide Automotive generative or predictive outputs or functions so AI at its highest level is about crafting algorithms that allow machines to perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence this includes learning from data reasoning logically solving problems perceiving the environment and even understanding human languages ai's applications are not confined to a single domain they stretch across various Fields both in general spheres and within the nuanced Arena of International Development ai's ability to analyze massive data sets enables more informed decisions in government policy but also in very different spaces such as finance and climate attack it's transforming Health Care as well ranging from enhancing diagnosis to personalizing treatment especially providing vital support in underresourced areas artificial intelligence is reshaping the educational landscape through personalized learning adaptive content and making elearning accessible even in remote regions and its influence on recruiting and employment follows a similar Trend redefining practices through tailored Solutions and technological innovation even agriculture is witnessing an AI driven Revolution were optimizing farming techniques for higher yields and supporting smallscale Farmers with AI driven insights are just the beginning of what's possible in the second half of this course we'll delve deeper into some of these areas while this course offers a comprehensive overview I have consciously chosen to keep it open to all ages apolitical and nonus Centric so some applications of AI such as those in elections and voting or the creation of adult content won't be discussed in detail if you find these topics intriguing links to resources for further exploration will be provided in the description of this video so the big question why should you care why watch the rest of this video course to start unethical AI practices have the potential to result in widespread discrimination AI systems are only as unbiased as the data that they are trained on if these systems are trained on unrepresented data they can unintentionally perpetuate and amplify existing societal biases this can lead to discriminatory outcomes in vital areas such as employment lending and many more potentially disadvantageous to certain groups based on factors like race gender or socioeconomic status trying to solve a problem or end a pattern of humandriven discrimination using artificial intelligence often backfires because algorithms are designed to imitate human behavior not deviate from it alignment in the context of AI refers to the Endeavor to ensure that AI system objectives actions and outcomes are in harmony with human values and goals misaligned AI systems pose a significant risk because their objectives may not coincide with ours leading to unintended and potentially harmful outcomes consider for instance a hypothetical super intelligent AI whose primary objective is to optimize paperclip production if not properly aligned such an artificial intelligence could consume all available resources including vital ones necessary for human survival to achieve its goal of Maximum paper clip production effectively leading to a catastrophic scenario for Humanity this extreme example often referred to as the paperclip maximizer thought experiment underlines the potential severity of AI misalignment what that means is that it is incumbent upon us to ensure the development of AI systems aligns with human values and interests and rigorous ethical scrutiny is applied to prevent any worst case scenario from becoming a reality if developed and deployed ethically AI systems can serve as powerful tools for societal good they can promote fairness by making unbiased decisions they can enhance commercial accountability by ensuring transparency and Foster inclusivity by providing personalized solutions to diverse populations from assisting doctors in diagnosing diseases to helping Educators provide personalized learning experiences ethical AI has the potential to improve countless lives and create a more Equitable Society and yet the importance of AI ethics extends Beyond immediate outcomes AI is poised to be a defining technology of our future with the potential to reshape our social fabric economy and Global Order as developers users policy makers and most importantly as humans we are all stakeholders in this future and so it's our shared responsibility to ensure that AI Technologies are developed and used in ways that align with our ethical values and mitigate harm understanding AI ethics is not just about preventing negative outcomes but rather actively working towards a future where AI serves as a tool for human flourishing so the study of AI ethics encouraged us to not just ask what can we do with AI but what should we do it pushes us to consider how we can harness ai's immense potential responsibly in a way that respects our shared human values promotes those Equitable outcomes and contributes to a better future for all of us AI ethics therefore is not just important it's essential are you excited yet we're just getting started next we're going to explore the basics of AI and ml now we are going beyond the surface to explore AI types and techniques including machine learning or ml in particular we'll demystify how algorithms can learn from data explore the architecture behind neural networks and look at how different algorithms serve different purposes in the world of artificial intelligence we commonly speak of three main types of AI the first is narrow or weak AI such as Siri or Alexa designed to perform specific tasks though quite skilled in their specific areas these systems can't go beyond their defined scope moving up the ladder we find General AI or strong AI a theoretical concept of machines with the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human can it's an ambitious goal that we are still striving to achieve although recent models such as Google scata are getting closer finally there's the concept of super intelligent AI which would surpass human intelligence entirely having the ability to learn and understand any task it's a thrilling and futuristic idea but it also brings up deep ethical and philosophical questions most AI researchers believe we're still a ways away from anything resembling super intelligent AI but as we'll discuss more later once you hit that point things begin moving pretty quickly together we'll explore each of these types of AI in Greater detail throughout the rest of this video in the realm of artificial intelligence several techniques enable machines to emulate humanlike intelligence first we have machine learning or ml which is a core technique allowing systems to learn from experience and improve over time unlike traditional programming where instructions are explicitly given ml enables systems to adapt and evolve by themselves as you can see in the diagram the core differences in the inputs and the outputs with the normal program you write the program and give it input and it runs to create the output with ML you give a model input and what you want the output to look like and then it figures out what the program should look like to obtain that here's some examples email filtering machine learning algorithms analyze thousands of emails learning the common characteristics of spam such as certain phrases patterns or sender profiles the model iteratively refines its understanding becoming a virtual expert in spam detection so you know that's why Gmail is so good movie recommendations services like Netflix use ml to analyze your viewing history ratings and behavior to predict what you might like to watch next the model considers various factors like genres directors actors and even the time you usually watch to offer personalized recommendations the more you interact the more tailored those recommendations become these examples showcase the adaptability of machine learning learning from patterns and providing actionable insights or automation as technology evolves we can expect to see even more applications that Leverage The predictive power of machine learning next there's deep learning an advanced approach inspired by the human brain's complex neural networks unlike traditional machine learning which can work with simpler algorithms deep learning involves multiple layers of interconnected nodes that process information in a hierarchical manner this allows deep learning models to automatically extract features and handle more complex tasks deep learning has paved the way for advancements in areas like facial recognition and natural language processing there's some examples of deep learning facial recognition deep learning algorithms particularly convolutional neural networks or cnns which we'll talk more about later have revolutionized facial recognition technology by analyzing thousands of facial features and patterns these models can identify and verify individuals with high accuracy another popular one to talk about autonomous driving deep learning plays a crucial role in enabling selfdriving cars to navigate and make decisions by processing vast amounts of data from cameras sensors and radar deep neural networks can recognize objects pedestrians and other vehicles can understand traffic signs and make realtime driving decisions finally we have natural language process anger NLP which serves as a bridge between human communication and machine understanding while traditional machine learning may require manual feature extraction for text Data NLP uses both statistical and deep learning techniques to automatically interpret respond to and even generate human languages this enables a more nuanced understanding of language including syntax semantics and context as we continue we'll delve into specific examples in each of these techniques to provide a concrete understanding of how they function and their significant roles in our technology driven world two examples of natural language processing would be chat Bots or virtual assistants natural language processing enables chat Bots and assistance like Siri or Alexa to understand and respond to human language by analyzing syntax semantics and contacts these systems can engage in conversation answer questions and perform tasks based on Voice or text commands sentiment analysis is another one businesses often use natural language processing to analyze customer feedback reviews and social media comments to gauge public sentiment about products or services by understanding the nuances of language including tone and emotion and sarcasm natural language processing algorithms can provide insights into customer satisfaction and preferences within the diverse and expansive realm of AI there are also many even more specialized subareas each contributing uniquely to that field generative AI is one such area that has recently captured the imagination of millions of people from the conversational prowess of Chachi PT to the mathematical assistance of photomath NLP is enabling machines to understand interpret and generate human languages the subfield enhances the way that we interact with technology making it more intuitive responsive and humanlike computer vision is another fascinating subfield dedicated to teaching computers to perceive and interpret the visual world it's the driving force behind Crown baking Innovations like selfdropping cars and facial recognition systems another field near and dear to my heart is robotics a field that merges AI with mechanical design revolutionizing industries from Healthcare to Manufacturing neural networks inspired by our brains architecture are at the center of many AI applications on a simplistic high level a neural network is like a virtual brain that helps computers learn from data imagine you're teaching it to recognize a cat you show it many pictures some of cats and some of other things the network makes guesses and you correct it the brain has layers of neurons that work together the first layer looks at basic things like lines and colors the next layers combine these Basics to recognize shapes like ears and Tails and the final layer puts it all together to say this is a cut over time with more pictures and Corrections the network gets better at recognizing cats it's like learning to ride a bike you get better with practice now for a more technical breakdown neural networks consist of interconnected layers of nodes or neurons each neuron receives an input processes it using a mathematical function and passes the output to the next layer here's what that looks like first the Network's input layer receives the raw data such as pixel values of an image each neuron corresponds to one feature like a pixels color intensity then there are hidden layers which contain neurons that perform computations each neuron's input is a weighted sum of the previous layer's outputs plus a bias term the weights and biases are the parameters that the network learns through training the weighted sum is then passed through an activation function like sigmoid this introduces nonlinearity allowing the network to learn complex patterns finally the output layer produces the final prediction for classification tasks a softmax function might be used to convert the final layer's outputs into probabilities networks are trained using a data set by repeatedly making predictions and comparing them to the true labels the differences between the predictions and the True Values are measured using a loss function the weights and biases are then updated using an optimization algorithm like gradient descent this process iteratively adjusts the parameters to minimize the loss in proving the Network's predictions the key to understanding the training of neural networks is an algorithm called back propagation it calculates the gradients of the loss function with respect to each weight and bias by applying the chain rule remember that from calculus these gradients are used to update the parameters in the direction that reduces the loss in other words a neural network learns to make predictions by adjusting its internal parameters based on the feedback it receives it's a highly iterative and computational process that enables a network to learn complex mappings from inputs to outputs okay cool but what can you actually do with them burst handwriting systems like those used by postal services to read addresses utilize neural networks to translate complex handwriting into standardized text they analyze individual Strokes curves and spacing learning to recognize various handwriting styles another one voice command recognition smart devices like Siri use neural networks to understand that spoken language these networks analyze the sound waves breaking them down into components that represent different aspects of speech like tone pitch and accent and yet another one fraud detection networks analyze spending patterns geographical locations in time to detect suspicious activity if an unexpected pattern emerges it might flag a transaction for review now let's look at a few different kinds of Networks recurrent neural networks or rnns are designed for sequential data making them suitable for applications like weather forecasting and realtime language translation unlike traditional neural networks rnns have connections that loop back on themselves allowing information to persist this looping mechanism enables them to remember previous inputs in the sequence thereby understanding the context and making informed predictions about future data for example in language translation rnns can learn the syntax grammar and context of a sentence providing more accurate translations convolutional neural networks or cnns are tailored for visual tasks and are widely used in medical Diagnostics and autonomous vehicles cnns utilize convolutional layers that apply filters to the input data detecting local patterns such as edges and textures these detected features are then pooled and passed through fully connected layers to make final predictions and medical Diagnostics cnns can detect tumors and xrays or MRI scans by recognizing subtle patterns that might be missed by human eyes and autonomous vehicles they interpret the visual World allowing the car to navigate its environment generative adversarial networks organs consist of two competing networks a generator and a discriminator the generator creates content such as images while the discriminator evaluates the generated content against Real data they are trained together in a cat and mouse game where the generator tries to produce realistic content and the discriminator tries to distinguish between the real content and the generated content in the world of art Gans have created entirely New pieces by learning from historical art styles in gaming they generate realistic Landscapes and characters Transformers such as the generative pretrained Transformer or GPT models are significant advancement in neural networks particularly for NLP unlike rnns Transformers use attention mechanisms that weigh the importance of different parts of the input allowing them to capture longrange dependencies in data this enables them to understand the context of words in a sentence even if they are far apart GPT models have been employed in various applications from writing assistance to complex question answering systems showcasing the power of neural networks and understanding and emulating human language there are dozens of other networks including many other extremely popular ones but the networks we've discussed adequately showcase the breadth of ai's capabilities from creative Endeavors to lifesaving Medical applications data sets are the lifeblood of machine learning providing the raw material for that learning let's explore two different types let's start with images for facial recognition a data set might include thousands of faces each tag with an identity the system learns to identify unique visual features and expressions another example would be sentiment analysis where text models like product reviews or social media posts are analyzed to gauge public sentiment these data sets can help in understanding the nuances of human language and emotion the quality and integrity of a data set are really important biased or unbalanced data can lead to flawed models raising critical ethical considerations which we'll discuss way more later as one example tick this image of a data set of puppies and chicken tenders the meme illustrates how challenging it can be for an AI model such as a convolutional neural network to differentiate between objects that have similar visual characteristics while humans can usually tell the difference based on context and experience AI models might struggle it also underscores the importance of diverse and representative training data if a model has not been exposed to enough variations of puppies and chicken tenders it may not have learned the subtle features that distinguish them it also points to the complexity of future extraction in image recognition identifying the essential characteristics that differentiate a puppy from a chicken tender is a nontrivial task sometimes the process of learning features can be problematic especially with deep learning algorithms since these systems determine and distinguish features independently without any explicit programming they sometimes discover incorrect yet true patterns in data let me give you an example a neural network trained to identify malignant skin lesions observed that many medical images of cancerous lesions included a ruler for scale instead of learning the nuanced differences between benign and malignant lesions in terms of their medical features it trained itself to look for the presence of a ruler given the trends in the training images so it mistakenly learned to associate the presence of a ruler in an image with the likelihood of the lesion being malignant as a result the AI performed super well in the training data but when presented with real world tumor images that didn't adhere to this ruler coincidence as you could expect it failed miserably not only is having broad training data important to building safe and effective AI but so is being able to track its decisionmaking processes doing so enables the AI to learn General more accurate features and also helps developers explain and fix pain points or causes of error AI is groundbreaking but not without its limitations there are several challenges that we've yet to overcome for large language models to reach their full potential speed is one of those gigantic models powerful but they're also slow faster response times will be necessary as we aim to apply these Technologies in more production settings another one would be bias large language models are trained on data from the internet unfortunately that includes a lot of content warped by our human subjectivity leading to lom's returning results that reflect a lack of diversity as well as being capable of generating extremist content even software developers with the best intentions will unconsciously make choices that cause AI to portray similar World Views outside of large language models one of the most eyeopening studies that brought this issue to the Forefront was conducted by propublica a nonprofit investigative journalism organization they looked into an algorithm used in the U.S criminal justice system to predict which individuals are likely to commit crimes again a concept known as recidivism the propublica study revealed that this recidivism predicting algorithm had a troubling bias against African Americans in simple terms the algorithm was more likely to wrongly predict that AfricanAmerican individuals would commit future crimes compared to White individuals on the flip side it was also more likely to incorrectly assume that white individuals were at low risk of reoffending these inaccuracies are not just numbers they have real world consequences such as unfavorably extended prison sentences or denied opportunities for parole this study serves as a wakeup call about the ethical challenges in AI it emphasizes the need for fairness transparency and accountability when we use algorithms to make important decisions especially in sensitive areas like criminal justice the findings from propublica have ignited debates and calls for Action to rigorously evaluate an audit AI algorithms ensuring they don't perpetuate existing societal biases it's a stark reminder that as we move forward with technological advancements we must also be vigilant in safeguarding ethical standards another limitation is hallucinations when given a prompt it doesn't understand generative AI will often respond absurdively with content that is certified bull shark importantly it's difficult to check the validity of such text it's a critical issue for large language models that makes it very difficult to use them for fact checking and essay writing another one plagiarism because the most notable loms are trained on billions of parameters they have plenty of examples to draw from while many of the generated responses are legitimately original there are also some that can be found verbatim on the web this makes large language models problematic when used in academic settings we must construct improved mechanisms for detecting and handling and plagiarism undesirable content is a huge limitation for most of the web's history the majority of content has been limited to what a human could author large language models remove that restriction disinformation is the deliberate spreading of false or misleading information often with the intent to deceive or manipulate public opinion the capabilities of llms to generate text that is indistinguishable from that written by humans have made them a powerful tool for propagating disinformation for example these models can be used to create fake news articles sometimes called read fakes false narratives or misleading social media posts at a scale and speed that were previously unimaginable the danger here is not just the volume of false information but also its potential to be a highly targeted and convincing thereby sowing Discord undermining trusts and institutions and even influencing things as important as elections we're entering an era in which our enemies can make it look like anyone is saying anything at any point in time even if they would never say those things so for instance they could have me say things like I don't know killmonger was right deep fix take disinformation to another level by using deep learning algorithms to create hyperrealistic videos where people appear to say or do things that they never actually did these manipulated videos can be incredibly convincing making it difficult for the average viewer to distinguish between what is real and what is fabricated deep fakes have been used for various malicious purposes from character assassination and fake news dissemination to fraud and blackmail the technology poses a significant threat to personal privacy and public trust as it can be used to create entirely false narratives that are almost impossible to debunk in a timely manner both disinformation and deep fix represent a dark side of artificial intelligence and machine learning Technologies they underscore the urgent need for ethical guidelines robust verification tools and public awareness to combat these emerging threats as these Technologies continue to evolve the challenge will be to balance the incredible potential for Innovation and positive impact against the risks of misuse and harm s you need a centerpiece 20 reps the table called from ebony cut that over into skinny pieces let you clean it with a face you talking money need a hearing aid you talking about me I don't see a shade switch on my side like to get any Lane I switch in my car if I keep anything when someone uses AI to write an article or create a painting or sing a song who does it belong to can the person who generated at claim ownership there's a lot of new legal questions that have yet to be answered by our aging laws for example if I train a model on your paintings and then it makes more that look similar do I need to compensate you for that or if I use samples of Taylor Swift's music to generate more pop or country do I owe her a songwriting credit my current View shared by an awesome Professor who specializes in copyright is that as of now ai generated images will be considered derivative works of whatever they were trained on another limitation or thing to think about is alignment our large language models aligned with human values and following human intent we'll need to continue training AI systems using human feedback to ensure that the systems we're building bring about more positive than negative consequences I'm going to discuss alignment further in a bit the Black Box problem refers to the challenge of understanding complex ml models imagine a model predicting credit worthiness where the input is the applicant's financial history and employment status and the output is a recommendation to approve or deny the loan do you see the black box the mathematical computations between input and output are hidden often involving hundreds of variables and nonlinear transformations this opacity can create ethical and practical challenges in healthcare if a model predicts a disease doctors need to know why to provide proper care in legal settings transparency is usually required for fairness the Black Box problem represents the two core issues that AI systems have if you take only a few things away from this course let this be one of them we do not understand why AI makes the decisions that it does and once AI makes a decision we do not know if that decision was the best one the issue is it's a feedback loop we're not going to talk about predictive policing much in this course but one relevant application is when a police department might use AI to determine where to send their patrol cars an AI model might determine that there are hot spots in three neighborhoods so the cops are sent to those three places they find crime they report back there was crime success right except they didn't go to the other places so they won't know whether or not they would have found crime going elsewhere AI is always right if you don't ever check if it's wrong see why it's difficult to verify results here's another example a school system might use AI to determine which teachers to hire or fire let's say it decides to fire one teacher since the algorithm is a black box the teacher can't appeal to the system and because the teacher was fired we'll never know if their students would have performed better than next year there may have been confounding variables the AI didn't consider we've discussed at length how AI works and now with the black box problem we're starting to explore the ethical implications bit but first let's actually go over some ethical and decision Frameworks that we can then apply to artificial intelligence ethical Frameworks serve as guiding compasses in the complex landscape of morality and ethics they're not just theoretical constructs but deeply ingrained in our culture legal systems and individual beliefs these Frameworks help us navigate moral dilemmas providing tools to identify analyze and resolve ethical issues in the context of AI they become instrumental in guiding design development and deployment ensuring that technology aligns with our societal values and principles consequentialism focuses on the outcomes or Consequences of actions assessing them as right or wrong based on their effect a common form utilitarianism argues for maximizing happiness or welfare across Society in the AI context a consequentialist approach might prioritize systems that optimize efficiency accessibility or overall societal wellbeing even if that means compromising on individual privacy or autonomy think of algorithms that predict health risks they might save lives but raise questions about personal data usage the trolley problem is a thought experiment highlighting these moral dilemmas imagine a runaway trolley you control the switch that can divert it onto one of two tracks one has five people the other has one what do you do this problem becomes more intricate in AI like in selfdriving cars if an accident is imminent how should the car react save the passengers or the pedestrians different ethical Frameworks may lead to different decisions the trolley problem exemplifies the real world ethical challenges that AI developers face deontological ethics yay Kant focuses on the intrinsic morality of actions not their results a deontological perspective might view lying is always wrong even if it leads to a good outcome in AI this approach could manifest in absolute rules around data privacy or nondiscrimination for example an algorithm must never use race as a factor in a decision even if statistically it could improve accuracy this rigid rulebased approach has strengths and creating clear guidelines but might lack flexibility in more complex realworld scenarios virtue ethics emphasizes character traits and virtues that lead to good moral Behavior it's about becoming a good person not just following rules or achieving good outcomes in AI this could translate into Building Systems that encourage positive human values like empathy creativity or collaboration imagine a virtual tutor that not only teaches mathematics but also encourages curiosity and resilience in students virtue ethics brings a humancentered approach aligning technology with our aspirations with personal growth and societal Harmony contract based ethics use morality as a set of rules or agreements made by rational individuals in political philosophy social contract theory has been influential in AI this might translate into transparent agreements between AI providers and users about data handling algorithmic bias or accountability the recent calls for regulation and standardization and AI can be seen as attempts to formalize these contracts ensuring that the technology serves the public interest while respecting individual rights applying these ethical Frameworks to AI is a multifaceted task involving developers regulators and users by using consequentialist ethics we might evaluate an AI system's deployment based on the happiness or efficiency it generates deontological principles might demand strict adherence to privacy Norms virtue ethics could push us to create technology that uplifts human dignity and contractbased ethics could seek to formalize relationships between different stakeholders the ethical design of AI is not just about avoiding harm but about crafting technology that embodies our highest values and aspirations as we discussed briefly before AI alignment represents the critical challenge of ensuring that AI systems understand and align with human values and intentions it's a multifaceted issue with various methods to address each catering to different contacts and ethical considerations the value alignment approach seeks to program AI directly with human ethics acting according to clearly defined values meanwhile inverse reinforcement learning takes a more observational stance where AI learns human preferences by watching human behavior interpretable AI emphasizes the importance of creating models that can be understood and interpreted by humans allowing for increased scrutiny and control in other words not a black box other methodologies Encompass broader strategies topdown approaches involve incorporating human values directly into ai's design utilizing expert knowledge and moral philosophy where on the other hand bottomup approaches allow AI to learn from data including human reactions and decisions to model human values effectively hybrid approach combines these strategies utilizing human crafted rules in datadriven learning to create adaptable guidance systems lastly the collaborative approaches encourage continuous human AI collaboration and oversight this method implements systems allowing ongoing human intervention and adjustment recognizing that human values may evolve and Alignment must be continuously maintained the choice of approach will depend on the specific application and societal context reflecting the complex and vital nature of this aspect of AI development next we'll dive into the Turing test an idea so profound it has fundamentally shaped our understanding of artificial intelligence there's a reason computers are also known as Turing machines picture this you're in a conversation with two unseen participants one human and the other a machine Alan Turing asks whether it's possible for you to determine which is which purely based on their responses this is not an intellectual game it's a quest to define the very nature of thought and understanding if a machine can respond like a human is it thinking does it possess Consciousness or intellect what does this tell us about ourselves and the nature of intelligence imagine you were the evaluator what questions would you ask what answers would convince you this isn't just about technology it's about redefining what it means to be sentient let's try it consider the following questions first how do you feel when you see a beautiful sunset second how do you feel after running a marathon and third explain the concept of love here's three responses when I see a beautiful sunset I feel peaceful it's like time stops and worries disappear the color blue reminds me of the clear sky on a sunny day or the calm waves at the beach love is kindness affection and strong attraction it's about understanding acceptance and being willing to put others needs before you're on which of these was written by a human and which was written by an AI such as Chachi PT any ideas the answer is they're all AI generated with gpt4 did you get that right could you tell the difference between a human and a machine if you didn't does that mean there's no difference does it matter these are just some of the questions that Turing asks us next up the Chinese room a thought experiment somewhat rebutting the Turing test imagine yourself inside a room filled with Chinese symbols and a rule book for manipulating them someone outside the room hands you messages in Chinese under the door and using the rule book or dictionary you respond creating the illusion that you understand the language but inside the room you have no understanding of Chinese whatsoever you're just using a dictionary the Chinese room challenges us to consider the difference between simulating understanding and genuine comprehension what does it mean to troopy know something can a machine ever understand or would only ever simulate understanding how do we distinguish between the appearance of intelligence and genuine consciousness these questions lead us down paths that question the very fabric of our thoughts and perceptions have you ever known everything about something without experiencing it that's the question at the heart of the black and white room experiment also known as Mary's room imagine a scientist her name is Mary who knows every physical fact about color but has never seen color herself she lives in a black and white room and learns everything through black and white resources like photographs or books and upon leaving the room and experiencing color for the first time does she learn anything new this thought experiment delves into the nature of understanding challenging our concepts of objective knowledge and subjective experience the implications of this thought experiment are farreaching can objective knowledge capture subjective experience what does this mean for AI which can possess all factual knowledge but lacks all personal experience how do we reconcile these ideas in our own lives consider deep blue and alphago the famous chess and go AI models respectively they can be seen as real world examples of the black and white room experiment these models have been trained to play chess and go at levels surpassing human Grand Masters but do they truly know the games deep blue knows every possible move in just alphago can predict and respond to nearly every possible scenario in go but do they comprehend what they're doing in the same way that humans do do they recognize they're playing a game does that matter deep blue and alphago highlight the complexities and the relationship between knowledge understanding and experience while they have the ability to outperform human players their understanding of the game may be considered superficial lacking the intrinsic human connection to the game's history art and culture which raises profound questions about the nature of intelligence understanding success can a machine ever truly know something or is it merely executing patterns in algorithms without genuine comprehension and if our brains are also electrical circuits with biological wires rather than synthetic ones how are we any different these questions reach Beyond mere philosophical musings and have practical implications in the development and deployment of AI systems they challenge us to reflect on what it means to know understand and experience something and how these Concepts relate to both human intelligence and artificial intelligence as we continue to advance in the field of AI these considerations guide our ethical Frameworks our system design and our understanding of the potential and limitations of machine intelligence The Singularity is a concept that has captured imaginations and sparked debates across various disciplines it's the hypothetical point in time when AI surpasses human intelligence imagine a future where machines become recursively selfimproving leading to Rapid and unfathomable advancements but it's more than just a technological Milestone it's a philosophical Crossroads some people consider this concept the worst case scenario for AI because of such a system exists and its goals are not perfectly aligned with ours it could act in ways detrimental to humanity to achieve its objectives see the paperclip scenario from the beginning of the video it might even resist attempts to shut it down or modify its goals recognizing efforts as threats to its own objectives this scenario while speculative and debated within the AI Community underscores the critical importance of AI alignment and the profound implications that it holds for our future what happens when machines are smarter than us how will our society laws ethics and even our own sense of identity change will we control these machines or will they transcend our understanding hi I'm Emilia jaborski and I am the director of the Futures program at a nonprofit organization called the future of Life Institute our organization seeks to both mitigate the largescale risks of emerging Technologies as well as steer technology development towards a positive safe and beneficial future by background I am a physician and a scientist who has worked in biomedical Innovation for over a decade both as an academic and as an entrepreneur in recent years I've also been focusing on the potential risks of artificial intelligence or AI the intersection of AI and biotechnology presents another layer of risk that is both fascinating and deeply concerning as AI systems become more advanced there are potential applications in the field of biotechnology grow exponentially this promises breakthroughs in medicine Agriculture and environmental Sciences but it also opens the door to more Sinister possibilities such as the development of advanced bioweapons imagine an AI system capable of Designing pathogens that are more potent contagious and resistant to current Medical Treatments such a system could be exploited to create biological weapons of unprecedented power and specificity this risk is not just theoretical the advances in gene editing Technologies like crispr combined with ai's data analysis capabilities make this a plausible near future scenario the ethical humanitarian and security implications are staggering raising urgent questions about meaningful regulation oversight and international cooperation to prevent misuse the concept of AI developed bioweapons adds a new dimension to the ongoing discussions about AI risk and increasingly Advanced AI development it serves as a sobering reminder that as we push the boundaries of what AI can do we also must be vigilant in addressing and mitigating the risks involved along the way the stakes are incredibly High and the ethical humanitarian and security considerations are complex necessitating a multidisciplinary approach to ensure that AI is developed and deployed responsibly moral status refers to the degree of value or worth attributed to an entity within ethical considerations determining how it should be treated and what rights and protections it should be afforded in the context of AI personhood moral status becomes a pivotal question if an AI system were to be granted moral status it would imply that the system has intrinsic value independent of its utility to human beings and therefore deserves ethical consideration this challenges traditional Notions that only beings with Consciousness emotions or the ability to suffer have moral status the debate over the moral status of AI systems touches on profound philosophical inquiries into the nature of Consciousness sentience and existence it also raises questions for me at least about what characteristics qualify as an entity for moral consideration and how these might apply to nonhuman artificially created beings the discussion of moral status in AI is not just theoretical it has practical implications for how we design use and regulate AI systems think of Frankenstein for example reflecting these broader societal values and principles but the question of personhood for AI is more than just a legal or technical issue it's a profound ethical dilemma that challenges our fundamental concepts of Rights obligations and empathy imagine a future where AI systems are autonomous exhibiting behaviors that we associate with sentient beings like humans should we Grant ai's rights should we afford them protections should we afford them respect what criteria should we use to determine moral legal status period how do we balance the needs and rights of human beings with our responsibilities towards increasingly sophisticated nonhuman entities especially if we made them this is not a mere academic exercise it's a pressing moral challenge that could reshape our laws our society and our relationship with technology here are some arguments for and against first in favor of granting AI personhood proponents of grandeuring personhood to AI systems base their arguments on several compelling reasons first they point to the potential for advanced AI to possess Consciousness or selfawareness thus deserving rights and Productions similar to humans they also argue that recognizing ai's personhood could prevent potential mistreatment or exploitation of Highly sophisticated systems granting legal status to AI might facilitate smoother interactions in legal and Commercial environments making AI entities accountable and responsible in ways similar to corporations proponents also believe that personhood for AI encourages ethical development and deployment ensuring that creators and users trust these systems with respect and dignity finally recognizing AI as entities with certain rights might Foster empathy and compassion leading to a more Humane approach to technology now let's look at the opposing side against granting AI personhood opponents of granting AI personhood counter these arguments with several concerns of Their Own first they contend that even the most advanced AI lacks genuine emotions Consciousness or intentions and thus cannot be equated to humans and moral or beagle terms or at the very least they can't we can't prove it has Consciousness or not they also worry that assigning personhood AI could dilute human rights undermining the unique moral status of human beings additionally critics argue that AI personhood might create legal and ethical confusion blurring the lines between objects and subjects of law leading to unforeseen consequences opponents emphasize that granting AI legal status might shift responsibility away from the human creators and users making accountability more challenging furthermore they warned that equating AI with personhood could lead to a very slippery slope where other none human entities might claim similar rights further complicating our legal and ethical Frameworks together these arguments illustrate the complexities and nuances of the question of personhood for AI they invite us to carefully consider the implications of our technological advancements and how they intersect with our legal and social norms the reality is it's really difficult to tell if AI has Consciousness or sentience when we don't even agree on how to define those terms my personal belief is that the difference between Ai and humans is not something we have but something we're limited by in our human case that's time for AIS it's energy regardless the debate over AI personhood will probably continue as the technology evolves prompting us to revisit and possibly even redefine our understanding of Rights responsibilities and what it even means to be a person now we'll Venture into the Practical impacts AI has on sectors like Health Care education Finance employment and more imagine a world where AI influences every aspect of Our Lives from our health and education to our work in legal systems wait you're already living in it what ethical considerations arise as AI becomes more embedded in these areas how do we ensure fairness transparency accountability and empathy how do we navigate the balance between efficiency and ethics Innovation and integrity whether you're contributing to the development of AI systems or policies these questions are significant AI in healthcare offers transformative potential this sector holds an incredibly important place in our society as it directly impacts virtually everyone's lives from early diagnosis to personalized treatment AI is revolutionizing the way we approach Medical Care let's break it down diagnosis AI can analyze scans and medical images spur signs of diseases such as cancer providing faster and more accurate detection for instance deep learning models are now being used to detect diabetic retinopathy greatly assisting ophthalmologists in early intervention in treatment AI Systems Support physicians in selecting personalized treatment plans tailoring the approach to the individual's unique needs Watson for oncology is an example assisting oncologists with personalized cancer treatment recommendations in research the applications of AI and medical research are groundbreaking Alpha folds prediction of the 3D structure proteins has revolutionized bioinformatics potentially accelerating drug Discovery and understanding of various diseases the integration of AI in healthcare brings unique ethical challenges let's start with data privacy with the massive collection of personal Healthcare data ensuring patient confidentiality becomes pretty big priority for example a breach in a Hospital's patient record system could expose sensitive information eroding trust in the institution we can also talk about bias in data sets AI systems can inadvertently perpetuate biases if trained on skewed or nondiverse data sets some more specific examples could be race bias where an AI model trained primarily on Caucasian skin might misdiagnose skin conditions in people with darker skin tones or sex bias a lack of representation of women and certain medical data sets could lead to inaccurate diagnoses and treatment for female patients for example heart disease system symptoms might manifest differently in women but if the data is heavily biased towards male participants the AI system might Overlook these differences you can also talk about age bias if an AI system is trained mainly on data from younger patients it might struggle to recognize and treat conditions that are more prevalent or manifest differently and alter individuals informed consent is another issue patients must be adequately informed about how their data is used and have the opportunity to consent to it without transparent communication there's a risk of undermining patient autonomy accessibility and equality is important because ensuring the AI driven Healthcare Solutions are available to all regardless of socioeconomic status is critical compliance with legal regulations is really important in healthcare here are a couple major privacy laws that AI systems currently need to comply with the first is called HIPAA the health insurance portability and accountability act which in the United States safeguards patients medical records and other health information setting the standard for data privacy the second is called gdpr General data protection regulation which in Europe protects and empowers all EU citizens data privacy including health information you know those annoying Banners at the bottom of websites that ask you to let the website collect cookies that's also gdpr now let's look at a specific case study IBM Watson in healthcare this technology demonstrates both promise and the complexities of AI in medicine Watson for oncology is a cognitive Computing system designed to support oncologists in identifying potential treatment options for individual cancer patients by analyzing vast amounts of medical literature clinical guidelines and patientspecific data Watson can assist doctors in navigating the complex landscape of Cancer Care its ability to process information at a speed unattainable by humans represents a significant advancement in personalized medicine one notable benefit of Watson for oncology is its capacity to bring worldclass cancer treatment expertise to remote or underserved areas by providing access to uptodate medical knowledge it helps level the playing field ensuring that patients everywhere can receive stateoftheart care however Watson's integration into Healthcare has not been without criticism some medical professionals have raised concerns about the transparency of Watson's decisionmaking process questioning how exactly it arrives at a particular recommendation this black box nature can lead to skepticism and reluctance among those who are accustomed to evidencebased practices the success of Watson in real world clinical settings has been mixed while some institutions praised its contributions others have found it less useful or even discordant with human experts opinions so while IBM Watson in healthcare presents a fascinating glimpse into the future of medicine where AI systems could play a pivotal role in diagnosis and treatment it also shows the importance of collaboration rigorous validation and ethical consideration it's a testament to both the potential and the pitfalls of AI and one of the most sensitive and vital areas of human life Ai and Healthcare holds tremendous promise but it also poses ethical and legal questions that are complex as we continue to innovate we must do so with care responsibility and a focus on human wellbeing next we'll explore AI in the spirit of education and the realm of personalized learning AI is making strides by creating customized educational plans tailored to individual students these plans adapt to students unique learning styles and paces offering a more engaging and Effective Education at times for instance tools like DreamBox or transforming math education by adapting content to the student's specific level making learning more relevant and more dynamic but beyond personalization AI is also assisting in content development by harnessing algorithms and data Educators can design materials that are engaging and tailored to meet the diverse needs of their students various content Technologies are emerging such as platforms that help Educators craft Interactive Learning Materials ensuring that content remains fresh relevant and inspiring imagine granting every person in the world access to a personal tutor that's what AI can accomplish if developed and deployed properly fitter Tom my organization which Seth introduced earlier was able to accomplish this on a smaller scale using chatgpt we developed an application that uses the machine learning model behind the tap gbt called gpt4 that allows students to generate curricula on any topic from crowdsource content this platform enabled us to ensure that reputable factual and accessible content was streamlined to the students we brought the tool along with free access to chat GPT plus from openai to nearly 2 400 students from underserved backgrounds and some of them were able to jump grade levels ahead in math and english comprehension content and learn about topics they didn't have the teaching capacity or textbooks for from financial literacy to menstrual Health to climate change all within a span of four months and using those two platforms as general purpose AI continues to scale and become more reliable we imagine that this type of education could be a reality for Millions if not billions of students in the future as AI becomes more influential in the educational landscape it's important to recognize and endress ethical concerns biases are a significant issue mirroring similar challenges in healthcare if AI systems are trained on biased data they can inadvertently reinforce stereotypes and inequalities failing to cater effectively to a diverse student body for instance gender biases and algorithms could lead to differentiated treatment male and female students in a way that reflects existing societal biases accessibility is another essential consideration the potential benefits of AI and education must be available to students from alsocial economic backgrounds ensuring equal access to these revolutionary tools is crucial to avoid widening existing educational disparities the goal ultimately is to leverage AI to uplift and Empower not to exclude or marginalize people still the potential upsides are currently outpacing fears of how AI will fundamentally alter education there are some cases where students in particular are not big fans online proctoring is now a staple in modern education especially in remote learning environments AI driven systems can monitor students during exams analyzing behaviors and patterns to prevent cheating while this technology has proven effective in maintaining academic Integrity it's not without ethical challenges data privacy is a major concern here their surveillance required for online proctoring can be seen as intrusive collecting sensitive information that must be handled with utmost care furthermore biases can creep into these systems as well algorithms may be more likely to flag students a particular ethnic backgrounds or those with disabilities leading to unfair scrutiny online proctoring encapsulates the broader themes of our exploration of AI and education the promise and the potential are enormous but the ethical considerations are equally significant as we continue to innovate and integrate AI into our classrooms and curricula we must do so with a Mindful and responsible approach ensuring that we harness technology to enhance education not hinder it the finance sector is already an industry transformed by AI let's take a closer look at two significant applications algorithmic trading and fraud detection algorithmic trading represents one of the most striking uses of AI in finance by employing intricate algorithms hedge funds and other financial institutions can execute high frequency trading strategies an example of this is hedge funds that use artificial intelligence driven algorithms to make a rapid buying and selling decisions capitalizing on my new price changes this technology streamlines trading but as we'll see it also presents unique ethical dilemmas fraud detection is another compelling application of AI in the financial World by monitoring the transactions in real time AI can detect and prevent fraudulent activities enhancing the security and integrity of our financial systems credit card companies for instance use sophisticated AI systems to spot suspicious transactions and act swiftly to protect customers the integration of AI in finance has brought with it several ethical concerns unique to the sector first let's discuss Market manipulation the speed and sophistication of AI training algorithms present opportunities for manipulation these algorithms can be employed to create false market trends or to spoof the market where in large buy or sell orders are placed and then quickly canceled to deceive other Traders this kind of manipulation can lead to distorted prices and undermine the Integrity of financial markets it raises questions about transparency fairness and the adequacy of existing regulatory measures data Securities another major concern in a world where personal and corporate financial information is entrusted to AI systems the stakes for securing this data are incredibly High breaches can lead not only to financial loss but to a loss of trust in financial institutions and so protecting this data requires an unprecedented level of security measures robust encryption and constant vigilance against everevolving cyber threats the ethical responsibility extends to ensuring the AI systems are transparent and how they handle data and comply with relevant privacy laws another issue centers around accountability and responsibility with AI algorithms making critical financial decisions questions arise about who is responsible when things go wrong it's the developers of the algorithms visit the institutions using them or someone else the lines of responsibility can be blurred complicating regulatory oversight finally we must think about issues of economic inequality and accessibility as AI drives more financial decision making there's a risk that those without access to these Technologies are left behind ensuring that the benefits and protections of AI and finance are available to all not just the technologically advanced is an ethical imperative the flash crash of 2010 serves as a dramatic illustration of all of these ethical concerns on May 6 2010 the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted over 1 000 points losing over one trillion dollars in just minutes only to rebound almost as quickly what caused this crazy event an investigation revealed that a large sell order executed by an algorithm triggered a Cascade of selling by other algorithms leading to a rapid and terrifying drop in market prices but the flash crash wasn't just a technical glitch it revealed fundamental vulnerabilities and a system heavily reliant on AI driven Trading it showed how algorithms reacting to each other in unexpected ways could create a feedback loop of selling that spiraled out of control the incident sparked a debate about the lack of transparency and algorithmic trading and raised questions about the adequacy of regulatory oversight how could such a system be safeguarded against manipulation what measures were in place to prevent a repeat of this event well for one circuit breakers were implemented which effectively paused trading in a security if its price moves too much in a short period the flash crash led to reforms and new regulations aimed at increasing transparency and stability in algorithmic trading but it also served as a stark warning of the potential genders of unchecked AI and finance emphasizing the need for careful consideration and robust safeguards in our financial systems the employment arena is rapidly evolving with artificial intelligence playing a pivotal role this is why AI in the workforce is among video Toms and many Civil Society organizations key priorities in recruitment AI streamlines operations sifts through applications and even conducts preliminary interviews via AI driven chat Bots tools like higher view allow for assessing candidates fit through video interviews pactum AI introduces an Innovative approach by automating salary negotiations eliminating the stress of facetoface discussions on this very delicate matter by doing so the company aims to minimize gender and possibly racial biases in wage determinations entrusting these decisions to a seemingly impartial nonhuman mediator these advancements not only expedite hiring and employment processes but also offer a promising reduction in human prejudices showcasing just a glimpse of the potential AI holds in this domain if implemented properly performance analysis is another area where AI has made inroads analyzing vast amounts of employee data AI systems can recognize Trends and patterns identifying those who might benefit from support or training systems like adp's AI driven Workforce analytics provide realtime insights fostering growth and productivity while these developments promise enhanced efficiency they also raise serious ethical considerations the automation of tasks traditionally performed by humans may lead to job displacement requiring a delicate balance between technological advancement and the human cost bias in recruiting algorithms often inadvertently perpetuated in a detrimental effects on gender race age or other factors this emphasizes the necessity for careful construction and ongoing monitoring of these systems AI development quite literally hinges on continuous data input and refinement this need has unintentionally birthed digital sweatshops in places like the Philippines and subSaharan Africa prominent companies have been linked to Partnerships with AI supply chain entities such as sama these businesses exploit labor by deciding critical content moderation tasks to workers paying them well below the minimum wage Beyond economic disadvantages these jobs have a severe mental toll and workers can confront disturbing and harmful content from AI platforms these efforts to improve moderation Technologies ensure that when these Technologies such as chat GPT are rolled out to the general public they are significantly safer and can't be used for at ethical purposes however the wellbeing and Economic Opportunity of these digital laborers could be compromised in the process there's still little regulation or intervention in this space and the companies involved have yet to face any tangible consequences just as AI can displace jobs or lead to worker exploitation there has been a growing push for technologybased solutions to economically support the most vulnerable many of whom will find their jobs displaced without concessions for upskilling or working in these digital sweatshots leading this movement are initiatives like the proposed AI windfall clause which suggests taxing AI generated profits to fund societal Wellness programs World coin video Tom and karya present different approaches to this challenge World coin offers cryptocurrency shares in exchange for Iris scans aiming to democratize financial systems video Tom's developer arm provides digital identification and micro loans to the unbanked with the eventual goal of integrating them into the formal banking system and serving as a potential proof of concept for an aifunded Universal basic income karya on the other hand offers Indian workers the opportunity to earn above the minimum wage by providing voice recordings which are then used to enhance voice recognition systems in AI the ethical dimensions of these initiatives are vast while worldcoin promises Financial inclusion it grapples with issues of data privacy informed consent and potential exploitation of economically vulnerable populations despite focusing on data privacy we at fiducon still face challenges with verifiability and Multinational Financial policy compliance with our systems meanwhile karya's approached those seemingly beneficial could lead to questions about the fair evaluation of voice data and the broader implications of commodifying native languages for AI purposes despite them being a nonprofit these Ventures highlight the needs to tread carefully weighing the benefits against the inherent ethical risks in AI driven compensation systems that being said they will emerge as vitally important as AI continues to proliferate in our social world privacy is also at the Forefront of ethical considerations the balance between an employer's need for information and an employee's right to privacy must be finely tuned alongside privacy ensuring equality and accessibility and AI tools across all socioeconomic backgrounds it's a vital ethical consideration the application of AI and recruitment offers both exciting opportunities and cautionary tales companies like Unilever have embraced AI achieving significant deficiencies in time and cost however this promising landscape isn't without pitfalls Amazon's experience offers a critical case study their AI recruitment tool designed to streamline the hiring process was found to be biased against women despite efforts to correct the system the biases persisted and Amazon eventually abandoned the tool this situation showed how a seemingly neutral algorithm can replicate human prejudices if not carefully managed it also illustrates the very fine line between efficiency and fairness potential and prudence the lessons learned from Amazon's experience here are a stark reminder of the need for vigilance and transparency and ai's application in recruiting ai's role in shaping the future of work is undeniable from personalized recruitment to continuous performance analysis the promise is great but so are the responsibilities the choices made today will shape tomorrow's jobs the integration of AI and employment is not merely a technological Evolution it's a societal transformation that requires thoughtful engagement with ethical considerations and a commitment to shaping a future that enhances rather than diminishes our working lives the growing implementation of AI Automation in various Industries is both an opportunity and a challenge on one hand it can create efficiencies Drive Innovation and free up human workers for mundane or repetitive tasks allowing them to engage in more creative or hopefully fulfilling work on the other hand there is a tangible fear of job loss particularly in sectors where automation can easily replace human labor entirely the displacement of workers due to technological advancements has become a crucial concern leading to debates on how best to retrain and support those whose roles are being phased out addressing the potential for job loss requires proactive planning and policy making as AI continues to change the employment landscape there must be concerted efforts to provide Education and Training and support to workers transitioning into new roles the integration of AI should be accompanied by a humancentric approach that values and invests in the workforce ensuring that people aren't left behind in the March towards progress collaboration between governments Industries and educational institutions are important in creating a resilient labor market that can adapt the changing nature of work striking a balance between technological advancement and human wellbeing hi everyone my name is sneha or even or and I am the founder and president of encode Justice the world's first and largest youth movement for humancentered artificial intelligence we're working to set rules of the road for AI by educating policy makers and the public about the social political and environmental implications of increasingly powerful AI systems there are a few thorny questions we're still up against when it comes to regulating AI how do we translate abstract Notions of fairness into quantifiable benchmarks that machines can process how do we ensure that models are safe trustworthy and reliable without hampering Innovation at a time when Global powers are approaching an AI arms race how do we balance the desire for explainable outcomes with the importance of intellectual property protections especially when so many models are proprietary and most crucially as AI models become increasingly Advanced how do we design agile structures of governance that can keep Pace learning to govern this moving Target is quickly becoming one of the heftiest regulatory challenges of our time responsibility and accountability in the age of AI are multifaceted and complex who takes the fall when an AI system fails or causes harm in the case of an autonomous vehicle the more important question isn't what the car does in some hypothetical trolley problem but who's responsible in the aftermath is it the developer who programmed the algorithms the company that deployed it or perhaps even the AI system itself who volunteers as tribute this debate has profound implications for law ethics and society as AI systems become more advanced and autonomous traditional legal Frameworks may be insufficient to address new scenarios remember how we previously discussed legal personhood for AI here's another reason that could be relevant if AIS were almost akin to corporations it would open up an entirely new dimension of legal options understanding these intricacies is key to creating a responsible AI driven future AI governance isn't just about legal compliance it's about building a holistic ecosystem that balances the Innovative potential of AI with ethical considerations and societal needs internal governance includes policies within an organization to guide AI development and use ensuring alignment with ethical principles safety standards and societal values on the other hand external oversight incorporates thirdparty audits certifications and Regulatory bodies that maintain industry standards together these elements form a cohesive governance framework that supports responsible AI development this multifaceted approach recognizes that AI is not any one thing but rather a diverse field of hearing applications each requiring nuanced understanding and regulation AI ethics codes and standards are foundational in shaping the moral fabric of the technology various organizations governments and Industry groups are working to develop these guidelines reflecting a concerted Global effort to align AI development with human values these codes not only address immediate ethical concerns but also seek to anticipate future challenges and possibilities they often focus on principles like transparency accountability privacy and fairness the development of globally accepted standards is an ongoing process involving continuous dialogue between technologists ethicists policy makers and the broader public it's an essential step towards a future where AI serves as a force for positive good governments around the world are actively grappling with how to regulate Ai and their approaches vary widely the challenge lies in creating policies that promote Innovation while protecting citizens and upholding societal values some governments encourage a free market approach fostering growth While others adopt more strict regulations to ensure compliance and Public Safety This Global web of AI policies reflects varying cultural political social and economic contacts each contributing to a complex tapestry of Regulation the United States defines its approach to AI regulation with the commitment to Human Rights transparency and accountability emphasizing entrepreneurial spirit and Innovation the U.S Fosters an environment conducive to AI advancement through programs like the American artificial intelligence initiative which focuses on R D investment and ethical guidelines and through consultation with a number of Civil Society groups the White House released a Bill of Rights to an automated Society outlining principles for the responsible development provenance and use of AI systems in addition the White House notched an agreement with a number of leading Tech firms like anthropic meta Google and openai these companies signed on to accept a voluntary commitments including things like stronger cyber security protections and a watermarking system to distinguish AI generated content federal agencies including the National Institute of Standards and Technology actively worked to develop standards and best practices state governments alongside industry groups contribute to this collaborative ecosystem through local regulations and initiatives simultaneously the U.S recognizes the need for ethical guard rails and principles like nondiscrimination and Ai and strives to balance Innovation with the protection of these Democratic principles this Dynamic and multifaceted approach aims to make the U.S a global leader in AI setting Trends and influencing International Norms around its development the European Union stance on AI regulation is characterized by a strong emphasis on privacy human rights and comprehensive oversight the EU has been at the Forefront of crafting regulations like the general data protection regulation or the gdpr which has set Global standards for data protection in April 2021 the European commission proposed new rules specifically targeting AI focusing on transparency accountability and risk management unlike a solely free market approach the EU integrates ethical considerations at every stage of AI development seeking to create a landscape that reflects Democratic Values initiatives like the high level expert group on artificial intelligence further underline the eu's commitment to a responsible and humancentric approach to AI collaborative efforts across member states and a focus on both Innovation and accountability make the eu's approach a model for Global AI governance China's AI regulatory landscape is unique reflecting its social political context National priorities and an integrated approach to technological governance several initiatives and policies highlight the country's approach to AI regulation China's approach integrates AI development with national priorities emphasizing State control the government plays an active role in shaping ai's Direction leveraging it as a tool for Social Development and Global competitiveness to understand China's approach you must appreciate its blend of governance National priorities and cultural values which offer insights into an alternative model of governance the final AI policy and case study we're going to look at are the two schools of thought when it comes to approaching AI regulation in the rapidly progressing AI landscape two distinct viewpoints have become especially pronounced the first are algorithmic Justice and Freedom Fighters with Advocates like Tim Nick gabru and joy buamuini they're concerned with the immediate challenges of AI like algorithmic fairness data privacy and the displacement of jobs on the other hand the longtermism group often linked to prominent figures like Elon Musk contemplate the broader future oriented implications especially the potential threats posed by strong Ai and super AI that might surpass human capabilities and intentions while both groups are certainly championing valid concerns they're differing focal points can lead to friction in both discourse and policy priorities those advocating for algorithmic justice feel that the long term is might sideline pressing social and ethical issues by concentrating on more distant and speculative threats however in contrast longtermis emphasize preemptive measures to Stave off any catastrophic outcomes in the AI driven future it's vital to recognize that the two perspectives can coexist and potentially even complement each other addressing algorithmic justice issues today can pave the way for AI alignment in the future ensuring that AI Technologies are both fair and safe it's also worth noting that skepticism towards longtermism sometimes stems from the knowledge that some of the early figures in AI longtermism had racist beliefs this historical backdrop underscores the importance of prioritizing ethics and inclusivity in today's AI discussions irrespective of the group's primary focus that being said we must be careful about what we prioritize when it comes to regulation to ensure that both shortterm and longterm harms are accurately addressed and then redressed 2023 marks the first ever Global AI safety Summit held in London by UK prime minister Rishi sudok who committed publicly to making the UK the geographical and intellectual home of AI governance the summit and future iterations of it are dedicated to convening leaders from around the world to craft regulations for Frontier AI models now more than ever intergovernmental coordination on AI has become Paramount an AI arms race May already be underway between Global powers like the U.S and China buyin from rival or states will be necessary to rein in AI development especially as current uses like autonomous weapons and future ones like aipowered cyber attacks threatened to undermine the world's order the UN has even moved to establish a highlevel advisory body on artificial intelligence mirroring a similar body in the EU there is an incredibly wide range of regulatory approaches and human rights environments to consider for for instance with the AI act the EU has explicitly rejected aibased surveillance through Technologies like facial recognition though similar systems are still in use by number of governments around the world it remains to be seen how exactly competing national interests and strategies will shape Global AI governance thank you for joining me for this course up until this point as we look towards the future of AI and ethical AI development we'll recap some essential themes challenges and opportunities from its applications in various sectors to the governing principles that must guide its evolution to bring together the insights we've gained throughout this course ai's future is poised to be transformative ongoing advancements such as Quantum Computing are expanding ai's capabilities while applications like space exploration offer New Frontiers AI is not just a technology of the future though it's shaping our present influencing sectors from Health Care Finance education to employment the potential for Innovation is vast but our ethical considerations must be at the core of progress ethical AI development is not merely a preference it's an imperative as we've explored in various contexts the ethical considerations in AI are multifaceted including accountability biases accessibility data security and legal personhood ensuring the AI development aligns with human values and societal needs is vital to harnessing ai's benefits while mitigating risk the development of AI isn't confined to technology experts it requires the engagement of governments private sectors Academia civil society and more different perspectives contribute to a richer and more balanced approach to AI collaboration across sectors Fosters Innovation sets appropriate guidelines ensures inclusivity and resonates with this complex tapestry of AI applications and ethical considerations that we've explored public awareness and education are integral to the responsible growth of AI an informed public can shape policies advocate for ethical considerations and contribute to a culture of responsible innovation education both formal and informal equips individuals with the knowledge and critical thinking required to navigate our AI driven World it Bridges the gap between technological advancements and societal readiness so in other words it's a plug to share this course with friends but with major cultural moments such as the launch of Chachi BTA we're starting to see the general public catching on to AI that means you dear viewer by watching this video course you're already in the top percentile of people who have knowledge about this space congratulations AI offers unprecedented opportunities to tackle Global challenges however deploying AI for social good isn't without its own challenges from the technological barriers to ethical complexities ai's role in global problem solving requires a nuanced understanding of both its capabilities and its limitations the strategies case studies and ethical debates that we have discussed throughout this course illuminate the Dynamics at play and leveraging AI for the Creator good
