hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to keep working on these react components so i've just been like grinding through stuff uh yesterday and today um i was uh i have a side project now that i'm working on um it's like a blockchain wallet uh so i was up last night late working on that too uh which we're doing that in react native so that's kind of cool um but i'm just trying to like balance uh being able to work and trying to stay in that flow state and like going too far and getting burnt out so right now definitely not burn out just a little bit tired probably after i do the stream i might get something you can do a workout and then i should be good to go and i'll go work on my side projects uh but maybe i'll let you know a little bit more about that project later on and um maybe i'll do some something on my own channel uh but for now we're gonna work with let's see i just noticed something yeah i just noticed an issue with the faculty uh list item component so that's what we'll start with i'll show you what the issue is uh first in the ui uh and then we'll go to the component and uh we'll fix that and we may actually create an entirely new component a new page today as well but let's fix this first so i think if i don't fix it now i'll probably forget about it all right let me get let me get my screen ready i'll get my screen ready and then also i'm gonna set my pomodoro timer uh okay i got everything the screen ready for you all so let me switch it over okay and i can't remember it wasn't this green which one was it let me check here okay i think it was psychology and social work let's see i think it was this page nope maybe so uh i've been working on all these faculty list pages and making sure that in the router uh we have them in properly and like halfway through the list of the faculty list pages it um the the url switched up so sometimes it's just like the program slash faculty so it'd be like english slash faculty but sometimes it changes so it's it would be department slash english faculty so for some programs it uses that and for some programs it uses the other one and there's no like it it's not like there's two urls and they both get the same place it has to be one or the other so i had to uh finish out the routing function to be able to handle things with three parameters which we never really finished that because we hadn't we didn't need it yet so i had to do that make some adjustments in the routing function so check out the last couple commits if you're interested in that but when i was doing that i noticed this so um her last name is o'brien right with a little um what is it uh apostrophe yeah i can't even think uh a little apostrophe right so and i know we fixed this issue before does anybody watching know how to fix this or remember how we did it before i feel like i'm in class but i just i just want to see if anybody else how how you all would fix this i'll give y'all a second and i'll answer a question while i'm while i'm waiting uh cooldeep asks uh can you give a rough idea for how you built your timer i want to make it to um actually i did not build that timer uh so um the timer that i'm using it was built by harshit who's in this channel quite a bit so if he if he's able to make it today um then we can we can ask him when he comes into the channel i think his break's over and he's back to school though so i'm not i don't think he'll be able to make it very often now uh but i mean this is early enough in the day that he he might not be sleeping yet so um cool deep ass how can i contact him um i think what the best way would be uh i guess he's on twitter um yeah send me a uh a direct message on twitter my links in the profile are in the description of the video the link to my twitter profile is in the description of this video send me a dm and then i'll connect you with harshit i don't want to like put out harshit's twitter info on the stream in case he doesn't want me to okay so the way we're going to fix this is we're going to use dangerously set inner html right um it's okay to do that because we have control of the content don't definitely do not want to do that if you're allowing users to enter in their own content and then have a display uh because bad things could happen let's see john also says um maybe you could find them with a regular expression wrap them in a span sorry yeah i should say it's not like there's one way to deal with this but we're just gonna do the way that uh we've usually dealt with this and we have the the option to do it this way like i said because we have control of our data this is not an option in all cases though all right so oh that's way too small let me make that bigger okay let me know if that's big enough if i need to go bigger and i don't need that sidebar to be that big and there's not even anything on this page so all right cool so here's our faculty list and uh so we're not actually going well just to show you on our faculty list page we're taking in that data that we're getting from wordpress one of the pieces of data that we're getting is the title and that's the that's the little bit that has that that name with the uh apostrophe in it so we're grabbing that data and we're passing it as a prop called profile name to our faculty list item component so now let's go into the faculty list item component and let's find where we're using that um profile name prop all right so we've done that our destructuring up here so we can just say profile name we don't have to use this props all the time which is convenient and let's find profile name there it is okay so you can see we're just putting profile name in here we're not setting dangerously setting the inner html so we're going to do that to do that i'm going to copy and paste where we're doing it here uh with with our title and it's kind of odd that i didn't think to do this before since we're already doing it in looks like oh just one other place um but what we can do here then is put in our profile name i don't think we'll need to add the zero i'm not sure why we have that in title i don't remember what happened there that uh that made us have to do that and then we can get rid of this closing tag and just add our slash in here let's save it and see if it works see what happens hey there we go so now it's switched up and we can see this is displayed properly along you know everything else was already looking good but now that's displayed properly so don't have to worry about something like that happening again so that's awesome that's uh one quick win right off the bat so i'm gonna commit that if you uh if you weren't with me yesterday uh i had i had vowed yesterday that i was gonna try to stick to my own advice of committing often so i'm going to try to keep it up let's do git status yep that's what changed and so we can do a git add let's run our yarn cm and we'll fix and um let's see faculty names with not displayed properly and i don't think i ever made an issue about that because i i just saw it not too long ago so that should be good we'll make sure it passes the test and then we can push it and uh lately i've been going through a lot of the uh open issues and just trying to uh close some of them because we were starting to get a lot of issues that were open so the next one i noticed that shouldn't be too difficult to do is uh creating a template page for jobs so this is issue 107. if you want to check out the get repo for this the links in the description okay um so let me just explain what i want to do here and uh if you want to follow along you can read it as well in the issue but uh so right now on the site we have job listings and they're split up into two categories faculty and staff uh so we're basically we're the routes for these pages are going to be slash hr slash faculty openings and slash hr staff openings so both routes are going to go to the same component to be rendered but then within that component we are going to grab the data um and filter it so we probably won't filter we'll probably do is use we're going to create a new graphql query and we're only going to grab the posts the job listing post for that particular um category we'll pull them in we'll list them all in a similar way that we we just saw with those faculty profiles and then we'll need to make um going to double check on the current site but i believe each one of them will have to have its own page as well so will be just like the faculty profiles where you'll be able to click to learn more and then it will open up its own page i'll have to see what the url should be for those as well but the first thing we need to do is create the new component and create um i can't talk today create a new component and create the graphql query that's it okay uh yep and it looks like everything passed wonderful this would be get push that is now available on github all right so let's check out our pages folder and let's see make sure i didn't already make something for this nope all right and since we already have the faculty list page up and uh it's gonna be similar to our jobs page let's just copy and paste our faculty list page and then uh we'll modify it and turn it into our jobs page so we're going to select everything copy it and uh let's make a new a new file called jobs dot um no it'll be let's make it job list i could make it plural jobs and then also have a template for job like just job but uh i think it's way more clear if you add the list at the end uh it's a lot easier to just mistake the two when there's only one character difference so we're going to say job list.js and then depending on how much time we have maybe we'll make the single job page as well okay so we need to change the name here so faculty list and faculty list faculty list um i was hoping i could just uh select all these but i can't right now so let's just call this jobless just a job list component and job list oops i don't need that list okay so we change the name and this is now job list we do have to remember to make a route for this in the router we'll never be able to get to it okay uh we're gonna name we're gonna rename our query as well so actually you may be able to grab all the query stuff at once job list query and we need to grab this from job list so on our other panel here let's work on our query and we can again we'll be able to copy that query that we're already using and just adjust it so in our queries we'll take that faculty list query we're going to copy that and make a new file we're going to call this job list dot js just paste it in there and job list was that i can't remember if that's capitalized or not yep it is faculty list so we'll capitalize that for job list and then let's change it here as well job list and instead of faculty departments i believe we can just say job i may have to double check to make sure um what i named that particular uh post type yeah let's see and then it's not going to be faculty yeah let me let me go back a second so i'm not looking at departments we're looking at yeah i need to check let's go to our wordpress uh installation and check what we name these because i created this post type a long time ago i believe i created the right taxonomy as well if i didn't then i need to make it because that's going to be important okay jobs oh it i don't think i have any taxonomy set setup so we may be doing some php for a minute nope there's nothing okay all right let's do that quickly uh hopefully hopefully i have this repo downloaded already um on my other screen i'm gonna get this opened up okay i think i do have it great pool okay all right so i'm gonna open this up and pull it over so we can check this out all right so here is our our plugin our franciscan custom post types.php file here uh so here's a wordpress plugin and we have jobs we may as well look up what we named jobs uh so it looks like it's just its job okay so that's that's pretty simple uh to remember but now we need to go down here to our taxonomies and let's check this out okay um yeah so we definitely need to add that taxonomy so let's grab let's grab this staff department's code we're going to copy and paste that to create a new jobs instead of staff department we'll call this uh we're gonna create a new taxonomy uh job job category you know what now i remember why i didn't make this before uh i was gonna use the advanced custom fields plugin to just make a um like a radio a field with it's a radio um button that you can either pick staff or faculty instead of an entirely new taxonomy but at this point that's going to take longer so i'm just going to do it like this hi gemma hi do you want to say hi to people on youtube to the ice cream shop but mama said no all right well maybe a different time well she might she might like this okay because i really want to go because we haven't been here in a really long time okay you wanna do you wanna watch me code okay you gotta be quiet though because we're gonna try to do something now all right okay okay all right so let's take all these instances where it says staff department and let's change it to job category and we'll do the same thing here uh you know what yeah i guess it's okay it's a word you know i will need to to start using that advanced custom fields plugin at some point so um we might maybe we'll do that on a stream let me know if you're interested in how we set that up and use it i do need to double check and make sure that it will work with graphql though jump um category all right so we're going to job categories and then down here we'll do the same thing oops well we'll camel case then uh for that wp graphql plugin things need to be camel case all right um oh they're talking to you um uh this is my daughter her name's gemma and they say you're cute cute gemma that microphone is not hooked up to the computer okay he was checking it out okay all right actually we're gonna do i'm gonna save this and oops this needs to be a new okay i had a drink right there but luckily it was in a like a travel mug instead of just the glass it would have been all over the place okay so my timer is up so i'm going to stop here before we check out to see if it'll work so it'll be suspenseful while i answer questions for five minutes uh so we're gonna do a short break i'm gonna scroll all the way up to the top and try to answer as many questions as i can in uh in five minutes and then we'll go back to this what are the questions well let me let me see the question okay um i see a lot of you just saying saying hi so hey everyone uh dash dash moo says um sorry if i mispronounced that let me know how i should pronounce it but anyway they say tell us more about that blockchain wallet side project um okay yeah i'll briefly talk about that it's um so there is a website called uh git coin so it's um g i t c o i n uh i can't remember if it's maybe it's dot io i'm not sure but anyway the idea behind it is that you take open github issues for uh projects and then you set a bounty on them and it's a certain amount of cryptocurrency so if you complete if you solve that issue then you get that that bounty right in cryptocurrency so um i get emails occasionally from that website that'll just update me on some things i might be interested in working on and i saw one and um it was using react and it had a decent bounty on it so i thought hey i'll try this out but by the time i um submitted a request to work on it someone else had already requested it so they they got it first but then i got to talking to the person that maintains that repo and they were saying that they're also working on you know a different project that's porting this web app to a react native uh app and um they asked if i had experience with react native and i said yeah and i sent him some of my repos and so now i'm working on that so at this point i'm just kind of working on ui stuff so i have some sketch files about how it's supposed to look and i'm trying to get that all sorted um you know as soon as i can i think it's a really really useful web app and i really want to use the the app itself lastly i can put in my info and saw it and it's it's really cool it gives you all your basically you give it your metamask wallet address and it it lists out all your coins and then the value of your coins and you know whatever currency you select um priyanka says can you please tell me how to get a job if someone is new to coding um if you're new to coding um the best thing to do is like keep learning keep working on projects um and you may i mean it depends a lot on where you're at and and what your skill level is but if you find if there's like an agency or something where you work or you know a company that's doing websites or whatever you want to work on uh you could ask them submit your resumes even if you're not hiring and just say like hey i'll work as a contract worker hourly basis or something that could open up the door for you to work on projects that you wouldn't normally be able to get on your own and clients that you would never be able to have access to on your own since you you're just trying to build up your reputation so that's one way to do it another way is just to reach out to clients on your own um you know small businesses in your area that might need you know work done you can try websites that list work um if you want i i've never had great luck with those there's a lot of competition you usually don't get paid that much uh but if you don't have any other way to build your portfolio that's a way to do it i've even heard of people picking a business that has let's say like a terrible website and redoing their website for free and then going to the business and showing them what they've done and saying that would you be interested in you know in having this website uh so you know those are just a few ways i'm sure there's a lot more that i'm forgetting but you know basically your focus at this point should be just building up your portfolio preferably with with projects for real clients but in the meantime if you don't have paying work try your best to keep learning keep doing projects that at least you can put in your github profile and in your portfolio um dash mook says uh how does react.js work for search engine optimization um we are using server side rendering for this and you need to do that if you want to use react and you want to use data that you're pulling in from an api you need to render it on the server side for search engines to see it you can do that a variety of ways the easiest way that i've found is just to use uh next js because it comes automatically with server side rendering so that's what we we're using right now okay and my timer is up so i'm gonna have to come back and finish answering the questions uh after the next pomodoro session so let's see uh if we can get this component up and running hey gemma i can't see my screen okay are you looking at that one now yeah i'm gonna look at that one now we're gonna go back and do some more code okay uh let's see okay here's what else i'd like to do i think it might not be a bad idea to add some more categories to the jobs uh this could um it could help users sort better right so let's add uh in addition to adding this to uh staff the staff members uh we're gonna add it to jobs oop job and what is this staff department and there should be a faculty should be a faculty department as well there we go so faculty department you can see is already used on a variety of post types and we're gonna add in job to this as well all right so now i'm just gonna copy and paste this into wordpress there are better ways to get your code into wordpress but this would be the fastest way right now since i don't have other ways set up and uh jimmy try not to uh wiggle the chair i'm i'm gonna get motion sick and so is everybody watching okay okay so we're gonna go down here to plugins into our editor and let's we're going to go to that franciscan franciscan custom post type plugin and now we can just copy and paste that oops i accidentally hit save like it was in my editor it's not we're gonna update that and we should be able to see the changes immediately if we did it right maybe i didn't do it right let me give it a refresh and now let's see oh yeah jobs yep here we go so now we have faculty department staff department oh and the category is called job we don't really want that i messed that up um let's change that really quick because that's going to be confusing so job yeah we need to say job category up here i know how to spell job it's easy okay all right so save that copy it and we still have this up on the screen which is good we'll update that and that should work now we'll give it a refresh and there we go now it says job category so that's wonderful so now if we go into jobs we should have there we go we have all these options uh and if we were to go into this this job clinical nursing instructor we can see that we can select these things here and we can add a new job category so we could say faculty as one category and staff as the other so now faculty and staff are there all right now clinical nursing instructor would be a faculty position so we're going to uncheck staff okay and then we can say it within our faculty department we can check nursing department update that and now if we go back to check all our jobs so now we can see our department and our category oh no did i mess up category ah i misspelled category no all right well i think i spelled it right in the slug so um that's good because it won't mess up too much uh cat yeah i spelled it right in the slug so that that's really what matters more like for the database uh data so let's change it here i definitely really like am just writing the first letter oh okay are you coding in your notebook it's actually mom so gemma's over here writing the code that we're writing she's writing it in a notebook she's coding along with us okay third time's a charm here right let's uh paste this in and now we'll have the uh the right spelling thanks for uh for letting me know about that uh glass down too hard it broke it was like one of those wine glasses that go up in the middle yeah yeah that's too bad and not baby shouldn't use those glasses huh okay well i used to use one but then but then it broke could you like either like pushed it off or something yeah there we go all right so that works now and now we can commit this change and push it up to github so let's see uh get add and connect and uh we're gonna say a new feature i'm gonna say add job category taxonomy and apply taxonomies to job post type all right great and so now um this this plugin is tracked on on github so you can check that out if you if you want to and now now we'll be able to do this so um be able to do what here's what we'll need what we need to make headphones all right so let me think how we're going to do this uh i guess the big yeah the first thing that we want to uh filter by i guess is actually let's let's think about this so right now let's go to the site right now i'm trying to think of a uh if we could create a better user experience than what we have right now all right so let's go through the steps that a user would take if they wanted to find a job listing to work at franciscan university i'm gonna do it like this so it's like kind of like if we're gonna do this now anyway you know we may as well give this some thought we don't have to copy the actual user experience you know as it currently is okay so we've come to the site and uh probably about about an employment and human resources okay so now that i'm here i either click see open faculty positions or see open staff positions let's open both of them because i believe these pages are pretty much the same let's see yeah so faculty openings these are all the same links okay this is pretty much it yeah i mean this is pretty much the same the only difference that i could see i mean there's a different image in the background so no big deal because we're not bringing images over right now anyway so here's my my idea what if in the router we made it so that both of those routes would go to the same page and from there then you could have filters like we did with the search page like we've done with with other projects and one of the filters would be do you want faculty openings or staff openings i i really think that's better because i mean to be honest with you it's entirely possible that someone might just want to work here and they may be looking for any opening faculty or staff perhaps they they do have a higher degree and they're qualified to do a variety of things they come in here you know if they've clicked on one let's say they didn't do like we did and open up new windows for both which probably would be the best way to go about this how it's currently set up but let's say they didn't and then they'd have to go to a different page to look at the different openings right there's actually not like no way to sort these at all so you could see like there's not that many jobs right now but it still would be nice to sort them occasionally we do have a lot of openings um so you know if if we had what is that like 10 openings somewhere around there no just guessing um 10 openings plus another couple openings and faculty like that's that is enough openings that you know maybe you might want to sort it right um in my mind i'm just thinking like when i've gone before to sites to try to find a job it is it's a little bit annoying to have to scroll through a lot of things that i'm i'm not even interested in or qualified for to try to find you know the one thing especially if i've heard from someone like hey they're hiring you know somebody here and i go to check it out and i gotta scroll through all this stuff it's a lot nicer if i could just search or click a category and go right to it so if we're trying to attract candidates uh i'd rather get as many applications as possible here and the best way to do that is to make it easier so anyway let me know what you think am i overthinking this or not either way uh i don't know we've already categor made the categories we've made the taxonomies in wordpress so you know we may as well utilize them at the very least there'll be one less link that we have to include in the menu so we'll just say um you know employment opportunities or something like that as the link and i think that would uh that would be better hey jim yeah don't mess with the chords you unplug all this stuff all right so let's do that then so what we'll do here then is uh we're going to grab this is going to be simplified now because we're not going to do any filtering within our query we're going to leave that all up to the component so at we're just gonna grab everything so let's go let's clean this up a bit and uh let's get rid of this part we won't need this anymore and let's see we do need to slug we need the name i don't know if we'll what do we have now you know what they have these images but i don't i don't think these it's just the same image over and over occasionally we throw in a different one so i'm not i don't think images are necessary right now uh let's see what the big page looks like i wonder where they're pulling this from if this is a separate thing okay okay for now i'm not going to show any of this stuff uh we'll just leave it with the title and then we'll see what we have we'll see if we want to add some more in so basically we just need the name in the slug and we don't want faculty departments and we don't need where right because we just need jobs and we don't need this part actually that's it let's test out our let's test out our query first so we're going to go in here and use our little tool here so our graph graphy ql i don't know how you're supposed to pronounce that but there's an i in there so i'm gonna say graph eql and um let's see if this query works oh there you go getting saved again nope all right what did we do wrong name okay so evidently name is not an option okay so we can get the jobs which is definitely cool uh so we get the jobs and we can't use name let's see what we can use yep we can use title great all right cool is that all the jobs that we have i thought we had more where's that at whoa yeah we definitely have a lot more hmm okay i wonder if we have uh some type of like limit is 10 the default i'm gonna have to check the documentation for um that wp graphql plugin and see what what the defaults are for the number of posts it returns yeah okay but for now at least we can get some data back so we don't yeah we actually don't need all this right now we could take this down a little bit more here we go jobless okay slug let's faculty list item do we have i wonder if we could use the faculty list item yeah we're not doing any checks right now to make sure any of this content is coming in okay all right i'm thinking about making this a little bit more reusable uh you know what we do have some really specific things going on though all right i i hate making another component that's like so specific but actually you know what let's let's wait let's test it first so what we can do then is um instead of this let's just say what do we have okay this data so let's say um job let's call this job data jobs data and then in here we'll switch this up good job and we're actually going to get rid of most of this and we don't we don't need it to be like that see because our data is going to come back like this so it'll be data jobs edges and that's what we'll need so it'll just be data jobs edges okay so that's our jobs data that's what we're going to map over so each one is going to be a job we have our slug that'll work and then here we're going to do our let's see job node title we're just going to put this inside of an h1 let's do an h2 because that'll be big so let's add job node title and up here we're not using this so let's get rid of this and let's save both of these see if this works hopefully i didn't mess this up too much that it's broken now but we can go to let's let's see if the routes there i doubt the route is there um about hr faculty opening nope so that route's not there let's add the route in our server um actually let's i wonder if we have an hr spot already anyway i think that was it hr okay so we have our hr page um let's change this up so this is the default it just defaults to page but then we also want when we get faculty openings we want it to render from our new jobs list so we called it no we called it job list okay so we wanted to render to that and then with our type whoops our type should be okay because we're not actually using the type at all um and then for our id we need an id i don't think we'll need an id not yet at least okay so save that see at least if we can get it to to render hmm oh there we go it was the server is restarting all right so that's not working what do we do let's see what our error is which y'all can't see that here we go oh a graphql syntax error okay all right so i messed that up let's see let's see what this query is nah just trying to find a similar query to what we need i don't write queries often enough um to be good at them it seems like i'm always all right unexpected name jobs this would it did work for us here right yeah wait and see what we get oh it worked great i just see nikki just said extra set of braces needed yep that was it nice all right cool so what we have when we go here to faculty openings is a list of openings awesome really cool awesome so that works so i believe my timer went off again or at least it's close to it yeah it timer went off again so basically from here what i will do is i'll put a little title up here so we know what page we're on uh and then i'll add in some i don't know where i'll put them maybe on this side uh basically i'll add in something some options so that users can filter i'll figure out how to have more than 10 at once excuse me and then i'll add in routes so we're going to have a route for staff opening that'll go to the same place and then we'll just have a route for job openings and that's what we'll link to but just in case somebody had bookmarked this it'll still take them to the right place they just may need to click the button and then eventually you know as people get used to the new link you know we won't really get visits to the old links anymore um okay all right cool so i'll probably keep working on this a little bit so i can get it to a point where maybe um i can just make a commit i mean really at this point it does work so i got i mean i could commit this it's not like it's i'm committing it in a broken state um but i want to get back to your questions now and i'm gonna try to answer all your questions and uh then we're gonna wrap things up oh nikki said it still has no idea what a taxonomy is um let me all right so a taxonomy is just a category or a tag in um in wordpress so it's it's just a way to organize posts all right um dickie allen says i'm currently going through the free code camp curriculum uh and applied css still and i have gotten pretty far in a python udemy course i'm starting to understand objectoriented programming in python is there a good place to really find out what you should focus on like what skills give results in particular fields i'm not sure what i really want to do i like javascript though um i said like is there a site that covers specific languages and what you get out of them huh interesting uh i'm not i'm not sure that there's a site that does that just in general if you want to be in web development javascript's definitely the way to go you're not stuck with web development you can develop apps with react native and javascript there are ways to do machine learning with javascript there are even ways to do vr and ar stuff with javascript uh but in terms of like machine learning python seems to be the most popular if you wanted to do native apps i don't know how much java is still used but that's what you used to use and then with ios stuff you know maybe you might want to learn you know csharp and.net framework stuff so yeah so i don't know a site that lists all of that if anybody knows of anything like that it would actually be pretty useful uh so please let us know uh i hope hopefully says may you explain the registered taxonomy object the booleans and other values etc where are those i used to find all right let's check it out so register taxonomy so a lot of this is just extending what's already in wordpress core so you know we're not really like you know building up our own programming stuff here we are just telling wordpress you know hey um wordpress you already have this function called register taxonomy like here's here's all the arguments that that function takes to create a new taxonomy so you could see like i don't know if it's different terminology for python but like for javascript land like all right this is your function and all your arguments are within these um uh parentheses uh so first off you know we're saying the name uh job categories and then we have an array the second parameter here uh is okay what is this gonna apply to and so we give it an array of the slugs for each post type that we wanted to apply to and then the third parameter is an array of all these attributes that we would like it to have so you know all these attributes are options there even more than this but these are all options that we can set for our particular taxonomy that we wanted to have so you know for instance we want it to be available in the rest api we want it to be available through graphql so hopefully that explains a bit i don't know enough about wordpress core to like really go through more of it uh this top part here uh this is the labels array so like that gets inserted here so this one is just i mean you can see how it would be a mess to put it right in here so obviously like we we make this variable for that so the labels these all have to do with how you will display this in the ui uh the wordpress admin ui so these are just the names that we give to you know those different spots so that's why like um you know even though i had spelled category correctly down here and actually said job category when we looked in the ui it only spelled job and then when i tried to fix it it spelled job category but category was spelled wrong uh because you know this is just the display stuff all right let me know if if i didn't answer your question properly or if i if i misunderstood it um dickie also asked is there a good reference for what to charge clients uh if a figure would be good to charge less or to do stuff free at first but you don't want to kill the job market um yeah yeah uh so yeah in general like you you want to get experience right but you don't don't want to sell yourself short so yeah there when you first start out there are probably going to be times when you'll do work for less than you really want to do it but what what you're doing is you know basically you could consider yourself in a paid internship at that point because you're still learning and anything you get from a client is going to be better than just doing side projects on your own and not getting paid anything so you find a client that you you know maybe something that you think will be good for your portfolio and you know try to get what you can but at that point it's it's not necessarily about the money because you're trying to build yourself up to where you could actually make the money so if you need money you know right away you know then you may need to do some other jobs that are noncoding related to get the money i mean i i did uh when i was starting out um but you want to transition into hopefully like building so each new client you get you'll be able to charge a little bit more hopefully get into bigger projects you know more steady work uh but you you got to build somewhere so you got to start up building your portfolio so that you can justify your price to the client so that you can prove to the client that you're going to bring value to them based on your past projects so you can point to this and say you know i did this website for this small business it was similar to yours their profits increased by this much you know after my the website launched something like that right if you can should prove that then it'll be worth so much so even if you didn't get paid that much to do it the first time after that you can quantify your value the value of your work to clients um and then what you're going to get paid is not going to be based on you know what somebody thinks you're worth it's going to be based on the value that your work will bring to them as in you know if you do this project for them they will make an extra i don't know five thousand dollars a month right then your work is worth close to five thousand dollars a month right because they're going to come out on top from that investment hopefully that makes sense i mean there's a lot of different uh ways to approach pricing that's just kind of one of the ways but like i said when you're just starting out the idea should be figure out what you like to do and build up a good portfolio and and then it's going to be a heck of a lot easier to get those higher paying clients and make sure you're really professional like make a good name for yourself especially locally if word gets out that you're not reliable you'll have a much harder time getting work um you know it's if you're trying to get remote work from different places you know maybe it won't get out but you know with the internet like you don't want to ruin your reputation right away just because you think oh well this this guy's not you know this client's not paying me that much anyway um no he's you know be professional no matter what you're making uh because you never know what kind of referrals you could get or what kind of damage it could do if you get bad reviews uh chad says do you have videos for creating custom themes for wordpress um actually no i um i've never done a custom wordpress theme video so usually i don't make wordpress themes i just use their rest api or graphql with wordpress to pull out the data and i just sometimes i just delete the themes i don't use them at all but i mean some of these things like being able to make new post types and um taxonomies you know they could definitely uh help you if you're building a theme world says you should be vice president of dev you know what they should make that position and give it to me that would be awesome alpha says how cool is visual studio codes integrated terminal and debug console huh oh yeah for sure i love it i love it so convenient especially when i'm trying to stream it's all there right on one screen i don't have to flip around between screens hey harshit made it um harsha says i'm busy these days tons of schoolwork that's why i'm inactive yeah i figured i figured you had school i remember you telling me so yeah don't worry about it school comes first for sure um francis says asks uh cavs or warriors um i don't know i don't i don't really have a basketball team so like growing up there's no basketball team close to me uh i i usually side with like all pittsburgh teams because i grew up close to pittsburgh but they don't have a basketball team so it was never a big thing for me uh i guess if i had to pick i would say cavs because that they're like as close as i have to a hometown uh nba team all right stacy says hello hey uh hey stacy how's it going world says how do you avoid getting tired of coding i can only code like 30 minutes a day hmm um i don't know i guess i mean two probably two things like one i do enjoy coding no there's three three three reasons why i can code for a long time one i enjoy coding number two i have years of experience of coding for long periods of time so i've built up my mind to be able to handle that right um because i i think it's like your body right you couldn't just go out and run for hours and hours if you haven't run that much before right it's the same way with coding like you couldn't just sit down and code for hours and hours your brain would be really tired right so and the third reason is uh money right i have to pay the bills so if i'm gonna get paid to code all day like i'm gonna code all day because if i don't like my family is not gonna have anywhere to live or they're not gonna have anything to eat uh my kids won't be able to um you know have any any toys or games or anything like that uh so that's also if all else fails the fact that i have to do it for my job will you know keep me coding okay nikki was saying that page also needs that dangerously set html does it you know bring it in it does yeah yeah i'll have to do that i mean it for for right now i just wanted to make sure that that query worked um but yeah you're right it when i start styling that for real it's it's going to be um uh dangerously dangerously set in her html to avoid this kind of stuff let's see okay is it all right so i guess at some point you couldn't hear me sorry about that it's possible maybe i covered up the mic i hopefully it's all right now um gabriel says how can i learn javascript uh there's a lot of different resources you can use to learn javascript i recommend checking out free code camp so freecodecamp.org will steer you in the right direction you can also it depends on how you like to learn uh if you like to read books to learn uh check out the book series called you don't know js and if you also um eloquent javascript is a good one and then if you like youtube videos uh the free code camp youtube channel has some good tutorial videos as well all right uh question is uh please could you clarify how to jump from html to sas in visual studio code uh csspeak only works with css um scss less in sublime plugin go to css definition it allows me to jump to sas thanks in advance um i have no idea how to do that uh with with sas so i don't use that feature in visual studio code so if anybody else uses that please let us know in the in the chat but uh yeah unfortunately i can't help you with that because i've i don't use it uh yamamoto says house how's the health insurance in the developer world um i don't know my health insurance is pretty good and i would do work for university so it's a little different it's not like a tech company or anything most of the job descriptions for developer jobs here in the united states that i've seen do include health insurance so i'm not sure about you know what it's like in other countries but at least in the united states you know you should probably expect to get health insurance from a developer job and it it seems rare that insurance isn't offered uh matt dutcher says i think that the you don't know js has an entire series on github for free uh yeah yeah for sure it's it's for free so both of those books that i mentioned you can get online for free um hopefully says usually in a wellmade site how much of it is custommade and how much depends on frameworks and apis um it just depends it depends um and custommade is not always better uh you know there's frameworks are are very helpful and uh they are been tested in a lot of situations so uh they can definitely be less buggy than something custommade they have more kids here so let me let me switch it up there we go there's uh raphael and gemma you wanna say hi all right so yeah i mean i would um i mean it entirely depends like if you see a wellmade site maybe it's custom maybe it's all frameworks uh it's just the quality of the site is not dependent on how much is custom and how much this frameworks and in my opinion john hanson says uh free code can't put up your how live coding changed my life youtube video on their channel oh cool cool uh i thought they might put that up i didn't know they did though that's awesome mad duchess says well cuties yeah and you have a happy father yeah yeah i love being a father um all right and i've gotten to the the end of the chat uh so thank you all so much for hanging out with me uh while i do my work and catching my mistakes uh which is super helpful and it's the end of the week so um i don't think i'll be doing any streaming over the weekend uh you never know if i do it maybe just might be something real lowkey in my own channel which you can find a link to my channel in the description also i promise i wouldn't mention this very often i haven't talked about it all week for a week at least i did start a patreon page so uh you can find the link from my youtube channel uh in the description to some of my newer videos and things so uh if you're interested in maybe supporting me only if you have a little extra despair but if you do please check out my patreon channel and i'm i'm not going to spam you with requests i'll mention it occasionally but it would really help me out to be able to do things like get better equipment for streaming or potentially dedicate more of my time to creating content for you all so um yeah so any little bit helps i really appreciate it and if you have any um any suggestions for things that you'd like to see on my patreon like reward levels and things like that let me know because i'm definitely new at it and i'm not sure what you all want i'm just kind of guessing at this point so let me know um all right cool so i'll see you all again uh on monday and until then have a wonderful weekend
