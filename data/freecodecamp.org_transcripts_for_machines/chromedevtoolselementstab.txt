all right in this video we are going to talk about the elements tab of google developer tools using the elements tab you can do a lot with html and css changing some other website while you're in the browser it's pretty cool so i had a camper suggest to me to work on this page which is ian mckellen's actual official home page it could use some css and html help we're really just gonna mess around with it so one way to get to the console or to the really just going to mess around with it one way to open up the developer tools especially when you're looking in elements is to right click and hit inspect element whatever you right clicked that's the element that it's going to inspect so here on this left side of cascading information it pulled up exactly all the information the html and over here it's all the style elements that apply to it let's go ahead and change that awesome picture of sir ian mckellen to this picture of a cat in a turkey costume so i'm just clicking here in the src and i'm just gonna paste my link from the other link and suddenly we are looking at a cat on the home page of mckellen.com additionally so say we go down here let's make this color not be blue anymore we're going to click inspect element and instead of changing over on this left cascading side we're going to change in here and see you can see it says background color if i double click that let's do aaa bbb which turns out to be this lovely light purple color so suddenly we've changed all this kind of stuff and we can even change text so if i want it to say i i'm continuing to right click and hit inspect element here it says what's new instead let's have it say free code camp is the bomb dot com there we go and now free code camp is the bomb.com is what that first little highlightable box says so that's pretty cool um additionally i'm going to move everything over to the right hand side now there's this kind of box over here that says margin border padding that's a really quick and easy way to edit those specific attributes of whatever you're looking at um it says margin border padding that's a really quick way to edit those attributes within the browser again you can't save any of this within the browser without changing some some settings um let's inspect element of this cat photo let's have it have a border of 10 pixels let's just see what happens there didn't save border 10 margin let's try margin 100 on the top so here it was the top number if i do it on the left hand side 100 it's there right hand side 100 bottom 100 so really all i'm doing is editing it in real time which is super cool padding is the same you can do this for anything that you're looking at on the web page you can edit it all here it is important to remember that cascading as far as what takes precedence so if there's a class that has an attribute that is applied that's still going to be more important to the browser than if you just apply it to all divs if there's a div class of top box and that has a certain color that's going to override any other just general div things that's the same as regular css those rules still apply here so now finally we're going to erase all of our amazing efforts here if we refresh everything goes back to normal so that's the elements page have fun playing around
