hi in this video we are going to be talking about chips and something called Moors law you've probably noticed over the past 10 or so years that if you're going to go buy an MP3 player you can get a lot more storage for a lot less price and you probably have even done the thing where you're at the store and you're like well I could get one now or I could wait six months and the price is going to be in half which might sound ridiculous but this is actually a trend that's been happening for a long time let's talk about what makes a chip now a chip is just full of these little things called transistors which are switches that can either be a one or a zero it's a common theme you've heard a lot about right so all these little transistors fit onto a chip and that's how it holds information it's stored in ones and zeros what makes these faster is the amount of transistors the transistors mean one or zero they're little switches that can hold just a one or a zero in their information and the amount of transistors they can fit doubles every two years since 1965 now what's most important about Moore's Law is that it's making technology more accessible and more affordable to everyone
