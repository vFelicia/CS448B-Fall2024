00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:09 - kids coding playground
00:10 - today we'll be doing a two-player
00:12 - ping-pong game so
00:14 - the objective of the game is to keep on
00:16 - hitting the ball back and forth
00:18 - and you try not to let your opponent hit
00:21 - in the back
00:22 - and when the ball touches this edge or
00:24 - this edge
00:25 - then you get a point so you have this
00:27 - point and
00:28 - this side's point and with that and then
00:30 - the first player to get seven points
00:33 - will win the game so let's go
00:36 - we will be learning these following
00:38 - concepts today variables
00:40 - loops broadcasting messages sensing
00:43 - collision which is like
00:44 - sensing blocks and pick random
00:48 - so i will be showing you guys the game i
00:50 - have my brother here with me
00:51 - hey to show us the game so let me make
00:54 - it bigger
00:56 - so you want me arrow keys sure i'll be
00:58 - here okay
01:01 - first of seven points and i even added
01:05 - some music
01:13 - so you just keep on oh no you like going
01:20 - so i'm just gonna let myself lose or
01:22 - something
01:23 - i wanna um demonstrate what happens when
01:27 - you
01:28 - uh lose
01:32 - so when the ball when the other person
01:35 - gets seven points
01:37 - on you then that means you will get uh
01:39 - you'll say the other pla
01:40 - either if the player if it's the player
01:43 - one that wins so say player one wins
01:45 - so this side is player one this side is
01:47 - player two
01:50 - hit it back
01:55 - okay one more point and then i'll show
01:58 - you guys how to make the game
02:01 - okay so say player two wins which is
02:03 - this team
02:04 - so i'll be making a new project so i can
02:08 - show you guys step by step how to make
02:09 - it so let's make a new project
02:12 - so let's make two variables in the
02:16 - beginning
02:17 - we will need a variable called player1
02:20 - score
02:23 - one score and another variable called
02:26 - player two score
02:34 - player two score so you have the two
02:36 - variables
02:38 - um we want we don't need this so you can
02:40 - just delete it the my variable
02:41 - you don't need that delete the scratch
02:43 - count we won't need that as well
02:45 - and you can double click on this to make
02:47 - it like that
02:51 - and next we'll be doing the backdrop so
02:54 - for the backdrop
02:55 - i'm gonna put some code for it so this
02:57 - is the color i did
02:59 - um for my last backdrop 39 color 100
03:03 - percent saturation and 40 brightness so
03:06 - get this color and then we need no
03:09 - outline
03:11 - so we're going to get the box thing uh
03:14 - and just
03:14 - draw a square like
03:18 - so there you go so i got the square
03:23 - this is the backdrop um and next we're
03:26 - gonna
03:27 - get some music i guess uh
03:30 - let's go get a song you guys can pick
03:32 - any song you guys want
03:34 - i'm just gonna pick the song i used this
03:36 - one
03:39 - so just kind of one flag clicked forever
03:42 - loop
03:44 - uh play the sound until done that's it
03:49 - and we will need two paddles
03:52 - so there's a paddle sprite just take
03:55 - two of those just make one and then
03:57 - duplicate it
03:59 - and go into the sprite we're going to
04:01 - make it a vertical
04:04 - oops select this thing
04:10 - so you can actually um just
04:14 - turn it vertical
04:18 - like that okay i know it's not perfect
04:23 - actually just duplicate this so then you
04:26 - already have an
04:27 - uh you already have a uh
04:31 - you already have like a vertical one so
04:34 - there you go two paddles we'll also need
04:37 - the ball
04:38 - let's get the ball sprite let's go here
04:41 - get the ball
04:42 - you want to get the this ball just going
04:45 - to get this one
04:47 - and next we're going to work on the ball
04:49 - code
04:50 - so one flag clicked
04:54 - actually no one yeah one flag clicked
04:57 - you want to set all the variables to
04:59 - zero set the player one score and set
05:01 - the player two score to zero
05:04 - uh set the size to forty percent so it
05:06 - won't be too big
05:09 - and we want it to go to zero zero the
05:12 - center position
05:15 - and then we want it to point in
05:16 - direction of 45
05:19 - so point in direction of 45
05:23 - it's going to be like top right
05:27 - so then we can bro then we're going to
05:28 - broadcast a new message
05:31 - called start game
05:38 - so that start game so when this receives
05:41 - start game
05:44 - then we can um execute
05:47 - all this code so get a forever loop
05:50 - move ten steps if on edge bounce
05:55 - that's the first part and then you get
05:58 - if it's touching the paddle one and
06:02 - touching the paddle
06:04 - the first paddle not the second paddle
06:05 - so if it's touching paddle
06:08 - then we can start sound pop to make some
06:11 - sound
06:12 - sound effects i guess turn
06:15 - we need to turn so it'll turn a random
06:18 - degree so it'll go
06:20 - different angles and directions you can
06:22 - turn pick
06:23 - random 170 to 190 degrees so
06:26 - let's get that pick random
06:30 - 170 to 190
06:35 - degrees so let's
06:38 - uh duplicate this
06:42 - put this under here instead of paddle
06:45 - we'll do paddle 2.
06:48 - and we'll start the pop turn this is all
06:50 - the same
06:52 - and then we'll get another if then
06:54 - statement
06:56 - if the
07:00 - x position is greater than 230
07:05 - so that means if the x position is
07:06 - greater than like
07:08 - 230 230 is like right here that means it
07:10 - touches the edge i guess
07:12 - so if the x position is greater than 230
07:17 - then we will change
07:23 - the players one score by one go back to
07:26 - the zero zero
07:28 - go back to the middle
07:31 - and wait three seconds and we'll start
07:33 - it over again
07:38 - we can duplicate this
07:42 - put this under here instead of this we
07:45 - will get the
07:48 - a less than symbol so less than symbol
07:50 - put that in here
07:51 - if the x position is less than negative
07:54 - 230
07:55 - so if it's less than this position like
07:57 - negative 230s right here
07:59 - then we can change the player to score
08:01 - by one
08:03 - go back to zero zero and wait three
08:05 - seconds so
08:07 - i just scroll around to let you guys see
08:09 - that's all the code we have for now
08:12 - obviously it does nothing yet except
08:15 - bounce around i guess
08:16 - now we can work on the paddle code
08:20 - so we can actually make the paddle a bit
08:22 - smaller like 75 percent
08:24 - size and same with the paddle 2 let's
08:27 - make it 75
08:28 - size so we got the two paddles
08:32 - let's get coding on it so when i receive
08:36 - start game
08:38 - we'll get a forever loop
08:41 - if on edge bounce
08:44 - so you cannot go down here and hide down
08:46 - here
08:48 - this is for player one so we'll do w the
08:51 - w key and the s
08:52 - key so if the key w is pressed
08:56 - which is the up if the w key is pressed
08:59 - then we can change the y by eight
09:02 - change y by eight
09:06 - and we can duplicate this if the s
09:09 - key is clicked which is down
09:12 - so when the s key is pressed we'll go
09:14 - negative eight
09:18 - and then we want to set the x and y
09:19 - position so i have the coordinates
09:21 - written down we will do
09:24 - negative 200
09:27 - and y zero so it will be right here
09:31 - about
09:31 - right here that's negative 200 y zero so
09:36 - then we'll get another if-then statement
09:38 - if
09:40 - the player one score is equal to
09:43 - seven i'm doing seven score
09:46 - as the winning you can do any number if
09:50 - you want
09:51 - uh if the player one score is equal to
09:54 - seven
09:55 - then we can broadcast a message called
09:58 - player one wins
10:00 - player one wins
10:04 - and then for the paddle 2 it'll be
10:07 - similar code
10:08 - we'll just set the x and y position
10:12 - to 200
10:15 - x so it will be in the y
10:19 - zero so it will be somewhere right here
10:22 - and then we can pretty much just drag
10:23 - this
10:24 - drag and drop it into the paddle too so
10:27 - we'll get the same code
10:29 - and then instead of w it'll be the up
10:31 - arrow key
10:32 - and instead of the s it'll be the down
10:34 - arrow key
10:36 - and instead of player one score it'll be
10:38 - player two score
10:41 - player two score and we'll broadcast a
10:43 - new message
10:44 - called player 2 wins
10:50 - player 2 wins and then we'll also make a
10:53 - new
10:54 - sprites paint a new sprite
10:58 - we will make two costumes for i'm gonna
11:01 - make this
11:02 - first one red so i'm just gonna type
11:05 - player one wins
11:11 - um player one wins make it a bit bigger
11:14 - a little bit smaller actually so player
11:17 - one wins
11:18 - i'm just gonna duplicate this we're
11:20 - gonna do it in the same
11:22 - sprite just two costumes and i'm gonna
11:24 - rename the costume to
11:25 - player one win
11:30 - just duplicate this
11:33 - instead of player one when i'm just
11:35 - going to name this to player two
11:39 - and then i'm just gonna double click on
11:42 - this
11:44 - i'm gonna make i'm gonna change the text
11:46 - to green
11:48 - to tell the difference so instead we're
11:51 - gonna write player
11:52 - two wins
11:57 - so we have two costumes player one and
11:58 - player two wins okay
12:02 - so let's go to the code for it so when
12:04 - flat clicked we want to go to zero
12:06 - zero go to the center
12:10 - and we want to hide so when it receives
12:14 - the
12:14 - player one win then we will show
12:19 - switch costume to player one win because
12:24 - the player 1 wins
12:25 - and we'll stop all
12:28 - just duplicate this for player 2 wins
12:32 - just click player 2 wins changes to
12:35 - player 2 win
12:37 - so that's all the code let's play it
12:40 - i'm playing by myself right now so
12:43 - it's not that easy
12:46 - [Music]
12:49 - so what happened to the paddle so guys i
12:52 - actually found out the bug
12:55 - set this to left and right so it won't
12:58 - flip so as you could see
13:00 - the paddle flip to the left a little
13:03 - so just do this left and right so now it
13:06 - will not flip
13:08 - save your project now i'm going to go
13:11 - full screen
13:12 - and show you guys oops
13:15 - i'm playing by myself right now so it's
13:17 - kind of hard i get two screens at
13:20 - two two places at the same time
13:30 - yeah so let me just make one of the
13:35 - teams lose
13:50 - [Music]
13:53 - and finally i'll say player one wins
13:56 - whichever
13:57 - team wins so yeah there you have it
14:00 - uh two player ping pong game and we
14:03 - rename it
14:04 - two player palm game
14:07 - player pong game so
14:10 - thank you guys for watching please like
14:12 - share and subscribe
14:13 - and i'll see you guys in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today we'll be doing a twoplayer pingpong game so the objective of the game is to keep on hitting the ball back and forth and you try not to let your opponent hit in the back and when the ball touches this edge or this edge then you get a point so you have this point and this side's point and with that and then the first player to get seven points will win the game so let's go we will be learning these following concepts today variables loops broadcasting messages sensing collision which is like sensing blocks and pick random so i will be showing you guys the game i have my brother here with me hey to show us the game so let me make it bigger so you want me arrow keys sure i'll be here okay first of seven points and i even added some music so you just keep on oh no you like going so i'm just gonna let myself lose or something i wanna um demonstrate what happens when you uh lose so when the ball when the other person gets seven points on you then that means you will get uh you'll say the other pla either if the player if it's the player one that wins so say player one wins so this side is player one this side is player two hit it back okay one more point and then i'll show you guys how to make the game okay so say player two wins which is this team so i'll be making a new project so i can show you guys step by step how to make it so let's make a new project so let's make two variables in the beginning we will need a variable called player1 score one score and another variable called player two score player two score so you have the two variables um we want we don't need this so you can just delete it the my variable you don't need that delete the scratch count we won't need that as well and you can double click on this to make it like that and next we'll be doing the backdrop so for the backdrop i'm gonna put some code for it so this is the color i did um for my last backdrop 39 color 100 percent saturation and 40 brightness so get this color and then we need no outline so we're going to get the box thing uh and just draw a square like so there you go so i got the square this is the backdrop um and next we're gonna get some music i guess uh let's go get a song you guys can pick any song you guys want i'm just gonna pick the song i used this one so just kind of one flag clicked forever loop uh play the sound until done that's it and we will need two paddles so there's a paddle sprite just take two of those just make one and then duplicate it and go into the sprite we're going to make it a vertical oops select this thing so you can actually um just turn it vertical like that okay i know it's not perfect actually just duplicate this so then you already have an uh you already have a uh you already have like a vertical one so there you go two paddles we'll also need the ball let's get the ball sprite let's go here get the ball you want to get the this ball just going to get this one and next we're going to work on the ball code so one flag clicked actually no one yeah one flag clicked you want to set all the variables to zero set the player one score and set the player two score to zero uh set the size to forty percent so it won't be too big and we want it to go to zero zero the center position and then we want it to point in direction of 45 so point in direction of 45 it's going to be like top right so then we can bro then we're going to broadcast a new message called start game so that start game so when this receives start game then we can um execute all this code so get a forever loop move ten steps if on edge bounce that's the first part and then you get if it's touching the paddle one and touching the paddle the first paddle not the second paddle so if it's touching paddle then we can start sound pop to make some sound sound effects i guess turn we need to turn so it'll turn a random degree so it'll go different angles and directions you can turn pick random 170 to 190 degrees so let's get that pick random 170 to 190 degrees so let's uh duplicate this put this under here instead of paddle we'll do paddle 2. and we'll start the pop turn this is all the same and then we'll get another if then statement if the x position is greater than 230 so that means if the x position is greater than like 230 230 is like right here that means it touches the edge i guess so if the x position is greater than 230 then we will change the players one score by one go back to the zero zero go back to the middle and wait three seconds and we'll start it over again we can duplicate this put this under here instead of this we will get the a less than symbol so less than symbol put that in here if the x position is less than negative 230 so if it's less than this position like negative 230s right here then we can change the player to score by one go back to zero zero and wait three seconds so i just scroll around to let you guys see that's all the code we have for now obviously it does nothing yet except bounce around i guess now we can work on the paddle code so we can actually make the paddle a bit smaller like 75 percent size and same with the paddle 2 let's make it 75 size so we got the two paddles let's get coding on it so when i receive start game we'll get a forever loop if on edge bounce so you cannot go down here and hide down here this is for player one so we'll do w the w key and the s key so if the key w is pressed which is the up if the w key is pressed then we can change the y by eight change y by eight and we can duplicate this if the s key is clicked which is down so when the s key is pressed we'll go negative eight and then we want to set the x and y position so i have the coordinates written down we will do negative 200 and y zero so it will be right here about right here that's negative 200 y zero so then we'll get another ifthen statement if the player one score is equal to seven i'm doing seven score as the winning you can do any number if you want uh if the player one score is equal to seven then we can broadcast a message called player one wins player one wins and then for the paddle 2 it'll be similar code we'll just set the x and y position to 200 x so it will be in the y zero so it will be somewhere right here and then we can pretty much just drag this drag and drop it into the paddle too so we'll get the same code and then instead of w it'll be the up arrow key and instead of the s it'll be the down arrow key and instead of player one score it'll be player two score player two score and we'll broadcast a new message called player 2 wins player 2 wins and then we'll also make a new sprites paint a new sprite we will make two costumes for i'm gonna make this first one red so i'm just gonna type player one wins um player one wins make it a bit bigger a little bit smaller actually so player one wins i'm just gonna duplicate this we're gonna do it in the same sprite just two costumes and i'm gonna rename the costume to player one win just duplicate this instead of player one when i'm just going to name this to player two and then i'm just gonna double click on this i'm gonna make i'm gonna change the text to green to tell the difference so instead we're gonna write player two wins so we have two costumes player one and player two wins okay so let's go to the code for it so when flat clicked we want to go to zero zero go to the center and we want to hide so when it receives the player one win then we will show switch costume to player one win because the player 1 wins and we'll stop all just duplicate this for player 2 wins just click player 2 wins changes to player 2 win so that's all the code let's play it i'm playing by myself right now so it's not that easy so what happened to the paddle so guys i actually found out the bug set this to left and right so it won't flip so as you could see the paddle flip to the left a little so just do this left and right so now it will not flip save your project now i'm going to go full screen and show you guys oops i'm playing by myself right now so it's kind of hard i get two screens at two two places at the same time yeah so let me just make one of the teams lose and finally i'll say player one wins whichever team wins so yeah there you have it uh two player ping pong game and we rename it two player palm game player pong game so thank you guys for watching please like share and subscribe and i'll see you guys in the next video
