00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys the kids coding
00:08 - playroom here today we're doing a new
00:09 - project in scratch we're working on the
00:11 - basketball game or scratch so basically
00:14 - the point of the game is you move around
00:15 - using the arrow keys
00:17 - and then you click the space bar to
00:18 - throw the basketball and you try to get
00:19 - into the hoop and then when you get into
00:21 - the hoop you'll get score as you can see
00:23 - so i'm going to play the project and
00:24 - show you guys how it works so
00:27 - we also have some music in the
00:28 - background so you move around using the
00:29 - cat you can also jump using the cat so
00:32 - you jump
00:33 - as you can see you make a score
00:36 - and as you can see if you shoot under
00:37 - the nets you cannot make a score like
00:39 - that
00:41 - so you can see that
00:45 - as you can see you can't make a score
00:46 - from under the nets
00:48 - one more
00:50 - there you go so
00:52 - it's pretty simple for a basketball game
00:54 - so yeah that's pretty much it for the
00:55 - game so now let's get on to the coding
00:57 - so let's start a new project so new
00:59 - projects
01:00 - okay so in our new project we're going
01:02 - to be using the cat so we're going to
01:03 - rename it to cap and then we rename the
01:05 - project to basketball
01:07 - basketball and then right here we can
01:10 - get some sprites so right here we have
01:11 - the net sprite so the hoop we actually
01:14 - drew this
01:15 - and we have to get our basketball sprite
01:17 - so we're gonna get a basketball right
01:18 - here
01:19 - basketball right here we'll take the
01:20 - basketball and then we'll resize it to
01:22 - 125 because it's a little bit too small
01:25 - and then we'll draw our hit box so hit
01:27 - box it's just going to be a small
01:29 - uh square so we take out the outline as
01:31 - well so no outline and then we're just
01:33 - going to zoom in
01:34 - hold down shift so then get a perfect
01:36 - square
01:37 - oops didn't have the tool selected hold
01:40 - down shift
01:42 - so about that big that should be good
01:44 - enough
01:44 - so the hitbox is going to be like on top
01:47 - of the basketball hoop so then it will
01:49 - be able to uh detect if the basketball
01:51 - is going through and you'll score
01:53 - and then next week go into her hoop as
01:56 - you can see her hoop is under the center
01:57 - thing because we want to put our hitbox
01:59 - about at this position
02:01 - so then it will
02:03 - look like it's actually going through
02:04 - the hoop and scoring and then for a
02:06 - basketball hoop it's pretty simple to
02:07 - draw we just have a outline of
02:10 - red
02:11 - and then we use the 20 thickness of the
02:13 - line and then we draw a line right there
02:15 - and then right here we have three lines
02:17 - down
02:17 - and then two lines across and they're
02:19 - all whites to make it look like a net
02:21 - so here we have our basketball hoop
02:24 - so yes if you want to draw it you can
02:26 - draw but it's also going to be in our
02:28 - google drive in the description below
02:30 - and then next
02:31 - we can rename this let's rename it to a
02:34 - box so there's right it's going to be
02:35 - hitbox
02:36 - and then we can get our backdrop so
02:39 - we got the brick wall background i think
02:41 - wall so we have the wall one we're gonna
02:43 - use this backdrop
02:45 - okay so now we have all our assets into
02:46 - our game let's get on to the coding so
02:48 - inside our cat we're going to first
02:50 - start with the movement of the cat so
02:52 - when green flag is clicked we are going
02:54 - to set the y velocity
02:57 - set y velocity we're going to make a new
02:59 - variable so we're going to
03:01 - make a new variable y velocity it's for
03:04 - this cat only for the sprite only
03:07 - by y velocity for this right only
03:10 - so we have y velocity we're going to set
03:12 - the y velocity to zero
03:14 - and then we're gonna forever
03:16 - here forever loop we're going to get
03:17 - change y velocity by the y y position by
03:20 - the y velocity so we're going to change
03:22 - the y
03:23 - by the y velocity
03:26 - that and then forever
03:28 - uh we have that forever so next we're
03:30 - going to get if then statement so if
03:33 - so if the position is greater than
03:35 - negative 130 so negative 130 is about
03:38 - down here somewhere so we want the cat
03:40 - to be somewhere down here so we're going
03:41 - to get if
03:42 - the position is greater than
03:45 - negative 130 so
03:46 - we're gonna get the y position
03:50 - oops accidentally checked it
03:52 - in the y position and then if it's
03:53 - greater than negative 130 meaning it's
03:55 - in the air so
03:56 - i'm gonna get if it's greater than
03:58 - position negative 130 over here
04:01 - that means it's in the air then we're
04:02 - going to change the y velocity by
04:04 - negative two meaning it will come back
04:06 - down so we're going to change the
04:07 - variable y velocity by negative two
04:10 - and then next we're going to get an if
04:12 - then statement
04:14 - if y velocity
04:16 - y position
04:18 - is less than negative negative 130
04:20 - meaning it's on the ground so we're
04:22 - going to get y position if it's less
04:23 - than negative 130.
04:26 - if it's like that then we're going to
04:28 - set the y back to negative 130
04:31 - set y back to 130 negative 130
04:36 - and then we're gonna set the y
04:38 - y velocity to zero
04:41 - next we're going to do with the left and
04:42 - right movement so we're going to when
04:44 - green flag clicks we're going to do this
04:46 - when we fly click we're going to get to
04:47 - forever
04:48 - we're going to forever if
04:51 - if then so if the left arrow key is
04:53 - pressed so if key left is pressed
04:56 - left arrow key is pressed then we're
04:58 - going to point direction of negative 90
05:02 - in direction negative 90.
05:04 - and then next we're gonna move eight
05:06 - steps
05:07 - so we're gonna make the
05:09 - cat move eight steps duplicate this and
05:12 - then we're gonna get a if right arrows
05:13 - key is pressed then we're gonna change
05:15 - the direction to 90 point version 90 and
05:17 - move eight steps we'll keep that
05:19 - okay so now we have all this code we're
05:21 - gonna get onto the
05:23 - left and right we're going to make it
05:24 - look like he's walking so we're going to
05:26 - hit the one group like clicked
05:27 - go down here we're going to get one
05:29 - group like clicked forever
05:30 - if
05:31 - uh
05:33 - left or right arrow key is pressed so we
05:34 - can use the or so
05:36 - or
05:37 - if key left is being pressed or right so
05:40 - we're going to get the key left
05:42 - arrow or duplicate let's get it right
05:46 - so if either one of those are pressed
05:48 - then we're going to do next costume.1
05:50 - seconds
05:51 - just so it'll look like it's walking
05:55 - so we have the
05:56 - 8.1
05:57 - and then
05:59 - next we have one more last bit of code
06:00 - so we're going to go over here
06:02 - uh we're going to do if up arrow key is
06:04 - pressed when up is pressed
06:07 - then we're going to if the y position is
06:09 - equal to negative 130 meaning the cat is
06:11 - going to be at negative 130 so we want
06:13 - the cat to be negative 130 we're going
06:15 - to set it right here
06:17 - 30 so
06:19 - so negative 130 so if the up arrow
06:22 - uh if the up arrow is pressed and
06:25 - if
06:26 - y
06:26 - position is equal to 1 negative 130
06:31 - so 5
06:32 - position my position is equal to
06:35 - negative 130 we're going to uh set the y
06:37 - velocity
06:38 - our variable y velocity we're going to
06:40 - set that to uh
06:42 - just said it's 20 so he's going to have
06:44 - like jump 20
06:46 - up in the air so we're gonna next see up
06:48 - here we can change the y by y velocity
06:50 - that means it'll be changing by 20. so
06:52 - let's play our code so right here we can
06:54 - see the cat is moving and of course it's
06:56 - upside down uh really simple to fix this
06:59 - just click this button and then it'll
07:00 - just right be right side up so where you
07:03 - can use the set rotation styles of left
07:05 - and right
07:06 - so as you can see our cat is moving
07:10 - jump as you can see now the cat can jump
07:12 - because we have our code in for the
07:14 - jumping physics as well okay so now our
07:16 - cat is jumping we can on to our
07:18 - basketball so
07:20 - on to our basketball go into our
07:22 - basketball we're going to get in a
07:23 - one-year flight clicked when we're on
07:25 - flick we're going to make a new variable
07:27 - and the name is score for all sprites so
07:30 - we're going to set the score to zero
07:32 - and then we're going to hide
07:34 - and hide the basketball beginning
07:36 - and then only when the spacebar is
07:38 - pressed then we'll show the basketball
07:39 - so
07:40 - when spacebar is pressed so when space
07:42 - keys press we're gonna do space then
07:44 - we're gonna make a new variable and then
07:45 - we're gonna name it made basket so this
07:48 - is to detect if the uh basketball has
07:50 - been made inside the basket
07:52 - made basket for this sprite only so meat
07:54 - basket for this right only i'm gonna set
07:57 - made basket to note so
07:59 - it's not gonna be in the basket
08:01 - obviously in the beginning and then
08:02 - we're gonna set
08:04 - the direction
08:05 - of the cat which is a new variable
08:07 - so we make a new variable we're gonna
08:08 - name it direction
08:10 - of cat so direction of cats
08:13 - it's for all sprites so we're gonna set
08:15 - direction of cats
08:16 - and then work as soon as the game starts
08:18 - as soon as you press the space bar we're
08:20 - going to get the position of where the
08:21 - ball is the direction of it so then it
08:24 - will go in a certain direction if you
08:25 - don't do this the ball will only shoot
08:26 - towards one side so we want to make it
08:28 - make sure the ball can shoot towards the
08:30 - left and right so we're going to get the
08:33 - this one this blocker here in sensing so
08:35 - we're going to get the cat and the
08:37 - direction so
08:38 - that's what we have to do and then we're
08:40 - gonna make it play the sound uh
08:43 - pop or you can do basketball bounce
08:45 - whatever uh we're gonna do pop whenever
08:47 - you shoot the ball and then we're gonna
08:49 - make the sprite go to the cat so
08:51 - the ball will always go to the cat
08:54 - and after that we're gonna set the y
08:56 - velocity to 24 so that's going to be the
08:58 - y velocity of the ball
09:00 - set y velocity
09:02 - y velocity
09:04 - all right we have to make a new variable
09:06 - oh yeah i forgot we have to make a new
09:08 - variable called y velocity
09:10 - for the sprite only
09:12 - it's also for the sprite only so
09:15 - we have y velocity
09:20 - i don't know why but is sometimes laggy
09:22 - or glitchy sometimes it doesn't show up
09:23 - when i made the variable i have to leave
09:25 - and come back so here we have the y
09:27 - velocity variable um again it's for the
09:30 - sprite only so we're going to set our y
09:32 - velocity
09:33 - y velocity and then we're going to set
09:35 - it to 24. that's gonna be it
09:37 - from this uh for the basketball and then
09:39 - we're going to point direction of the
09:40 - direction of the cat so it's going to
09:42 - point in the direction of
09:44 - the direction of the cat right here you
09:45 - see and see me set the variable to that
09:48 - um sensing block so best sensing
09:51 - direction of the cat is now the variable
09:53 - so we're going to just put the variable
09:54 - right there
09:55 - and then we're going to show the ball
09:58 - and then next we're going to repeat
10:00 - until so repeat
10:02 - until gonna repeat until and then we're
10:05 - gonna get
10:06 - if the y position is less than negative
10:08 - 130
10:09 - so if the y position
10:12 - y position is less than negative 130
10:15 - meaning it's on the ground then we're
10:18 - going to
10:19 - repeat until so if it's like that then
10:21 - we're going to get if else statement so
10:23 - if
10:24 - so basically we're going to repeat the
10:25 - ball until it's on the ground so we're
10:27 - going to repeat this code in here until
10:28 - it's on the ground so we're going to do
10:30 - if direction of the cat is greater than
10:32 - zero
10:34 - so the direction of the cat
10:37 - the direction of the cat's greater than
10:38 - zero we're gonna change the x by ten
10:41 - so this is basically making the ball
10:42 - move in a certain direction so we're
10:44 - gonna change the uh x by 10 else we're
10:47 - going to change the x by negative 10
10:49 - because it'll be going towards the other
10:50 - way so if the direction of the cat is
10:52 - towards the right side meaning it's
10:53 - greater than zero ball is going to shoot
10:55 - towards this side if it's pointing
10:57 - towards this way the ball will shoot
10:58 - this way so that's the code for which
11:01 - way the ball has to shoot according to
11:03 - wherever the cat is pointing towards and
11:05 - the next we're gonna obviously have to
11:06 - do set
11:08 - make the ball shoot so we're gonna have
11:09 - to change the y position
11:11 - change y
11:13 - we're going to change the y by
11:15 - the y y velocity so y velocity and then
11:18 - we're going to change the y velocity by
11:20 - negative 2.
11:22 - so this is the
11:24 - code to make it come back down
11:26 - and then if else we're getting it if
11:27 - else uh
11:29 - inside here inside the repeat loop
11:32 - so the repeat until
11:34 - uh so if it's
11:35 - the direction of the cat is greater than
11:37 - zero we're also going to make the ball
11:38 - like turn so it's kind of like
11:40 - in like real life when you throw a
11:41 - basketball it goes up and then comes
11:42 - back down in like a parabola pattern so
11:45 - kind of like that so we're gonna have to
11:47 - make it turn so we're gonna do if it's
11:48 - greater than zero so let's say the cat's
11:50 - pointing towards this way then we're
11:51 - going to turn six degrees towards the
11:53 - right side
11:55 - else if it's facing this way the cat's
11:57 - facing towards the left kind of turn six
12:00 - degrees towards the left
12:02 - like that
12:03 - and then next we're gonna get if then
12:04 - statement so if
12:06 - so this is like for the hitbox
12:08 - if um
12:10 - touching so any two and statements so
12:12 - and and
12:14 - so
12:15 - if
12:17 - the ball is touching the hitbox so this
12:18 - is to detect if the ball should make a
12:20 - shot or not so if it's touching the
12:22 - hitbox for one
12:25 - oops for the first one hitbox and then
12:27 - the second one if the y velocity is less
12:30 - than zero meaning it's negative two
12:32 - which means it's falling so we want the
12:34 - ball to only be able to shoot if it's
12:36 - coming over the hoop so we're gonna do
12:39 - if it's less than zero so
12:43 - zero y velocity is less than zero
12:46 - and we're going to make it made basket
12:48 - equal to no
12:49 - because we want to make sure the basket
12:52 - the ball is not in the basket
12:54 - before we can make another one so we're
12:56 - going to make it no so
12:59 - made baskets go to no
13:01 - because if it is then that means it'll
13:04 - score multiple times and then we're
13:06 - going to change the score by one right
13:08 - here
13:10 - okay score by one and then we're going
13:11 - to set made basket to yes because
13:13 - it's being made into the basket so we're
13:16 - going to ask yes
13:18 - and then next we're going to broadcast a
13:20 - message
13:21 - called
13:22 - made shot so you know new message
13:25 - made shot so made shot and then we're
13:28 - going to hide
13:29 - all this
13:30 - so
13:31 - that's a lot of code so
13:33 - here i'll show you guys the top and then
13:36 - go back to the bottom
13:38 - make sure you guys didn't mess up
13:39 - anything
13:40 - so that's basically it for the ball
13:43 - now let's hop into the hoop so let's go
13:45 - into our hoop code
13:47 - oh yeah let me show you guys the ball
13:49 - should be able to shoot as you can see
13:51 - the ball is shooting
13:53 - so now we're going to make the code for
13:54 - the hoop to fly all around
13:56 - so we're going to get a link green
13:57 - flight clicked
14:00 - and we're going to forever
14:03 - and then we're going to glide one second
14:06 - glide one second to pick random negative
14:08 - 240.
14:11 - so negative 240 for the x
14:14 - to 240
14:16 - 240 and then for the why we can do pick
14:19 - random negative 50 to 180 so
14:22 - so it's going to be something like this
14:25 - so it's going to glide from somewhere
14:27 - pick random right here to here for the x
14:29 - and then for the y negative 50 is
14:30 - probably like right here the somewhere
14:32 - up here 180s like up here so it's just
14:34 - going to glide somewhere randomly
14:36 - like randomly all around here
14:39 - and then next we're going to receive the
14:40 - message made shot when i receive made
14:43 - shot we're gonna uh play a sound so
14:45 - we're gonna start sound here
14:47 - and inside the cats right here
14:49 - um we're going to when i receive the
14:52 - mage shot
14:53 - we're gonna make the cat say score
14:55 - for one second
14:57 - so
14:59 - score
15:01 - exclamation mark for one second
15:03 - and then next let's go to our hitbox
15:04 - this is our last piece of code we need
15:06 - it's pretty simple it's for the hitbox
15:08 - when we fly clicked we just need to set
15:10 - the ghost effect
15:12 - set
15:13 - ghost effect
15:15 - to 100 so then it's not visible but it's
15:17 - still
15:18 - uh you can still like so the ball
15:21 - touches it it'll still detect stuff but
15:22 - if you hide it it will not so that's why
15:24 - you use the ghost effect
15:26 - and then we're going to use forever loop
15:27 - and then we're going to go to the hoop
15:29 - so this hitbox will go to the hoop
15:33 - go to
15:34 - loop
15:36 - so forever always follow the hoop okay
15:38 - so here we have it uh we can also add
15:40 - some music
15:42 - uh what music
15:43 - let's just
15:46 - let's just get a forever loop go to
15:48 - sounds let's just find
15:50 - some random music i don't know
15:52 - whatever sound let's go to loops yeah
15:54 - these are all the music
15:56 - let's just use uh k by yes sure let's
15:59 - use that
16:01 - and then start sounding so long
16:03 - save your project and
16:05 - let's play our project
16:08 - so you see the cat is moving around the
16:10 - basket also moves around you shoot
16:14 - see as you can see when i shoot it it's
16:16 - a score
16:18 - [Music]
16:22 - oh yeah also let me show you the
16:23 - variable sport
16:25 - about to do that
16:26 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys the kids coding playroom here today we're doing a new project in scratch we're working on the basketball game or scratch so basically the point of the game is you move around using the arrow keys and then you click the space bar to throw the basketball and you try to get into the hoop and then when you get into the hoop you'll get score as you can see so i'm going to play the project and show you guys how it works so we also have some music in the background so you move around using the cat you can also jump using the cat so you jump as you can see you make a score and as you can see if you shoot under the nets you cannot make a score like that so you can see that as you can see you can't make a score from under the nets one more there you go so it's pretty simple for a basketball game so yeah that's pretty much it for the game so now let's get on to the coding so let's start a new project so new projects okay so in our new project we're going to be using the cat so we're going to rename it to cap and then we rename the project to basketball basketball and then right here we can get some sprites so right here we have the net sprite so the hoop we actually drew this and we have to get our basketball sprite so we're gonna get a basketball right here basketball right here we'll take the basketball and then we'll resize it to 125 because it's a little bit too small and then we'll draw our hit box so hit box it's just going to be a small uh square so we take out the outline as well so no outline and then we're just going to zoom in hold down shift so then get a perfect square oops didn't have the tool selected hold down shift so about that big that should be good enough so the hitbox is going to be like on top of the basketball hoop so then it will be able to uh detect if the basketball is going through and you'll score and then next week go into her hoop as you can see her hoop is under the center thing because we want to put our hitbox about at this position so then it will look like it's actually going through the hoop and scoring and then for a basketball hoop it's pretty simple to draw we just have a outline of red and then we use the 20 thickness of the line and then we draw a line right there and then right here we have three lines down and then two lines across and they're all whites to make it look like a net so here we have our basketball hoop so yes if you want to draw it you can draw but it's also going to be in our google drive in the description below and then next we can rename this let's rename it to a box so there's right it's going to be hitbox and then we can get our backdrop so we got the brick wall background i think wall so we have the wall one we're gonna use this backdrop okay so now we have all our assets into our game let's get on to the coding so inside our cat we're going to first start with the movement of the cat so when green flag is clicked we are going to set the y velocity set y velocity we're going to make a new variable so we're going to make a new variable y velocity it's for this cat only for the sprite only by y velocity for this right only so we have y velocity we're going to set the y velocity to zero and then we're gonna forever here forever loop we're going to get change y velocity by the y y position by the y velocity so we're going to change the y by the y velocity that and then forever uh we have that forever so next we're going to get if then statement so if so if the position is greater than negative 130 so negative 130 is about down here somewhere so we want the cat to be somewhere down here so we're going to get if the position is greater than negative 130 so we're gonna get the y position oops accidentally checked it in the y position and then if it's greater than negative 130 meaning it's in the air so i'm gonna get if it's greater than position negative 130 over here that means it's in the air then we're going to change the y velocity by negative two meaning it will come back down so we're going to change the variable y velocity by negative two and then next we're going to get an if then statement if y velocity y position is less than negative negative 130 meaning it's on the ground so we're going to get y position if it's less than negative 130. if it's like that then we're going to set the y back to negative 130 set y back to 130 negative 130 and then we're gonna set the y y velocity to zero next we're going to do with the left and right movement so we're going to when green flag clicks we're going to do this when we fly click we're going to get to forever we're going to forever if if then so if the left arrow key is pressed so if key left is pressed left arrow key is pressed then we're going to point direction of negative 90 in direction negative 90. and then next we're gonna move eight steps so we're gonna make the cat move eight steps duplicate this and then we're gonna get a if right arrows key is pressed then we're gonna change the direction to 90 point version 90 and move eight steps we'll keep that okay so now we have all this code we're gonna get onto the left and right we're going to make it look like he's walking so we're going to hit the one group like clicked go down here we're going to get one group like clicked forever if uh left or right arrow key is pressed so we can use the or so or if key left is being pressed or right so we're going to get the key left arrow or duplicate let's get it right so if either one of those are pressed then we're going to do next costume.1 seconds just so it'll look like it's walking so we have the 8.1 and then next we have one more last bit of code so we're going to go over here uh we're going to do if up arrow key is pressed when up is pressed then we're going to if the y position is equal to negative 130 meaning the cat is going to be at negative 130 so we want the cat to be negative 130 we're going to set it right here 30 so so negative 130 so if the up arrow uh if the up arrow is pressed and if y position is equal to 1 negative 130 so 5 position my position is equal to negative 130 we're going to uh set the y velocity our variable y velocity we're going to set that to uh just said it's 20 so he's going to have like jump 20 up in the air so we're gonna next see up here we can change the y by y velocity that means it'll be changing by 20. so let's play our code so right here we can see the cat is moving and of course it's upside down uh really simple to fix this just click this button and then it'll just right be right side up so where you can use the set rotation styles of left and right so as you can see our cat is moving jump as you can see now the cat can jump because we have our code in for the jumping physics as well okay so now our cat is jumping we can on to our basketball so on to our basketball go into our basketball we're going to get in a oneyear flight clicked when we're on flick we're going to make a new variable and the name is score for all sprites so we're going to set the score to zero and then we're going to hide and hide the basketball beginning and then only when the spacebar is pressed then we'll show the basketball so when spacebar is pressed so when space keys press we're gonna do space then we're gonna make a new variable and then we're gonna name it made basket so this is to detect if the uh basketball has been made inside the basket made basket for this sprite only so meat basket for this right only i'm gonna set made basket to note so it's not gonna be in the basket obviously in the beginning and then we're gonna set the direction of the cat which is a new variable so we make a new variable we're gonna name it direction of cat so direction of cats it's for all sprites so we're gonna set direction of cats and then work as soon as the game starts as soon as you press the space bar we're going to get the position of where the ball is the direction of it so then it will go in a certain direction if you don't do this the ball will only shoot towards one side so we want to make it make sure the ball can shoot towards the left and right so we're going to get the this one this blocker here in sensing so we're going to get the cat and the direction so that's what we have to do and then we're gonna make it play the sound uh pop or you can do basketball bounce whatever uh we're gonna do pop whenever you shoot the ball and then we're gonna make the sprite go to the cat so the ball will always go to the cat and after that we're gonna set the y velocity to 24 so that's going to be the y velocity of the ball set y velocity y velocity all right we have to make a new variable oh yeah i forgot we have to make a new variable called y velocity for the sprite only it's also for the sprite only so we have y velocity i don't know why but is sometimes laggy or glitchy sometimes it doesn't show up when i made the variable i have to leave and come back so here we have the y velocity variable um again it's for the sprite only so we're going to set our y velocity y velocity and then we're going to set it to 24. that's gonna be it from this uh for the basketball and then we're going to point direction of the direction of the cat so it's going to point in the direction of the direction of the cat right here you see and see me set the variable to that um sensing block so best sensing direction of the cat is now the variable so we're going to just put the variable right there and then we're going to show the ball and then next we're going to repeat until so repeat until gonna repeat until and then we're gonna get if the y position is less than negative 130 so if the y position y position is less than negative 130 meaning it's on the ground then we're going to repeat until so if it's like that then we're going to get if else statement so if so basically we're going to repeat the ball until it's on the ground so we're going to repeat this code in here until it's on the ground so we're going to do if direction of the cat is greater than zero so the direction of the cat the direction of the cat's greater than zero we're gonna change the x by ten so this is basically making the ball move in a certain direction so we're gonna change the uh x by 10 else we're going to change the x by negative 10 because it'll be going towards the other way so if the direction of the cat is towards the right side meaning it's greater than zero ball is going to shoot towards this side if it's pointing towards this way the ball will shoot this way so that's the code for which way the ball has to shoot according to wherever the cat is pointing towards and the next we're gonna obviously have to do set make the ball shoot so we're gonna have to change the y position change y we're going to change the y by the y y velocity so y velocity and then we're going to change the y velocity by negative 2. so this is the code to make it come back down and then if else we're getting it if else uh inside here inside the repeat loop so the repeat until uh so if it's the direction of the cat is greater than zero we're also going to make the ball like turn so it's kind of like in like real life when you throw a basketball it goes up and then comes back down in like a parabola pattern so kind of like that so we're gonna have to make it turn so we're gonna do if it's greater than zero so let's say the cat's pointing towards this way then we're going to turn six degrees towards the right side else if it's facing this way the cat's facing towards the left kind of turn six degrees towards the left like that and then next we're gonna get if then statement so if so this is like for the hitbox if um touching so any two and statements so and and so if the ball is touching the hitbox so this is to detect if the ball should make a shot or not so if it's touching the hitbox for one oops for the first one hitbox and then the second one if the y velocity is less than zero meaning it's negative two which means it's falling so we want the ball to only be able to shoot if it's coming over the hoop so we're gonna do if it's less than zero so zero y velocity is less than zero and we're going to make it made basket equal to no because we want to make sure the basket the ball is not in the basket before we can make another one so we're going to make it no so made baskets go to no because if it is then that means it'll score multiple times and then we're going to change the score by one right here okay score by one and then we're going to set made basket to yes because it's being made into the basket so we're going to ask yes and then next we're going to broadcast a message called made shot so you know new message made shot so made shot and then we're going to hide all this so that's a lot of code so here i'll show you guys the top and then go back to the bottom make sure you guys didn't mess up anything so that's basically it for the ball now let's hop into the hoop so let's go into our hoop code oh yeah let me show you guys the ball should be able to shoot as you can see the ball is shooting so now we're going to make the code for the hoop to fly all around so we're going to get a link green flight clicked and we're going to forever and then we're going to glide one second glide one second to pick random negative 240. so negative 240 for the x to 240 240 and then for the why we can do pick random negative 50 to 180 so so it's going to be something like this so it's going to glide from somewhere pick random right here to here for the x and then for the y negative 50 is probably like right here the somewhere up here 180s like up here so it's just going to glide somewhere randomly like randomly all around here and then next we're going to receive the message made shot when i receive made shot we're gonna uh play a sound so we're gonna start sound here and inside the cats right here um we're going to when i receive the mage shot we're gonna make the cat say score for one second so score exclamation mark for one second and then next let's go to our hitbox this is our last piece of code we need it's pretty simple it's for the hitbox when we fly clicked we just need to set the ghost effect set ghost effect to 100 so then it's not visible but it's still uh you can still like so the ball touches it it'll still detect stuff but if you hide it it will not so that's why you use the ghost effect and then we're going to use forever loop and then we're going to go to the hoop so this hitbox will go to the hoop go to loop so forever always follow the hoop okay so here we have it uh we can also add some music uh what music let's just let's just get a forever loop go to sounds let's just find some random music i don't know whatever sound let's go to loops yeah these are all the music let's just use uh k by yes sure let's use that and then start sounding so long save your project and let's play our project so you see the cat is moving around the basket also moves around you shoot see as you can see when i shoot it it's a score oh yeah also let me show you the variable sport about to do that score okay as you can see the score is two yeah so as you can see the game is working a pretty simple basketball game so yeah that's pretty much it for this tutorial don't forget to like share and subscribe and ring the notification bell i think guys all for watching and i will see you guys in the next tutorial
