00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids coding
00:09 - playground here and today we're back for
00:10 - another video
00:12 - called the faily bricks game we'll be
00:14 - making a family breaks human scratch
00:16 - the objective of this game is to survive
00:18 - as long as possible if the player drops
00:20 - to zero then the game is over
00:21 - player the player can collect hearts to
00:24 - refill hp stars
00:26 - to get more points and power so you can
00:28 - shoot out lasers
00:29 - so anyways um if you never heard about
00:32 - the game called faily brakes
00:33 - it's a pretty cool game i sometimes play
00:36 - it
00:37 - and as you know this video was sponsored
00:40 - by
00:40 - bailey brakes and um sponge games
00:44 - well i'm just kidding psych and it's not
00:47 - sadly we don't have a sponsor okay what
00:48 - happened let's get into this
00:51 - so um
00:54 - bailey breaks game we'll be learning
00:55 - these following concepts in scratch
00:57 - variables loops broadcast messages
00:59 - custom block
01:00 - custom sprite control sprite with keys
01:02 - and we'll be jumping right into the
01:04 - video
01:05 - so i'm gonna go demo the game full
01:08 - screen it
01:10 - so as you can see it says please select
01:12 - the card by using left and right arrow
01:14 - keys please
01:15 - click space when you're done i'm going
01:17 - to play some cool music um
01:19 - so you can just like select a skin so i
01:22 - am going to select
01:23 - blue because my favorite color and as
01:26 - you can see these hearts give you
01:27 - um 20 extra hp and these stars just give
01:31 - you points they don't really do anything
01:33 - and then you can also shoot these crates
01:34 - and then just start out
01:36 - ten lasers and then um you can also
01:39 - gather lasers
01:40 - by looking at these power ups right
01:44 - here i wonder
01:46 - [Music]
01:50 - yeah so then the rocks
01:56 - so in this game uh soccer ball
02:00 - it takes one hit to kill the soccer ball
02:02 - and
02:03 - um and one had to kill the crate
02:06 - also it takes three hits to kill the
02:08 - wall uh three hits to break the
02:10 - motorcycle
02:11 - and rocks i believe it is three two
02:15 - and yeah basically that's the game
02:20 - he has some decorations on the side too
02:23 - i'm going to show you
02:24 - how how you die so i'm going to pick a
02:26 - different skin to show that this all the
02:28 - skins work
02:29 - purple and i'm trying to die not
02:32 - gathering live so
02:34 - i'm bumping into rocks they lose you ten
02:36 - lives
02:37 - so bail at 10 mil hertz left hit the
02:40 - crate as you can see you flip over
02:42 - and you die so basically yeah and that's
02:45 - what
02:46 - the game is known about so
02:49 - um i started a new project and i
02:52 - am going to say some things before i
02:54 - start please like share subscribe
02:56 - and comment in the comment section below
02:58 - for what else um
02:59 - content you want so you can also
03:00 - basically share it with your friends
03:02 - so just to leave this scratch cat it's
03:05 - the first thing
03:07 - and i'm gonna get the convertible sprite
03:09 - i actually have it in my backpack i
03:11 - think
03:11 - um right here let's just drag the
03:14 - convertibles right first i'll show you
03:15 - some things
03:16 - in the convertible spray as you can see
03:18 - there's costumes and
03:20 - i um had some a few costumes like yellow
03:25 - purple blue red and green so yeah
03:28 - so you can make a new costume if you
03:30 - want just duplicate the older costume
03:32 - and just change it a little bit so you
03:34 - can also
03:35 - um change like the color you can make it
03:38 - all wacky
03:39 - i don't know what you can do but you can
03:41 - make it like
03:43 - um like orange
03:46 - or you can just do like a um
03:50 - let's just just have to do this and then
03:52 - you can also make a darker color this is
03:54 - optional but you can make a darker color
03:56 - and then put this in this a darker color
04:01 - and you can also use this you can also
04:03 - use like basically this you can also use
04:05 - to make some cool skins too
04:07 - so anyways i'm gonna start getting
04:09 - everything i have in my backpack
04:12 - so convertible is in the sprite library
04:14 - so you can find it
04:15 - and um we have i have a backdrop
04:19 - so i got this from the math racing game
04:21 - so
04:22 - yeah you can just take the backdrop you
04:24 - got from the math recent game
04:25 - and in the backdrop you just have to
04:28 - write a hp type of thing
04:30 - and um i put a star
04:33 - and a power up
04:35 - [Music]
04:37 - and put a star in the power so yeah
04:42 - star hp power
04:45 - so anyways let me try the rest of the
04:47 - things the rest of my sprites inside
04:49 - so i have a motorcycle i
04:52 - this is also in the sprite library i
04:55 - just need obstacles but there is some
04:57 - things inside the motorcycle
04:58 - so all these um things are all
05:01 - in the all um all
05:05 - all obstacles and they're all one sprite
05:07 - so it's crate soccer ball rock
05:09 - rocks 2 wall morsel
05:12 - [Music]
05:14 - so yeah so
05:18 - we will have these sprites in the links
05:19 - in description in our google drive
05:21 - so i'm also going to drag some other
05:23 - things like the
05:24 - um decorations i guess this is optional
05:28 - but you could use it and i have a heart
05:30 - i think there is a heart in scratch
05:32 - already so
05:33 - you could also use that i also have a
05:35 - laser
05:36 - i think the lasers also you just have to
05:38 - name it button
05:40 - button and then you just color i think
05:43 - it's already colored like that
05:44 - and yeah so it's basically almost
05:48 - all the things we'll have so
05:51 - for the costumes the costumes there's
05:53 - also the star
05:55 - and the power up which is this is just a
05:57 - lightning you just color it
05:58 - um pink so yeah
06:02 - actually we drew this a lightning but
06:04 - there is a lightning in the sprite
06:06 - library
06:07 - search it up for you guys lightning like
06:10 - that you can also do that and
06:11 - yeah change the color i don't know you
06:13 - can do anything but there's also some
06:15 - other code that we
06:16 - that we need like we're gonna work on
06:19 - the player
06:20 - first on part one and we're trying to
06:22 - cover some
06:23 - easy code in the beginning so yeah so
06:26 - when the green flag is clicked
06:30 - so set hp
06:47 - bro so i do have a testing uh
06:50 - [Music]
06:52 - so i do have a testing limit but i i
06:55 - would actually do 100
06:56 - but you can do like more if you want and
06:59 - you also need to make a new variable
07:07 - so set score to zero
07:11 - and then oh yes i'm gonna make laser
07:16 - and set lasers to 10 well you can put
07:20 - infinite if you want you can put a
07:22 - million if you want but i'm using 10
07:25 - and also you can also i have a written
07:28 - coordinate so it's go
07:30 - going to here that's fine
07:33 - anything's fine and i'll point in
07:35 - direction 90.
07:38 - and we'll switch costume to convertible
07:42 - one
07:45 - so convertible one is the um
07:49 - green one so you can change it around
07:52 - and with your skin so yeah now set
07:55 - say please
07:59 - say please
08:03 - select
08:05 - [Music]
08:06 - a car
08:09 - by using left
08:15 - and right arrow keys
08:21 - um please
08:25 - click please space
08:32 - press space when
08:36 - you are done
08:41 - i'm gonna make it five seconds
08:45 - and then i'll broadcast a new message
08:47 - because we don't even have any messages
08:49 - like i said wait um select a card
08:56 - [Music]
09:00 - yeah and then um i'll also be working on
09:03 - a little bit more code like when i
09:05 - receive select a car
09:10 - it will go forever
09:14 - you need an if then statement if then
09:19 - the key right left arrow
09:22 - um key
09:26 - left arrow is pressed
09:30 - it will uh
09:33 - it will switch costume
09:37 - to to
09:41 - minus a minus so switch costume
09:45 - to costume number
09:48 - minus one so i'll tell you what that
09:50 - does
09:52 - right now so costume number minus
09:55 - what so basically that's going left so
09:57 - the costume number will go left
09:59 - so i think um behind the green is the
10:02 - purple no i mean yellow
10:04 - so i'll switch to yellow basically and
10:06 - it'll wait until
10:11 - wait until
10:15 - the not key left arrow is pressed
10:19 - so it will not be as glitchy
10:21 - [Music]
10:28 - so yeah and um also you need to
10:30 - duplicate this and you can also make the
10:32 - right side
10:35 - which is slightly different so let's
10:37 - just
10:38 - write and
10:42 - um switch costume the costume number
10:45 - plus one
10:52 - plus one so plus one is red i know
10:57 - i think and
11:00 - you'll see right around to the left
11:03 - arrow so yeah
11:05 - um you know wait until
11:08 - and it will broadcast
11:11 - and you also have to go to the um
11:13 - spacebar sorry
11:14 - um so you gotta go to spacebar so it's
11:18 - really different from office by just
11:19 - duplicate it for quicker use
11:22 - and you do not need to i'll switch
11:23 - costume number
11:25 - so you can throw that away this costume
11:27 - number not
11:29 - uh key space press
11:31 - [Music]
11:35 - and it will broadcast
11:37 - [Music]
11:40 - start game
11:45 - and stop the script so you can you so
11:48 - because you're using right and left
11:49 - arrow keys to move your car
11:51 - you gotta start stop the script so then
11:54 - it will
11:55 - not change skins basically and also
11:58 - we have some other code to do
12:02 - so i'm going to show you the skin
12:05 - stuff so it says please select the car
12:08 - by using left or right arrow keys please
12:10 - press space when you're done
12:12 - and bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam
12:14 - bam bam bam bam so
12:16 - all those colors okay yeah and we're
12:18 - also gonna have some author code for
12:19 - moving
12:20 - so this should be simple enough when i
12:23 - receive start game
12:26 - it will uh go forever
12:32 - if then the left key arrows clicked
12:41 - then it will change x by minus 10 so go
12:44 - to the right
12:46 - left left left sorry ah
12:50 - um and also you said to
12:53 - duplicate this and this will be click
12:57 - right arrow and instead it's 10.
13:06 - and then you also need an if then
13:09 - if then statement if then
13:13 - so for the up and down arrow keys
13:16 - there's a little twist to it
13:18 - so you need and operator so
13:21 - it will key up press so it will not
13:24 - so i'll tell you after when i'm done
13:26 - coding keep
13:27 - up up arrow and um
13:32 - you need um if the
13:35 - 880 is greater than the y position
13:39 - less than the y position then it will
13:45 - then that that's basically so it will
13:47 - not go
13:48 - if it's up so it'll let you go up
13:52 - will not let you pass this green grass
13:55 - so
13:56 - that's uh basically like a border so
13:58 - that's a coordinate
13:59 - so yours could be different
14:02 - but yeah so mine is just
14:05 - like this so change y by 10
14:08 - and you just have to duplicate this
14:16 - duplicate this throw this away
14:19 - throw this away put this inside of here
14:23 - instead you gotta change that's a down
14:25 - arrow
14:26 - in the y position
14:31 - so i just got to take this out and it's
14:33 - just a little bit different so
14:36 - so we have to use this one
14:40 - so um if the y position is greater than
14:45 - negative 90 so it's a y position
14:53 - and it will change y by
14:56 - negative
15:01 - [Music]
15:04 - and we'll be also working on some other
15:06 - code we have here
15:08 - so sorry about this guys
15:12 - um it's actually right arrow i forgot
15:15 - about to do that
15:16 - so it's left right up down so let's see
15:21 - so as you can see it works correctly so
15:25 - just start the game working
15:29 - so yeah
15:33 - okay so i also got to show you um it
15:36 - will
15:37 - not be able to cross into here or here
15:41 - so
15:41 - let me show you see look so yeah
15:46 - let's have some other code to do like
15:49 - when i receive
15:52 - start game will go forever
15:57 - and if then it's touching the power up
16:02 - so we do have the power up here we're
16:05 - touching
16:06 - power up the broadcast got power up so
16:10 - yeah
16:11 - god just got power up
16:22 - and it will also mess up some code
16:26 - so when i showed you the demo i had some
16:29 - trees so we'll be coding this and this
16:30 - will be the end of the video
16:32 - so when the green flag is clicked we'll
16:34 - hide
16:35 - let me show and when i start the game
16:40 - when i receive start game
16:43 - then i'll go forever
16:48 - it'll go forever it'll go next costume
16:52 - so
16:52 - i do have some costume to the tree trees
16:54 - a trees b
16:56 - three c three costume one basically
16:58 - costume two
16:59 - lesson three costume four costume five
17:02 - costume six so you don't have to have as
17:05 - much as i do
17:06 - but you can do that if you want to
17:10 - we'll give it in the google drive in the
17:11 - links in the description like
17:13 - what i said like earlier so then it'll
17:16 - go to
17:16 - a position to make it go here
17:21 - i'll repeat 50 times and change x
17:26 - by minus seven
17:32 - so that's the trees and we'll be working
17:35 - on the other things on part two
17:38 - so this change access to make the trees
17:41 - go backwards to
17:42 - make like looking the cars going forward
17:44 - and it's not set at this chain checks
17:47 - so um we'll be doing the rest in part
17:50 - part one two we might have a part three
17:53 - i'm not sure
17:55 - but yeah so then we can finish this game
17:59 - so i'm gonna i'm gonna select the skin
18:01 - hopefully select red
18:03 - so as you can see trees moving
18:07 - and yeah that's basically what it is so
18:10 - you're not done coding you'll finish the
18:12 - rest later
18:13 - please like share subscribe and comment
18:15 - in the comment section below
18:17 - what else videos you want thank you for
18:19 - watching
18:20 - see you guys
18:29 - [Music]
18:31 - you

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here and today we're back for another video called the faily bricks game we'll be making a family breaks human scratch the objective of this game is to survive as long as possible if the player drops to zero then the game is over player the player can collect hearts to refill hp stars to get more points and power so you can shoot out lasers so anyways um if you never heard about the game called faily brakes it's a pretty cool game i sometimes play it and as you know this video was sponsored by bailey brakes and um sponge games well i'm just kidding psych and it's not sadly we don't have a sponsor okay what happened let's get into this so um bailey breaks game we'll be learning these following concepts in scratch variables loops broadcast messages custom block custom sprite control sprite with keys and we'll be jumping right into the video so i'm gonna go demo the game full screen it so as you can see it says please select the card by using left and right arrow keys please click space when you're done i'm going to play some cool music um so you can just like select a skin so i am going to select blue because my favorite color and as you can see these hearts give you um 20 extra hp and these stars just give you points they don't really do anything and then you can also shoot these crates and then just start out ten lasers and then um you can also gather lasers by looking at these power ups right here i wonder yeah so then the rocks so in this game uh soccer ball it takes one hit to kill the soccer ball and um and one had to kill the crate also it takes three hits to kill the wall uh three hits to break the motorcycle and rocks i believe it is three two and yeah basically that's the game he has some decorations on the side too i'm going to show you how how you die so i'm going to pick a different skin to show that this all the skins work purple and i'm trying to die not gathering live so i'm bumping into rocks they lose you ten lives so bail at 10 mil hertz left hit the crate as you can see you flip over and you die so basically yeah and that's what the game is known about so um i started a new project and i am going to say some things before i start please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below for what else um content you want so you can also basically share it with your friends so just to leave this scratch cat it's the first thing and i'm gonna get the convertible sprite i actually have it in my backpack i think um right here let's just drag the convertibles right first i'll show you some things in the convertible spray as you can see there's costumes and i um had some a few costumes like yellow purple blue red and green so yeah so you can make a new costume if you want just duplicate the older costume and just change it a little bit so you can also um change like the color you can make it all wacky i don't know what you can do but you can make it like um like orange or you can just do like a um let's just just have to do this and then you can also make a darker color this is optional but you can make a darker color and then put this in this a darker color and you can also use this you can also use like basically this you can also use to make some cool skins too so anyways i'm gonna start getting everything i have in my backpack so convertible is in the sprite library so you can find it and um we have i have a backdrop so i got this from the math racing game so yeah you can just take the backdrop you got from the math recent game and in the backdrop you just have to write a hp type of thing and um i put a star and a power up and put a star in the power so yeah star hp power so anyways let me try the rest of the things the rest of my sprites inside so i have a motorcycle i this is also in the sprite library i just need obstacles but there is some things inside the motorcycle so all these um things are all in the all um all all obstacles and they're all one sprite so it's crate soccer ball rock rocks 2 wall morsel so yeah so we will have these sprites in the links in description in our google drive so i'm also going to drag some other things like the um decorations i guess this is optional but you could use it and i have a heart i think there is a heart in scratch already so you could also use that i also have a laser i think the lasers also you just have to name it button button and then you just color i think it's already colored like that and yeah so it's basically almost all the things we'll have so for the costumes the costumes there's also the star and the power up which is this is just a lightning you just color it um pink so yeah actually we drew this a lightning but there is a lightning in the sprite library search it up for you guys lightning like that you can also do that and yeah change the color i don't know you can do anything but there's also some other code that we that we need like we're gonna work on the player first on part one and we're trying to cover some easy code in the beginning so yeah so when the green flag is clicked so set hp bro so i do have a testing uh so i do have a testing limit but i i would actually do 100 but you can do like more if you want and you also need to make a new variable so set score to zero and then oh yes i'm gonna make laser and set lasers to 10 well you can put infinite if you want you can put a million if you want but i'm using 10 and also you can also i have a written coordinate so it's go going to here that's fine anything's fine and i'll point in direction 90. and we'll switch costume to convertible one so convertible one is the um green one so you can change it around and with your skin so yeah now set say please say please select a car by using left and right arrow keys um please click please space press space when you are done i'm gonna make it five seconds and then i'll broadcast a new message because we don't even have any messages like i said wait um select a card yeah and then um i'll also be working on a little bit more code like when i receive select a car it will go forever you need an if then statement if then the key right left arrow um key left arrow is pressed it will uh it will switch costume to to minus a minus so switch costume to costume number minus one so i'll tell you what that does right now so costume number minus what so basically that's going left so the costume number will go left so i think um behind the green is the purple no i mean yellow so i'll switch to yellow basically and it'll wait until wait until the not key left arrow is pressed so it will not be as glitchy so yeah and um also you need to duplicate this and you can also make the right side which is slightly different so let's just write and um switch costume the costume number plus one plus one so plus one is red i know i think and you'll see right around to the left arrow so yeah um you know wait until and it will broadcast and you also have to go to the um spacebar sorry um so you gotta go to spacebar so it's really different from office by just duplicate it for quicker use and you do not need to i'll switch costume number so you can throw that away this costume number not uh key space press and it will broadcast start game and stop the script so you can you so because you're using right and left arrow keys to move your car you gotta start stop the script so then it will not change skins basically and also we have some other code to do so i'm going to show you the skin stuff so it says please select the car by using left or right arrow keys please press space when you're done and bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam so all those colors okay yeah and we're also gonna have some author code for moving so this should be simple enough when i receive start game it will uh go forever if then the left key arrows clicked then it will change x by minus 10 so go to the right left left left sorry ah um and also you said to duplicate this and this will be click right arrow and instead it's 10. and then you also need an if then if then statement if then so for the up and down arrow keys there's a little twist to it so you need and operator so it will key up press so it will not so i'll tell you after when i'm done coding keep up up arrow and um you need um if the 880 is greater than the y position less than the y position then it will then that that's basically so it will not go if it's up so it'll let you go up will not let you pass this green grass so that's uh basically like a border so that's a coordinate so yours could be different but yeah so mine is just like this so change y by 10 and you just have to duplicate this duplicate this throw this away throw this away put this inside of here instead you gotta change that's a down arrow in the y position so i just got to take this out and it's just a little bit different so so we have to use this one so um if the y position is greater than negative 90 so it's a y position and it will change y by negative and we'll be also working on some other code we have here so sorry about this guys um it's actually right arrow i forgot about to do that so it's left right up down so let's see so as you can see it works correctly so just start the game working so yeah okay so i also got to show you um it will not be able to cross into here or here so let me show you see look so yeah let's have some other code to do like when i receive start game will go forever and if then it's touching the power up so we do have the power up here we're touching power up the broadcast got power up so yeah god just got power up and it will also mess up some code so when i showed you the demo i had some trees so we'll be coding this and this will be the end of the video so when the green flag is clicked we'll hide let me show and when i start the game when i receive start game then i'll go forever it'll go forever it'll go next costume so i do have some costume to the tree trees a trees b three c three costume one basically costume two lesson three costume four costume five costume six so you don't have to have as much as i do but you can do that if you want to we'll give it in the google drive in the links in the description like what i said like earlier so then it'll go to a position to make it go here i'll repeat 50 times and change x by minus seven so that's the trees and we'll be working on the other things on part two so this change access to make the trees go backwards to make like looking the cars going forward and it's not set at this chain checks so um we'll be doing the rest in part part one two we might have a part three i'm not sure but yeah so then we can finish this game so i'm gonna i'm gonna select the skin hopefully select red so as you can see trees moving and yeah that's basically what it is so you're not done coding you'll finish the rest later please like share
