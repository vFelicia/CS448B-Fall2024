00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:09 - kids coding CLR today we'll be finishing
00:11 - up the um coin matching game so from
00:14 - last week we did the um check button the
00:17 - new
00:19 - button um the robot
00:22 - setup and the back drop so that's all we
00:25 - have for today today we'll be working on
00:27 - the arrows and add some more code to the
00:29 - Rob but so let's go to the first Arrow
00:34 - the down one for the one cent so for the
00:37 - down one I'm going to get a one flag
00:40 - clicked green flag is clicked zoom in
00:43 - well let's
00:46 - hide and then when the backdrop switches
00:48 - to backdrop
00:51 - too then we want to show because the
00:54 - first backdrop is the um the
00:57 - instructions backdrop and then the
00:59 - second one is the actual dis back drop
01:02 - and then after that we want to do when
01:04 - this Sprite is being clicked then let's
01:07 - get an if then statement if if selected
01:12 - one selected one is greater
01:15 - than selected one is greater than
01:18 - zero cuz this is going back that means
01:21 - minus one so if selected one is greater
01:24 - than zero that means anything greater
01:26 - than zero then we want to change the
01:29 - selected one byga 1 selected one by
01:33 - negative 1 so this Arrow all the left
01:36 - arrows are making it minus one and all
01:38 - the right arrow are making it go up by
01:41 - one all right so for the up arrow is
01:44 - pretty much the same thing but we're
01:47 - just going to um and the only reason we
01:49 - put the zero right here is to prevent it
01:51 - from being a negative number so um let's
01:55 - drag and drop all of this code into the
01:57 - up key we just have to change it a
02:00 - little
02:03 - bit like that okay so um we have all
02:06 - this code so for this one we're just
02:08 - going to take all this out just take all
02:10 - of that out and change selected one Nega
02:14 - by neg one selected 1 by one instead of
02:17 - negative 1
02:19 - okay so for the down five it's pretty
02:22 - much the same thing as well going to
02:24 - drag and drop the same code from down
02:26 - one into down
02:28 - five
02:31 - down five pretty much the same thing
02:33 - except we have to change the variables
02:35 - since I've selected one it'll be
02:37 - selected
02:38 - five uh because this is the um five cent
02:42 - down button and then we're going to
02:44 - change this to selected five as well so
02:47 - that's the code for this down for the up
02:50 - it's literally the same thing as this
02:52 - one except for the variable we just have
02:55 - to change some variables so just keep on
02:57 - repeating this until you're all done
03:00 - with all of them so up we're going to
03:03 - have to do select five and change it by
03:06 - one so up you're going to have to do
03:10 - that and then for the down one I'm just
03:13 - going to drag and drop all of this into
03:16 - the down 10 instead we're going to do
03:19 - the new other variable select 10 instead
03:22 - of Select five so just keep on repeating
03:25 - this select
03:27 - 10 and this should be select 10 as well
03:31 - so now we have all of that let's go to
03:33 - the up one so let's drag and drop
03:36 - this
03:38 - this and this
03:41 - okay and you can actually skip this part
03:44 - if uh you want you can just pause the
03:46 - video and just do it yourself so
03:49 - selected 10 change that by one and then
03:53 - finally we have the last down button so
03:55 - let's drag and drop this into the
03:58 - down
04:02 - down down button so instead right here
04:05 - we're going to change this to um 25 um I
04:09 - mean selected
04:11 - 25 and this should be selected 25 as
04:15 - well so that's for the down and then for
04:18 - the up we're going to get this
04:21 - code instead we're going to have to
04:24 - change the
04:26 - variable this variable should be
04:30 - selected 25 okay now let's try it out so
04:34 - now when you click the up and down as
04:38 - you can see when it's uh zero you cannot
04:40 - keep on going
04:42 - down goes up as you can
04:47 - [Music]
04:50 - see as you can see it's working so now
04:54 - the arrows are working out and I also
04:57 - want to show the target when it switches
04:59 - to this backdrop so so right here show
05:03 - the target variable I forgot to do that
05:05 - in the last video but in this video
05:08 - Let's just show it show the
05:10 - Target in the beginning when you click
05:13 - space the target shows up so now let's
05:15 - work on the rest of the code for the
05:18 - Retro robot so we're going to make a
05:19 - custom block for the Retro robot so
05:22 - let's make a custom block we're going to
05:24 - name it
05:27 - calculate calculate so this to calculate
05:30 - um the least amount of steps or least
05:33 - amount of coins it
05:35 - takes to get the value so in the
05:39 - beginning we're going to set all the
05:41 - calculate uh variables to zero so we're
05:45 - going to set uh so calculate one
05:49 - calculate
05:50 - 5 Calculate 10 and calculate 25 all to
05:55 - zero and then we're going to set the
05:57 - remainder to like Target
06:00 - the remainder to the Target which is
06:03 - pick random one to 100 and then we're
06:06 - going to we're going to start from the
06:08 - biggest number the 25 because we want to
06:10 - find the least amount of coins so we're
06:12 - going to start from the 25 cent repeat
06:16 - until repeat until the remainder is less
06:19 - than
06:21 - 25 repeat until the remainder is less
06:24 - than 25 the variable
06:27 - remainder and then we'll uh if this is
06:30 - true then we will set the
06:33 - remainder set the remainder to remainder
06:37 - minus
06:39 - 25 so it
06:43 - subtract let me duplicate this remainder
06:45 - minus
06:47 - 25 and then we want to change the
06:49 - calculate 25 by one because you have one
06:52 - more so you want to change the
06:54 - calculated
06:56 - 25 by one all right so now now we just
06:59 - duplicate
07:00 - this and now we just have to change this
07:03 - to 10 change this to
07:06 - 10 and instead of calculate 25 we're
07:09 - going to do Calculate 10 and change by
07:12 - one like that all right let's duplicate
07:17 - this put this under
07:19 - here this remainder is less than five so
07:25 - now we have do five change this to five
07:28 - as well instead of Calculate 10 we're
07:30 - going to calculate
07:33 - five and then finally we have down here
07:36 - we want to set the calculated one to the
07:39 - remainder the value of whatever the
07:41 - remainder
07:43 - is all right so this is the calculate
07:46 - custom block code okay now let's
07:51 - continue so remember earlier I uh
07:54 - broadcasted the message um check check
07:58 - answer well now this is where the check
08:01 - answer comes into play so we're going to
08:03 - try to find the least amount of steps
08:05 - you can do this in so we're going to do
08:07 - when I receive check
08:09 - answer we're going to calculate on this
08:12 - custom block right
08:14 - here and then we're going to get an if L
08:16 - statement okay so
08:18 - if if the selected one is equal to
08:22 - selected calculated one so this is just
08:25 - to find the least amount of steps this
08:27 - is a really long statement right here so
08:30 - we're going to need three ands I think
08:33 - yeah so let's get three
08:35 - ands um and then so we're going to get
08:37 - an equal right here equal going to put
08:40 - it equal right
08:42 - here equal right
08:44 - here and an equal right here a really
08:47 - long statement so if the selected one so
08:52 - whatever the selected is is equal to the
08:55 - amount of calculated one so the amount
08:59 - you selected is equal to the calculated
09:01 - one and selected five is equal to
09:04 - calculated
09:06 - five and then you have selected
09:10 - 10 yeah this is pretty long selected 10
09:13 - is equal to calculated
09:15 - 10 and selected 25 is equal to select uh
09:20 - calculate 25 then that means we have to
09:23 - get it say that's correct cuz that's the
09:26 - least number of steps say that that is
09:33 - correct
09:36 - correct that is
09:38 - correct and then let's say if it's not
09:42 - the least amount of steps we're going to
09:43 - get another F statement put that inside
09:45 - the else area so this is the code for
09:48 - the top just show it for a little bit if
09:51 - else inside the else area so if the
09:55 - target is
09:57 - equal all so we're going to need three
10:00 - addition
10:01 - signs let's put that right
10:05 - here wait
10:08 - um we're going to need
10:12 - this this oops sorry addition not
10:17 - subtraction uh like that and like that
10:20 - so three addition signs so if the
10:23 - selected one is multiplied by
10:26 - one so this is like if you get it
10:29 - correct but it's not the least amount of
10:31 - steps it will do this selected five
10:34 - multiplied by
10:36 - five selected
10:38 - 10 is multiplied by
10:41 - 10 uh I think we need even
10:46 - more we
10:49 - need actually we need one more addition
10:52 - sign so get an addition sign put this
10:54 - selected one um
10:57 - plus uh this
11:00 - selected
11:01 - one
11:03 - multiply oh sorry this should be
11:05 - multiply I'm doing this wrong sorry
11:07 - about that multiply so we're going to
11:10 - get this selected
11:12 - one multiplied by
11:16 - one
11:18 - plus selected five multiplied by five
11:21 - this should be multiplication not
11:23 - addition select five multiplied by
11:27 - five this is a really long one as well
11:31 - and then we need another
11:33 - addition
11:35 - uh selected 10 multiply by
11:41 - 10
11:43 - multiply selected 10 multip by 10 and
11:47 - then we need a selected
11:49 - 25 multipli by 25 so we're going to get
11:52 - addition sign one last one pop that in
11:56 - the
11:57 - front and drag drag this over here
12:00 - selected 25 multiplied by
12:05 - 25 selected 25 multiplied by
12:09 - 25 like that put that in the
12:13 - front and if that's equal to the target
12:17 - number then we will say that is correct
12:20 - but that is not the least amount of
12:23 - steps that is
12:27 - correct but it is not the least amount
12:32 - of
12:34 - coins like that and if it's just
12:37 - completely wrong then we will just
12:40 - say that is
12:45 - incorrect all right so I think we're
12:47 - done now let's test it out all right
12:49 - let's try it out let's click the play
12:51 - Space Bar new 81 so let's do three of
12:55 - these
12:57 - 75 and then we do one of these 80 and
12:59 - then one of these check that is at least
13:02 - amount of steps so that is correct let's
13:04 - put a new one let's say if we do it
13:06 - slower so let's do like six of these and
13:09 - then two of these it'll say that is
13:11 - correct but that is not the least amount
13:13 - of coins so as you can see it's working
13:15 - and when you just get it completely
13:17 - wrong it just says that is incorrect so
13:20 - I'm going to do one more
13:21 - 86 let's see three of these one of these
13:26 - and one of these that is correct
13:30 - so as you can see it is working
13:32 - now so yeah that's pretty much it for
13:35 - the coin game so thank you guys for
13:38 - watching don't forget to like share and
13:41 - subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
13:43 - next video
13:45 - [Music]
13:54 - bye

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding CLR today we'll be finishing up the um coin matching game so from last week we did the um check button the new button um the robot setup and the back drop so that's all we have for today today we'll be working on the arrows and add some more code to the Rob but so let's go to the first Arrow the down one for the one cent so for the down one I'm going to get a one flag clicked green flag is clicked zoom in well let's hide and then when the backdrop switches to backdrop too then we want to show because the first backdrop is the um the instructions backdrop and then the second one is the actual dis back drop and then after that we want to do when this Sprite is being clicked then let's get an if then statement if if selected one selected one is greater than selected one is greater than zero cuz this is going back that means minus one so if selected one is greater than zero that means anything greater than zero then we want to change the selected one byga 1 selected one by negative 1 so this Arrow all the left arrows are making it minus one and all the right arrow are making it go up by one all right so for the up arrow is pretty much the same thing but we're just going to um and the only reason we put the zero right here is to prevent it from being a negative number so um let's drag and drop all of this code into the up key we just have to change it a little bit like that okay so um we have all this code so for this one we're just going to take all this out just take all of that out and change selected one Nega by neg one selected 1 by one instead of negative 1 okay so for the down five it's pretty much the same thing as well going to drag and drop the same code from down one into down five down five pretty much the same thing except we have to change the variables since I've selected one it'll be selected five uh because this is the um five cent down button and then we're going to change this to selected five as well so that's the code for this down for the up it's literally the same thing as this one except for the variable we just have to change some variables so just keep on repeating this until you're all done with all of them so up we're going to have to do select five and change it by one so up you're going to have to do that and then for the down one I'm just going to drag and drop all of this into the down 10 instead we're going to do the new other variable select 10 instead of Select five so just keep on repeating this select 10 and this should be select 10 as well so now we have all of that let's go to the up one so let's drag and drop this this and this okay and you can actually skip this part if uh you want you can just pause the video and just do it yourself so selected 10 change that by one and then finally we have the last down button so let's drag and drop this into the down down down button so instead right here we're going to change this to um 25 um I mean selected 25 and this should be selected 25 as well so that's for the down and then for the up we're going to get this code instead we're going to have to change the variable this variable should be selected 25 okay now let's try it out so now when you click the up and down as you can see when it's uh zero you cannot keep on going down goes up as you can see as you can see it's working so now the arrows are working out and I also want to show the target when it switches to this backdrop so so right here show the target variable I forgot to do that in the last video but in this video Let's just show it show the Target in the beginning when you click space the target shows up so now let's work on the rest of the code for the Retro robot so we're going to make a custom block for the Retro robot so let's make a custom block we're going to name it calculate calculate so this to calculate um the least amount of steps or least amount of coins it takes to get the value so in the beginning we're going to set all the calculate uh variables to zero so we're going to set uh so calculate one calculate 5 Calculate 10 and calculate 25 all to zero and then we're going to set the remainder to like Target the remainder to the Target which is pick random one to 100 and then we're going to we're going to start from the biggest number the 25 because we want to find the least amount of coins so we're going to start from the 25 cent repeat until repeat until the remainder is less than 25 repeat until the remainder is less than 25 the variable remainder and then we'll uh if this is true then we will set the remainder set the remainder to remainder minus 25 so it subtract let me duplicate this remainder minus 25 and then we want to change the calculate 25 by one because you have one more so you want to change the calculated 25 by one all right so now now we just duplicate this and now we just have to change this to 10 change this to 10 and instead of calculate 25 we're going to do Calculate 10 and change by one like that all right let's duplicate this put this under here this remainder is less than five so now we have do five change this to five as well instead of Calculate 10 we're going to calculate five and then finally we have down here we want to set the calculated one to the remainder the value of whatever the remainder is all right so this is the calculate custom block code okay now let's continue so remember earlier I uh broadcasted the message um check check answer well now this is where the check answer comes into play so we're going to try to find the least amount of steps you can do this in so we're going to do when I receive check answer we're going to calculate on this custom block right here and then we're going to get an if L statement okay so if if the selected one is equal to selected calculated one so this is just to find the least amount of steps this is a really long statement right here so we're going to need three ands I think yeah so let's get three ands um and then so we're going to get an equal right here equal going to put it equal right here equal right here and an equal right here a really long statement so if the selected one so whatever the selected is is equal to the amount of calculated one so the amount you selected is equal to the calculated one and selected five is equal to calculated five and then you have selected 10 yeah this is pretty long selected 10 is equal to calculated 10 and selected 25 is equal to select uh calculate 25 then that means we have to get it say that's correct cuz that's the least number of steps say that that is correct correct that is correct and then let's say if it's not the least amount of steps we're going to get another F statement put that inside the else area so this is the code for the top just show it for a little bit if else inside the else area so if the target is equal all so we're going to need three addition signs let's put that right here wait um we're going to need this this oops sorry addition not subtraction uh like that and like that so three addition signs so if the selected one is multiplied by one so this is like if you get it correct but it's not the least amount of steps it will do this selected five multiplied by five selected 10 is multiplied by 10 uh I think we need even more we need actually we need one more addition sign so get an addition sign put this selected one um plus uh this selected one multiply oh sorry this should be multiply I'm doing this wrong sorry about that multiply so we're going to get this selected one multiplied by one plus selected five multiplied by five this should be multiplication not addition select five multiplied by five this is a really long one as well and then we need another addition uh selected 10 multiply by 10 multiply selected 10 multip by 10 and then we need a selected 25 multipli by 25 so we're going to get addition sign one last one pop that in the front and drag drag this over here selected 25 multiplied by 25 selected 25 multiplied by 25 like that put that in the front and if that's equal to the target number then we will say that is correct but that is not the least amount of steps that is correct but it is not the least amount of coins like that and if it's just completely wrong then we will just say that is incorrect all right so I think we're done now let's test it out all right let's try it out let's click the play Space Bar new 81 so let's do three of these 75 and then we do one of these 80 and then one of these check that is at least amount of steps so that is correct let's put a new one let's say if we do it slower so let's do like six of these and then two of these it'll say that is correct but that is not the least amount of coins so as you can see it's working and when you just get it completely wrong it just says that is incorrect so I'm going to do one more 86 let's see three of these one of these and one of these that is correct so as you can see it is working now so yeah that's pretty much it for the coin game so thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next video bye
