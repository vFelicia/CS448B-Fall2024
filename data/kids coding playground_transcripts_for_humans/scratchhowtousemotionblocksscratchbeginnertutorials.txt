00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys to kids coding
00:08 - playground here today we'll be doing a
00:10 - new type of video on the channel we'll
00:12 - be doing a video on an in-depth
00:14 - explanation of all the motion blocks as
00:16 - listed here
00:17 - and this is like a video for beginners
00:18 - that just started scratch maybe you want
00:20 - to know what each block does so maybe
00:23 - you want to watch one of these videos so
00:24 - we might do some for all the other
00:26 - blocks as well in the future
00:28 - but first we're going to start out with
00:30 - the motion blocks
00:31 - so
00:32 - let's get started first of all we have
00:34 - the move 10 steps block so
00:36 - this is exactly what it says move 10
00:39 - steps so
00:40 - um as you can see when you click on it
00:43 - so you can click on this block to make
00:44 - it like run or you can just use a one
00:47 - green fly clicked but that's not
00:48 - relevant right now so you click on it
00:50 - you see it moves ten steps you can see
00:52 - that it is moving
00:54 - yeah you can see that and if you do move
00:57 - negative 10 steps
00:58 - guess what it does move backwards of
01:01 - course
01:02 - so there you go move that's the move 10
01:04 - steps and stuff like that and you can
01:05 - make it move a certain amount of steps
01:07 - as much as you want to move 50 steps
01:09 - you can move negative 100 steps yeah you
01:12 - can
01:12 - you can just play around with it
01:14 - whatever you want i'm just gonna make it
01:16 - go back to the middle
01:18 - and then here we have the turn degrees
01:20 - step
01:21 - uh turn degrees block so what it does is
01:23 - it also turns it just turns the cat so
01:26 - this is the right turn and this one's
01:28 - the left turn so you can see there's a
01:29 - difference between both of them since
01:31 - when you turn to the right this one you
01:32 - turn to the left
01:34 - you can also change this to whatever you
01:35 - want turn 90 degrees see that
01:38 - or you can turn this
01:40 - uh negative 90 degrees it will turn the
01:42 - other way
01:44 - see that
01:47 - yeah so turn
01:49 - yeah so basically it's just the turning
01:51 - it's really
01:52 - simple and then here we have the go to
01:55 - random position block
01:57 - uh when you click here you can either
01:58 - make it go to the mouse pointer or a
02:00 - sprite so let's say i get a sprite let's
02:01 - just get apple or whatever so you see
02:04 - the apple we have another sprite so
02:06 - right here if we do go to apple the
02:08 - sprite then it'll go to the sprite as
02:10 - you can see so if i move the apple right
02:12 - here let's let's see
02:14 - of course it'll just go to the apple
02:17 - so and then here if go to mouse pointer
02:18 - this will make it go towards the mouse
02:20 - pointer as you can see my mouse is on
02:22 - this side so it'll go this side so i'm
02:23 - going to put a wait
02:25 - two seconds to show you guys how it
02:26 - works so going to motion so you click on
02:29 - it my mouse is right here
02:32 - you see the cat it goes to my mouse
02:34 - pointer so let's try again
02:36 - what if i want to go here
02:38 - so you can see the cat follows the mouse
02:42 - and then we have another one which is go
02:44 - to random position exactly what it says
02:46 - just goes to a random position as you
02:47 - can see
02:48 - and then right here we have the go to
02:50 - position go to x and y so basically this
02:53 - is where it will set the position of any
02:56 - sprite so let's say you want to make
02:58 - this cat go to 100
03:00 - 100
03:02 - well then i'll go to this position which
03:04 - is 100 100
03:05 - and if wherever you drag the cat is
03:07 - wherever it will set it to so you see
03:10 - right here it changed
03:12 - so i'm going to show you guys that it
03:14 - changed
03:14 - so like it goes to this position as you
03:16 - can see so i'm going to set it right
03:18 - here so if you click this one it goes to
03:19 - this position
03:21 - so
03:22 - yeah so basically it just basically sets
03:23 - the position of the cat and if you want
03:25 - to make it go to the middle it's of
03:27 - course zero zero so you click that it
03:29 - will go to the center
03:31 - and then next we have the glide so glide
03:33 - to a random position is exactly what it
03:35 - says as well
03:36 - it'll just glide to a random position
03:37 - you can see
03:38 - and you can also change the duration of
03:40 - the glide like two seconds as you can
03:42 - see it will glide a little bit slower
03:44 - about five seconds uh to show you guys
03:46 - it actually is gliding slower as you can
03:48 - see it's gliding much slower
03:50 - yeah so
03:52 - that you can change the duration also
03:54 - apple you can make it glide to a sprite
03:56 - as well so you can see
03:58 - click it it'll go to the apple glide
04:00 - there
04:01 - and then finally we have the glide to
04:02 - mouse pointer i'm going to put another
04:04 - wait two seconds so i can show you guys
04:06 - that it goes to the mouse pointer
04:08 - so
04:10 - let's click it
04:11 - so my mouse is right here as you can see
04:14 - it glides the mouse
04:16 - so that's what the glide thing is
04:19 - there's also another glide block this is
04:20 - if you want to make it glide to a
04:22 - certain position
04:23 - so you can basically make it whatever
04:26 - position you want so what if you want
04:27 - the cat to glide right here
04:30 - so you'll get this so first
04:33 - you set the position to right there
04:35 - right so you can just click that it'll
04:36 - glide down there
04:38 - so it'll also glide to the corresponding
04:40 - x and y so if you want to glide back to
04:42 - 0
04:43 - 0 0 then look we'll glide there
04:46 - you can also change the duration of the
04:48 - glide like any other one so
04:50 - oops i need to change this so maybe 50
04:52 - 150
04:54 - as you can see it's gliding pretty slow
04:56 - yeah so that's basically it for the
04:59 - glide
05:01 - next we have the point direction blocks
05:03 - so as you can see 90 is the default so
05:05 - it's
05:06 - already at position 90. so we can set
05:09 - this to whatever you want maybe 120
05:11 - you click it it will point in the
05:13 - direction of 120.
05:15 - um you can also rotate this dial so
05:17 - wherever you want it so negative 90
05:19 - it'll point the opposite way as you can
05:21 - see when it's point direction of
05:22 - negative 90 it is flipped upside down
05:24 - and what if you don't want that well
05:27 - it's uh luckily it's really easy to fix
05:29 - this you can either click this button
05:31 - right here as you can see the left right
05:33 - button so now it won't flip upside down
05:35 - or you can also use and block inside the
05:37 - motion
05:38 - and we'll get there later
05:40 - after we get we're going in order so
05:41 - once we get there i'll show you that it
05:43 - will also work as well so next we have
05:46 - the point towards block so the point
05:48 - towards block basically makes the cat
05:50 - point in a certain direction so first
05:52 - we're gonna have to make it go rotate
05:54 - all around as well right now so then it
05:56 - will be able to point towards something
05:58 - so the point towards your point towards
05:59 - the mouse pointer apple so as you can
06:01 - see
06:02 - you point towards the apple no point
06:03 - towards apple it's pointing already
06:05 - towards it
06:06 - and point towards mouse pointer it'll
06:09 - point towards your mouse pointer as you
06:10 - can see it will rotate that way so i'm
06:11 - going to put a weight as well just wait
06:13 - two seconds
06:15 - so you play it it's gonna point towards
06:17 - it
06:17 - so as you can see that cap points
06:19 - towards the mouse pointer
06:21 - so that's the point towards block and
06:23 - then next we have the change x
06:25 - block so basically this is
06:27 - um so first we have to make this
06:29 - uh go back to its original direction
06:31 - let's go back to 90 so
06:33 - and then you're ready to change x this
06:35 - is basically moving 10 steps but it
06:36 - doesn't
06:37 - uh it's
06:38 - it's not affected by like the
06:40 - positioning of the cat so the cat is
06:41 - pointing towards the left then moving 10
06:44 - steps will move it towards the left but
06:46 - changing x will only change it on the
06:47 - x-axis so changing x by 10 as you can
06:50 - see it will just keep on moving 10.
06:52 - let's do 50 or something see as you can
06:54 - see it's moving by 50. and if you do
06:56 - negative 58 it'll move backwards so you
06:58 - see that
07:00 - so
07:01 - there you have the change x by 50 and
07:04 - then here with the set x so this is
07:06 - wherever you want to set your x position
07:08 - to
07:09 - so let's say you don't set the x for the
07:12 - cat to 150 maybe
07:14 - then you'll set it over there so you can
07:15 - see the cat gets set right there it's
07:16 - basically a go to block
07:18 - except it's only for the x position you
07:20 - can even do negative 150
07:23 - it'll be right there and next we have to
07:25 - change twice that's basically the same
07:27 - thing as the change x you can see it's
07:29 - changing on the y-axis
07:31 - and you can do like maybe maybe 50 or
07:33 - something and it'll
07:34 - move down by
07:36 - 50 as you can see
07:38 - so yeah that's basically what it does
07:41 - and then here we have the set y this is
07:43 - also like the go to block it'll set the
07:46 - y of the
07:48 - cap so
07:49 - we'll set it to 150
07:53 - so as you can see it gets set to 150
07:56 - and let's say you undo
07:59 - 10 it gets set to 10. so basically also
08:02 - sets the y
08:03 - of the cat
08:04 - instead of using this maybe you only
08:06 - want to set the y position then you'll
08:08 - use that block and then if on edge
08:10 - bounce i'm going to make a simple uh
08:12 - script for this
08:13 - so um it'll actually work
08:16 - so right here we have a simple script to
08:19 - show how if on edge bounce works so
08:21 - let's play it
08:23 - as you can see the cat is bouncing all
08:24 - around it doesn't go off the edge it
08:27 - just bounces around like that
08:29 - um let's say you would want to remove
08:31 - this
08:31 - guess what happens it just gets stuck on
08:33 - the edge and it doesn't go anywhere so
08:36 - um it just gets stuck on the side so if
08:38 - on edge bounce is good for like
08:41 - some games where you don't want the
08:42 - characters to get off the borders then
08:44 - you can use the bounce
08:47 - and then next
08:48 - like i explained earlier we have the
08:49 - rotation style like remember i showed
08:52 - you that if you don't want your cat to
08:54 - be upside down like this
08:55 - you click this right
08:57 - well maybe you don't want to do that you
08:59 - want to set it every green flag is
09:01 - clicked you just do this
09:03 - and you can set it to don't rotate all
09:05 - around or left and right so if you send
09:06 - it to all around
09:08 - you'll be able to flip all around so now
09:10 - it's upside down and then don't rotate
09:12 - which is make it you can't rotate it at
09:14 - all and then left right you play it
09:16 - you'll just go back upright
09:19 - and then right here of the x y and
09:21 - direction so these are all three
09:23 - um very important for some games like
09:25 - platformers so we have x position this
09:28 - basically is the x position of whatever
09:30 - the sprite is so as you can see the
09:32 - sprite is at 16 so maybe you can try to
09:35 - detect the x position of some sprite in
09:37 - a platformer same with this this is the
09:39 - y position of the sprite is negative one
09:42 - except this goes into the decimals um
09:45 - you just have to know the whole number
09:46 - integer you just have to know the
09:47 - integer
09:48 - so that's the negative one and then
09:50 - direction this is the direction it's
09:52 - pointed towards as you can see it's
09:54 - negative 89 point something but right
09:56 - here is negative 90 it just rounds up to
09:58 - the nearest
09:59 - number so here we have the negative 89
10:01 - rounds up to negative 90 rounds up to
10:03 - the nearest integer
10:05 - and then so that's what the direction is
10:07 - so let's say i change the direction
10:09 - to maybe over here as you can see the
10:12 - sprite direction will change as well
10:14 - well you can't really see the change
10:16 - because i set it to no road left and
10:18 - right rotation only so if i switch it
10:20 - back like this you can see that it
10:22 - changes
10:23 - so that is it for all of the
10:25 - motion blocks in scratch
10:28 - i hope this video really helped you guys
10:30 - on understanding motion blocks and if
10:33 - you're new to our channel
10:35 - please consider subscribing to our
10:36 - channel and leave a like on this video
10:39 - thank you guys for watching and i will
10:40 - see you guys in the next video
10:42 - [Music]
10:52 - you

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys to kids coding playground here today we'll be doing a new type of video on the channel we'll be doing a video on an indepth explanation of all the motion blocks as listed here and this is like a video for beginners that just started scratch maybe you want to know what each block does so maybe you want to watch one of these videos so we might do some for all the other blocks as well in the future but first we're going to start out with the motion blocks so let's get started first of all we have the move 10 steps block so this is exactly what it says move 10 steps so um as you can see when you click on it so you can click on this block to make it like run or you can just use a one green fly clicked but that's not relevant right now so you click on it you see it moves ten steps you can see that it is moving yeah you can see that and if you do move negative 10 steps guess what it does move backwards of course so there you go move that's the move 10 steps and stuff like that and you can make it move a certain amount of steps as much as you want to move 50 steps you can move negative 100 steps yeah you can you can just play around with it whatever you want i'm just gonna make it go back to the middle and then here we have the turn degrees step uh turn degrees block so what it does is it also turns it just turns the cat so this is the right turn and this one's the left turn so you can see there's a difference between both of them since when you turn to the right this one you turn to the left you can also change this to whatever you want turn 90 degrees see that or you can turn this uh negative 90 degrees it will turn the other way see that yeah so turn yeah so basically it's just the turning it's really simple and then here we have the go to random position block uh when you click here you can either make it go to the mouse pointer or a sprite so let's say i get a sprite let's just get apple or whatever so you see the apple we have another sprite so right here if we do go to apple the sprite then it'll go to the sprite as you can see so if i move the apple right here let's let's see of course it'll just go to the apple so and then here if go to mouse pointer this will make it go towards the mouse pointer as you can see my mouse is on this side so it'll go this side so i'm going to put a wait two seconds to show you guys how it works so going to motion so you click on it my mouse is right here you see the cat it goes to my mouse pointer so let's try again what if i want to go here so you can see the cat follows the mouse and then we have another one which is go to random position exactly what it says just goes to a random position as you can see and then right here we have the go to position go to x and y so basically this is where it will set the position of any sprite so let's say you want to make this cat go to 100 100 well then i'll go to this position which is 100 100 and if wherever you drag the cat is wherever it will set it to so you see right here it changed so i'm going to show you guys that it changed so like it goes to this position as you can see so i'm going to set it right here so if you click this one it goes to this position so yeah so basically it just basically sets the position of the cat and if you want to make it go to the middle it's of course zero zero so you click that it will go to the center and then next we have the glide so glide to a random position is exactly what it says as well it'll just glide to a random position you can see and you can also change the duration of the glide like two seconds as you can see it will glide a little bit slower about five seconds uh to show you guys it actually is gliding slower as you can see it's gliding much slower yeah so that you can change the duration also apple you can make it glide to a sprite as well so you can see click it it'll go to the apple glide there and then finally we have the glide to mouse pointer i'm going to put another wait two seconds so i can show you guys that it goes to the mouse pointer so let's click it so my mouse is right here as you can see it glides the mouse so that's what the glide thing is there's also another glide block this is if you want to make it glide to a certain position so you can basically make it whatever position you want so what if you want the cat to glide right here so you'll get this so first you set the position to right there right so you can just click that it'll glide down there so it'll also glide to the corresponding x and y so if you want to glide back to 0 0 0 then look we'll glide there you can also change the duration of the glide like any other one so oops i need to change this so maybe 50 150 as you can see it's gliding pretty slow yeah so that's basically it for the glide next we have the point direction blocks so as you can see 90 is the default so it's already at position 90. so we can set this to whatever you want maybe 120 you click it it will point in the direction of 120. um you can also rotate this dial so wherever you want it so negative 90 it'll point the opposite way as you can see when it's point direction of negative 90 it is flipped upside down and what if you don't want that well it's uh luckily it's really easy to fix this you can either click this button right here as you can see the left right button so now it won't flip upside down or you can also use and block inside the motion and we'll get there later after we get we're going in order so once we get there i'll show you that it will also work as well so next we have the point towards block so the point towards block basically makes the cat point in a certain direction so first we're gonna have to make it go rotate all around as well right now so then it will be able to point towards something so the point towards your point towards the mouse pointer apple so as you can see you point towards the apple no point towards apple it's pointing already towards it and point towards mouse pointer it'll point towards your mouse pointer as you can see it will rotate that way so i'm going to put a weight as well just wait two seconds so you play it it's gonna point towards it so as you can see that cap points towards the mouse pointer so that's the point towards block and then next we have the change x block so basically this is um so first we have to make this uh go back to its original direction let's go back to 90 so and then you're ready to change x this is basically moving 10 steps but it doesn't uh it's it's not affected by like the positioning of the cat so the cat is pointing towards the left then moving 10 steps will move it towards the left but changing x will only change it on the xaxis so changing x by 10 as you can see it will just keep on moving 10. let's do 50 or something see as you can see it's moving by 50. and if you do negative 58 it'll move backwards so you see that so there you have the change x by 50 and then here with the set x so this is wherever you want to set your x position to so let's say you don't set the x for the cat to 150 maybe then you'll set it over there so you can see the cat gets set right there it's basically a go to block except it's only for the x position you can even do negative 150 it'll be right there and next we have to change twice that's basically the same thing as the change x you can see it's changing on the yaxis and you can do like maybe maybe 50 or something and it'll move down by 50 as you can see so yeah that's basically what it does and then here we have the set y this is also like the go to block it'll set the y of the cap so we'll set it to 150 so as you can see it gets set to 150 and let's say you undo 10 it gets set to 10. so basically also sets the y of the cat instead of using this maybe you only want to set the y position then you'll use that block and then if on edge bounce i'm going to make a simple uh script for this so um it'll actually work so right here we have a simple script to show how if on edge bounce works so let's play it as you can see the cat is bouncing all around it doesn't go off the edge it just bounces around like that um let's say you would want to remove this guess what happens it just gets stuck on the edge and it doesn't go anywhere so um it just gets stuck on the side so if on edge bounce is good for like some games where you don't want the characters to get off the borders then you can use the bounce and then next like i explained earlier we have the rotation style like remember i showed you that if you don't want your cat to be upside down like this you click this right well maybe you don't want to do that you want to set it every green flag is clicked you just do this and you can set it to don't rotate all around or left and right so if you send it to all around you'll be able to flip all around so now it's upside down and then don't rotate which is make it you can't rotate it at all and then left right you play it you'll just go back upright and then right here of the x y and direction so these are all three um very important for some games like platformers so we have x position this basically is the x position of whatever the sprite is so as you can see the sprite is at 16 so maybe you can try to detect the x position of some sprite in a platformer same with this this is the y position of the sprite is negative one except this goes into the decimals um you just have to know the whole number integer you just have to know the integer so that's the negative one and then direction this is the direction it's pointed towards as you can see it's negative 89 point something but right here is negative 90 it just rounds up to the nearest number so here we have the negative 89 rounds up to negative 90 rounds up to the nearest integer and then so that's what the direction is so let's say i change the direction to maybe over here as you can see the sprite direction will change as well well you can't really see the change because i set it to no road left and right rotation only so if i switch it back like this you can see that it changes so that is it for all of the motion blocks in scratch i hope this video really helped you guys on understanding motion blocks and if you're new to our channel please consider subscribing to our channel and leave a like on this video thank you guys for watching and i will see you guys in the next video you
