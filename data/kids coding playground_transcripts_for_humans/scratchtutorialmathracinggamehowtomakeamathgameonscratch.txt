00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to another tutorial
00:09 - on kids coding playground
00:10 - today we're going to be evaluating to
00:12 - the math game so we're going to turn it
00:14 - into a math
00:15 - racing game um we convert it from the
00:18 - math game so if you have not done the
00:20 - math game
00:20 - you guys should do the math game first
00:22 - before working on this one
00:24 - and the players will have to answer a
00:26 - math question
00:27 - and every question that answers
00:29 - correctly i'll move forward if it
00:30 - doesn't answer any questions correctly
00:32 - it'll just stay put
00:33 - and the dog is controlled by the ai
00:36 - it'll just
00:36 - move amount uh like six steps or
00:39 - something
00:40 - like every second and if the dog touches
00:43 - the finish line before the cat then you
00:45 - lose
00:46 - but if the cat touches the finish line
00:48 - before the dog then the dog loses
00:51 - so you want to beat the objective of the
00:52 - games just to beat the dog
00:55 - and today we'll be learning these
00:57 - following concepts in scratch
00:58 - uh actually we will not be using
01:01 - variables and custom blocks
01:02 - this is from the last episode so that's
01:05 - why it has these
01:06 - but we will be using the broadcast
01:08 - message loops
01:09 - i don't think we'll be using operator
01:11 - blocks but we'll be using some of these
01:13 - concepts from here so
01:14 - let's go back to our project so i'm
01:16 - gonna change this music right here
01:18 - because
01:19 - um we don't want to get flat our video
01:21 - flag for copyright
01:22 - so that's not a good thing so our video
01:25 - might get taken down if we do
01:26 - copyrighted music
01:28 - so i'm going to show you the game now
01:31 - so i added some modifiers to this game
01:34 - like credits and all that stuff
01:35 - but and i also added an intro you guys
01:38 - can add that if you want as well
01:41 - let's turn up the volume a little bit
01:45 - so i added an intro it was pretty simple
01:47 - to make so these
01:48 - we will not need to get into because
01:51 - i did music um
01:54 - so let's go with multiplication because
01:57 - it's this easiest
01:59 - so if you get a question wrong you'll
02:02 - just stay
02:02 - put if you get it right then you move
02:05 - forward
02:07 - if you get it right then you can keep
02:09 - moving forward
02:11 - so i'm going to try to repeat this real
02:13 - quick
02:18 - so as you can see um i'm pretty fast
02:22 - right now and the score still goes up
02:24 - right here
02:25 - so let's finish this real quick
02:29 - and i made it a little bit more funny so
02:31 - like when you lose you'll say that you
02:33 - failed or something
02:34 - um uh
02:38 - we're almost there
02:38 - [Music]
02:48 - oops
02:52 - go i think we got there i win
02:55 - and then i'll just say great job you
02:57 - beat the dog
02:58 - press the flag to play again and now you
03:00 - can enjoy the music so that's what i did
03:02 - at the end so that's what i have
03:06 - so let's go to our project we were
03:09 - working on
03:11 - okay so now we are inside our project
03:13 - will work we were working on earlier
03:16 - so this is the one i've been teaching
03:19 - you guys with
03:20 - so we're gonna go to the cat and i
03:23 - in the beginning i set the uh
03:27 - i made it go to um i think negative
03:31 - 204 negative 204
03:35 - negative 58. and i also set the size
03:39 - of the cat to 60. um
03:43 - set the size of the cat to 60 and i'm
03:45 - actually going to upload some uh
03:47 - um backdrops into this one so let's go
03:50 - to backdrops
03:52 - backdrops so i have the um
03:56 - this is the winning meeting screen these
03:59 - are the intros
04:02 - um and this is the track the race track
04:06 - actually i move this like right here
04:08 - this is the race track
04:09 - so this is the racetrack for it
04:13 - and this doesn't look very good it's not
04:17 - very proportionate so i just moved it to
04:18 - the left a little bit
04:20 - so now it's covering the whole screen so
04:22 - now let's go to the cat
04:25 - put down the backpack again so i set it
04:27 - to negative 204 and why click negative
04:29 - 58
04:30 - and i set the size of 60 so it'll be
04:33 - between the tracks
04:34 - and then for right here for like every
04:38 - single right answer we're gonna have to
04:39 - do this
04:41 - so when um after this when the answer is
04:43 - correct we need to broadcast
04:45 - a message let's call it correct answer
04:50 - correct answer
04:54 - so this will go to the um cat when it
04:57 - receives correct answer so it'll move
04:59 - forward so we're going to do that
05:02 - or here as well you're gonna have to do
05:05 - it for
05:06 - every single one here
05:09 - and finally in here so that's it
05:12 - we're here and then now we're going to
05:14 - have to receive the message
05:16 - so when i receive
05:19 - correct answer then we want to repeat 10
05:22 - times
05:23 - move three steps so basically moving 30
05:25 - steps
05:27 - move three steps and then
05:30 - i did next costume wait 0.1 seconds so
05:33 - look like it's running
05:36 - wait one seconds
05:39 - and then if it's touching the finish
05:42 - line and i have to get the finish line
05:44 - which i don't have so i'm gonna get that
05:46 - quickly okay so i just got the finish
05:48 - line from
05:49 - my other project so what i did for the
05:52 - finish line is basically a
05:54 - uh rectangle just a long rectangle
05:58 - so if you show it i put it right there
06:01 - and move it like
06:02 - right there actually i might have to
06:04 - like elongate it a little bit
06:07 - there you go center it
06:10 - a little bit smaller
06:15 - and look at that yeah that looks fine so
06:17 - that's going to be my um
06:19 - finish line it's just a rectangle so i'm
06:22 - going to go back into my cat
06:24 - let's go to the code and then um if
06:27 - i get an if-then statement if it is
06:30 - touching the finish line
06:34 - touching finish line then
06:37 - i will make it say i win
06:41 - uh i win for two seconds i guess
06:45 - i win and then i'm gonna switch the
06:47 - backdrop to
06:48 - uh this backdrop
06:52 - um this one this backdrop so tell them
06:55 - that they won
06:56 - [Music]
06:57 - so i'm gonna go into cat
07:00 - and then make it switch to backdrop five
07:04 - which is the waiting backdrop and then
07:06 - i'm gonna stop the script
07:07 - after you win or you can just put stop
07:10 - ball i'm just gonna put stop all
07:13 - um and then now let's go to the dog
07:16 - so from the i just got the dog from the
07:19 - sprite library so let's go
07:22 - dog this dog i just got this one
07:26 - so i made it go uh when i receive start
07:29 - game which is a broadcast i made i
07:31 - believe
07:33 - [Music]
07:34 - start game right here
07:37 - then i want to show in the beginning
07:41 - uh go to front layer
07:44 - and repeat repeat until it's touching
07:47 - the finish line
07:49 - just like the cat um
07:52 - touching finish line so we're gonna make
07:56 - it move six steps that's what i did
07:58 - move six steps
08:01 - and then i'm gonna next costume
08:04 - wait one second so his two costumes are
08:06 - like sticking out his tongue
08:08 - so i'm gonna make a wait one second
08:10 - instead
08:12 - and then if he is touching
08:16 - [Music]
08:18 - the finish line then
08:21 - i'll make him say i beat you
08:25 - for two seconds i beat you
08:29 - for two seconds and then i played the
08:32 - sound
08:34 - dog so i just play the sound that's what
08:36 - i did
08:37 - and then i'm gonna broadcast a message
08:39 - called you lose
08:42 - [Music]
08:46 - and then i'm going to hide and stop all
08:49 - so that's what i'm going to do
08:53 - and then i'm gonna get a one flag
08:55 - clicked
08:57 - show and i made the
09:01 - uh uh dog go to
09:04 - negative 183
09:08 - negative two for the x and y position
09:11 - and i made him hide
09:16 - and actually actually don't even need
09:20 - this show i don't even know why i put it
09:21 - there
09:22 - but um when the backdrop switches to
09:25 - backdrop five which is the
09:27 - winning screen i want it to hide so one
09:30 - backdrop switches to backdrop five
09:32 - then hide gotta do the same thing with
09:36 - the cat so
09:36 - i dropped your sister
09:40 - then finally for the backdrop remember
09:44 - for
09:45 - i made like a little intro of the end
09:47 - flashing in the back
09:49 - i know it's not a good intro but you
09:50 - guys can do anything else
09:52 - so when i receive start game in the
09:55 - beginning
09:57 - i want to switch back
10:00 - up to backdrop one which is the first
10:03 - backdrop
10:04 - this one
10:06 - [Music]
10:08 - so after that i'm gonna run flat clicked
10:13 - uh actually no
10:16 - we switched to backdrop too sorry about
10:18 - that
10:19 - so when you start the game you switch to
10:21 - backdrop too
10:23 - and then we're gonna get one flag
10:26 - clicked
10:27 - repeat five times
10:31 - switch backdrop to backdrop seven
10:35 - actually up to backdrop seven which is
10:37 - the um
10:39 - the flashing stuff i'm gonna wait 0.35
10:42 - seconds that's what i did
10:45 - three five i just experimented until i
10:48 - found the right number
10:49 - and then i'm gonna switch the backdrop
10:51 - back to backdrop eight
10:53 - and then after that let's switch back to
10:55 - backdrop two
10:57 - actually no we're switching it right
10:58 - here i forgot about that
11:00 - so we're gonna do backdrop one right
11:02 - here for now
11:03 - and then i'm gonna get a forever loop
11:06 - set the volume to 40
11:08 - because you actually don't you don't
11:10 - have to do that but
11:12 - i actually had a medieval song because
11:14 - but back then i had another song that
11:15 - was really loud
11:17 - so i set it to 40 so i actually did the
11:20 - medieval
11:21 - medieval one sound you guys can pick
11:23 - whatever sound you want
11:25 - and i'm just gonna play this on medieval
11:27 - one and so on
11:28 - so for the finish line i'm gonna get a
11:31 - one flag clicked
11:32 - go to this position and hide
11:37 - 228 y negative 22. that's where
11:40 - it is right now um
11:44 - and then when backdrop switches to
11:47 - backdrop two
11:48 - [Music]
11:50 - then we can show which is backdrop two
11:52 - is the
11:54 - oops backdrop two is the racing backdrop
11:58 - so
11:58 - i'm gonna show and then after that
12:03 - when backdrop switches to backdrop five
12:06 - then we're also gonna hide
12:11 - [Music]
12:12 - so yeah so yeah that's the code for the
12:16 - finish line
12:17 - so i'll show on the racing backdrop and
12:20 - i'll hide
12:21 - on the backdrop five the winning
12:22 - backdrop
12:24 - so i think that's pretty much it
12:28 - see what else we can add oh yeah anna
12:31 - losing
12:33 - losing screen yeah losing so i'm going
12:37 - paint a new sprite i'm gonna make it
12:39 - like a red color
12:41 - um put marker because it's easy to read
12:44 - remember
12:44 - you lose okay so
12:48 - remember we broadcast and fail on the um
12:52 - so you can hold down alt if you want so
12:54 - keep the sprite centered when you
12:56 - make it bigger so when the
12:59 - dog right here touches the finish line
13:01 - it was broadcast you lose so
13:03 - we're gonna get a one flat click right
13:05 - here i wanna hide this in the beginning
13:09 - and i'm gonna make it go to zero zero
13:11 - which is the origin
13:14 - zero zero and then when i receive
13:17 - um you lose then i want to show
13:22 - and go to the front layer go to front
13:24 - layer and show
13:27 - so that's pretty much it let's try it
13:29 - out now
13:30 - everyone i found out a bug while i was
13:32 - testing
13:33 - so in the beginning you want to actually
13:36 - hide i actually got the
13:38 - backdrops incorrect i'm sorry about that
13:39 - guys so
13:41 - up here where it's supposed to have a
13:43 - one flag clicked
13:44 - you have to replace it with the switch
13:46 - when this backdrop switches to backdrop
13:48 - one
13:49 - then you will execute all this code
13:51 - under here so that's
13:53 - one mistake i did and the other is
13:55 - inside the um
13:58 - backdrop i think yeah and these two are
14:00 - backwards i actually did it wrong
14:03 - i actually did it as backdrop one
14:04 - earlier which is wrong so you have to
14:07 - switch these two
14:09 - so that was um wrong so
14:12 - and the dog one last thing i wanted to
14:15 - make this
14:16 - dog at size 65 i think yeah i said at 65
14:21 - so let's try it out now
14:24 - it should work so as you can see the
14:26 - intro place
14:28 - and i'll say let's play a math game
14:30 - answer the following questions
14:31 - press the quit button to stop all
14:33 - answers uh
14:34 - choose one of the operations are random
14:37 - so
14:38 - let's see so that's correct
14:41 - you move forward
14:51 - so it's working as you can see
14:55 - so i'm gonna try to beat this dog
15:03 - and after i beat the dog i'm going to
15:04 - let you guys see what happens
15:07 - if the dog wins i'm going to like set
15:08 - the dog up going like
15:10 - 20 steps every time so
15:14 - 50 or something like that so i can show
15:16 - you guys what happens
15:23 - almost there i think one more should do
15:29 - there we go so now great job you beat
15:32 - the dog oh yeah and i can also make this
15:34 - hide
15:35 - if you want to do that quit you can just
15:38 - say when
15:39 - backdrop switches when backdrop switches
15:42 - to backdrop five
15:44 - which is the winning backdrop then you
15:45 - can hide
15:47 - so yeah as you can see it is working
15:49 - right now so i will show you
15:51 - what happens when you lose so
15:54 - let's do that make it like 50 steps
15:59 - and yes i need to show this in the
16:01 - beginning one flag click hide
16:03 - and when backdrop switches
16:08 - to backdrop two i think is the racing
16:11 - one
16:14 - yeah so switch to backdrop two so we can
16:17 - quit when backdrop switches back drop
16:19 - two then we wanna
16:19 - actually show this so let's try it out
16:23 - this time i will let the dog win
16:25 - i put it at 50 steps or something like
16:27 - that
16:31 - let it finish talking random
16:35 - beat me already so looks like the dog is
16:39 - going pretty fast so you'll say i beat
16:42 - you
16:43 - and then you'll say you lose as you can
16:45 - see
16:46 - so that's it for this tutorial on how to
16:49 - make a math
16:50 - racing game uh thank you guys for
16:53 - watching
16:53 - don't forget to like share subscribe and
16:56 - i'll see you guys in the next video
17:02 - goodbye
17:07 - [Music]
17:10 - you

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys to another tutorial on kids coding playground today we're going to be evaluating to the math game so we're going to turn it into a math racing game um we convert it from the math game so if you have not done the math game you guys should do the math game first before working on this one and the players will have to answer a math question and every question that answers correctly i'll move forward if it doesn't answer any questions correctly it'll just stay put and the dog is controlled by the ai it'll just move amount uh like six steps or something like every second and if the dog touches the finish line before the cat then you lose but if the cat touches the finish line before the dog then the dog loses so you want to beat the objective of the games just to beat the dog and today we'll be learning these following concepts in scratch uh actually we will not be using variables and custom blocks this is from the last episode so that's why it has these but we will be using the broadcast message loops i don't think we'll be using operator blocks but we'll be using some of these concepts from here so let's go back to our project so i'm gonna change this music right here because um we don't want to get flat our video flag for copyright so that's not a good thing so our video might get taken down if we do copyrighted music so i'm going to show you the game now so i added some modifiers to this game like credits and all that stuff but and i also added an intro you guys can add that if you want as well let's turn up the volume a little bit so i added an intro it was pretty simple to make so these we will not need to get into because i did music um so let's go with multiplication because it's this easiest so if you get a question wrong you'll just stay put if you get it right then you move forward if you get it right then you can keep moving forward so i'm going to try to repeat this real quick so as you can see um i'm pretty fast right now and the score still goes up right here so let's finish this real quick and i made it a little bit more funny so like when you lose you'll say that you failed or something um uh we're almost there oops go i think we got there i win and then i'll just say great job you beat the dog press the flag to play again and now you can enjoy the music so that's what i did at the end so that's what i have so let's go to our project we were working on okay so now we are inside our project will work we were working on earlier so this is the one i've been teaching you guys with so we're gonna go to the cat and i in the beginning i set the uh i made it go to um i think negative 204 negative 204 negative 58. and i also set the size of the cat to 60. um set the size of the cat to 60 and i'm actually going to upload some uh um backdrops into this one so let's go to backdrops backdrops so i have the um this is the winning meeting screen these are the intros um and this is the track the race track actually i move this like right here this is the race track so this is the racetrack for it and this doesn't look very good it's not very proportionate so i just moved it to the left a little bit so now it's covering the whole screen so now let's go to the cat put down the backpack again so i set it to negative 204 and why click negative 58 and i set the size of 60 so it'll be between the tracks and then for right here for like every single right answer we're gonna have to do this so when um after this when the answer is correct we need to broadcast a message let's call it correct answer correct answer so this will go to the um cat when it receives correct answer so it'll move forward so we're going to do that or here as well you're gonna have to do it for every single one here and finally in here so that's it we're here and then now we're going to have to receive the message so when i receive correct answer then we want to repeat 10 times move three steps so basically moving 30 steps move three steps and then i did next costume wait 0.1 seconds so look like it's running wait one seconds and then if it's touching the finish line and i have to get the finish line which i don't have so i'm gonna get that quickly okay so i just got the finish line from my other project so what i did for the finish line is basically a uh rectangle just a long rectangle so if you show it i put it right there and move it like right there actually i might have to like elongate it a little bit there you go center it a little bit smaller and look at that yeah that looks fine so that's going to be my um finish line it's just a rectangle so i'm going to go back into my cat let's go to the code and then um if i get an ifthen statement if it is touching the finish line touching finish line then i will make it say i win uh i win for two seconds i guess i win and then i'm gonna switch the backdrop to uh this backdrop um this one this backdrop so tell them that they won so i'm gonna go into cat and then make it switch to backdrop five which is the waiting backdrop and then i'm gonna stop the script after you win or you can just put stop ball i'm just gonna put stop all um and then now let's go to the dog so from the i just got the dog from the sprite library so let's go dog this dog i just got this one so i made it go uh when i receive start game which is a broadcast i made i believe start game right here then i want to show in the beginning uh go to front layer and repeat repeat until it's touching the finish line just like the cat um touching finish line so we're gonna make it move six steps that's what i did move six steps and then i'm gonna next costume wait one second so his two costumes are like sticking out his tongue so i'm gonna make a wait one second instead and then if he is touching the finish line then i'll make him say i beat you for two seconds i beat you for two seconds and then i played the sound dog so i just play the sound that's what i did and then i'm gonna broadcast a message called you lose and then i'm going to hide and stop all so that's what i'm going to do and then i'm gonna get a one flag clicked show and i made the uh uh dog go to negative 183 negative two for the x and y position and i made him hide and actually actually don't even need this show i don't even know why i put it there but um when the backdrop switches to backdrop five which is the winning screen i want it to hide so one backdrop switches to backdrop five then hide gotta do the same thing with the cat so i dropped your sister then finally for the backdrop remember for i made like a little intro of the end flashing in the back i know it's not a good intro but you guys can do anything else so when i receive start game in the beginning i want to switch back up to backdrop one which is the first backdrop this one so after that i'm gonna run flat clicked uh actually no we switched to backdrop too sorry about that so when you start the game you switch to backdrop too and then we're gonna get one flag clicked repeat five times switch backdrop to backdrop seven actually up to backdrop seven which is the um the flashing stuff i'm gonna wait 0.35 seconds that's what i did three five i just experimented until i found the right number and then i'm gonna switch the backdrop back to backdrop eight and then after that let's switch back to backdrop two actually no we're switching it right here i forgot about that so we're gonna do backdrop one right here for now and then i'm gonna get a forever loop set the volume to 40 because you actually don't you don't have to do that but i actually had a medieval song because but back then i had another song that was really loud so i set it to 40 so i actually did the medieval medieval one sound you guys can pick whatever sound you want and i'm just gonna play this on medieval one and so on so for the finish line i'm gonna get a one flag clicked go to this position and hide 228 y negative 22. that's where it is right now um and then when backdrop switches to backdrop two then we can show which is backdrop two is the oops backdrop two is the racing backdrop so i'm gonna show and then after that when backdrop switches to backdrop five then we're also gonna hide so yeah so yeah that's the code for the finish line so i'll show on the racing backdrop and i'll hide on the backdrop five the winning backdrop so i think that's pretty much it see what else we can add oh yeah anna losing losing screen yeah losing so i'm going paint a new sprite i'm gonna make it like a red color um put marker because it's easy to read remember you lose okay so remember we broadcast and fail on the um so you can hold down alt if you want so keep the sprite centered when you make it bigger so when the dog right here touches the finish line it was broadcast you lose so we're gonna get a one flat click right here i wanna hide this in the beginning and i'm gonna make it go to zero zero which is the origin zero zero and then when i receive um you lose then i want to show and go to the front layer go to front layer and show so that's pretty much it let's try it out now everyone i found out a bug while i was testing so in the beginning you want to actually hide i actually got the backdrops incorrect i'm sorry about that guys so up here where it's supposed to have a one flag clicked you have to replace it with the switch when this backdrop switches to backdrop one then you will execute all this code under here so that's one mistake i did and the other is inside the um backdrop i think yeah and these two are backwards i actually did it wrong i actually did it as backdrop one earlier which is wrong so you have to switch these two so that was um wrong so and the dog one last thing i wanted to make this dog at size 65 i think yeah i said at 65 so let's try it out now it should work so as you can see the intro place and i'll say let's play a math game answer the following questions press the quit button to stop all answers uh choose one of the operations are random so let's see so that's correct you move forward so it's working as you can see so i'm gonna try to beat this dog and after i beat the dog i'm going to let you guys see what happens if the dog wins i'm going to like set the dog up going like 20 steps every time so 50 or something like that so i can show you guys what happens almost there i think one more should do there we go so now great job you beat the dog oh yeah and i can also make this hide if you want to do that quit you can just say when backdrop switches when backdrop switches to backdrop five which is the winning backdrop then you can hide so yeah as you can see it is working right now so i will show you what happens when you lose so let's do that make it like 50 steps and yes i need to show this in the beginning one flag click hide and when backdrop switches to backdrop two i think is the racing one yeah so switch to backdrop two so we can quit when backdrop switches back drop two then we wanna actually show this so let's try it out this time i will let the dog win i put it at 50 steps or something like that let it finish talking random beat me already so looks like the dog is going pretty fast so you'll say i beat you and then you'll say you lose as you can see so that's it for this tutorial on how to make a math racing game uh thank you
