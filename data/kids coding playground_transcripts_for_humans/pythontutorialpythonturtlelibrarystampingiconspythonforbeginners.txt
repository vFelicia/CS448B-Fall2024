00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:09 - kids coding playground
00:10 - today we'll be doing another python
00:12 - tutorial so today we will be doing
00:14 - a stamping project on python so it's
00:17 - like the scratch on scratch how you can
00:19 - use pen
00:20 - on python we're just going to be
00:22 - stamping like icons
00:24 - on the screen so you can use in any
00:27 - image you'd like
00:28 - so like here we have an image and then
00:31 - apple
00:32 - so usually you would want to get a 64 by
00:34 - 64
00:35 - for trinket.io so this is like 256x256
00:39 - but if the icon is too big you can like
00:40 - go into an editor and
00:42 - make it a little bit smaller so yeah
00:46 - um or you can just go to the description
00:48 - below and
00:49 - in the google drive you can download our
00:50 - sprites if you want
00:53 - so without further ado let's start a new
00:55 - trinket so let's click new trinket and
00:57 - click python
00:59 - first first things first we're gonna uh
01:02 - rename our
01:03 - thing to stamping
01:06 - icons so stamping icons and i'm gonna
01:09 - actually make the
01:10 - font a little bit bigger so that you
01:12 - guys can see it better
01:14 - okay so first we're going to import the
01:16 - turtle so then we can actually
01:18 - pen use the pen import turtle
01:24 - so we're going to import the turtle okay
01:28 - so the turtle in python is a
01:30 - pre-installed python library that
01:32 - enables
01:33 - users to create pictures and shapes by
01:35 - providing them with a virtual canvas
01:37 - the on-screen pen that you use for
01:40 - drawing is called the turtle
01:41 - and this is what gives the library its
01:44 - name
01:45 - so yeah it's basically like a pen in
01:46 - python so
01:48 - we also have to import some sprites into
01:51 - here so let's import the sprites
01:53 - so what you want to do is click the
01:54 - image library
01:56 - and then upload a new image so we're
01:58 - going to click here
02:00 - and then we have all of the python stuff
02:03 - so we're just going to
02:05 - get one of these i already had these
02:07 - pre-downloaded
02:08 - um you guys can do whatever you want or
02:12 - you can use these same
02:14 - so we have two space invader monsters i
02:16 - guess
02:17 - and then we're gonna get a spaceship
02:21 - so we're gonna get three sprites and
02:23 - click done so save it
02:25 - and then now you have the three um
02:27 - things from alien uh space invaders
02:30 - so now you wanna click main pi to go
02:32 - back to the code
02:33 - okay so now let's uh
02:36 - make a new variable so let's define the
02:39 - variable my turtle
02:41 - turtle so we're going to define my
02:43 - turtle equals
02:45 - the turtle dot turtle
02:51 - um and then you have to put a
02:53 - parenthesis at the end
02:54 - and then you can add a semicolon if you
02:56 - like and after that you want to get a
02:59 - canvas which is the um basically the
03:02 - stage or the backdrop
03:03 - in scratch you can put an equal sign
03:06 - canvas equals turtle
03:09 - dot screen and then put a parenthesis
03:13 - and you you could put a semicolon and
03:16 - then after that
03:17 - we're gonna add all of the sprites into
03:20 - here
03:21 - so canvas
03:24 - dot add shape
03:28 - add shape and then we're gonna
03:32 - go here so right here we have all the
03:34 - sprites
03:35 - so we're gonna get the alien one dot png
03:38 - so ctrl c and then you gotta put some uh
03:41 - you gotta put quotation marks and put
03:43 - that inside
03:44 - and then next we're gonna put another
03:46 - canvas
03:48 - dot add shape and then put a
03:52 - uh parentheses and a quotation mark
03:56 - and then go into here we're gonna copy
03:58 - paste this alien alien3.png
04:01 - go back to the main pie duplicate it
04:03 - here
04:04 - and then finally can this add
04:08 - shape and then we're going to put a
04:10 - quotation mark and a parenthesis
04:13 - and then we're gonna get the space
04:14 - invaders.png
04:16 - go back to main pi and duplicate it so
04:19 - as you can see
04:20 - we're and then after this we're gonna
04:21 - get one last thing print
04:23 - we're gonna print the canvas dot
04:27 - get shapes shapes
04:30 - and then we're gonna add a parenthesis
04:33 - so when you play this
04:35 - all the different sprites will show up
04:37 - down here
04:38 - with the alien 1 alien 3 space invaders
04:41 - and these are just like
04:42 - the other stuff within the turtle so
04:46 - that's that's what the print thing does
04:47 - it'll just show up right there
04:50 - and after that we're gonna start working
04:52 - on the turtle
04:53 - so first we're gonna make the turtle go
04:55 - up so we're going to do my
04:57 - turtle turtle dot
05:01 - up and then put parentheses and
05:04 - ascend and i also forgot to put
05:06 - semicolons right here
05:08 - um it's optional but i like to do it and
05:11 - after
05:11 - you do that my turtle dot up which
05:14 - basically means
05:15 - moving the turtle up and then we're
05:18 - gonna
05:18 - uh set the x and y position of the
05:21 - turtle so
05:22 - like in scratch we have the go to block
05:24 - in python we have something called go
05:26 - to as well so just do my tool
05:30 - dot go to and then you put a parenthesis
05:34 - negative 200 and then you put a comma
05:37 - zero
05:38 - so this is just a random position
05:41 - i just picked like somewhere somewhere
05:44 - like right here i think
05:46 - and after that we're gonna get something
05:48 - called moving forward so we're gonna do
05:49 - my
05:51 - dot forward so this does what it says
05:54 - just move it forward
05:55 - and then we're going to do this so this
05:57 - means moving forward 50 steps
05:59 - so we're going to put my turtle dot
06:01 - forward and parentheses
06:03 - 50. so this basically is a moving steps
06:06 - in scratch
06:06 - basically moving 50 steps and after that
06:11 - we're going to get a my turtle dot left
06:15 - my so this basically means turning the
06:17 - turtle left
06:20 - [Music]
06:22 - this is turning the turtle to the left
06:23 - side 90 degrees
06:26 - so this hurdle is facing this way so
06:29 - turning 90 degrees to the left would
06:30 - basically mean the turtle's facing up
06:32 - right now so the turtle will be facing
06:35 - up now so after this
06:36 - we're going to add another thing we're
06:38 - going to say my turtle forward 100
06:40 - 100 steps forward so
06:45 - forward and i'm going to do 100 steps
06:51 - okay and that for that we're going to
06:54 - get the shape alien1.png so we're going
06:57 - to get
06:58 - my turtle
07:02 - dot um shape
07:05 - and then we uh alien this thing
07:08 - just copy paste it ctrl c
07:12 - ctrl v and then after that we gotta
07:14 - stamp the thing we gotta stamp the
07:17 - alien1.png
07:18 - so we're gonna do a my turtle
07:22 - dot stamp and then add a parenthesis at
07:26 - the end
07:28 - okay now i'm gonna run the code to show
07:31 - you guys how it works
07:32 - so as you can see the turtle is moving
07:34 - right here and the
07:35 - space invader is showing up so now we
07:38 - have one of the
07:39 - space invaders showing up and now we
07:42 - gotta stamp the other ones
07:43 - so we're going to enter again after it's
07:46 - done stamping
07:47 - we're going to make it turn right so
07:50 - basically i'll be facing
07:52 - like to the side so we're going to do my
07:54 - turn
07:55 - dot right right um
07:58 - and then we're gonna do 90 degrees as
08:00 - well
08:03 - okay um and then after turning right 90
08:06 - degrees
08:06 - we're going to make it move forward
08:07 - again so we'll just move this way we're
08:09 - going to make it
08:10 - my turtle move 100 steps again
08:14 - forward 100
08:18 - and then after moving forward 100 steps
08:20 - we want to
08:21 - make the turtle face left again making
08:23 - it face straight up like this
08:25 - alien invader right now spacing space
08:27 - invader it's alien
08:29 - so we're gonna do my turtle dot
08:33 - my turtle dot um
08:37 - left left and then we're going to do 90
08:40 - degrees
08:42 - okay after turning left we're going to
08:45 - start
08:45 - after like you're right here or
08:47 - something we're going to get the other
08:49 - shape
08:50 - so my turtle uh
08:53 - dot shape
08:56 - dot shape and then we're gonna get the
08:57 - other one so copy paste it
09:00 - the alien invader three
09:03 - so alien three a little bit okay so
09:07 - after this we're gonna stamp it so after
09:10 - we get the shape we're gonna stamp
09:12 - so my turtle
09:16 - stamp and then we're gonna add this
09:19 - semicolon and
09:22 - [Music]
09:24 - after this we're gonna add um we're
09:27 - gonna
09:28 - stamp the last alien invader we're gonna
09:30 - stamp another purple one
09:32 - so we're gonna make it uh turn right
09:34 - again so it will face
09:35 - this way so now move this way so my
09:38 - turtle dot right
09:41 - dot right and then we're going to 90
09:43 - degrees
09:46 - 90 degrees after turning right okay
09:48 - after that we're gonna make the turtle
09:50 - move forward again
09:52 - dot four this is like pretty much the
09:54 - same thing as the other
09:55 - parts and after that after moving
09:58 - forward we're gonna
10:00 - get uh turn left again so then he'll be
10:02 - facing up so that will be upright
10:04 - my turtle dot right
10:08 - i mean sorry not right left so we'll be
10:11 - facing
10:12 - left 90 degrees so and
10:15 - you have to do left 90 degrees i'll be
10:17 - facing up again
10:18 - after you get the left we're gonna add
10:21 - this alien one
10:22 - png again so just to copy paste this
10:26 - okay after copy pasting it we're gonna
10:28 - stamp it of course
10:29 - so i'm gonna do my terminal
10:34 - and then put a parenthesis semicolon
10:38 - after that we're going to finally um
10:41 - get the space invaders so we're going to
10:43 - get the shape space invaders so we don't
10:45 - have to stamp
10:46 - actually like we can just move to the
10:48 - position if you set it
10:49 - before you can just move to the position
10:51 - and it'll actually
10:52 - become the new um sprite so we're gonna
10:55 - actually do this instead we don't have
10:57 - to stand
10:58 - we're gonna do my turtle
11:01 - dot shape and then we're gonna get the
11:04 - space invaders
11:09 - okay so then just put that in here and
11:11 - then
11:12 - semicolon okay so after doing this
11:15 - we can just move to this uh place we
11:18 - want
11:18 - so the place i've got to was a negative
11:21 - 50 negative 100 so we're going to do my
11:23 - turtle
11:24 - dot go to negative 50
11:29 - negative 100 and then we're going to add
11:31 - a semicolon
11:32 - so i'm going to show you the whole game
11:34 - and i'm going to show you them step by
11:35 - step
11:36 - so if you run it it'll be like that
11:40 - it'll change like that and the space in
11:42 - favor so now you got the three
11:43 - little aliens and the space invader so
11:46 - um if you would like to comment out
11:48 - something like making
11:50 - it not able to run in the code just put
11:52 - the pound symbol
11:54 - in other programming languages like
11:55 - slash slash but this is python so it's
11:57 - gonna be fun
11:58 - so i'm gonna show you um
12:02 - um the first two okay so
12:07 - uh let's get it up to here so now it's
12:09 - played
12:12 - so as you can see it you can stamp the
12:15 - two things
12:16 - and let's say we do comment it
12:20 - up to here up to this stamp so now you
12:22 - can see
12:23 - when you run it um
12:26 - you see the three space invaders and
12:29 - then after that
12:30 - it will become and then the spaceship
12:32 - will go down here
12:34 - so yeah that's pretty much the project
12:37 - we're working on today so
12:38 - i'm gonna run it one more time for you
12:40 - guys to see it
12:43 - so as you can see it's a pretty cool
12:44 - project you can do
12:46 - so you can save your project like that
12:49 - so yeah thank you guys for watching
12:51 - don't forget to like
12:53 - share and subscribe and ring the
12:55 - notification bell
12:56 - and i'll see you guys in the next video
13:01 - [Music]
13:04 - bye
13:07 - [Music]
13:10 - you

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today we'll be doing another python tutorial so today we will be doing a stamping project on python so it's like the scratch on scratch how you can use pen on python we're just going to be stamping like icons on the screen so you can use in any image you'd like so like here we have an image and then apple so usually you would want to get a 64 by 64 for trinket.io so this is like 256x256 but if the icon is too big you can like go into an editor and make it a little bit smaller so yeah um or you can just go to the description below and in the google drive you can download our sprites if you want so without further ado let's start a new trinket so let's click new trinket and click python first first things first we're gonna uh rename our thing to stamping icons so stamping icons and i'm gonna actually make the font a little bit bigger so that you guys can see it better okay so first we're going to import the turtle so then we can actually pen use the pen import turtle so we're going to import the turtle okay so the turtle in python is a preinstalled python library that enables users to create pictures and shapes by providing them with a virtual canvas the onscreen pen that you use for drawing is called the turtle and this is what gives the library its name so yeah it's basically like a pen in python so we also have to import some sprites into here so let's import the sprites so what you want to do is click the image library and then upload a new image so we're going to click here and then we have all of the python stuff so we're just going to get one of these i already had these predownloaded um you guys can do whatever you want or you can use these same so we have two space invader monsters i guess and then we're gonna get a spaceship so we're gonna get three sprites and click done so save it and then now you have the three um things from alien uh space invaders so now you wanna click main pi to go back to the code okay so now let's uh make a new variable so let's define the variable my turtle turtle so we're going to define my turtle equals the turtle dot turtle um and then you have to put a parenthesis at the end and then you can add a semicolon if you like and after that you want to get a canvas which is the um basically the stage or the backdrop in scratch you can put an equal sign canvas equals turtle dot screen and then put a parenthesis and you you could put a semicolon and then after that we're gonna add all of the sprites into here so canvas dot add shape add shape and then we're gonna go here so right here we have all the sprites so we're gonna get the alien one dot png so ctrl c and then you gotta put some uh you gotta put quotation marks and put that inside and then next we're gonna put another canvas dot add shape and then put a uh parentheses and a quotation mark and then go into here we're gonna copy paste this alien alien3.png go back to the main pie duplicate it here and then finally can this add shape and then we're going to put a quotation mark and a parenthesis and then we're gonna get the space invaders.png go back to main pi and duplicate it so as you can see we're and then after this we're gonna get one last thing print we're gonna print the canvas dot get shapes shapes and then we're gonna add a parenthesis so when you play this all the different sprites will show up down here with the alien 1 alien 3 space invaders and these are just like the other stuff within the turtle so that's that's what the print thing does it'll just show up right there and after that we're gonna start working on the turtle so first we're gonna make the turtle go up so we're going to do my turtle turtle dot up and then put parentheses and ascend and i also forgot to put semicolons right here um it's optional but i like to do it and after you do that my turtle dot up which basically means moving the turtle up and then we're gonna uh set the x and y position of the turtle so like in scratch we have the go to block in python we have something called go to as well so just do my tool dot go to and then you put a parenthesis negative 200 and then you put a comma zero so this is just a random position i just picked like somewhere somewhere like right here i think and after that we're gonna get something called moving forward so we're gonna do my dot forward so this does what it says just move it forward and then we're going to do this so this means moving forward 50 steps so we're going to put my turtle dot forward and parentheses 50. so this basically is a moving steps in scratch basically moving 50 steps and after that we're going to get a my turtle dot left my so this basically means turning the turtle left this is turning the turtle to the left side 90 degrees so this hurdle is facing this way so turning 90 degrees to the left would basically mean the turtle's facing up right now so the turtle will be facing up now so after this we're going to add another thing we're going to say my turtle forward 100 100 steps forward so forward and i'm going to do 100 steps okay and that for that we're going to get the shape alien1.png so we're going to get my turtle dot um shape and then we uh alien this thing just copy paste it ctrl c ctrl v and then after that we gotta stamp the thing we gotta stamp the alien1.png so we're gonna do a my turtle dot stamp and then add a parenthesis at the end okay now i'm gonna run the code to show you guys how it works so as you can see the turtle is moving right here and the space invader is showing up so now we have one of the space invaders showing up and now we gotta stamp the other ones so we're going to enter again after it's done stamping we're going to make it turn right so basically i'll be facing like to the side so we're going to do my turn dot right right um and then we're gonna do 90 degrees as well okay um and then after turning right 90 degrees we're going to make it move forward again so we'll just move this way we're going to make it my turtle move 100 steps again forward 100 and then after moving forward 100 steps we want to make the turtle face left again making it face straight up like this alien invader right now spacing space invader it's alien so we're gonna do my turtle dot my turtle dot um left left and then we're going to do 90 degrees okay after turning left we're going to start after like you're right here or something we're going to get the other shape so my turtle uh dot shape dot shape and then we're gonna get the other one so copy paste it the alien invader three so alien three a little bit okay so after this we're gonna stamp it so after we get the shape we're gonna stamp so my turtle stamp and then we're gonna add this semicolon and after this we're gonna add um we're gonna stamp the last alien invader we're gonna stamp another purple one so we're gonna make it uh turn right again so it will face this way so now move this way so my turtle dot right dot right and then we're going to 90 degrees 90 degrees after turning right okay after that we're gonna make the turtle move forward again dot four this is like pretty much the same thing as the other parts and after that after moving forward we're gonna get uh turn left again so then he'll be facing up so that will be upright my turtle dot right i mean sorry not right left so we'll be facing left 90 degrees so and you have to do left 90 degrees i'll be facing up again after you get the left we're gonna add this alien one png again so just to copy paste this okay after copy pasting it we're gonna stamp it of course so i'm gonna do my terminal and then put a parenthesis semicolon after that we're going to finally um get the space invaders so we're going to get the shape space invaders so we don't have to stamp actually like we can just move to the position if you set it before you can just move to the position and it'll actually become the new um sprite so we're gonna actually do this instead we don't have to stand we're gonna do my turtle dot shape and then we're gonna get the space invaders okay so then just put that in here and then semicolon okay so after doing this we can just move to this uh place we want so the place i've got to was a negative 50 negative 100 so we're going to do my turtle dot go to negative 50 negative 100 and then we're going to add a semicolon so i'm going to show you the whole game and i'm going to show you them step by step so if you run it it'll be like that it'll change like that and the space in favor so now you got the three little aliens and the space invader so um if you would like to comment out something like making it not able to run in the code just put the pound symbol in other programming languages like slash slash but this is python so it's gonna be fun so i'm gonna show you um um the first two okay so uh let's get it up to here so now it's played so as you can see it you can stamp the two things and let's say we do comment it up to here up to this stamp so now you can see when you run it um you see the three space invaders and then after that it will become and then the spaceship will go down here so yeah that's pretty much the project we're working on today so i'm gonna run it one more time for you guys to see it so as you can see it's a pretty cool project you can do so you can save your project like that so yeah thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe and ring the notification bell and i'll see you guys in the next video bye you
