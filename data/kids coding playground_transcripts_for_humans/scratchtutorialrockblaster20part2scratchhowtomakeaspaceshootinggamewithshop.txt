00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:09 - kids coding playground
00:10 - today is the second part for the rock
00:12 - blaster 2.0
00:13 - so before i'm going to start i'm going
00:15 - to go through the code a little bit
00:18 - and you guys can put anything you missed
00:21 - so this is the custom block for creating
00:24 - the enemies
00:26 - when it starts as a clone what will it
00:28 - do
00:30 - so this is the code for the aliens and
00:32 - rocks
00:33 - so for the player we just have the
00:35 - movement and
00:37 - just the start game right here and then
00:40 - um today we might as well work in the
00:43 - laser
00:44 - today so let's work on the laser so
00:48 - i have two costumes a single shot and
00:50 - triple shot
00:51 - so i'm gonna make it start on the first
00:53 - costume so
00:54 - i'm gonna start with the one flat
00:55 - clicked um
00:57 - switch costume to a single shot and then
01:01 - i'm going to set the size to 10
01:03 - so it isn't too big it'll be like a
01:06 - small laser
01:07 - and then i want it to hide in the
01:08 - beginning
01:10 - and then when i when i receive start
01:12 - game
01:15 - when i receive start game then um i want
01:18 - to get a forever loop
01:22 - forever if key spaces press
01:26 - i'm doing i'm doing um the space bar to
01:28 - shoot you guys can do
01:29 - any key one if space key is pressed then
01:33 - i'll create a clone of myself
01:35 - and wait until not
01:38 - key spaces press so what this does is
01:41 - make it so the player cannot spam
01:44 - um cannot hold the space button and then
01:47 - it will keep on shooting really fast
01:49 - so we just put the weight until not key
01:52 - space press
01:53 - so then you have to like manually click
01:55 - the space bar
01:56 - every time you shoot one bullet so and
01:59 - then
02:00 - let me start as a clone when i start as
02:02 - a clone
02:05 - then you want to go to negative 160
02:10 - as the player go like somewhere right
02:12 - here in the front of the player so
02:14 - negative 116.
02:15 - the player is at negative 180 so you
02:17 - want to go near the front of the player
02:20 - and then you want to get the y position
02:22 - of the player
02:24 - so if you want to do this you have to
02:28 - check this one first
02:30 - player y position so you're going to get
02:33 - the y
02:33 - position of the player and then show
02:38 - repeat until touching the edge
02:41 - so the bullet will keep on moving until
02:43 - it's touching the edge
02:45 - repeat until touching edge
02:51 - and then i want to move ten steps
02:55 - and then delete this clone when it
02:56 - touches the edge
02:59 - okay so
03:03 - now you should be able to shoot at
03:05 - bullets as you can see but the bullets
03:07 - do not kill the aliens yet but you can
03:09 - still shoot
03:10 - as you can see and if i took this out
03:14 - this thing out then you could just spam
03:16 - bullets like this
03:18 - and i didn't want that so definitely
03:21 - remember to put this
03:22 - into your code okay
03:25 - so now let's go back to the um rocks
03:27 - which is basically the aliens
03:29 - and the enemies stuff like that and get
03:32 - an if then statement
03:33 - if touching
03:37 - touching laser
03:41 - then we want to change the money by 100.
03:43 - each enemy
03:44 - you kill you get 100 money
03:48 - you can do it by any amount of money but
03:50 - i'm just gonna do it by 100
03:53 - and then i'm going to make it go to 240
03:57 - 240 and then pick random negative 150
04:01 - one negative 150 and 150 for the y
04:03 - position
04:04 - so 240x is like at the edge right here
04:07 - and then negative 150
04:08 - to 150 y is like from up here to like
04:11 - down there so spawn somewhere randomly
04:13 - from up here to here when it's touching
04:15 - the laser
04:16 - so i'm gonna pick random negative 150
04:21 - to 150
04:24 - and then when it's touching the laser i
04:26 - want to make it play the magic spell
04:29 - so i already have it but uh if you don't
04:32 - have it just go to the sound library
04:33 - and get it that's where i got it from so
04:36 - next i will get
04:37 - make the force wheel so for the force
04:39 - field
04:41 - we can we don't have um the shop yet
04:44 - but let's make some variables first so
04:47 - we're going to be making the uh
04:49 - force field via oops caps lock is on
04:54 - force feel uh
04:57 - force fields variable so this is just to
05:00 - keep track
05:01 - of how many force fields there are and
05:03 - then
05:04 - for the force field code actually let's
05:06 - work on the shot first since
05:08 - the force field is uh you need to buy
05:10 - stuff in order to get the force field
05:12 - so i'm gonna go to the shop real quick
05:16 - then uh when fly clicked
05:22 - hide
05:24 - um oh yeah and and we also have to do
05:27 - the pause button i forgot about that
05:29 - uh in order to get to the shop you have
05:30 - to get to the pause button so first i'm
05:32 - gonna work on the pause button
05:34 - forgot about that sorry about that so
05:36 - i'm gonna get a one flat click for this
05:38 - uh pause button and then we'll need to
05:40 - make a new variable called in
05:41 - shop so this is the um
05:44 - just to detect if it's in the shop so
05:47 - when you press
05:48 - p then it will not pause you in the shop
05:51 - so and then the shopping cart will not
05:53 - show up in the shop so
05:55 - let's make a new variable called in shop
05:57 - and we want to set in shop to no
06:01 - setting shop to know for now so we want
06:03 - to set in shop to no
06:05 - because in the beginning the player is
06:07 - not in the shop
06:09 - so we don't always want to set in shop
06:10 - to know and then
06:12 - we want to go to front layer
06:15 - go to the front layer and then we want
06:18 - to hide in the beginning we don't want
06:19 - the pause button
06:21 - showing in the beginning and we want to
06:23 - make it go to the zero zero so it'll be
06:24 - in the center of the screen
06:26 - and then when the keys p is plot pressed
06:30 - key p is pressed because p for pause
06:33 - then if in shop is equal to note that
06:36 - means the player is not in the shop
06:39 - if in shop is equal to no
06:42 - then we want to show
06:46 - that we want to show the pause button
06:47 - letting the player know it's paused
06:50 - and then we want to broadcast a new
06:51 - message called pause game
06:53 - [Music]
06:55 - so pause game will basically just pause
06:57 - the game
06:58 - pause okay pause game
07:02 - and then next we want to work on the
07:06 - shopping cart
07:07 - so now let's go to the shopping cart so
07:09 - um we already have the one flag clicked
07:11 - hide
07:12 - so i'm gonna receive pause game for the
07:15 - shopping cart then we want to set the
07:16 - size to zero percent
07:18 - so like come in like it'll like start at
07:21 - zero percent
07:22 - and then it'll get bigger it look like
07:24 - it's like
07:25 - zooming in i guess and then you want to
07:27 - go to the front layer
07:30 - i want to point direction of 90 so the
07:32 - shopping cart is facing the right
07:36 - point direction of 90 and then i want to
07:39 - go to 150 negative 70 i already have
07:42 - these coordinates
07:43 - because it was from my backpack but 150
07:46 - negative 70 is like somewhere right here
07:48 - and then we want to make a new variable
07:50 - called turn
07:51 - so this is just to make the um the um
07:55 - shopping cart like tilt left and right
07:59 - so we got to make a new variable called
08:01 - turn i'm going to set the turn to zero
08:06 - i already have turn um because i
08:09 - got the certain backpack so i'm just
08:10 - going to delete it because i just made a
08:12 - new one
08:13 - so i'm going to set the turn to zero in
08:15 - the beginning
08:16 - and show
08:19 - and then forever
08:23 - um change the size
08:28 - change size by
08:31 - 50 minus the size divided by three so
08:34 - this is just to make it
08:35 - like when you move your mouse on it
08:36 - it'll get bigger and when you move your
08:38 - mouse off of it it'll get smaller so
08:40 - let's get a division and a subtraction
08:44 - so 50 minus the size of the
08:48 - shop which is 65
08:52 - size of the shop and then divide it by
08:55 - three
08:56 - and we'll change the size by that and
08:58 - then we want to change the turn by four
09:03 - turn by four and then we want to turn to
09:06 - the right or left
09:09 - turn to the right or left a cosine of
09:12 - turn divided by two so we'll get like a
09:15 - little small number
09:17 - so what cosine is is just make make it a
09:19 - very small number
09:22 - so the cosine ones you have to get the
09:24 - absolute value one
09:25 - click the triangle and
09:28 - cosine of term divided by two
09:38 - um so this is when you put your mouse on
09:40 - it it will kind of like
09:41 - and not you not put your mouse on it
09:43 - then it was just like kind of rotate
09:45 - left and right
09:46 - and then you got an if
09:51 - touching mouse pointer
09:55 - then we want to change the size
09:58 - so if it's touching the mouse pointer
10:00 - we'll change the size bigger else
10:02 - it'll change it smaller right here so
10:05 - we want to get a subtraction and a
10:07 - division
10:10 - the division put in here subtraction in
10:12 - front
10:14 - and then 50 divided by this
10:17 - minus the size
10:21 - divided by three
10:25 - and then next we want to get an if-then
10:27 - statement so if
10:28 - [Music]
10:31 - the in shop is equal to no and you need
10:34 - two ands
10:37 - and so if the if it's not in the shop
10:40 - so if the in shop is equal to no that
10:42 - means the player is not inside the shop
10:45 - then and touching the mouse pointer and
10:48 - mouse down
10:49 - that means it will open the shop and
10:51 - change the in shot to yes
10:53 - so if it's touching the mouse pointer
10:55 - and mouse down
10:57 - so we're doing touching the mouse corner
10:59 - and mouse down so
11:00 - it'll know that it's actually clicking
11:02 - on the button
11:04 - so we're gonna wait until the mouse is
11:07 - down
11:07 - wait until the mouse is down
11:11 - that means the player is clicking then
11:13 - we'll set the in shot to yes
11:16 - letting the pause button know
11:20 - uh player is inside the shot and then we
11:23 - broadcast another message called open
11:26 - shot
11:31 - so this is just to uh call for all of
11:33 - these other buttons
11:35 - so then it will um so then uh
11:39 - call to all these buttons so then it
11:40 - will show up in the shop
11:42 - so i think and then we have one more
11:45 - bit of code right here when i receive
11:48 - open shop
11:49 - hide and stop other scripts in the
11:52 - sprite so then when it's in the shop
11:54 - it'll stop all of this code right here
12:00 - okay stop other scripts in the sprite so
12:03 - i think i'll stop here
12:05 - so that is the shop and uh
12:10 - um and the laser we did that today
12:13 - so i'm just gonna go through the code
12:14 - one last time so
12:17 - if you have anything missing you can put
12:18 - that down right now
12:20 - and with the laser so let's
12:24 - try it out and i forgot one last thing
12:27 - this instead of 50 it should be 75 so
12:30 - then it'll get bigger
12:31 - and i just changed the backdrop to the
12:33 - star in the game
12:35 - but when you're in the shop i'll change
12:36 - to this backdrop but
12:39 - now when you press p it doesn't pause
12:41 - everything yet but now the
12:43 - shop can show up when you click p
12:46 - and then you click on the shop and yeah
12:48 - that's what we have for now
12:50 - as you can see you can move around
12:53 - you can shoot lasers
12:57 - at the enemies and of course the uh
13:00 - rocks and all the aliens don't kill the
13:02 - spaceship yet
13:03 - you press p and you can open the shop
13:06 - but nothing happens yet because we have
13:07 - not done anything to
13:08 - all of these buttons yet so thank you
13:11 - guys for watching
13:12 - don't forget to like share subscribe and
13:15 - ring the notification bell
13:17 - see you guys in the next episode of this
13:19 - game
13:21 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today is the second part for the rock blaster 2.0 so before i'm going to start i'm going to go through the code a little bit and you guys can put anything you missed so this is the custom block for creating the enemies when it starts as a clone what will it do so this is the code for the aliens and rocks so for the player we just have the movement and just the start game right here and then um today we might as well work in the laser today so let's work on the laser so i have two costumes a single shot and triple shot so i'm gonna make it start on the first costume so i'm gonna start with the one flat clicked um switch costume to a single shot and then i'm going to set the size to 10 so it isn't too big it'll be like a small laser and then i want it to hide in the beginning and then when i when i receive start game when i receive start game then um i want to get a forever loop forever if key spaces press i'm doing i'm doing um the space bar to shoot you guys can do any key one if space key is pressed then i'll create a clone of myself and wait until not key spaces press so what this does is make it so the player cannot spam um cannot hold the space button and then it will keep on shooting really fast so we just put the weight until not key space press so then you have to like manually click the space bar every time you shoot one bullet so and then let me start as a clone when i start as a clone then you want to go to negative 160 as the player go like somewhere right here in the front of the player so negative 116. the player is at negative 180 so you want to go near the front of the player and then you want to get the y position of the player so if you want to do this you have to check this one first player y position so you're going to get the y position of the player and then show repeat until touching the edge so the bullet will keep on moving until it's touching the edge repeat until touching edge and then i want to move ten steps and then delete this clone when it touches the edge okay so now you should be able to shoot at bullets as you can see but the bullets do not kill the aliens yet but you can still shoot as you can see and if i took this out this thing out then you could just spam bullets like this and i didn't want that so definitely remember to put this into your code okay so now let's go back to the um rocks which is basically the aliens and the enemies stuff like that and get an if then statement if touching touching laser then we want to change the money by 100. each enemy you kill you get 100 money you can do it by any amount of money but i'm just gonna do it by 100 and then i'm going to make it go to 240 240 and then pick random negative 150 one negative 150 and 150 for the y position so 240x is like at the edge right here and then negative 150 to 150 y is like from up here to like down there so spawn somewhere randomly from up here to here when it's touching the laser so i'm gonna pick random negative 150 to 150 and then when it's touching the laser i want to make it play the magic spell so i already have it but uh if you don't have it just go to the sound library and get it that's where i got it from so next i will get make the force wheel so for the force field we can we don't have um the shop yet but let's make some variables first so we're going to be making the uh force field via oops caps lock is on force feel uh force fields variable so this is just to keep track of how many force fields there are and then for the force field code actually let's work on the shot first since the force field is uh you need to buy stuff in order to get the force field so i'm gonna go to the shop real quick then uh when fly clicked hide um oh yeah and and we also have to do the pause button i forgot about that uh in order to get to the shop you have to get to the pause button so first i'm gonna work on the pause button forgot about that sorry about that so i'm gonna get a one flat click for this uh pause button and then we'll need to make a new variable called in shop so this is the um just to detect if it's in the shop so when you press p then it will not pause you in the shop so and then the shopping cart will not show up in the shop so let's make a new variable called in shop and we want to set in shop to no setting shop to know for now so we want to set in shop to no because in the beginning the player is not in the shop so we don't always want to set in shop to know and then we want to go to front layer go to the front layer and then we want to hide in the beginning we don't want the pause button showing in the beginning and we want to make it go to the zero zero so it'll be in the center of the screen and then when the keys p is plot pressed key p is pressed because p for pause then if in shop is equal to note that means the player is not in the shop if in shop is equal to no then we want to show that we want to show the pause button letting the player know it's paused and then we want to broadcast a new message called pause game so pause game will basically just pause the game pause okay pause game and then next we want to work on the shopping cart so now let's go to the shopping cart so um we already have the one flag clicked hide so i'm gonna receive pause game for the shopping cart then we want to set the size to zero percent so like come in like it'll like start at zero percent and then it'll get bigger it look like it's like zooming in i guess and then you want to go to the front layer i want to point direction of 90 so the shopping cart is facing the right point direction of 90 and then i want to go to 150 negative 70 i already have these coordinates because it was from my backpack but 150 negative 70 is like somewhere right here and then we want to make a new variable called turn so this is just to make the um the um shopping cart like tilt left and right so we got to make a new variable called turn i'm going to set the turn to zero i already have turn um because i got the certain backpack so i'm just going to delete it because i just made a new one so i'm going to set the turn to zero in the beginning and show and then forever um change the size change size by 50 minus the size divided by three so this is just to make it like when you move your mouse on it it'll get bigger and when you move your mouse off of it it'll get smaller so let's get a division and a subtraction so 50 minus the size of the shop which is 65 size of the shop and then divide it by three and we'll change the size by that and then we want to change the turn by four turn by four and then we want to turn to the right or left turn to the right or left a cosine of turn divided by two so we'll get like a little small number so what cosine is is just make make it a very small number so the cosine ones you have to get the absolute value one click the triangle and cosine of term divided by two um so this is when you put your mouse on it it will kind of like and not you not put your mouse on it then it was just like kind of rotate left and right and then you got an if touching mouse pointer then we want to change the size so if it's touching the mouse pointer we'll change the size bigger else it'll change it smaller right here so we want to get a subtraction and a division the division put in here subtraction in front and then 50 divided by this minus the size divided by three and then next we want to get an ifthen statement so if the in shop is equal to no and you need two ands and so if the if it's not in the shop so if the in shop is equal to no that means the player is not inside the shop then and touching the mouse pointer and mouse down that means it will open the shop and change the in shot to yes so if it's touching the mouse pointer and mouse down so we're doing touching the mouse corner and mouse down so it'll know that it's actually clicking on the button so we're gonna wait until the mouse is down wait until the mouse is down that means the player is clicking then we'll set the in shot to yes letting the pause button know uh player is inside the shot and then we broadcast another message called open shot so this is just to uh call for all of these other buttons so then it will um so then uh call to all these buttons so then it will show up in the shop so i think and then we have one more bit of code right here when i receive open shop hide and stop other scripts in the sprite so then when it's in the shop it'll stop all of this code right here okay stop other scripts in the sprite so i think i'll stop here so that is the shop and uh um and the laser we did that today so i'm just gonna go through the code one last time so if you have anything missing you can put that down right now and with the laser so let's try it out and i forgot one last thing this instead of 50 it should be 75 so then it'll get bigger and i just changed the backdrop to the star in the game but when you're in the shop i'll change to this backdrop but now when you press p it doesn't pause everything yet but now the shop can show up when you click p and then you click on the shop and yeah that's what we have for now as you can see you can move around you can shoot lasers at the enemies and of course the uh rocks and all the aliens don't kill the spaceship yet you press p and you can open the shop but nothing happens yet because we have not done anything to all of these buttons yet so thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share subscribe and ring the notification bell see you guys in the next episode of this game
