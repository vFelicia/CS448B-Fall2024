00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's
00:08 - kidscodingplayground here and today
00:10 - we're back for another video
00:12 - this is part two of feed the ghost
00:15 - so um i already renamed it to feed the
00:18 - ghost teaching because i will teach you
00:19 - guys this
00:20 - and a bullseye um if you do not have
00:23 - this code
00:24 - you can just copy this it's just making
00:25 - it glide around the moon
00:27 - um you feel free to pause if you need it
00:30 - clouds this should be simple enough too
00:32 - you can pause this too and
00:35 - um yeah so but it's just going up and
00:38 - down and up and down and up and down so
00:40 - it's for extra detail
00:42 - and ghost we also worked on this it's
00:44 - gonna make it fly around
00:46 - and it's gonna make a clone and it's
00:47 - gonna make five clones of itself
00:49 - and it's gonna hide the real sprite and
00:51 - it's gonna be flying all around
00:53 - the backdrop so
00:56 - yeah before i start please like share
00:59 - subscribe and comment in the comment
01:01 - section below for what else content you
01:02 - want
01:03 - so anyways let's get started on the
01:06 - candy
01:07 - this has a lot of code in it so yeah
01:11 - so when the green flag is clicked
01:15 - it will set candy to 20 you can you can
01:18 - set
01:18 - how much candy you want like you can set
01:20 - like 100 if you want
01:22 - or if yeah or and then set score to zero
01:29 - and also it'll go to the front layer
01:31 - because uh
01:32 - it'll be in front of the ghost when you
01:34 - feed them so go different layer where's
01:36 - that
01:36 - right here and go backward one later
01:42 - you'll also set size to 50 it's already
01:44 - at 50 right now
01:48 - um i actually said 26 i don't know why
01:53 - and um go to x
01:58 - i i have coordinates 0
02:02 - negative 40 140
02:06 - and then no show
02:09 - and then i'll also demo a part of this
02:11 - so what green flag is clicked
02:14 - but forever turn
02:17 - 15 degrees this side so
02:20 - it will look better i guess so here's
02:23 - the forever
02:24 - right here so to see if it goes flying
02:28 - all around both sides everywhere
02:30 - candy's spinning spinning spinning okay
02:32 - so yeah
02:33 - let's just work on getting
02:36 - the candy launched so when i receive
02:41 - space um when the space
02:45 - he's pressed if then
02:48 - you need if that statement if then an
02:51 - and operator if then the candy
02:55 - is greater than zero
03:02 - and the score is not 10 so you need not
03:07 - score equals 10.
03:15 - so yeah and then it will broadcast a new
03:18 - message
03:21 - and wait shoot
03:29 - and also we'll be working on the sound
03:32 - effects this part is optional but if you
03:34 - want it
03:34 - that's fine when i receive shoot so
03:37 - there's some things already have it
03:38 - bite ratio
03:44 - high whoosh you can get them from all
03:47 - from this
03:48 - sprite library prairie like highways
03:51 - for example there's highways right here
03:58 - and crazy laugh right here
04:04 - and also bite
04:10 - so yeah you can get all of them from the
04:11 - sprite library so when i receive
04:13 - shoot it will start sound
04:18 - high loose
04:24 - yeah so we're gonna work on
04:28 - some other things like when i receive
04:31 - shoot
04:32 - repeat 12 times
04:35 - and then it'll get smaller and smaller
04:37 - like you threw it away so
04:39 - change size by
04:42 - minus one minus two
04:45 - and also when i receive shoot
04:49 - it will change
04:54 - when i receive shoot it will change
04:57 - candy
04:59 - by minus one you lost the candy
05:02 - and it will glide
05:06 - it will glide 0.5
05:10 - seconds to where the bullseye is so so
05:12 - it's x
05:14 - and y so glide to where the bullseye is
05:18 - bullseye x and y it's right here and
05:21 - it can be and then if then else
05:24 - statement
05:26 - it's touching the ghost
05:31 - it will broadcast hit ghost so you gotta
05:34 - make a new broadcast
05:35 - broadcast and wait hit ghost
05:43 - it goes and else you miss
05:46 - so basically it will say set miss to y
05:50 - and y stands for yes that means you've
05:52 - missed
05:55 - and it'll broadcast and wait again
05:59 - and you gotta make a new broadcast
06:03 - message
06:04 - miss
06:07 - okay so we're gonna work on some sound
06:09 - effects like when i receive
06:11 - hit ghost i'll start sound bite because
06:15 - you
06:15 - hit the ghost with the candy and it will
06:17 - eat the candy
06:18 - so start sound bite and also when you
06:22 - miss
06:26 - it will make the crazy laugh
06:35 - yeah so we have some other code to do
06:38 - so when i receive
06:43 - what i receive hit ghost or wait 0.5
06:49 - seconds
06:49 - 0.5 seconds
06:54 - and then you need if then statement
06:58 - if then the score equals 10.
07:09 - squared equals 10 and then it will
07:12 - broadcast what
07:16 - the broadcast win so i have it right
07:19 - here
07:25 - one in weight broadcast winning wait
07:41 - another if then statement if then
07:45 - the candy in the end the candy equals
07:49 - zero
07:57 - and not the score equals 10 you
07:59 - basically lose
08:08 - so yeah and also broadcast lose and wait
08:12 - so you gotta make a new one
08:13 - broadcast lose
08:18 - and wait so yeah we also have some other
08:22 - code for us to do
08:23 - and so when i receive hit ghost
08:31 - it will change score
08:35 - by one
08:40 - so change score by one
08:45 - and say got it
08:54 - for 0.5 seconds it'll hide
09:01 - and wait 0.5 seconds
09:10 - also set size to 50 so it will become 50
09:13 - because once you throw the candy
09:15 - it will um shrink and we want it to be
09:18 - 50
09:19 - again so it will set size to
09:23 - 50.
09:26 - and also go to the coordinate i have
09:30 - and show
09:36 - and also we have some a little bit more
09:38 - code to do
09:39 - like when i receive
09:42 - when i receive miss
09:46 - it will wait 0.5 seconds
09:52 - and you need if then statement
09:56 - if then the candy equals zero
10:04 - if the candy equals zero then it will
10:07 - broadcast
10:08 - lose and wait
10:16 - i just lose and wait and then when i
10:18 - receive
10:22 - miss
10:26 - it will say missed
10:35 - for 0.5 seconds again
10:39 - and it will hide
10:44 - and then it'll wait 0.5 seconds so we're
10:47 - almost done with
10:48 - this code and also
10:51 - i'll set size to fit
10:58 - i'll go to my written coordinate down
11:02 - and it'll show
11:10 - show and it will set
11:14 - mist
11:17 - to a
11:22 - so the mist the set mist to end
11:25 - means that if you miss it you have to
11:28 - reset the variable or every single time
11:30 - it will miss so we'll also be working on
11:32 - the banner
11:33 - i also have this dude so it is v10 goes
11:37 - to win
11:38 - win and loss so i'm going to demo the
11:40 - game before i do this code
11:42 - so as you can see it's working the
11:44 - bull's eye is going everywhere
11:45 - and the candy is spinning around there's
11:47 - ghosts flying everywhere
11:49 - and as you can see it goes where the
11:50 - bullseye is so yeah
11:53 - we will be um working on the banner next
11:56 - so
11:58 - i have all the costumes here the start
12:01 - win and lose so yeah
12:04 - start win lose so you have to make these
12:06 - so when the green flag is clicked
12:10 - it will go to x
12:16 - 0 6 yet this is the coordinate it'll go
12:19 - to the front
12:22 - layer
12:24 - so go in front of the ghost and the
12:26 - candies you know switch costume to start
12:31 - you start because start is the v10 goes
12:34 - to win
12:35 - and then it'll show wait one second
12:39 - so you can read it
12:43 - then then hide so yeah so
12:47 - you can feel free to pause whenever you
12:48 - want to and
12:50 - yeah so when i receive one
12:56 - win it'll switch costume
13:01 - to one
13:05 - and uh it will show
13:10 - and it will stop everything
13:15 - the second block is really similar to
13:19 - um the second block when you loose is
13:21 - really similar you just have to change
13:22 - up some things so i'm just gonna
13:24 - so you just have to right click here and
13:27 - not add comment not delete block
13:29 - duplicate and then you go here and then
13:31 - when i receive
13:32 - lose instead let's switch costume to the
13:35 - losing one
13:36 - will show and stop all so i can review
13:38 - this again so start as feed 10 goes to
13:40 - win
13:41 - win one lose you lose and yeah
13:46 - so i'm gonna just um demo the game
13:50 - so as you can see it says speed 10 goes
13:52 - to win a bunch of ghosts flying
13:54 - everywhere there's actually five of them
13:56 - and then um you throw the candy and it
13:59 - says missed
14:01 - and then it says got it then you throw
14:03 - it again it goes where the bull's eye is
14:10 - so your candy's going down each time you
14:12 - throw the candy
14:27 - right here
14:30 - [Music]
14:36 - see it works so i'm i'm sure the wind
14:39 - function also works too
14:41 - so to speed up the process for you guys
14:43 - so we sped up the process for you guys
14:45 - i have five more candies left and i hope
14:47 - i can win here
14:49 - [Music]
14:51 - so yeah i'm gonna try to win here
14:55 - um i'm waiting for the bullseye to hit a
14:57 - ghost
14:58 - and got it and the you win function
15:02 - works too so as you can see
15:06 - so please like share
15:10 - subscribe and comment in the comment
15:13 - section below for what else
15:14 - content you want so anyways see you guys
15:28 - you

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's kidscodingplayground here and today we're back for another video this is part two of feed the ghost so um i already renamed it to feed the ghost teaching because i will teach you guys this and a bullseye um if you do not have this code you can just copy this it's just making it glide around the moon um you feel free to pause if you need it clouds this should be simple enough too you can pause this too and um yeah so but it's just going up and down and up and down and up and down so it's for extra detail and ghost we also worked on this it's gonna make it fly around and it's gonna make a clone and it's gonna make five clones of itself and it's gonna hide the real sprite and it's gonna be flying all around the backdrop so yeah before i start please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below for what else content you want so anyways let's get started on the candy this has a lot of code in it so yeah so when the green flag is clicked it will set candy to 20 you can you can set how much candy you want like you can set like 100 if you want or if yeah or and then set score to zero and also it'll go to the front layer because uh it'll be in front of the ghost when you feed them so go different layer where's that right here and go backward one later you'll also set size to 50 it's already at 50 right now um i actually said 26 i don't know why and um go to x i i have coordinates 0 negative 40 140 and then no show and then i'll also demo a part of this so what green flag is clicked but forever turn 15 degrees this side so it will look better i guess so here's the forever right here so to see if it goes flying all around both sides everywhere candy's spinning spinning spinning okay so yeah let's just work on getting the candy launched so when i receive space um when the space he's pressed if then you need if that statement if then an and operator if then the candy is greater than zero and the score is not 10 so you need not score equals 10. so yeah and then it will broadcast a new message and wait shoot and also we'll be working on the sound effects this part is optional but if you want it that's fine when i receive shoot so there's some things already have it bite ratio high whoosh you can get them from all from this sprite library prairie like highways for example there's highways right here and crazy laugh right here and also bite so yeah you can get all of them from the sprite library so when i receive shoot it will start sound high loose yeah so we're gonna work on some other things like when i receive shoot repeat 12 times and then it'll get smaller and smaller like you threw it away so change size by minus one minus two and also when i receive shoot it will change when i receive shoot it will change candy by minus one you lost the candy and it will glide it will glide 0.5 seconds to where the bullseye is so so it's x and y so glide to where the bullseye is bullseye x and y it's right here and it can be and then if then else statement it's touching the ghost it will broadcast hit ghost so you gotta make a new broadcast broadcast and wait hit ghost it goes and else you miss so basically it will say set miss to y and y stands for yes that means you've missed and it'll broadcast and wait again and you gotta make a new broadcast message miss okay so we're gonna work on some sound effects like when i receive hit ghost i'll start sound bite because you hit the ghost with the candy and it will eat the candy so start sound bite and also when you miss it will make the crazy laugh yeah so we have some other code to do so when i receive what i receive hit ghost or wait 0.5 seconds 0.5 seconds and then you need if then statement if then the score equals 10. squared equals 10 and then it will broadcast what the broadcast win so i have it right here one in weight broadcast winning wait another if then statement if then the candy in the end the candy equals zero and not the score equals 10 you basically lose so yeah and also broadcast lose and wait so you gotta make a new one broadcast lose and wait so yeah we also have some other code for us to do and so when i receive hit ghost it will change score by one so change score by one and say got it for 0.5 seconds it'll hide and wait 0.5 seconds also set size to 50 so it will become 50 because once you throw the candy it will um shrink and we want it to be 50 again so it will set size to 50. and also go to the coordinate i have and show and also we have some a little bit more code to do like when i receive when i receive miss it will wait 0.5 seconds and you need if then statement if then the candy equals zero if the candy equals zero then it will broadcast lose and wait i just lose and wait and then when i receive miss it will say missed for 0.5 seconds again and it will hide and then it'll wait 0.5 seconds so we're almost done with this code and also i'll set size to fit i'll go to my written coordinate down and it'll show show and it will set mist to a so the mist the set mist to end means that if you miss it you have to reset the variable or every single time it will miss so we'll also be working on the banner i also have this dude so it is v10 goes to win win and loss so i'm going to demo the game before i do this code so as you can see it's working the bull's eye is going everywhere and the candy is spinning around there's ghosts flying everywhere and as you can see it goes where the bullseye is so yeah we will be um working on the banner next so i have all the costumes here the start win and lose so yeah start win lose so you have to make these so when the green flag is clicked it will go to x 0 6 yet this is the coordinate it'll go to the front layer so go in front of the ghost and the candies you know switch costume to start you start because start is the v10 goes to win and then it'll show wait one second so you can read it then then hide so yeah so you can feel free to pause whenever you want to and yeah so when i receive one win it'll switch costume to one and uh it will show and it will stop everything the second block is really similar to um the second block when you loose is really similar you just have to change up some things so i'm just gonna so you just have to right click here and not add comment not delete block duplicate and then you go here and then when i receive lose instead let's switch costume to the losing one will show and stop all so i can review this again so start as feed 10 goes to win win one lose you lose and yeah so i'm gonna just um demo the game so as you can see it says speed 10 goes to win a bunch of ghosts flying everywhere there's actually five of them and then um you throw the candy and it says missed and then it says got it then you throw it again it goes where the bull's eye is so your candy's going down each time you throw the candy right here see it works so i'm i'm sure the wind function also works too so to speed up the process for you guys so we sped up the process for you guys i have five more candies left and i hope i can win here so yeah i'm gonna try to win here um i'm waiting for the bullseye to hit a ghost and got it and the you win function works too so as you can see so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below for what else content you want so anyways see you guys you
