00:00 - [Music]
00:08 - hello guys welcome back to kids calling
00:10 - playground channel so today we'll be
00:12 - working on this game called duck hunt
00:15 - this game i used to play when i was a
00:17 - kid you know in the 80s 1980s
00:21 - so i remember i have like the yellow and
00:23 - white laser gun that i used to shoot
00:26 - and you know it was really fun so you
00:29 - can shoot the ducks and you can do also
00:31 - shoot the clay pigeon back then
00:34 - it was uh
00:35 - on nes so that was a nintendo
00:38 - really old game but it was really fun
00:39 - game so i thought of making this game i
00:41 - already
00:42 - have worked on it at this game in the
00:44 - past a bit but didn't didn't really
00:46 - complete it so i had some time over
00:50 - the two weeks ago so i was working on
00:51 - this so thought of sharing it with you
00:53 - guys okay
00:55 - so
00:57 - uh so what we're gonna learn so we will
00:59 - be learning these uh following concept
01:01 - in scratch uh mouse control
01:04 - uh we have some uh broadcasting messages
01:07 - between the sprite custom block
01:10 - variable list sensing and operator so
01:13 - we'll use some of these uh concept to
01:15 - make this game
01:16 - okay without further ado let me show you
01:18 - the game how it looks like
01:21 - okay so this is the duckhunt game so let
01:23 - me play this
01:25 - so
01:26 - you can you see the dog is kind of
01:28 - slipping around looking for the
01:31 - for the ducks so the ducks kind of fly
01:33 - around
01:35 - i'm missing
01:36 - so when you get one done you get this
01:39 - red mark here so it's blinking for the
01:41 - second duck and you get three shots so
01:46 - so
01:47 - so if you let's say if i miss
01:49 - all the shot
01:52 - then you see the blood that fire flies
01:54 - away and then the dog kind of laugh at
01:55 - you so but if you get all the stuff and
01:59 - you get the ducks
02:00 - then the dog will come out wherever the
02:02 - ducks drop and they'll pick up that duck
02:05 - so you see so i miss one ducks right so
02:10 - so you just get some points so at the
02:13 - end you know we'll
02:14 - just say oh you did good or you did that
02:17 - and if you did good then you just
02:19 - continue again you can make it harder
02:21 - you know like maybe
02:22 - like a second stage you can make it like
02:25 - let's say uh
02:26 - you know uh the duck flies a little bit
02:29 - faster
02:30 - or you can maybe add more ducks
02:33 - so this is my last stop here
02:36 - okay so i missed and then the
02:39 - flies away and then you know it resets
02:41 - and it starts kind of start over
02:43 - and you know that's how the game works
02:47 - so uh you know that's it that's how the
02:50 - game works right now
02:51 - so let me kind of show you how how we
02:54 - code this okay
02:55 - all right so um
02:58 - so this game i downloaded some sprites
03:02 - so this is where i downloaded the uh the
03:05 - sprite from this website uh sprite
03:07 - resources and now you can
03:17 - use other downl i use this tool this is
03:19 - a game maker studio too that we use you
03:21 - can actually make other kind of game so
03:24 - i use that to cut up all my ducks you
03:26 - can see i have different ducks here
03:29 - so different ducks the dog you know you
03:31 - can cut up the different dog and then
03:33 - you can stitch them up together you know
03:36 - to form the animation so you see the dog
03:39 - with one duck the dog with two ducks and
03:42 - dog with three ducks i'm not really
03:43 - using these these other one the dog with
03:46 - three are two ducks and three ducks
03:48 - because uh you know uh we only have one
03:51 - ducks right now uh if you have more than
03:53 - one that's a little bit complicated it
03:55 - will be a little bit harder maybe later
03:57 - we can do that to expand the game
03:59 - but uh for right now it's just one duck
04:01 - mode so and then you have the dog
04:03 - laughing at us
04:05 - stuff like that
04:06 - okay and then you have the background
04:09 - and kind of like that so i cut them all
04:11 - up for you guys already
04:13 - so you can you can just kind of use it
04:15 - as it's okay
04:17 - so let's go back to our game here
04:21 - okay so we'll create a new game
04:25 - new
04:27 - okay
04:29 - all right so i already have some of the
04:31 - uh stuff in my backpack
04:33 - uh so just
04:35 - so i just gonna drag them in
04:37 - and i'll upload this all to our google
04:39 - drive also if you uh you can just i'll
04:42 - go down who drive to to download
04:45 - and also the uh
04:47 - if you don't know how to do that you can
04:48 - just go to the share uh
04:51 - share project and then just export the
04:53 - uh the
04:54 - you know are the sprite that'll be good
04:56 - enough so i'm just gonna drag them all
04:58 - in and i'm gonna show you how it works
05:01 - okay
05:02 - so we have to come out the background as
05:04 - well
05:06 - okay so for the background we just go
05:08 - back to the background we are going to
05:10 - grab this
05:12 - uh this is our background for the
05:14 - duck hunt
05:16 - and then this is the pink background
05:18 - where the ducks flies away okay so
05:22 - there's two different color okay
05:25 - all right so i'll show you how it works
05:29 - okay so the target is pretty easy
05:32 - so you can just draw the circle okay and
05:34 - then draw the cross i think this was the
05:36 - old one that i had i mean it doesn't
05:39 - it's not even in the center let me just
05:41 - make a new one so i think that was the
05:43 - old one i have done uh the bat game
05:46 - using similar oops using similar uh
05:50 - sprites so i just took it from there so
05:52 - let's just paint a new one
05:54 - here so uh we'll use this pink uh color
05:57 - as well this orange color let's just use
06:00 - the same one
06:01 - okay so let's just paint this real quick
06:04 - so i will paint it with this actually we
06:07 - need this color the outside
06:10 - so let's go back over here let's
06:13 - use that
06:14 - color
06:16 - what is this 100 hundred okay
06:20 - 10
06:22 - 100 100
06:23 - okay so just let's do a no feel
06:28 - just hold the shift
06:31 - oopsie
06:33 - always mess that up
06:36 - okay so and then you can just draw
06:38 - to
06:40 - kind of hold the
06:41 - shift key and draw a straight line
06:45 - hold the shift key draw a straight line
06:47 - you can just move it
06:49 - there you go so we have our target
06:52 - so let's see how it looks like if we put
06:54 - it in the zero position let's put it
06:57 - zero zero
07:00 - okay so that looks okay
07:03 - so uh if you want us
07:05 - shorter longer you can do that
07:08 - you can do a little bit shorter
07:12 - okay
07:15 - okay all right so we have our target so
07:18 - let's trash the oh and the old one
07:19 - actually looks worse so let's take that
07:22 - into one okay all right so we have to
07:24 - target so far um the dog as you can see
07:28 - the dog has like custom the dog all of
07:30 - them are done
07:31 - and the dog
07:32 - that jumps in and then the ducks and
07:35 - everything and then you have the ducks
07:38 - you have the ducks flying different
07:40 - custom flying
07:41 - and then this is the duck when you die
07:43 - falls down okay the ground the ground
07:46 - sprite so the ground sprite is just this
07:48 - so we're gonna use this to kind of cover
07:50 - the dark in the background
07:52 - so it kind of blend in with the uh with
07:54 - the project with the uh with the
07:56 - backdrop so the backdrop is like this as
07:58 - well so i'll create another ground
08:00 - sprite basically just the backdrop piece
08:02 - here
08:03 - so this ground you can see i can move it
08:05 - right so basically we are moving putting
08:08 - a ground sprite on top of that so later
08:10 - we can
08:11 - hide the dog when they pick up the ducks
08:14 - so you see how this dog like this
08:17 - so you can see the dog like this so we
08:19 - can kind of hide his body like this so
08:21 - that it doesn't cover a little bit of
08:23 - his body okay that's why we had that uh
08:26 - ground
08:27 - and then we can use that to uh detect
08:29 - touching and then we have the uh this is
08:31 - the shooting the how many shots you have
08:34 - so you have three bullet two bullet one
08:36 - bullet and then no bullet
08:38 - and this is the ducks with the white
08:40 - ducks
08:41 - okay
08:42 - so let's see let me see where this white
08:44 - duck is let's hide okay you see the
08:46 - white ducks and then you have the red
08:48 - ducks okay all right so this is all the
08:51 - sprite that we need
08:53 - okay so let's start the coding
08:57 - okay so let's put it put some code on
09:00 - the ground first and we're here so let's
09:02 - just go um when green flags are clicked
09:05 - we're gonna put it at zero zero position
09:08 - so
09:10 - so let's just do zero zero
09:12 - so that will just keep him you see i put
09:15 - it already over here because since that
09:17 - one is in the bottom here so it fit
09:19 - perfectly so put zero zero
09:22 - okay
09:23 - okay so when we uh go to the backdrop
09:27 - what we can do is uh when green flap is
09:29 - clicked
09:30 - same thing what we want to do is we're
09:32 - gonna switch to background number one
09:35 - okay number one which is the blue sky
09:38 - and then the pink sky okay so number one
09:40 - when the game start we'll use that
09:43 - okay
09:44 - all right
09:45 - and then later we'll call some more okay
09:47 - let's go back to the dark
09:51 - okay so for the dog we are going to use
09:54 - the uh
09:55 - when green flap is clipped
09:57 - uh what we're going to do is we are
09:59 - going to do the weight
10:02 - and then we're going to do the height
10:03 - first actually we're going to hide the
10:05 - sprite in the beginning i'm going to
10:07 - wait for a half a second okay 0.5
10:10 - uh what we want to do is we're going to
10:12 - switch to dark one dark one which is
10:14 - this dot right here
10:16 - okay so dark one
10:19 - and then we are going to move into a
10:21 - position
10:23 - so let's move them like somewhere like
10:25 - right here okay so you can see right um
10:30 - around this this path or whatever or you
10:32 - can move it a little bit further and
10:34 - you'll kind of walk through here and
10:35 - then we'll jump here so what we're going
10:37 - to do is we're going to move into
10:40 - negative 182
10:42 - and
10:43 - negative 95 so let's just start let's
10:46 - see how it looks so you can see
10:48 - the dog but we have high right so we
10:51 - must show it okay
10:52 - so
10:53 - we have to show it back so make sure
10:55 - also we want to go into the front layer
10:58 - okay so that it will come up in the
11:00 - front of this uh
11:01 - ground block
11:03 - then we have to say go to front layer
11:05 - and then show okay so now we run this
11:08 - you should see the dock now so you can
11:10 - see the dots over here
11:12 - okay all right so we're going to make
11:13 - the dot kind of walk and then jump here
11:16 - okay so next we're going to use a repeat
11:19 - loop
11:21 - okay we want to repeat twice
11:23 - two times
11:25 - and we are going to start with the dark
11:27 - custom one
11:32 - anyway we already at one here so one
11:34 - just in case you know in case we change
11:36 - something but really this one may not be
11:39 - needed but it's kind of easy to see when
11:41 - we're doing this so that way you can
11:44 - see how how we just kind of copy and
11:46 - paste the code so we're going to say
11:48 - move 10 step
11:50 - and then we are going to say weight
11:54 - 0.1 okay so what we're going to do is
11:57 - we're going to change the costume first
11:59 - time
12:00 - then we are going to use the second
12:02 - costume
12:03 - okay
12:05 - then we are going to use the third
12:07 - costume
12:09 - the third costume
12:12 - and we'll do the fourth costume
12:16 - okay fourth class two so these are all
12:18 - the four so one two three and four
12:22 - they're all walking right so we do full
12:25 - costume
12:27 - and then we have the some sound so we
12:29 - have the
12:29 - laughing sound
12:32 - this is caught in the duck
12:34 - this is the dog sniffing
12:37 - and this is the dark blocking so we're
12:39 - going to use some of this sound so it's
12:41 - already loaded pre-loaded to the so i
12:43 - added to the to the sprite for you guys
12:45 - okay so what we're going to do is
12:50 - okay so click on this so play sound
12:53 - sound here
12:55 - play sound okay we're gonna say play
12:58 - sound sniffing sound so the dog will
13:00 - walk walk walk over here and then do the
13:02 - sniffing sound twice
13:04 - okay after that we are going to switch
13:07 - to the costume
13:10 - so dog number five
13:13 - so dog number five is when the dog kind
13:15 - of see it so this is outside the loop so
13:17 - just kind of zoom out a little bit you
13:19 - see the repeat two time so this one is
13:21 - outside
13:22 - so and then we're gonna do another
13:24 - weight
13:26 - uh 0.3
13:29 - and then this time we are going to play
13:31 - the
13:32 - sound of the top barking
13:34 - okay
13:35 - then we're gonna switch to costume
13:38 - number six
13:41 - okay number six
13:43 - that is the dock when you kind of look
13:45 - up number six you can see number six
13:48 - okay number five look up so number six
13:50 - it's kinda like he's gonna jump in okay
13:52 - number seven also jump
13:54 - okay so we are going to use number six
13:57 - and then what we're going to do is we're
13:58 - going to make the dot kind of glide here
14:00 - and then we're gonna glide here twice so
14:03 - so for the first time we'll glide like
14:04 - somewhere in this position so
14:07 - kind of i have to position down but um
14:09 - just kind of glide so we kind of see
14:12 - where we want to glide so we're gonna do
14:14 - 0.2 second
14:16 - and glide to actually negative 66
14:19 - and
14:20 - negative 58
14:22 - okay and then and then whatever it is
14:25 - and then i'm going to try to glide one
14:26 - more time like higher so after that i'm
14:29 - gonna switch to costume number seven
14:34 - and then we're gonna apply a little bit
14:36 - higher so for negative so we're gonna go
14:39 - more a higher will be positive a little
14:41 - bit higher right so it'll be
14:43 - a negative 41 okay and then negative
14:46 - 17. so you can kind of just move them
14:49 - like this and then like this so it
14:51 - doesn't really have to be exactly the
14:53 - position okay but uh this is what i had
14:55 - in the whole game so it looks pretty
14:57 - good
14:58 - and then after that we want to hide the
15:00 - dog so we jump into the grass we'll hide
15:02 - him
15:03 - and then we will broadcast a message
15:07 - okay
15:08 - and then say
15:09 - start game
15:11 - so this will start the game this message
15:14 - will help us to
15:15 - broadcast that game for other people to
15:17 - do okay so let's run this real quick so
15:20 - you can see the dock sniffing twice
15:23 - and then the dog block and then he'll
15:25 - jump into the background and then hide
15:28 - okay so after this point we're gonna
15:30 - start and then the ducks can be flying
15:32 - around
15:34 - okay so next thing we are going to do is
15:36 - come to the target first
15:38 - so when green flag is clicked
15:41 - uh what we're going to do is we're going
15:42 - to create some variable actually let's
15:44 - create score
15:46 - okay
15:49 - okay after that we'll create
15:54 - shot that is actually getting when the
15:56 - duck gets shot
15:58 - and then we'll make one more call bullet
16:02 - okay
16:03 - all right so we're gonna hide these we
16:05 - don't really need that we can keep the
16:06 - score maybe on the bottom here doesn't
16:09 - really matter
16:10 - okay so what we're going to do is when
16:12 - the green flag is clicked we're going to
16:13 - reset the score real quick
16:16 - and now we have the dog right the dog's
16:17 - broadcast stop game so what we're going
16:20 - to do is
16:21 - i'm going to say when i receive start
16:23 - game
16:25 - um
16:26 - and then we're going to say set
16:30 - dot
16:31 - shot to zero so zero meaning the duck
16:33 - did not get shot
16:34 - the duck is still flying did not die yet
16:37 - okay
16:38 - and then you
16:39 - pull it we're gonna put three so we need
16:42 - to put it here instead of here because
16:44 - you know when we kill the ducks we'll
16:47 - have a new duck flying and then we have
16:48 - to reset this variable so we can
16:51 - broadcast start game again so that's why
16:53 - we reset it so we'll put it over here
16:55 - okay
16:56 - not in here so only the score will reset
16:59 - it one time so these will get reset
17:01 - every time the ducks got killed
17:03 - okay so position we're gonna position to
17:05 - zero zero so put the this guy in the
17:08 - middle
17:09 - and we're gonna do a little wait so just
17:12 - before the game start we'll do a little
17:14 - wait
17:15 - and then what we're going to do is we
17:17 - are going to create some custom blocks
17:20 - actually so
17:21 - we call it control target
17:24 - so using a custom block one thing is we
17:26 - can reuse the code so we're going to
17:29 - make we are going to make a code for
17:31 - moving the the target and we can use it
17:34 - in the uh you know when the game start
17:36 - and later when we
17:38 - when the when we go to the next level or
17:40 - when the auto ducts shot you can call
17:42 - the blocks again we don't want to repeat
17:44 - the code so
17:46 - so on this you say okay forever
17:51 - okay and then you say
17:53 - set
17:56 - set x
17:58 - and then we're going to say set y
18:00 - uh we're gonna set it to the mouse x
18:04 - and mouse y okay
18:07 - and then we're also going to make it go
18:10 - to front layer so that you can go on
18:13 - from everything
18:15 - and then we will check if they actually
18:18 - have the bullet around the fire the shot
18:20 - so
18:21 - if all it is
18:23 - so we're gonna use operator check
18:26 - create at zero
18:28 - so one two three is greater than zero
18:30 - right so
18:32 - so bullet greater than zero
18:34 - and then we are checking if it's
18:36 - actually have the mouse is down
18:38 - so if it's have the
18:40 - mouse down
18:42 - mouse down
18:44 - then we will start the sound
18:49 - so what we want to do is we want to
18:50 - start sounding not use it until done so
18:53 - that way it wasn't will not block the
18:55 - next set of code
18:56 - so we are going to
18:58 - cover a new event
19:01 - um
19:02 - event called shot
19:04 - fire so this is fire in the shot
19:08 - and then we're going to change the
19:09 - variable since we used one of the uh
19:12 - bullets right we're going to say minus
19:14 - one
19:15 - and we're gonna put a little weight here
19:17 - so that you know it doesn't kind of span
19:19 - through it
19:21 - all right
19:23 - okay so let's just try real quick what
19:26 - we had so far
19:27 - so we have the control block here
19:30 - and then this is starting with the game
19:32 - so let's see so in the beginning we
19:35 - cannot really move yet so you see it's
19:37 - kind of in the middle we're not moving
19:38 - yet so once the dock kind of jumps in
19:44 - okay so i forgot to call the method so
19:48 - so even though there's so many times or
19:50 - sometimes you forget so here you go we
19:53 - forgot to call the control block so
19:55 - that's why this thing wasn't following
19:56 - me okay let's go again
19:58 - so
19:59 - let's see
20:00 - all right
20:02 - so once it's done it jumps in so you can
20:04 - see
20:05 - the control is following me okay so if i
20:08 - click on the bullet you can see
20:11 - it's okay i don't have the uh picture
20:13 - yet but you can kind of see right if i
20:15 - open the bullet you see two
20:17 - one right so you cannot shoot anymore
20:20 - when you have normal bullet but if you
20:22 - have more bullet then you can shoot you
20:24 - can see right so let's start again so
20:26 - you can see the dog kind of go into the
20:28 - back
20:31 - and then you can fire
20:35 - there you go so this is what it is so
20:37 - far
20:39 - okay so uh we will actually add a little
20:41 - bit more and then i think we'll call it
20:43 - uh done for this uh
20:45 - first
20:46 - first
20:47 - tutorial so let's
20:49 - finish it real quick let's work on this
20:51 - piece here
20:52 - so uh this one is when we
20:55 - start
20:58 - uh what we want to do is we're gonna put
21:00 - in some way here you can see
21:03 - he's actually behind this block
21:06 - so uh
21:07 - while making go to the front layer so
21:09 - let's go put into a position
21:11 - let's put them around here so 175 155
21:16 - in the beginning we're gonna hide
21:19 - and then when we receive
21:24 - uh skin start game where we broadcast
21:27 - when the dog jumps into the
21:28 - woods uh we are going to say switch to
21:32 - costume
21:33 - number one which is shot we have three
21:36 - bullets
21:37 - and what we're going to do is make it go
21:39 - to the front layer
21:41 - and then we are going to show it so that
21:43 - in the beginning we don't see it after
21:45 - the game start or see it
21:47 - and then when we say um
21:51 - receive where is it
21:54 - when i receive
21:55 - shot fire so this time we are going to
21:58 - say next costume
22:01 - okay
22:03 - and then starts
22:04 - so far so uh okay so we're gonna add
22:07 - more coal later on but let's just test
22:08 - it real quick
22:10 - so as you can see the dog kind of
22:12 - sniffing his way and then jump in
22:15 - and then you can see the oh what comes
22:17 - here you can shoot see they have one
22:19 - bullet too
22:21 - then no more right
22:23 - okay so so far this is what we have so
22:25 - far okay
22:27 - all right so
22:29 - this is uh we'll end the tutorial here
22:31 - and then we'll create another tutorial
22:32 - so i don't want to be too long so uh if
22:35 - you guys enjoy the video please give us
22:37 - a thumbs up uh put in some comments for
22:40 - us
22:41 - and share it with your friends all right
22:42 - thank you see you guys next time bye

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome back to kids calling playground channel so today we'll be working on this game called duck hunt this game i used to play when i was a kid you know in the 80s 1980s so i remember i have like the yellow and white laser gun that i used to shoot and you know it was really fun so you can shoot the ducks and you can do also shoot the clay pigeon back then it was uh on nes so that was a nintendo really old game but it was really fun game so i thought of making this game i already have worked on it at this game in the past a bit but didn't didn't really complete it so i had some time over the two weeks ago so i was working on this so thought of sharing it with you guys okay so uh so what we're gonna learn so we will be learning these uh following concept in scratch uh mouse control uh we have some uh broadcasting messages between the sprite custom block variable list sensing and operator so we'll use some of these uh concept to make this game okay without further ado let me show you the game how it looks like okay so this is the duckhunt game so let me play this so you can you see the dog is kind of slipping around looking for the for the ducks so the ducks kind of fly around i'm missing so when you get one done you get this red mark here so it's blinking for the second duck and you get three shots so so so if you let's say if i miss all the shot then you see the blood that fire flies away and then the dog kind of laugh at you so but if you get all the stuff and you get the ducks then the dog will come out wherever the ducks drop and they'll pick up that duck so you see so i miss one ducks right so so you just get some points so at the end you know we'll just say oh you did good or you did that and if you did good then you just continue again you can make it harder you know like maybe like a second stage you can make it like let's say uh you know uh the duck flies a little bit faster or you can maybe add more ducks so this is my last stop here okay so i missed and then the flies away and then you know it resets and it starts kind of start over and you know that's how the game works so uh you know that's it that's how the game works right now so let me kind of show you how how we code this okay all right so um so this game i downloaded some sprites so this is where i downloaded the uh the sprite from this website uh sprite resources and now you can use other downl i use this tool this is a game maker studio too that we use you can actually make other kind of game so i use that to cut up all my ducks you can see i have different ducks here so different ducks the dog you know you can cut up the different dog and then you can stitch them up together you know to form the animation so you see the dog with one duck the dog with two ducks and dog with three ducks i'm not really using these these other one the dog with three are two ducks and three ducks because uh you know uh we only have one ducks right now uh if you have more than one that's a little bit complicated it will be a little bit harder maybe later we can do that to expand the game but uh for right now it's just one duck mode so and then you have the dog laughing at us stuff like that okay and then you have the background and kind of like that so i cut them all up for you guys already so you can you can just kind of use it as it's okay so let's go back to our game here okay so we'll create a new game new okay all right so i already have some of the uh stuff in my backpack uh so just so i just gonna drag them in and i'll upload this all to our google drive also if you uh you can just i'll go down who drive to to download and also the uh if you don't know how to do that you can just go to the share uh share project and then just export the uh the you know are the sprite that'll be good enough so i'm just gonna drag them all in and i'm gonna show you how it works okay so we have to come out the background as well okay so for the background we just go back to the background we are going to grab this uh this is our background for the duck hunt and then this is the pink background where the ducks flies away okay so there's two different color okay all right so i'll show you how it works okay so the target is pretty easy so you can just draw the circle okay and then draw the cross i think this was the old one that i had i mean it doesn't it's not even in the center let me just make a new one so i think that was the old one i have done uh the bat game using similar oops using similar uh sprites so i just took it from there so let's just paint a new one here so uh we'll use this pink uh color as well this orange color let's just use the same one okay so let's just paint this real quick so i will paint it with this actually we need this color the outside so let's go back over here let's use that color what is this 100 hundred okay 10 100 100 okay so just let's do a no feel just hold the shift oopsie always mess that up okay so and then you can just draw to kind of hold the shift key and draw a straight line hold the shift key draw a straight line you can just move it there you go so we have our target so let's see how it looks like if we put it in the zero position let's put it zero zero okay so that looks okay so uh if you want us shorter longer you can do that you can do a little bit shorter okay okay all right so we have our target so let's trash the oh and the old one actually looks worse so let's take that into one okay all right so we have to target so far um the dog as you can see the dog has like custom the dog all of them are done and the dog that jumps in and then the ducks and everything and then you have the ducks you have the ducks flying different custom flying and then this is the duck when you die falls down okay the ground the ground sprite so the ground sprite is just this so we're gonna use this to kind of cover the dark in the background so it kind of blend in with the uh with the project with the uh with the backdrop so the backdrop is like this as well so i'll create another ground sprite basically just the backdrop piece here so this ground you can see i can move it right so basically we are moving putting a ground sprite on top of that so later we can hide the dog when they pick up the ducks so you see how this dog like this so you can see the dog like this so we can kind of hide his body like this so that it doesn't cover a little bit of his body okay that's why we had that uh ground and then we can use that to uh detect touching and then we have the uh this is the shooting the how many shots you have so you have three bullet two bullet one bullet and then no bullet and this is the ducks with the white ducks okay so let's see let me see where this white duck is let's hide okay you see the white ducks and then you have the red ducks okay all right so this is all the sprite that we need okay so let's start the coding okay so let's put it put some code on the ground first and we're here so let's just go um when green flags are clicked we're gonna put it at zero zero position so so let's just do zero zero so that will just keep him you see i put it already over here because since that one is in the bottom here so it fit perfectly so put zero zero okay okay so when we uh go to the backdrop what we can do is uh when green flap is clicked same thing what we want to do is we're gonna switch to background number one okay number one which is the blue sky and then the pink sky okay so number one when the game start we'll use that okay all right and then later we'll call some more okay let's go back to the dark okay so for the dog we are going to use the uh when green flap is clipped uh what we're going to do is we are going to do the weight and then we're going to do the height first actually we're going to hide the sprite in the beginning i'm going to wait for a half a second okay 0.5 uh what we want to do is we're going to switch to dark one dark one which is this dot right here okay so dark one and then we are going to move into a position so let's move them like somewhere like right here okay so you can see right um around this this path or whatever or you can move it a little bit further and you'll kind of walk through here and then we'll jump here so what we're going to do is we're going to move into negative 182 and negative 95 so let's just start let's see how it looks so you can see the dog but we have high right so we must show it okay so we have to show it back so make sure also we want to go into the front layer okay so that it will come up in the front of this uh ground block then we have to say go to front layer and then show okay so now we run this you should see the dock now so you can see the dots over here okay all right so we're going to make the dot kind of walk and then jump here okay so next we're going to use a repeat loop okay we want to repeat twice two times and we are going to start with the dark custom one anyway we already at one here so one just in case you know in case we change something but really this one may not be needed but it's kind of easy to see when we're doing this so that way you can see how how we just kind of copy and paste the code so we're going to say move 10 step and then we are going to say weight 0.1 okay so what we're going to do is we're going to change the costume first time then we are going to use the second costume okay then we are going to use the third costume the third costume and we'll do the fourth costume okay fourth class two so these are all the four so one two three and four they're all walking right so we do full costume and then we have the some sound so we have the laughing sound this is caught in the duck this is the dog sniffing and this is the dark blocking so we're going to use some of this sound so it's already loaded preloaded to the so i added to the to the sprite for you guys okay so what we're going to do is okay so click on this so play sound sound here play sound okay we're gonna say play sound sniffing sound so the dog will walk walk walk over here and then do the sniffing sound twice okay after that we are going to switch to the costume so dog number five so dog number five is when the dog kind of see it so this is outside the loop so just kind of zoom out a little bit you see the repeat two time so this one is outside so and then we're gonna do another weight uh 0.3 and then this time we are going to play the sound of the top barking okay then we're gonna switch to costume number six okay number six that is the dock when you kind of look up number six you can see number six okay number five look up so number six it's kinda like he's gonna jump in okay number seven also jump okay so we are going to use number six and then what we're going to do is we're going to make the dot kind of glide here and then we're gonna glide here twice so so for the first time we'll glide like somewhere in this position so kind of i have to position down but um just kind of glide so we kind of see where we want to glide so we're gonna do 0.2 second and glide to actually negative 66 and negative 58 okay and then and then whatever it is and then i'm going to try to glide one more time like higher so after that i'm gonna switch to costume number seven and then we're gonna apply a little bit higher so for negative so we're gonna go more a higher will be positive a little bit higher right so it'll be a negative 41 okay and then negative 17. so you can kind of just move them like this and then like this so it doesn't really have to be exactly the position okay but uh this is what i had in the whole game so it looks pretty good and then after that we want to hide the dog so we jump into the grass we'll hide him and then we will broadcast a message okay and then say start game so this will start the game this message will help us to broadcast that game for other people to do okay so let's run this real quick so you can see the dock sniffing twice and then the dog block and then he'll jump into the background and then hide okay so after this point we're gonna start and then the ducks can be flying around okay so next thing we are going to do is come to the target first so when green flag is clicked uh what we're going to do is we're going to create some variable actually let's create score okay okay after that we'll create shot that is actually getting when the duck gets shot and then we'll make one more call bullet okay all right so we're gonna hide these we don't really need that we can keep the score maybe on the bottom here doesn't really matter okay so what we're going to do is when the green flag is clicked we're going to reset the score real quick and now we have the dog right the dog's broadcast stop game so what we're going to do is i'm going to say when i receive start game um and then we're going to say set dot shot to zero so zero meaning the duck did not get shot the duck is still flying did not die yet okay and then you pull it we're gonna put three so we need to put it here instead of here because you know when we kill the ducks we'll have a new duck flying and then we have to reset this variable so we can broadcast start game again so that's why we reset it so we'll put it over here okay not in here so only the score will reset it one time so these will get reset every time the ducks got killed okay so position we're gonna position to zero zero so put the this guy in the middle and we're gonna do a little wait so just before the game start we'll do a little wait and then what we're going to do is we are going to create some custom blocks actually so we call it control target so using a custom block one thing is we can reuse the code so we're going to make we are going to make a code for moving the the target and we can use it in the uh you know when the game start and later when we when the when we go to the next level or when the auto ducts shot you can call the blocks again we don't want to repeat the code so so on this you say okay forever okay and then you say set set x and then we're going to say set y uh we're gonna set it to the mouse x and mouse y okay and then we're also going to make it go to front layer so that you can go on from everything and then we will check if they actually have the bullet around the fire the shot so if all it is so we're gonna use operator check create at zero so one two three is greater than zero right so so bullet greater than zero and then we are checking if it's actually have the mouse is down so if it's have the mouse down mouse down then we will start the sound so what we want to do is we want to start sounding not use it until done so that way it wasn't will not block the next set of code so we are going to cover a new event um event called shot fire so this is fire in the shot and then we're going to change the variable since we used one of the uh bullets right we're going to say minus one and we're gonna put a little weight here so that you know it doesn't kind of span through it all right okay so let's just try real quick what we had so far so we have the control block here and then this is starting with the game so let's see so in the beginning we cannot really move yet so you see it's kind of in the middle we're not moving yet so once the dock kind of jumps in okay so i forgot to call the method so so even though there's so many times or sometimes you forget so here you go we forgot to call the control block so that's why this thing wasn't following me okay let's go again so let's see all right so once it's done it jumps in so you can see the control is following me okay so if i click on the bullet you can see it's okay i don't have the uh picture yet but you can kind of see right if i open the bullet you see two one right so you cannot shoot anymore when you have normal bullet but if you have more bullet then you can shoot you can see right so let's start again so you can see the dog kind of go into the back and then you can fire there you go so this is what it is so far okay so uh we will actually add a little bit more and then i think we'll call it uh done for this uh first first tutorial so let's finish it real quick let's work on this piece here so uh this one is when we start uh what we want to do is we're gonna put in some way here you can see he's actually behind this block so uh while making go to the front layer so let's go put into a position let's put them around here so 175 155 in the beginning we're gonna hide and then when we receive uh skin start game where we broadcast when the dog jumps into the woods uh we are going to say switch to costume number one which is shot we have three bullets and what we're going to do is make it go to the front layer and then we are going to show it so that in the beginning we don't see it after the game start or see it and then when we say um receive where is it when i receive shot fire so this time we are going to say next costume okay and then starts so far so uh okay so we're gonna add more coal later on but let's just test it real quick so as you can see the dog kind of sniffing his way and then jump in and then you can see the oh what comes here you can shoot see they have one bullet too then no more right okay so so far this is what we have so far okay all right so this is uh we'll end the tutorial here and then we'll create another tutorial so i don't want to be too long so uh if you guys enjoy the video please give us a thumbs up uh put in some comments for us and share it with your friends all right thank you see you guys next time bye
