00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kid scrolling
00:09 - playground here and today we're back for
00:10 - another video in scratch and today we'll
00:12 - be making a holy game
00:15 - and um a lot of people a lot of
00:18 - celebrate this holiday so we decided to
00:20 - make a holy game because a lot of people
00:23 - just played do this holiday um this
00:26 - might this video might be a little bit
00:27 - late when it gets released but it's
00:29 - still a pretty cool game so when we
00:31 - start it under some music
00:35 - so we start it
00:37 - and then there's some music in the
00:38 - background uh ben is holding a bag and
00:42 - you use the arrow keys to move up and
00:43 - down you can't go left and right
00:45 - and you throw bags
00:47 - at
00:48 - others so then they'll change color
00:52 - and when you get to 100 color
00:54 - each person does 10
00:56 - color they will um hit you if they hit
01:00 - you 10 times that means um your colors
01:01 - will go up by 10 and if you get to 100
01:04 - that means you got colored and now you
01:06 - have to go home because you're very uh
01:08 - colorful so
01:10 - yeah we have to do we did that and if
01:12 - you throw colors at
01:14 - the people that are trying to color you
01:16 - you can um slow them down
01:19 - and then they will have to go home too
01:21 - because they are colored as well so
01:24 - you can see i'm throwing bags
01:28 - of color
01:30 - on
01:31 - these characters sometimes you throw two
01:33 - bags sometimes one bag sometimes three
01:37 - um
01:39 - each character has um
01:42 - a different amount of
01:45 - speed and
01:47 - uh health which is how long we survived
01:50 - from the back
01:52 - so
01:54 - [Music]
01:57 - you can throw multiple bags at once
02:00 - and they split two and it's a random
02:02 - position so it can go like from here
02:05 - let's get
02:06 - started
02:08 - so now let's get started so of course we
02:10 - delete the scratch cat and now we get
02:13 - our bed
02:15 - ben
02:16 - uh up here and
02:19 - if you don't want any of these costumes
02:20 - you want him throwing a bag you do not
02:23 - want him doing that or that or that so
02:25 - the first one is the regular idol
02:27 - position you duplicate that click on the
02:30 - arm
02:30 - flip it vertical it might look a little
02:32 - bit wonky right now but all you have to
02:34 - do is make it go a little bit more up
02:36 - and then you got a throwing position
02:38 - and you just keep on duplicating that
02:40 - and slowly rotating it until it looks
02:44 - like it's moving properly so as i'm
02:47 - doing right now
02:49 - but right now um i have some yeah and
02:52 - then you just move the arm off
02:54 - so right now i have my character inside
02:56 - my backpack so let's put it in our band
02:58 - because it's all the throwing ones
03:00 - this shows one
03:02 - there should be seven costumes in the
03:03 - end the idol position
03:05 - the throw one throw two throw three
03:08 - throw four throw five and throw six
03:10 - where he throws it and there's no more
03:11 - back
03:13 - so we have to import our bag too and
03:15 - actually um i drew this bag
03:18 - so
03:20 - we need two costumes a bigger one and a
03:22 - smaller one because this is the one that
03:24 - he should be holding and this is the one
03:26 - that he throws out so this one the lines
03:29 - are
03:30 - a bit thicker these are seven lines and
03:33 - these are three
03:35 - so
03:36 - so you just have to make the line
03:38 - smaller and uh make the overall sprite
03:41 - smaller so all you have to do is do that
03:42 - ctrl c
03:44 - go to your bend and if supposing you
03:47 - don't have this bag yet you put your bag
03:49 - maybe you want to make it a little bit
03:51 - smaller
03:52 - and you put it on his arm that's what
03:54 - you do for every single costume like
03:56 - this one like this one like you can
03:58 - control v right here put it up there
04:00 - so
04:02 - you want to copy the costume from before
04:04 - so you don't have to resize your still
04:06 - time see you have this
04:08 - bag
04:10 - you copy the same bag because if you get
04:13 - from the color bag again that means it
04:14 - will be um
04:17 - bigger
04:18 - and you want it to be the same size as
04:20 - before so you just copy and paste it to
04:22 - the next costume as so ctrl c
04:26 - and then
04:27 - uh ctrl v so it's the same size and you
04:30 - put it up there so that's good and now
04:32 - uh we have our color back in we also
04:35 - need our character which you can just
04:36 - get from here there's
04:38 - a bunch that you can pick from there's
04:40 - actually character one and character two
04:42 - so there's a bunch of characters but
04:43 - we're gonna use character one for now
04:45 - and
04:46 - we need
04:47 - you
04:50 - got
04:52 - colored
04:53 - so we have these three as well
04:57 - so you can go to our how to make amazing
04:59 - text video from our um channel
05:03 - and that
05:04 - was one of our newer videos so just go
05:06 - there and then
05:08 - as you can see this is how you do it so
05:10 - it's actually two layers of text
05:13 - so the first layer is just regular and
05:16 - the second layer is more bolded
05:19 - and it's darker so if you want to learn
05:22 - how to do that um
05:24 - just go to our how to make amazing text
05:27 - and you just drag it out and
05:29 - put it back in
05:31 - so that's for our text and we just
05:33 - changed a different color
05:35 - so you see you can do that
05:37 - change to whatever color you want
05:39 - and yeah you put it back in and
05:42 - have a forgot and you
05:45 - so
05:45 - now
05:46 - we
05:47 - yeah
05:49 - so we go oh yeah let's rename this real
05:51 - quick holy
05:55 - and now we go our ben
05:57 - when the green flag is clicked
06:00 - that means it will clear our graphic
06:02 - effects because in the when we get hit
06:04 - by the characters that means you'll
06:07 - change color because
06:08 - you got color
06:10 - and clear graphic effects in the
06:12 - beginning as always
06:15 - um switch costume to ben a
06:17 - let me change this real quick back to
06:19 - the big bag right here because that's
06:21 - what he throws
06:22 - um
06:23 - cleographic effects switch costume to
06:26 - ben a because that's his idol position
06:29 - the one with his hand down
06:31 - and then you'll go to x yeah i already
06:34 - have the position because i uploaded it
06:36 - from the thing so it goes somewhere
06:38 - around here
06:41 - it'll set colors to zero
06:44 - which are basically his lives
06:49 - so set colors to
06:51 - zero
06:53 - and go it will go forever
06:57 - and then if
06:59 - [Music]
07:00 - then so yeah we have our street let's
07:03 - get our street in real quick
07:07 - yeah so um
07:08 - if i'm not mistaken it's called neural
07:11 - yep
07:12 - and we delete this
07:13 - so
07:14 - for reference this is where our you want
07:16 - your ben to be so
07:19 - i'm probably over here because you don't
07:21 - want him flying up here because there's
07:23 - no way he could fly you're probably
07:25 - running from the sidewalk and down to
07:28 - the bottom of the road so
07:30 - so uh we have our and
07:34 - so if the up arrow key is pressed
07:40 - and the y position
07:43 - is less than 50
07:47 - the y position is less than 50 so it
07:50 - cannot pass a certain
07:52 - position
07:54 - and after that we need to change y by
07:56 - 10.
07:59 - and then we duplicate that it's almost
08:01 - the same concept
08:03 - now it's down arrow
08:06 - and y position
08:08 - is greater than negative 100 so let's do
08:13 - greater than
08:15 - negative 100
08:17 - so we have our y position
08:22 - negative 100 so it's over here somewhere
08:24 - so you don't want to go too low you
08:26 - don't want him to go under the ground
08:27 - because there's no way he would go under
08:29 - the road without like a drill or
08:31 - something no way you could just drill
08:33 - with his own hands so and after that
08:36 - instead of changing y by 10 it changed y
08:38 - by minus 10 negative 10 and then if then
08:43 - the space key is pressed
08:46 - then it will broadcast throw back and
08:48 - wait
08:56 - and after that we have one more script
08:58 - of code we actually have two more but
08:59 - we'll get to the other one later because
09:02 - it's from the bag so when i receive
09:04 - throw bag it'll switch costume to ben a
09:07 - which is his idol position
09:09 - oh repeat six times because he has six
09:12 - moving costumes as you can see right
09:13 - here one two three four five six
09:17 - and uh repeat six times
09:21 - next costume since this is um
09:24 - a lot of costumes you don't have to put
09:25 - a small weight
09:27 - and then wait 0.1 seconds right under
09:29 - here
09:31 - and switch costume back to then a
09:36 - so okay so i'm gonna zoom out feel free
09:39 - to pause so uh you can get all the code
09:42 - down just in case if you haven't got it
09:45 - so
09:46 - as you can see yep he is throwing the
09:48 - bag
09:50 - and yeah we can move him
09:52 - and he can't move that high there and he
09:54 - can't move that low into the air on the
09:56 - ground so yeah
09:58 - working
10:00 - so let's set the size to 100 i have no
10:02 - idea how this got to 125 but yeah 100 so
10:05 - yeah
10:07 - so his feet aren't in the ground because
10:08 - they were on the ground because he was
10:09 - 125 so we just decided to change it
10:12 - so yeah
10:14 - now it's time to work on the back
10:17 - when the
10:18 - green flag is clicked
10:21 - it will hide
10:26 - it will hide
10:30 - and
10:30 - then when i receive throwback
10:34 - it'll wait until
10:39 - not
10:39 - [Music]
10:40 - not okay
10:42 - and key spaces press because you do not
10:44 - want to let hold the thing hold the
10:46 - space again it throws bags and there's
10:48 - no way you can lose
10:50 - so we need to add this simple script of
10:52 - code
10:54 - and then it'll create
10:55 - clone of myself
11:00 - so actually i have to make the back of
11:01 - 20 i have no idea how i got to 35 i
11:03 - actually have no idea
11:05 - and we do that
11:06 - and when i start as a clone
11:10 - it will set the color
11:14 - effect to pick random one to three
11:16 - hundred
11:22 - it'll go to x
11:25 - x position so this is you use the tricky
11:27 - part block we have to move the second
11:30 - one first so it will go to the x
11:33 - position of bend and it will go to the y
11:36 - position of bend
11:38 - and now it will show
11:42 - it'll point in direction so this is just
11:44 - random aim so he goes blah blah blah and
11:47 - go here to here so you have you can't
11:49 - it's not 100 chance you'll hit the
11:51 - person you're trying to target
11:53 - so
11:55 - so uh let's see
11:58 - as you can see the bag is
12:00 - actually gonna be on him so
12:03 - as you can see it's it's behind him yeah
12:05 - so the bag is actually on him you do not
12:07 - want that to happen so if you click
12:09 - space you want it to be up here because
12:10 - that's where his hand is
12:12 - so
12:13 - so you do not want that to be in the
12:14 - middle right so um you want to add the x
12:18 - position you want to add
12:21 - 25 so it's
12:24 - somewhere over here maybe
12:26 - over here gonna be over here so then the
12:29 - hand is up there in the y position
12:32 - you also want to add
12:36 - 75
12:40 - and then it'll show like we already did
12:42 - that so it'll point in direction um
12:44 - [Music]
12:46 - you know pick random like what i
12:48 - described earlier pick random 60 to 120
12:53 - so
12:55 - the aim is different
12:58 - and
12:59 - the direction you have to click all
13:01 - around i already did that so you see
13:03 - this is 60
13:05 - to
13:06 - 120 yeah right here
13:09 - so this is the range you can hit people
13:11 - from
13:12 - and
13:14 - uh
13:15 - yeah so 60 to 120 so it will repeat
13:18 - until
13:21 - touch it
13:23 - or
13:25 - repeat until touching character one
13:28 - because it will go into the character
13:30 - which will make it change color
13:33 - or it's touching the edge
13:38 - it'll move 15 steps to get to that goal
13:44 - and i'll delete this clone in the end
13:47 - so yeah we are done with the bag
13:51 - so yeah let's
13:53 - let's let you see all the code
13:55 - i think we can zoom in
13:57 - feel free to pause right now so you can
13:59 - get all the code
14:01 - so yeah
14:03 - so let's see
14:04 - see the bag is going but right now the
14:07 - character is in the middle so the bag is
14:09 - stopping there
14:10 - yeah so
14:12 - yeah the bag is going
14:13 - so now we have to work on the character
14:17 - character still has some decent code
14:20 - so um
14:22 - so the character you actually have to
14:23 - make it rotate left right the direction
14:26 - so it doesn't flip over when it's going
14:28 - on the other side so we need when a
14:30 - green flag is clicked
14:34 - so we also have to change the direction
14:36 - negative 90.
14:39 - so it's facing that way and then
14:41 - the green flag is clicked
14:43 - it will hide
14:47 - it'll set character hp sub room okay
14:50 - this is very important please do not
14:51 - skip this part
14:54 - so character hp did i spell character
14:56 - correctly yeah i think it smells correct
14:57 - correctly and then you click for this
14:59 - sprite only do not skip the step
15:02 - most of the mistakes come right here so
15:04 - please do not skip this step the
15:05 - character hp
15:07 - you know set character hp to pick random
15:09 - three to five so it can
15:11 - the character will can disappear in
15:13 - three hits from the bag or five hits
15:15 - from the back or four hits because three
15:17 - to five you know set size to 75 percent
15:20 - well i mean it's 100 right now so i'm
15:22 - gonna set the size of 75.
15:26 - and then i'll go forever
15:30 - no create a clone of myself
15:34 - and i'll wait a pic random second until
15:37 - a new one spawns
15:39 - so
15:40 - wait
15:42 - pick random one to 1.5 seconds for
15:45 - another person to spawn
15:48 - and uh since we have the clone we're
15:51 - gonna do some clone work here so when i
15:53 - start as a clone
15:56 - you'll switch costume
15:59 - to care to pick random or so uh there
16:02 - are 13 costumes for the character i'll
16:04 - show you in a minute so 1 to 13 so it
16:06 - can be number one character all the way
16:09 - to 13 because there's 13 characters that
16:11 - are here so
16:13 - switch costume to pick random 1 to 13.
16:16 - and i'll show
16:20 - and i'll set speed so this is also uh
16:23 - for this right only so please do not
16:25 - skip this part
16:27 - and it'll set speed
16:30 - so each character will have a different
16:31 - amount of speed to pick random
16:35 - negative three
16:37 - so it's actually pretty slow to negative
16:39 - seven which is
16:41 - very quick
16:42 - so it'll go to x
16:46 - 200 so it's back here so the character
16:49 - will spawn over here
16:51 - because you do not want it spawning
16:52 - right here next to ben
16:54 - and
16:55 - uh we need to pick random
16:58 - for the y negative 60 so it can be from
17:02 - probably here
17:04 - a little lower
17:07 - negative 80 my bad
17:09 - and to positive 80 so it can be
17:13 - so it won't be flying like ben if so he
17:16 - doesn't fly either so
17:20 - and then it will repeat until
17:23 - you need an or statement
17:26 - repeat until the x position
17:30 - or
17:31 - so we need that
17:33 - is
17:34 - less than negative 220.
17:38 - so
17:40 - x position up here
17:43 - is less than negative 220
17:47 - or touching ben
17:49 - because um
17:51 - if you do edge if it's touching the edge
17:53 - that means
17:55 - the characters spawn right here that
17:56 - means they'll be touching the edge and
17:58 - they'll
17:59 - be constantly disappearing and they
18:01 - can't move so there's no point of this
18:03 - game so add this descriptive code or
18:05 - touching ben
18:09 - it will change x
18:11 - by speed and that's how quick they're
18:13 - going right so over here so change x
18:16 - by speed
18:19 - and then it'll delete this clone
18:22 - in the end of all that
18:24 - and then there's another one i start as
18:26 - a clone so when i start as a clone
18:28 - you'll go forever
18:31 - so if then it's
18:33 - touching the color bag
18:39 - then it will change color effect by 25
18:42 - because they've been hit
18:44 - by
18:45 - a color a color back so they'll change
18:47 - color
18:48 - and then change character hp
18:52 - by -1 so because they'll start losing
18:55 - their hp
18:56 - slowly
18:57 - and then you need an if then else
19:00 - statement
19:01 - right not
19:03 - right inside of it
19:06 - and
19:08 - if and then
19:10 - if the speed
19:12 - is less than negative one which means
19:14 - that they won't be able to move anymore
19:18 - so negative one is the slowest possible
19:20 - speed of a character so if the speed is
19:23 - gr less than negative one which is like
19:25 - negative seven which is quick that means
19:27 - it will change speed by 0.5 so it'll
19:31 - actually make
19:33 - the
19:34 - character slower
19:37 - and else you'll set speed to
19:40 - uh negative
19:41 - set speed to negative one because that's
19:43 - the slowest it can go
19:46 - and you want them to move right so yeah
19:49 - so when i start as a clone
19:54 - you'll go forever
19:57 - and
19:58 - if
19:59 - then
19:59 - [Music]
20:01 - if then you need a or semen
20:04 - if the character hp is equal to zero
20:12 - so when it loses all its hp
20:14 - or it's less than zero if it's been hit
20:17 - by multiple bags
20:21 - then it will delete this clone
20:24 - because they had
20:26 - uh
20:28 - gotten colored
20:31 - okay um and now i'm going to show all
20:33 - the code
20:34 - so feel free to pause here
20:38 - let's drag that down a little bit
20:41 - so we're going that yeah and yeah feel
20:44 - free to pause right here so you can see
20:46 - all the code so let's see if this works
20:49 - let's actually hide this first so then i
20:51 - can you guys can see something so um
20:54 - and the variables too so let's go to
20:56 - characters
20:59 - no colors you know
21:03 - okay and now let's go so you see they're
21:05 - moving okay we're changing their color
21:08 - and they will disappear they have
21:10 - different amounts of hp as you can see
21:12 - this woman right here has
21:14 - five hp
21:15 - this one has three
21:17 - and the colors aren't changing yet
21:19 - because we're not finished with the code
21:22 - but yeah it's function
21:24 - it's functioning
21:26 - so now since the characters are moving
21:28 - we go back to ben and when the green
21:30 - flag is clicked
21:33 - forever
21:36 - if then
21:39 - it's touching
21:42 - character one because if they get hit by
21:44 - the character let me go change colors by
21:46 - 10
21:49 - which means you got colored a little bit
21:50 - so
21:52 - yeah
21:52 - and then it'll set the color
21:56 - so it'll have a slight change we'll set
21:58 - the color effect
22:00 - to pick random ones 300 so there's a
22:02 - bunch of colors you can become for
22:05 - just
22:06 - 0.1 seconds so
22:08 - 0.1 seconds right here
22:12 - it'll clear the graphic effects again
22:16 - and now
22:18 - under that we put an if then statement
22:21 - right under that if then the colors you
22:24 - need a or
22:26 - is equal to
22:29 - the colors is equal to 100 which means
22:33 - you now have to go home because you have
22:36 - been fully colored
22:38 - uh or
22:39 - colors is greater than 100
22:46 - then it will set the color effect
22:51 - to pick
22:52 - random one to 300
22:56 - in our broadcast you got colored
23:02 - so you
23:04 - you
23:05 - got
23:06 - color
23:09 - and it'll stop other scripts in this
23:10 - sprite so you can't move ben anymore
23:13 - once you get color
23:15 - so stop other scripts in the sprite and
23:17 - after you stop all the scripts on the
23:19 - sprite you also have to stop this script
23:21 - because if you don't stop this script i
23:24 - mean that means
23:26 - uh you'll be still changing color you'll
23:28 - be still broadcasting this thing so you
23:30 - want to stop this script as well
23:32 - so now we are done with fully done with
23:35 - ben
23:36 - so i hope you guys can see this
23:38 - i'm gonna zoom out a little bit so yeah
23:41 - feel free to pause right here get all
23:42 - the code done
23:44 - and now we are on you
23:46 - which is a sprite u
23:48 - so when the green flag is clicked
23:51 - you can i just drag the position
23:53 - somewhere and then uh you'll go to this
23:55 - position it will hide
23:58 - and then when i receive
24:01 - you got colored
24:05 - then it will show
24:09 - and
24:10 - that's basically it for all the other
24:12 - ones but you just have to change the
24:13 - position so they're not in all on one
24:15 - position
24:17 - so let's move that in there
24:18 - why is that zooming out
24:22 - zoom in
24:23 - and then it'll go to here instead of
24:25 - going there it'll go to here so yeah
24:28 - just get some positions done you know
24:31 - drag it around see where you can put the
24:32 - positions
24:35 - so
24:37 - now let's go to
24:38 - whatever go to this
24:40 - yeah and now we have you got colored
24:43 - and
24:46 - and on the last one colored you have to
24:49 - add extra code
24:50 - to stop everything so it will wait two
24:52 - seconds
24:54 - and then it will stop everything
24:57 - so we have one more scripting character
24:59 - so let's go back to character so right
25:01 - now we have four scripts but we are
25:03 - supposed to have five so we're gonna
25:05 - move over a little bit so when i receive
25:08 - you got colored
25:10 - then it will stop other scripts in this
25:12 - sprite
25:15 - where's that
25:17 - and then it will
25:19 - delete this clone because there'll be no
25:21 - more spawning once you get color
25:24 - yeah so feel free to pause right
25:26 - here and now we're gonna add the music
25:29 - for our final touch
25:32 - and if i'm not mistaken
25:35 - the music is dance energetic so let's
25:39 - see
25:43 - energetic
25:44 - you have this one
25:46 - and
25:48 - when the green flag is clicked
25:52 - zoom in when the green flag is it will
25:55 - set volume to 50 so you can kind of hear
25:58 - me and then
25:59 - oh it's optional and then it'll go
26:02 - forever
26:03 - and i'll
26:04 - play sound energy dancer
26:06 - until done so let's listen and see what
26:09 - this is all about
26:11 - so as you can see there are people
26:13 - coming my colors are changing
26:15 - i'm changing color too and bags are
26:17 - working correctly they're slowing them
26:19 - down to see like this man getting slow
26:22 - and yeah they're slowing down
26:25 - yeah and some have different health than
26:26 - others oh no i'm about to lose i got
26:29 - color
26:30 - so yeah
26:31 - that's it oh is it so please like share
26:34 - subscribe and comment in the comment
26:36 - section below uh what you did for holy

26:59 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's kid scrolling playground here and today we're back for another video in scratch and today we'll be making a holy game and um a lot of people a lot of celebrate this holiday so we decided to make a holy game because a lot of people just played do this holiday um this might this video might be a little bit late when it gets released but it's still a pretty cool game so when we start it under some music so we start it and then there's some music in the background uh ben is holding a bag and you use the arrow keys to move up and down you can't go left and right and you throw bags at others so then they'll change color and when you get to 100 color each person does 10 color they will um hit you if they hit you 10 times that means um your colors will go up by 10 and if you get to 100 that means you got colored and now you have to go home because you're very uh colorful so yeah we have to do we did that and if you throw colors at the people that are trying to color you you can um slow them down and then they will have to go home too because they are colored as well so you can see i'm throwing bags of color on these characters sometimes you throw two bags sometimes one bag sometimes three um each character has um a different amount of speed and uh health which is how long we survived from the back so you can throw multiple bags at once and they split two and it's a random position so it can go like from here let's get started so now let's get started so of course we delete the scratch cat and now we get our bed ben uh up here and if you don't want any of these costumes you want him throwing a bag you do not want him doing that or that or that so the first one is the regular idol position you duplicate that click on the arm flip it vertical it might look a little bit wonky right now but all you have to do is make it go a little bit more up and then you got a throwing position and you just keep on duplicating that and slowly rotating it until it looks like it's moving properly so as i'm doing right now but right now um i have some yeah and then you just move the arm off so right now i have my character inside my backpack so let's put it in our band because it's all the throwing ones this shows one there should be seven costumes in the end the idol position the throw one throw two throw three throw four throw five and throw six where he throws it and there's no more back so we have to import our bag too and actually um i drew this bag so we need two costumes a bigger one and a smaller one because this is the one that he should be holding and this is the one that he throws out so this one the lines are a bit thicker these are seven lines and these are three so so you just have to make the line smaller and uh make the overall sprite smaller so all you have to do is do that ctrl c go to your bend and if supposing you don't have this bag yet you put your bag maybe you want to make it a little bit smaller and you put it on his arm that's what you do for every single costume like this one like this one like you can control v right here put it up there so you want to copy the costume from before so you don't have to resize your still time see you have this bag you copy the same bag because if you get from the color bag again that means it will be um bigger and you want it to be the same size as before so you just copy and paste it to the next costume as so ctrl c and then uh ctrl v so it's the same size and you put it up there so that's good and now uh we have our color back in we also need our character which you can just get from here there's a bunch that you can pick from there's actually character one and character two so there's a bunch of characters but we're gonna use character one for now and we need you got colored so we have these three as well so you can go to our how to make amazing text video from our um channel and that was one of our newer videos so just go there and then as you can see this is how you do it so it's actually two layers of text so the first layer is just regular and the second layer is more bolded and it's darker so if you want to learn how to do that um just go to our how to make amazing text and you just drag it out and put it back in so that's for our text and we just changed a different color so you see you can do that change to whatever color you want and yeah you put it back in and have a forgot and you so now we yeah so we go oh yeah let's rename this real quick holy and now we go our ben when the green flag is clicked that means it will clear our graphic effects because in the when we get hit by the characters that means you'll change color because you got color and clear graphic effects in the beginning as always um switch costume to ben a let me change this real quick back to the big bag right here because that's what he throws um cleographic effects switch costume to ben a because that's his idol position the one with his hand down and then you'll go to x yeah i already have the position because i uploaded it from the thing so it goes somewhere around here it'll set colors to zero which are basically his lives so set colors to zero and go it will go forever and then if then so yeah we have our street let's get our street in real quick yeah so um if i'm not mistaken it's called neural yep and we delete this so for reference this is where our you want your ben to be so i'm probably over here because you don't want him flying up here because there's no way he could fly you're probably running from the sidewalk and down to the bottom of the road so so uh we have our and so if the up arrow key is pressed and the y position is less than 50 the y position is less than 50 so it cannot pass a certain position and after that we need to change y by 10. and then we duplicate that it's almost the same concept now it's down arrow and y position is greater than negative 100 so let's do greater than negative 100 so we have our y position negative 100 so it's over here somewhere so you don't want to go too low you don't want him to go under the ground because there's no way he would go under the road without like a drill or something no way you could just drill with his own hands so and after that instead of changing y by 10 it changed y by minus 10 negative 10 and then if then the space key is pressed then it will broadcast throw back and wait and after that we have one more script of code we actually have two more but we'll get to the other one later because it's from the bag so when i receive throw bag it'll switch costume to ben a which is his idol position oh repeat six times because he has six moving costumes as you can see right here one two three four five six and uh repeat six times next costume since this is um a lot of costumes you don't have to put a small weight and then wait 0.1 seconds right under here and switch costume back to then a so okay so i'm gonna zoom out feel free to pause so uh you can get all the code down just in case if you haven't got it so as you can see yep he is throwing the bag and yeah we can move him and he can't move that high there and he can't move that low into the air on the ground so yeah working so let's set the size to 100 i have no idea how this got to 125 but yeah 100 so yeah so his feet aren't in the ground because they were on the ground because he was 125 so we just decided to change it so yeah now it's time to work on the back when the green flag is clicked it will hide it will hide and then when i receive throwback it'll wait until not not okay and key spaces press because you do not want to let hold the thing hold the space again it throws bags and there's no way you can lose so we need to add this simple script of code and then it'll create clone of myself so actually i have to make the back of 20 i have no idea how i got to 35 i actually have no idea and we do that and when i start as a clone it will set the color effect to pick random one to three hundred it'll go to x x position so this is you use the tricky part block we have to move the second one first so it will go to the x position of bend and it will go to the y position of bend and now it will show it'll point in direction so this is just random aim so he goes blah blah blah and go here to here so you have you can't it's not 100 chance you'll hit the person you're trying to target so so uh let's see as you can see the bag is actually gonna be on him so as you can see it's it's behind him yeah so the bag is actually on him you do not want that to happen so if you click space you want it to be up here because that's where his hand is so so you do not want that to be in the middle right so um you want to add the x position you want to add 25 so it's somewhere over here maybe over here gonna be over here so then the hand is up there in the y position you also want to add 75 and then it'll show like we already did that so it'll point in direction um you know pick random like what i described earlier pick random 60 to 120 so the aim is different and the direction you have to click all around i already did that so you see this is 60 to 120 yeah right here so this is the range you can hit people from and uh yeah so 60 to 120 so it will repeat until touch it or repeat until touching character one because it will go into the character which will make it change color or it's touching the edge it'll move 15 steps to get to that goal and i'll delete this clone in the end so yeah we are done with the bag so yeah let's let's let you see all the code i think we can zoom in feel free to pause right now so you can get all the code so yeah so let's see see the bag is going but right now the character is in the middle so the bag is stopping there yeah so yeah the bag is going so now we have to work on the character character still has some decent code so um so the character you actually have to make it rotate left right the direction so it doesn't flip over when it's going on the other side so we need when a green flag is clicked so we also have to change the direction negative 90. so it's facing that way and then the green flag is clicked it will hide it'll set character hp sub room okay this is very important please do not skip this part so character hp did i spell character correctly yeah i think it smells correct correctly and then you click for this sprite only do not skip the step most of the mistakes come right here so please do not skip this step the character hp you know set character hp to pick random three to five so it can the character will can disappear in three hits from the bag or five hits from the back or four hits because three to five you know set size to 75 percent well i mean it's 100 right now so i'm gonna set the size of 75. and then i'll go forever no create a clone of myself and i'll wait a pic random second until a new one spawns so wait pick random one to 1.5 seconds for another person to spawn and uh since we have the clone we're gonna do some clone work here so when i start as a clone you'll switch costume to care to pick random or so uh there are 13 costumes for the character i'll show you in a minute so 1 to 13 so it can be number one character all the way to 13 because there's 13 characters that are here so switch costume to pick random 1 to 13. and i'll show and i'll set speed so this is also uh for this right only so please do not skip this part and it'll set speed so each character will have a different amount of speed to pick random negative three so it's actually pretty slow to negative seven which is very quick so it'll go to x 200 so it's back here so the character will spawn over here because you do not want it spawning right here next to ben and uh we need to pick random for the y negative 60 so it can be from probably here a little lower negative 80 my bad and to positive 80 so it can be so it won't be flying like ben if so he doesn't fly either so and then it will repeat until you need an or statement repeat until the x position or so we need that is less than negative 220. so x position up here is less than negative 220 or touching ben because um if you do edge if it's touching the edge that means the characters spawn right here that means they'll be touching the edge and they'll be constantly disappearing and they can't move so there's no point of this game so add this descriptive code or touching ben it will change x by speed and that's how quick they're going right so over here so change x by speed and then it'll delete this clone in the end of all that and then there's another one i start as a clone so when i start as a clone you'll go forever so if then it's touching the color bag then it will change color effect by 25 because they've been hit by a color a color back so they'll change color and then change character hp by 1 so because they'll start losing their hp slowly and then you need an if then else statement right not right inside of it and if and then if the speed is less than negative one which means that they won't be able to move anymore so negative one is the slowest possible speed of a character so if the speed is gr less than negative one which is like negative seven which is quick that means it will change speed by 0.5 so it'll actually make the character slower and else you'll set speed to uh negative set speed to negative one because that's the slowest it can go and you want them to move right so yeah so when i start as a clone you'll go forever and if then if then you need a or semen if the character hp is equal to zero so when it loses all its hp or it's less than zero if it's been hit by multiple bags then it will delete this clone because they had uh gotten colored okay um and now i'm going to show all the code so feel free to pause here let's drag that down a little bit so we're going that yeah and yeah feel free to pause right here so you can see all the code so let's see if this works let's actually hide this first so then i can you guys can see something so um and the variables too so let's go to characters no colors you know okay and now let's go so you see they're moving okay we're changing their color and they will disappear they have different amounts of hp as you can see this woman right here has five hp this one has three and the colors aren't changing yet because we're not finished with the code but yeah it's function it's functioning so now since the characters are moving we go back to ben and when the green flag is clicked forever if then it's touching character one because if they get hit by the character let me go change colors by 10 which means you got colored a little bit so yeah and then it'll set the color so it'll have a slight change we'll set the color effect to pick random ones 300 so there's a bunch of colors you can become for just 0.1 seconds so 0.1 seconds right here it'll clear the graphic effects again and now under that we put an if then statement right under that if then the colors you need a or is equal to the colors is equal to 100 which means you now have to go home because you have been fully colored uh or colors is greater than 100 then it will set the color effect to pick random one to 300 in our broadcast you got colored so you you got color and it'll stop other scripts in this sprite so you can't move ben anymore once you get color so stop other scripts in the sprite and after you stop all the scripts on the sprite you also have to stop this script because if you don't stop this script i mean that means uh you'll be still changing color you'll be still broadcasting this thing so you want to stop this script as well so now we are done with fully done with ben so i hope you guys can see this i'm gonna zoom out a little bit so yeah feel free to pause right here get all the code done and now we are on you which is a sprite u so when the green flag is clicked you can i just drag the position somewhere and then uh you'll go to this position it will hide and then when i receive you got colored then it will show and that's basically it for all the other ones but you just have to change the position so they're not in all on one position so let's move that in there why is that zooming out zoom in and then it'll go to here instead of going there it'll go to here so yeah just get some positions done you know drag it around see where you can put the positions so now let's go to whatever go to this yeah and now we have you got colored and and on the last one colored you have to add extra code to stop everything so it will wait two seconds and then it will stop everything so we have one more scripting character so let's go back to character so right now we have four scripts but we are supposed to have five so we're gonna move over a little bit so when i receive you got colored then it will stop other scripts in this sprite where's that and then it will delete this clone because there'll be no more spawning once you get color yeah so feel free to pause right here and now we're gonna add the music for our final touch and if i'm not mistaken the music is dance energetic so let's see energetic you have this one and when the green flag is clicked zoom in when the green flag is it will set volume to 50 so you can kind of hear me and then oh it's optional and then it'll go forever and i'll play sound energy dancer until done so let's listen and see what this is all about so as you can see there are people coming my colors are changing i'm changing color too and bags are working correctly they're slowing them down to see like this man getting slow and yeah they're slowing down yeah and some have different health than others oh no i'm about to lose i got color so yeah that's it oh is it so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below uh what you did for holy and if oh if you celebrate holy what you did for holy and yeah i've heard that there's also really good good food at holy and stuff i've never went there but yeah um so yeah uh see you guys next time
