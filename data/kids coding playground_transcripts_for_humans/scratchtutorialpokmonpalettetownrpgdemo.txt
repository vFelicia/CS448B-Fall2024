00:35 - little bit more soon because we're kind
00:37 - of busy right now so let's play so you
00:40 - can move around
00:42 - as the character
00:43 - your ash
00:45 - and you can go inside these houses like
00:47 - this one
00:49 - and go into the houses and you can like
00:50 - open these chests and get some coins
00:53 - so like you can't really do anything but
00:55 - just move around and get coins right now
00:57 - because we don't have anything else

01:02 - this house let's go to the next one
01:04 - it's the next house there's some chess
01:06 - right here
01:07 - and we got all these uh sprites and
01:10 - decoration from online
01:13 - and then here we have our final house
01:15 - so what we did was we
01:17 - on the website they gave the sprite
01:18 - sheets we cut out the sprites and when
01:20 - we used the sprites inside our project
01:21 - so let's go to the last house
01:25 - so here there's a chest right here
01:28 - there's a chest right here and this one
01:29 - you can go upstairs like when you go
