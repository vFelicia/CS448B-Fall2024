00:03 - [Music]
00:10 - hello and welcome to kids coding
00:13 - playground channel here we'll be
00:14 - teaching kids step by step learning the
00:17 - basic programming concept one of my
00:20 - favorite tool to use is scratch scratch
00:23 - is a visual or interactive programming
00:25 - language to develop MIT what kids can
00:29 - program their own interactive story
00:31 - games and animation so it is a really
00:34 - fun and easy tool to use let's get
00:39 - started now we'll go to here so we need
00:45 - to go to scratch that mit.edu
00:49 - so in here you can you can sign up for
00:52 - your own account okay after you sign up
00:56 - then you can see your stuff what are
00:59 - some other things that you could you
01:01 - have your project come here and then you
01:04 - can also if you don't like the online
01:07 - version you can also go here go down
01:10 - here into the download so this download
01:13 - you can download the offline version of
01:16 - scratch meaning you can actually run it
01:18 - anywhere but I do recommend the online
01:22 - version so that if you have online
01:24 - access then you can pretty much use it
01:26 - anytime the offline versions you know
01:30 - you have to save it locally on your file
01:31 - in the year to like load it up but it
01:35 - allows you to work online without
01:36 - internet access but the online version
01:39 - everything is saved to your engine to
01:42 - your project so let me get started so
01:46 - now that you have a little bit basic of
01:48 - about scratch where did it go and how to
01:51 - download the scratch and how that lock
01:53 - in and use it so once you log in you
01:56 - will see you can go to my stuff click on
02:00 - this and you'll show like different
02:01 - stuff what are some of the project you
02:03 - have for scratch so or you can also
02:07 - create your new project so we can do
02:11 - that by clicking on this button here
02:13 - create a new project so when you create
02:15 - this new project
02:16 - it will low into this editor so this is
02:20 - the editor for scratch so let me show
02:24 - you one of the sly I made about the
02:28 - scratch
02:29 - so here the scratch editor this is a 3.0
02:32 - scratch recently updated to 3.0 so this
02:36 - is a menu so this is the menu while you
02:38 - have here this is the stop and start
02:41 - this is the button to run your game this
02:45 - is the script area when you put your toe
02:47 - here those blocks this is the Kohl
02:49 - palette so you can track and drag the
02:52 - code and drop into this group area and
02:54 - these are the extension extension is
02:56 - like other stuff like music pen you know
03:00 - or others thing that you want to use
03:02 - with scratch and this is the background
03:05 - editor you can put a background for your
03:07 - game this is the sprite editor where you
03:10 - can edit putting different sprite like
03:13 - the cat here for example you can have a
03:16 - dog or something else and this is the
03:19 - stage meaning like when you're going to
03:21 - see so when your game runs so this is
03:24 - the basic apart the laid out for the
03:27 - scratch next we want to understand about
03:30 - the X&Y position of the of the scratch
03:33 - so in the center of scratch will be 0 0
03:37 - this side will be positive x right this
03:41 - I will be negative X and this size
03:43 - positive Y this down here is negative Y
03:47 - so as you can see this quadrant here is
03:50 - positive x and positive Y here is
03:52 - positive x negative Y here is a negative
03:56 - x negative Y and here's negative x
03:59 - positive Y so here to kind of understand
04:01 - the positions of 0 0 is kinda in the
04:04 - center of the stage ok so next we're
04:09 - gonna go step by step
04:11 - teaching the kids how to code the first
04:14 - scratch game ok here we go so this is
04:19 - the sample lesson we can I walk on today
04:21 - so we're gonna have the cat in the
04:22 - background with the music and the cat
04:25 - will be dancing
04:26 - okay so let's let's start with the
04:30 - program so first we have the cat right
04:35 - so what we can do is we can click on
04:37 - this button here and go into here say
04:42 - select a background and then you can
04:44 - type maybe dance let's say yeah see
04:49 - dance so you have this spotlight select
04:52 - this so now you have the cat have a
04:56 - background of the dance stage we can't
04:58 - move that catcon in the middle of that
05:00 - stage here so after that what we can do
05:04 - is we can do some coding to make this
05:08 - cat move so first thing we can do is you
05:13 - can see these here these are the
05:15 - different code block they have so we can
05:20 - start with the first one event so when
05:24 - the button is clicked what do you want
05:26 - the cat to do so the cat it's not doing
05:31 - anything right now let's say we want to
05:33 - make the cat move so we're gonna have to
05:35 - take a look at this costume so as you
05:37 - can see the first costume is the cat
05:39 - camera standing here second custom is
05:42 - the cat can I like moving his leg so you
05:45 - can what you can do is you can put a
05:46 - loop we'll go into more detail on this
05:49 - later on but for right now I just follow
05:52 - along so you can see here control we
05:54 - can't drag this for loop into the into
05:59 - this block here so it was kind of like a
06:01 - Lego kind of thing you slaps naturally
06:04 - so and then you can say go back to here
06:09 - look and look you can say next costume
06:12 - so what you do is when you click on this
06:15 - you'll see the cat continuously forever
06:18 - changing the costume so I can click on
06:21 - this once so you can see it cannot go
06:23 - really fast right that's what we're not
06:25 - what we want right you can stop it so
06:28 - what we can do is you can put a little
06:30 - bit of weight
06:31 - okay in the control I believe yeah
06:34 - that's it yeah here so you can track
06:36 - weight over here you can do like 0.1
06:40 - second so this is like a fraction of a
06:43 - second right so let's say if you go
06:44 - start again so you see how you click on
06:47 - this green flag go that means they will
06:49 - execute this block of code here so let
06:53 - me kind of zoom in so you can see better
06:55 - I should do that earlier
06:57 - so now let's let's click on this code so
07:01 - as you can see you can see the cat is
07:03 - kind of running or dancing or what it's
07:05 - doing and you can see that this block of
07:07 - code has become yellow meaning this
07:09 - isn't running so you can stop this now
07:12 - we have the cat moving kinda thing so
07:14 - now let's same one add some music to
07:16 - their cat right so what we can do we can
07:20 - go in here and then we can this is the
07:24 - extension we can add music extension so
07:27 - once you have the extension music you
07:29 - see something like this so what we can
07:32 - do is we can go back to the event we're
07:35 - gonna draw out another start when start
07:38 - is click then we are going back to the
07:42 - control we had another forever loop here
07:44 - and then what we can do is we're gonna
07:49 - make the cat kind of moving forward a
07:52 - little bit moving back a little bit so
07:54 - this is a movement so you had to go to
07:56 - the motion so you can say move forward
08:00 - ten step and what we can do is go back
08:02 - to the music we can say hey play this
08:05 - drum sound right or point zero five two
08:11 - second for the beat and then play and
08:14 - then make the movement again and then we
08:17 - can use like moving back right put back
08:21 - here and then you send
08:23 - ten so here so you can have like the
08:29 - drum plane is moving forward I'm moving
08:32 - backward and then we can use another
08:34 - music like let's say you can put another
08:37 - sound here and you can choose a
08:39 - different sound maybe you can choose
08:41 - this one right and then you can also
08:45 - make it move forward I can or you can
08:47 - just duplicate the code you right click
08:49 - say duplicate so now you have a second
08:52 - set of holes playing some sound we can
08:57 - move backward and forward again and then
09:00 - maybe we can delete this part we'd only
09:02 - track it back in here we'll delete that
09:05 - this one we can just select another one
09:08 - here so what happened if I run this code
09:11 - now you will see that the cat will
09:13 - continue moving dancing moving forward
09:17 - and backward and then we're changing the
09:19 - costume and playing this sound so let me
09:21 - run this real quick or save our project
09:24 - [Music]
09:31 - so as you can see this is a really
09:34 - simple project we created so where you
09:36 - can make the cat dancing right so next
09:40 - we can do is we can also make the cat
09:42 - maybe changing color
09:44 - so there's another event you can use by
09:47 - different event let's go back to the
09:49 - event so when space key is pressed so
09:53 - what we want to do is when the space key
09:56 - is pressed we want to change the color
09:58 - effects so we're going to go back to the
10:00 - look you can see that here change color
10:04 - effect by 25 so what happened is they
10:07 - kind of make the cat change the color
10:11 - and also you can make the cat say
10:13 - something if you like and you can say
10:15 - hello right and we can say hello for
10:20 - maybe one second right so what you do is
10:24 - when the game is running you can push
10:26 - the space key and it will change this
10:32 - you see hello the cat is changing colors
10:34 - so so you can see that the cat is
10:37 - dancing the music is playing in the
10:41 - background and then you can push the
10:42 - space key or change the color of the cap
10:44 - so and also you can also like you know
10:48 - let's say if I want to reset the game
10:51 - every time so let's say I dragged the
10:54 - cat over here so let's say what I can do
10:57 - is I drag this here so every time the
11:00 - game start we'll move the cat to this
11:02 - position let's save the cat somehow
11:04 - playing you doing some other game I
11:07 - can't move to a certain position but
11:09 - when I click on this stop button it'll
11:11 - always put the cat back to this stage
11:13 - here so I click on this your character
11:22 - your sprite in the game next thing we
11:26 - can do is I think we'll we'll stop here
11:30 - for now so this is kind of the basic of
11:33 - the game so next we can go introduction
11:38 - introduce how to add that even spry into
11:41 - the game maybe making adding the dog
11:43 - having the bats that flies around so ok
11:48 - we're gonna try that next next lesson
11:51 - thank you so if you like what I'm doing
11:57 - here please leave a like thumbs up

hello and welcome to kids coding playground channel here we'll be teaching kids step by step learning the basic programming concept one of my favorite tool to use is scratch scratch is a visual or interactive programming language to develop MIT what kids can program their own interactive story games and animation so it is a really fun and easy tool to use let's get started now we'll go to here so we need to go to scratch that mit.edu so in here you can you can sign up for your own account okay after you sign up then you can see your stuff what are some other things that you could you have your project come here and then you can also if you don't like the online version you can also go here go down here into the download so this download you can download the offline version of scratch

it locally on your file in the year to like load it up but it allows you to work online without internet access but the online version everything is saved to your engine to your project so let me get started so now that you have a little bit basic of about scratch where did it go and how to download the scratch and how that lock in and use it so once you log in you will see you can go to my stuff click on this and you'll show like different stuff what are some of the project you have for scratch so or you can also create your new project so we can do that by clicking on this button here create a new project so when you create this new project it will low into this editor so this is the editor for scratch so let me show you one of the sly I made about the scratch so here the scratch editor this is a 3.0 scratch recently updated to 3.0 so this is a menu so this is the menu while you have here this is the stop and start this is the button to run your game this is the script area when you put your toe here those blocks this is the Kohl palette so you can track and drag the code and drop into this group area and these are the extension extension is like other stuff like music pen you know or others thing that you want to use with scratch and this is the background editor you can put a background for your game this is the sprite editor where you can edit putting different sprite like the cat here for example you can have a dog or something else and this is the stage meaning like when you're going to see so when your game runs so this is the basic apart the laid out for the scratch next we want to understand about the X&Y position of the of the scratch so in the center of scratch will be 0 0 this side will be positive x right this I will be negative X and this size positive Y this down here is negative Y so as you can see this quadrant here is positive x and positive Y here is positive x negative Y here is a negative x negative Y and here's negative x positive Y so here to kind of understand the positions of 0 0 is kinda in the center of the stage ok so next we're gonna go step by step teaching the kids how to code the first scratch game ok here we go so this is the sample lesson we can I walk on today so we're gonna have the cat in the background with the music and the cat will be dancing okay so let's let's start with the program so first we have the cat right so what we can do is we can click on this button here and go into here say select a background and then you can type maybe dance let's say yeah see dance so you have this spotlight select this so now you have the cat have a background of the dance stage we can't move that catcon in the middle of that stage here so after that what we can do is we can do some coding to make this cat move so first thing we can do is you can see these here these are the different code block they have so we can start with the first one event so when the button is clicked what do you want the cat to do so the cat it's not doing anything right now let's say we want to make the cat move so we're gonna have to take a look at this costume so as you can see the first costume is the cat camera standing here second custom is the cat can I like moving his leg so you can what you can do is you can put a loop we'll go into more detail on this later on but for right now I just follow along so you can see here control we can't drag this for loop into the into this block here so it was kind of like a Lego kind of thing you slaps naturally so and then you can say go back to here look and look you can say next costume so what you do is when you click on this you'll see the cat continuously forever changing the costume so I can click on this once so you can see it cannot go really fast right that's what we're not what we want right you can stop it so what we can do is you can put a little bit of weight okay in the control I believe yeah that's it yeah here so you can track weight over here you can do like 0.1 second so this is like a fraction of a second right so let's say if you go start again so you see how you click on this green flag go that means they will execute this block of code here so let me kind of zoom in so you can see better I should do that earlier so now let's let's click on this code so as you can see you can see the cat is kind of running or dancing or what it's doing and you can see that this block of code has become yellow meaning this isn't running so you can stop this now we have the cat moving kinda thing so now let's same one add some music to their cat right so what we can do we can go in here and then we can this is the extension we can add music extension so once you have the extension music you see something like this so what we can do is we can go back to the event we're gonna draw out another start when start is click then we are going back to the control we had another forever loop here and then what we can do is we're gonna make the cat kind of moving forward a little bit moving back a little bit so this is a movement so you had to go to the motion so you can say move forward ten step and what we can do is go back to the music we can say hey play this drum sound right or point zero five two second for the beat and then play and then make the movement again and then we can use like moving back right put back here and then you send ten so here so you can have like the drum plane is moving forward I'm moving backward and then we can use another music like let's say you can put another sound here and you can choose a different sound maybe you can choose this one right and then you can also make it move forward I can or you can just duplicate the code you right click say duplicate so now you have a second set of holes playing some sound we can move backward and forward again and then maybe we can delete this part we'd only track it back in here we'll delete that this one we can just select another one here so what happened if I run this code now you will see that the cat will continue moving dancing moving forward and backward and then we're changing the costume and playing this sound so let me run this real quick or save our project so as you can see this is a really simple project we created so where you can make the cat dancing right so next we can do is we can also make the cat maybe changing color so there's another event you can use by different event let's go back to the event so when space key is pressed so what we want to do is when the space key is pressed we want to change the color effects so we're going to go back to the look you can see that here change color effect by 25 so what happened is they kind of make the cat change the color and also you can make the cat say something if you like and you can say hello right and we can say hello for maybe one second right so what you do is when the game is running you can push the space key and it will change this you see hello the cat is changing colors so so you can see that the cat is dancing the music is playing in the background and then you can push the space key or change the color of the cap so and also you can also like you know let's say if I want to reset the game every time so let's say I dragged the cat over here so let's say what I can do is I drag this here so every time the game start we'll move the cat to this position let's save the cat somehow playing you doing some other game I can't move to a certain position but when I click on this stop button it'll always put the cat back to this stage here so I click on this your character your sprite in the game next thing we can do is I think we'll we'll stop here for now so this is kind of the basic of the game so next we can go introduction introduce how to add that even spry into the game maybe making adding the dog having the bats that flies around so ok we're gonna try that next next lesson thank you so if you like what I'm doing here please leave a like
