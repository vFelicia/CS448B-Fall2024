00:19 - so you guys can watch that because
00:20 - that's our first post today the second
00:22 - post today
00:23 - um so if you didn't know we saw our
00:26 - first day of spring
00:27 - and i think the fill the punxsutawney
00:30 - phil
00:31 - whatever the heck he's called the
00:33 - groundhog dude
00:34 - said that it would be six more weeks of
00:36 - winter well it's like it's
00:37 - it's like the heat of summer now so i
00:39 - mean like
00:40 - if if you live here it's so hot so
00:44 - phil is wrong it's a wonderful day let's
00:47 - have a barbecue okay so
00:48 - this is my project that i made it's a
00:50 - spring cooking game
00:52 - animation because people ask for a
00:54 - cooking spring whatever
00:56 - um game animation so
00:59 - we decided to make this so it's a
01:01 - wonderful day
01:03 - i agree let's light the fire chat other
01:06 - cat
01:08 - a bucket here a little grill hold some
01:10 - fire sounds
01:12 - and a fire we actually drew this fire
01:14 - and then we put the skewer
01:16 - on with the different foods a little it
01:19 - is done
01:20 - let's eat yeah i'm hungry
01:23 - so they're eating the food right now and
01:25 - then yeah let me put out the fire so he
01:27 - kicks the bucket and it flips over and
01:29 - it dumps the fire
01:31 - let's go home so then they go home so
01:34 - it's a simple
01:36 - uh animation that you can make so we're
01:39 - not going to teach this animation it's
01:40 - just a showcase
01:41 - and we will show you the code and we'll
01:43 - provide all the sprites
01:45 - so um we can also draw your own sprites
01:48 - so we'll be teaching you how to draw
01:49 - your own sprites so stick in for like
01:51 - the next 10 minutes or so
01:52 - so um here we go we have
01:56 - uh we have all this stuff so
02:00 - so um i'm gonna draw the vlogs for you
02:03 - i'm not a good artist
02:04 - so i'm gonna try doing this so
02:07 - i'm gonna get this color real quick so
02:09 - yeah so this is how you draw logs
02:13 - so paint you need outline
02:17 - outline no outline and then this thing
02:21 - the first one should look like this
02:28 - so it should be as big as that i mean
02:30 - like it's off the screen right now so
02:32 - you can
02:32 - position it better i don't know so you
02:35 - can also draw another one
02:37 - and tilt it so make a long and skinny
02:40 - soap because wood is always different
02:41 - so you can make it like thick thicker or
02:46 - smaller so like this
02:49 - you can flip it silk a skinny one
02:52 - you can make a skinny one i think this
02:55 - one should be more
02:56 - bigger
02:59 - i think this one should be more bigger
03:02 - uh yeah
03:05 - this should be fine so in that is that
03:07 - and then we can also make another one
03:09 - so we can make a a thicker one so
03:13 - this we can
03:17 - uh you can control c
03:21 - ctrl v so i can make the other one
03:24 - thicker but i decided to make this one
03:25 - more less because it's it looks like the
03:29 - smaller logs are on top
03:31 - and then the bigger log is on the bottom
03:33 - so this is basically how the fighter log
03:35 - should look like
03:36 - but i'm gonna use this costume so you
03:38 - guys can copy off of that
03:40 - and then i'm gonna show you how to draw
03:42 - a skewer next
03:45 - actually first the grill because the
03:46 - grill is the easier one
03:48 - yeah yeah so do that so um
03:52 - paint so first you have to start out
03:54 - with the little cubes
03:56 - so not the cubes
03:59 - this so draw the
04:03 - other two things so there's two little
04:06 - things on the side of the grill
04:08 - and you also need the thing so
04:11 - so i'm gonna make one like this tall
04:14 - and then i'm gonna put the other one all
04:17 - the way on the other side so it's ctrl c
04:18 - ctrl v
04:19 - and i'm gonna put it all the way
04:23 - here here i think i should put it there
04:27 - yeah
04:27 - so um i'll position it later so don't
04:30 - worry about that
04:31 - outline the thickness should be six so
04:35 - uh let's do six and then make
04:38 - a long line all the way
04:42 - across oh no all the way across
04:46 - here and then okay and then
04:49 - a second line then we get too close i
04:52 - think i'm ready too close
04:54 - so a second line
04:59 - oh my god i made it too close
05:04 - but i think that's fine i can make
05:06 - multiple lines to make it
05:07 - not like it's that close
05:11 - so
05:14 - so you have to hold the shift key while
05:16 - you're doing
05:17 - oopsies it's always too close i because
05:21 - the one that was over here is really
05:23 - close lines and i want to make it really
05:25 - close so it looks like the same
05:27 - so it should be around here yeah so
05:29 - three of these
05:30 - this looks great in my opinion i don't
05:32 - know but okay so
05:34 - you guys can follow along or you can
05:35 - copy this one i thought those two
05:39 - yeah so i just made it a little bit
05:41 - close
05:42 - so yeah i'm going to pull that one
05:47 - farther and then i'm going to pull this
05:48 - one to make it look like the same as
05:51 - the other one that i have so yeah great
05:54 - um great so look it looks
05:57 - it looks like grill now so and next
06:00 - we're gonna work on the skewer
06:02 - just we need to make a plain old stick
06:06 - here
06:07 - thickness is it's loading
06:11 - thickness is 10 so i'm gonna make this
06:13 - ten
06:14 - and then i'm gonna make it
06:21 - i'm gonna make it oopsies
06:29 - i'm gonna make it really like
06:32 - this did i make it i can't even see it
06:36 - i think it's hiding yeah it's hiding so
06:38 - i think it should be
06:39 - longer i'm not sure so yeah we can make
06:42 - this
06:43 - longer just a little bit yeah that
06:45 - should be the right size
06:48 - so i'm gonna show it here
06:51 - that's a little bit too long uh like a
06:55 - little bit shorter
06:57 - it's fine in your project you can make
06:58 - it smaller so i'm gonna
07:01 - make some uh uh
07:06 - um the whatever
07:09 - the fruits the veggies whatever they're
07:12 - called
07:12 - these things i think they're
07:16 - vegetables they're peppers pretty sure
07:18 - they're peppers
07:19 - grilling peppers so um yeah
07:22 - peppers we can also use a circle because
07:25 - circle
07:26 - looks quite well so you can just make it
07:30 - reshape it make it big and make it small
07:32 - doesn't matter
07:33 - so you can make it different sizes and
07:36 - shapes
07:37 - you can make an onion so we made an
07:39 - onion on one of them you can make a
07:41 - fish or even put a fish on one of them
07:44 - so it's
07:45 - different things you can make a lot of
07:47 - different creations it's your creativity
07:50 - because it always looks great so i'm
07:53 - gonna
07:54 - make onion ring next because onion rings
07:57 - are great so
08:03 - i could make onion rings
08:07 - you can see whatever this color is it's
08:09 - actually a circle so outline is now
08:12 - this and then i can make a circle
08:15 - no fill yeah great and then make the
08:18 - onion ring see
08:20 - great onion ring look on earring so yeah
08:24 - so it's just a skewer filled with
08:28 - meat i don't know what meat it could be
08:30 - any meat if you're a vegetarian that's
08:32 - fine
08:33 - you can put it all veggies because
08:35 - everybody likes vegetables
08:37 - so great we can make it a different
08:39 - color like red
08:40 - like that's a red pepper guys so
08:44 - so it's a red pepper guys great uh we
08:47 - can also put one more
08:49 - i'm gonna put one more
08:54 - i i think it's the
08:58 - so it can be meat if you like meat um
09:01 - yeah uh so i can put another piece of
09:04 - meat here
09:06 - i don't know i'm not a good artist so
09:09 - make it like
09:10 - this i don't know
09:16 - it looks like a pepper kinda so uh
09:19 - yeah i can add a little top to that
09:22 - all vegan skewer guys pepper
09:25 - pepper pepper pepper onion great
09:28 - all vegan so this is how you make the
09:30 - roasted version
09:32 - so you just have to duplicate it and
09:33 - change the color so
09:35 - i'm gonna start out with
09:39 - the green one i'm gonna change this to a
09:43 - darker green because it's you know
09:45 - whenever you roast something it gets
09:47 - darker if you didn't know that
09:48 - probably already did but i'm gonna make
09:51 - this one
09:52 - a more darker red almost like a brown
09:56 - so you can make it me if you want to on
09:58 - your game and then i can make this
10:03 - i'll make the brightness lower this oh
10:05 - my god it's almost black
10:07 - like this color great um and i can make
10:10 - this a darker red
10:15 - and this yellow almost like a maroon can
10:19 - be
10:20 - less golden so probably like that yeah
10:24 - great
10:24 - look it's a roasted skewer from raw to
10:27 - roasted
10:28 - so yeah or you can use this one look at
10:32 - this
10:33 - greatness so look meat
10:36 - there's meat peppers onions meat
10:39 - pepper meat and this is the roasted
10:42 - version oh yeah and you can also add the
10:43 - fish because
10:44 - cat two the brown one and the gray one
10:48 - the green one has a fish on it so you
10:51 - can add a fish
10:52 - and this is how you get a fish under
10:53 - thing so i'm gonna skewer too
10:56 - delete that costume first i'm gonna go
10:57 - back to the skewer
10:59 - oh never mind that's the regular costume
11:01 - so yeah
11:02 - this one you make the fish you just have
11:05 - to upload a costume and group it and put
11:07 - it into there so that's how you make it
11:09 - no no no it's a search costume so choose
11:11 - a costume
11:14 - fish because you know cats always love
11:17 - to eat fish
11:18 - i'm pretty sure these are all tropical
11:20 - fish i think this one might be edible
11:22 - not sure i don't i'm not a fish
11:23 - expert so yeah so fish you can
11:27 - just group this ctrl c
11:31 - and then i'll put it like over here ctrl
11:34 - v
11:35 - and then you can delete this costume
11:37 - afterwards
11:39 - and then you can just align it on one of
11:41 - those things so
11:43 - i i gotta group it first so
11:48 - group it group and then you can add it
11:51 - anywhere you want you can add it on the
11:53 - bottom you can add on top
11:54 - you can add a big fish you gotta
11:58 - flip horizontal you can make it flip the
12:01 - other way so you can even make it really
12:04 - big
12:04 - like you caught a big tuna or something
12:06 - i don't know to change the color of the
12:08 - fish you gotta ungroup it and break it
12:10 - up so
12:11 - ungroup and then you gotta get on one of
12:14 - those little scales
12:15 - and little dots and scales so that's for
12:18 - the whole one
12:19 - you can make a brown color because you
12:21 - just fried a fish so
12:22 - um yeah this is that and we can make the
12:26 - meat like a darker color a darker
12:29 - yellow like yeah nice not coloring the
12:32 - whole thing because it's
12:34 - ungrouped so nice um make it a darker
12:39 - or yellow it's like almost a brown color
12:43 - more like a plant type color
12:47 - not really so yeah i like a jade color i
12:50 - don't know
12:50 - so and then um you can make the eye
12:53 - even more darker but that's fine and you
12:56 - can change the color of the spots
12:58 - but that's fine you can do it if you
13:00 - want to but we ungrouped it again so now
13:02 - it's one spot by one spot
13:04 - so so this one and this one looks very
13:07 - similar so you can just
13:09 - oh i haven't grouped it so
13:12 - so yeah and then we can just group it
13:15 - back
13:18 - together group
13:20 - so and then you can add it onto your
13:22 - skewer if you want to
13:23 - but this is the raw skewer so you can
13:25 - put on your cooked skewer so that's
13:27 - basically how you do the fish
13:28 - and then now we're going to teach you
13:30 - how to do the fire
13:31 - so the fire is quite hard
13:36 - so yeah um my dad drew all these
13:40 - a fire costume we spent a lot of effort
13:42 - drawing all this stuff
13:43 - reshaping squares and adding all these
13:47 - little particle effects
13:48 - it took forever believe me and then uh
13:52 - so
13:52 - do you know why so please like share
13:55 - subscribe
13:56 - right now please just do it and
13:59 - what while you subscribe your subscribe
14:02 - is gonna be blazing hot and it's gonna
14:03 - boost our channel
14:05 - thank you for your subscribe thank you
14:07 - so
14:08 - you can make this fire so i'm gonna try
14:11 - to make this fire so
14:13 - i mean like not a good artist
14:16 - so i might just fail the fire looks
14:19 - very hard to do so you just have to
14:22 - start out with a circle
14:23 - looks so bland but you just have to
14:26 - reshape it into life
14:27 - so um yeah maybe change some edges
14:31 - make some ridges i don't know make it
14:34 - like a fire type of shape
14:36 - takes forever we might make one or two
14:40 - costumes or three
14:41 - for you to see so looks more like a
14:43 - dinosaur
14:44 - print like when you step like one of
14:46 - those t-rexes that are
14:48 - stumped down and they make the little
14:50 - print in the mud
14:51 - right now but we have to add all the
14:53 - fire effects
14:54 - and it will look glorious so right now
14:58 - i'm reshaping all the fire and
15:01 - making it a paw print i don't know what
15:03 - this is right now
15:04 - um looks way different cause it looks
15:08 - so i'm not a good artist so yeah
15:11 - this looks like uh
15:15 - a dog like a dog can
15:19 - but the ring finger is kind of messed up
15:22 - and the pinkies are in the pinky and the
15:24 - middle fingers so short
15:26 - so yeah looks like a volcano now so but
15:29 - you now you have to copy paste it ctrl
15:33 - c ctrl v you make another set of it
15:36 - and then you make it smaller and make it
15:38 - inside
15:40 - and now you have to change the color
15:42 - just a little bit and reshape it so then
15:44 - it'll fit inside the fire
15:45 - so great then we can change the color
15:48 - this um
15:49 - blazing hot thing the inside of the fire
15:53 - if you ever seen a fighter
15:54 - like in those cartoons and stuff they
15:56 - always have the red layer
15:58 - the orange layer outside and they have
16:00 - like the lighter orange layer and then
16:02 - they have the yellow layer so
16:04 - that's basically what we're doing right
16:05 - now so yeah
16:08 - um yeah
16:11 - looks this one looks way better so we
16:14 - can make a
16:15 - third one which we have to i guess so
16:18 - so um this fire is looking kind of
16:21 - screwed so
16:22 - um we can add a third layer but we're
16:25 - not gonna do that you can add some
16:26 - little particle effects
16:28 - like just some you know
16:31 - i don't know uh
16:34 - red little lava effects coming out like
16:38 - in minecraft if you ever played
16:39 - minecraft you probably have
16:41 - i mean like minecraft like the lava pits
16:44 - they always have like lava jumping out
16:46 - so that's basically what we're doing and
16:49 - then you can also make some
16:50 - gas as well which is because fire
16:54 - emits deadly gas so
16:58 - yeah we can make some gas make a gray
17:00 - color
17:02 - so gray draw some little
17:05 - i don't know a gas particles so around
17:09 - the fire
17:10 - and then you should make them go up and
17:11 - then new gas particles come out so
17:14 - we also have this in the google drive if
17:15 - you don't want to make your fire
17:17 - and it ends up looking like a butterfly
17:19 - or something then you can download it
17:21 - feel free to download it
17:22 - and if you don't understand watch our
17:24 - entire download google drive
17:26 - um video uh yeah you can do that it's on
17:29 - our channel so
17:30 - yeah um we could yeah so this is
17:34 - basically our animation you can code
17:36 - whatever you want but first let me show
17:37 - you the code to our animation
17:39 - so i'm starting out the butterfly
17:40 - because butterfly is just useless
17:43 - just flies there doing nothing so this
17:45 - is a butterfly
17:46 - feel free to pause because we're almost
17:48 - at the 20 minute mark so we gotta speed
17:51 - this up
17:51 - grill nah this is no code basically
17:56 - fire logs nope this is barely any code
17:58 - as well
17:59 - skewer so first i'm going to start out
18:01 - with the regular cat
18:06 - i i can't even zoom in i gotta
18:09 - i i could drag this thing down here so
18:12 - you can see it all right yeah yeah so
18:14 - this is for a regular cat
18:18 - so you could do this and and
18:21 - and you can make them talk back and
18:23 - forth like it's like a real conversation
18:26 - and then you can go to cat2 this is
18:28 - basically all the code
18:30 - feel free to pause remember and um yeah
18:34 - this is pretty good i mean like they're
18:35 - having like a conversation yeah i'm
18:37 - hungry yeah let me put out the fire and
18:39 - stuff
18:40 - so skewer this is where the skewer
18:44 - jumps onto the grill and starts burning
18:47 - itself so
18:48 - yeah nice you feel free to pause and
18:51 - then skewer two um
18:56 - codes everywhere so this looks great as
18:59 - well
18:59 - and then we got skewer two and then
19:02 - yeah and then take out oh wait i forgot
19:05 - to name this
19:06 - take out if you use the first uh
19:09 - costume a takeout it looks really like a
19:12 - bucket
19:12 - so you take out a it looks so much like
19:15 - a bucket if you do not know
19:16 - chinese food yeah i was like that always
19:19 - looks like a bucket uh outside so
19:21 - great um all this stuff fire gone fire
19:25 - put out
19:25 - all this stuff and then you can also do
19:27 - the backdrop add some music
19:29 - and then we have the fire tackling
19:32 - i did i didn't demo the fire code yet so
19:36 - here's the fire code and then there
19:40 - fighter sand oh so i just
19:44 - i think i think i actually got this from
19:46 - a real life fighter that i made
19:48 - a like a while ago and i just recorded
19:51 - like the fire
19:52 - just cackling and then at the camp so i
19:54 - just took some sound from that so
19:56 - yeah that's what i did so yeah
19:59 - that's about it guys and you guys
20:02 - remember to make your own story or you
20:03 - can just copy our story i don't know
20:06 - you can if you want to but remember you
20:08 - can be creative

can watch that because that's our first post today the second post today um so if you didn't know we saw our first day of spring and i think the fill the punxsutawney phil whatever the heck he's called the groundhog dude said that it would be six more weeks of winter well it's like it's it's like the heat of summer now so i mean like if if you live here it's so hot so phil is wrong it's a wonderful day let's have a barbecue okay so this is my project that i made it's a spring cooking game animation because people ask for a cooking spring whatever um game animation so we decided to make this so it's a wonderful day i agree let's light the fire chat other cat a bucket here a little grill hold some fire sounds and a fire we actually drew this fire and then we put the skewer on with the different foods a little it is done let's eat yeah i'm hungry so they're eating the food right now and then yeah let me put out the fire so he kicks the bucket and it flips over and it dumps the fire let's go home so then they go home so it's a simple uh animation that you can make so we're not going to teach this animation it's just a showcase and we will show you the code and we'll provide all the sprites so um we can also draw your own sprites so we'll be teaching you how to draw your own sprites so stick in for like the next 10 minutes or so so um here we go we have uh we have all this stuff so so um i'm gonna draw the vlogs for you i'm not a good artist so i'm gonna try doing this so i'm gonna get this color real quick so yeah so this is how you draw logs so paint you need outline outline no outline and then this thing the first one should look like this so it should be as big as that i mean like it's off the screen right now so you can position it better i don't know so you can also draw another one and tilt it so make a long and skinny soap because wood is always different so you can make it like thick thicker or smaller so like this you can flip it silk a skinny one you can make a skinny one i think this one should be more bigger i think this one should be more bigger uh yeah this should be fine so in that is that and then we can also make another one so we can make a a thicker one so this we can uh you can control c ctrl v so i can make the other one thicker but i decided to make this one more less because it's it looks like the smaller logs are on top and then the bigger log is on the bottom so this is basically how the fighter log should look like but i'm gonna use this costume so you guys can copy off of that and then i'm gonna show you how to draw a skewer next actually first the grill because the grill is the easier one yeah yeah so do that so um paint so first you have to start out with the little cubes so not the cubes this so draw the other two things so there's two little things on the side of the grill and you also need the thing so so i'm gonna make one like this tall and then i'm gonna put the other one all the way on the other side so it's ctrl c ctrl v and i'm gonna put it all the way here here i think i should put it there yeah so um i'll position it later so don't worry about that outline the thickness should be six so uh let's do six and then make a long line all the way across oh no all the way across here and then okay and then a second line then we get too close i think i'm ready too close so a second line oh my god i made it too close but i think that's fine i can make multiple lines to make it not like it's that close so so you have to hold the shift key while you're doing oopsies it's always too close i because the one that was over here is really close lines and i want to make it really close so it looks like the same so it should be around here yeah so three of these this looks great in my opinion i don't know but okay so you guys can follow along or you can copy this one i thought those two yeah so i just made it a little bit close so yeah i'm going to pull that one farther and then i'm going to pull this one to make it look like the same as the other one that i have so yeah great um great so look it looks it looks like grill now so and next we're gonna work on the skewer just we need to make a plain old stick here thickness is it's loading thickness is 10 so i'm gonna make this ten and then i'm gonna make it i'm gonna make it oopsies i'm gonna make it really like this did i make it i can't even see it i think it's hiding yeah it's hiding so i think it should be longer i'm not sure so yeah we can make this longer just a little bit yeah that should be the right size so i'm gonna show it here that's a little bit too long uh like a little bit shorter it's fine in your project you can make it smaller so i'm gonna make some uh uh um the whatever the fruits the veggies whatever they're called these things i think they're vegetables they're peppers pretty sure they're peppers grilling peppers so um yeah peppers we can also use a circle because circle looks quite well so you can just make it reshape it make it big and make it small doesn't matter so you can make it different sizes and shapes you can make an onion so we made an onion on one of them you can make a fish or even put a fish on one of them so it's different things you can make a lot of different creations it's your creativity because it always looks great so i'm gonna make onion ring next because onion rings are great so i could make onion rings you can see whatever this color is it's actually a circle so outline is now this and then i can make a circle no fill yeah great and then make the onion ring see great onion ring look on earring so yeah so it's just a skewer filled with meat i don't know what meat it could be any meat if you're a vegetarian that's fine you can put it all veggies because everybody likes vegetables so great we can make it a different color like red like that's a red pepper guys so so it's a red pepper guys great uh we can also put one more i'm gonna put one more i i think it's the so it can be meat if you like meat um yeah uh so i can put another piece of meat here i don't know i'm not a good artist so make it like this i don't know it looks like a pepper kinda so uh yeah i can add a little top to that all vegan skewer guys pepper pepper pepper pepper onion great all vegan so this is how you make the roasted version so you just have to duplicate it and change the color so i'm gonna start out with the green one i'm gonna change this to a darker green because it's you know whenever you roast something it gets darker if you didn't know that probably already did but i'm gonna make this one a more darker red almost like a brown so you can make it me if you want to on your game and then i can make this i'll make the brightness lower this oh my god it's almost black like this color great um and i can make this a darker red and this yellow almost like a maroon can be less golden so probably like that yeah great look it's a roasted skewer from raw to roasted so yeah or you can use this one look at this greatness so look meat there's meat peppers onions meat pepper meat and this is the roasted version oh yeah and you can also add the fish because cat two the brown one and the gray one the green one has a fish on it so you can add a fish and this is how you get a fish under thing so i'm gonna skewer too delete that costume first i'm gonna go back to the skewer oh never mind that's the regular costume so yeah this one you make the fish you just have to upload a costume and group it and put it into there so that's how you make it no no no it's a search costume so choose a costume fish because you know cats always love to eat fish i'm pretty sure these are all tropical fish i think this one might be edible not sure i don't i'm not a fish expert so yeah so fish you can just group this ctrl c and then i'll put it like over here ctrl v and then you can delete this costume afterwards and then you can just align it on one of those things so i i gotta group it first so group it group and then you can add it anywhere you want you can add it on the bottom you can add on top you can add a big fish you gotta flip horizontal you can make it flip the other way so you can even make it really big like you caught a big tuna or something i don't know to change the color of the fish you gotta ungroup it and break it up so ungroup and then you gotta get on one of those little scales and little dots and scales so that's for the whole one you can make a brown color because you just fried a fish so um yeah this is that and we can make the meat like a darker color a darker yellow like yeah nice not coloring the whole thing because it's ungrouped so nice um make it a darker or yellow it's like almost a brown color more like a plant type color not really so yeah i like a jade color i don't know so and then um you can make the eye even more darker but that's fine and you can change the color of the spots but that's fine you can do it if you want to but we ungrouped it again so now it's one spot by one spot so so this one and this one looks very similar so you can just oh i haven't grouped it so so yeah and then we can just group it back together group so and then you can add it onto your skewer if you want to but this is the raw skewer so you can put on your cooked skewer so that's basically how you do the fish and then now we're going to teach you how to do the fire so the fire is quite hard so yeah um my dad drew all these a fire costume we spent a lot of effort drawing all this stuff reshaping squares and adding all these little particle effects it took forever believe me and then uh so do you know why so please like share subscribe right now please just do it and what while you subscribe your subscribe is gonna be blazing hot and it's gonna boost our channel thank you for your subscribe thank you so you can make this fire so i'm gonna try to make this fire so i mean like not a good artist so i might just fail the fire looks very hard to do so you just have to start out with a circle looks so bland but you just have to reshape it into life so um yeah maybe change some edges make some ridges i don't know make it like a fire type of shape takes forever we might make one or two costumes or three for you to see so looks more like a dinosaur print like when you step like one of those trexes that are stumped down and they make the little print in the mud right now but we have to add all the fire effects and it will look glorious so right now i'm reshaping all the fire and making it a paw print i don't know what this is right now um looks way different cause it looks so i'm not a good artist so yeah this looks like uh a dog like a dog can but the ring finger is kind of messed up and the pinkies are in the pinky and the middle fingers so short so yeah looks like a volcano now so but you now you have to copy paste it ctrl c ctrl v you make another set of it and then you make it smaller and make it inside and now you have to change the color just a little bit and reshape it so then it'll fit inside the fire so great then we can change the color this um blazing hot thing the inside of the fire if you ever seen a fighter like in those cartoons and stuff they always have the red layer the orange layer outside and they have like the lighter orange layer and then they have the yellow layer so that's basically what we're doing right now so yeah um yeah looks this one looks way better so we can make a third one which we have to i guess so so um this fire is looking kind of screwed so um we can add a third layer but we're not gonna do that you can add some little particle effects like just some you know i don't know uh red little lava effects coming out like in minecraft if you ever played minecraft you probably have i mean like minecraft like the lava pits they always have like lava jumping out so that's basically what we're doing and then you can also make some gas as well which is because fire emits deadly gas so yeah we can make some gas make a gray color so gray draw some little i don't know a gas particles so around the fire and then you should make them go up and then new gas particles come out so we also have this in the google drive if you don't want to make your fire and it ends up looking like a butterfly or something then you can download it feel free to download it and if you don't understand watch our entire download google drive um video uh yeah you can do that it's on our channel so yeah um we could yeah so this is basically our animation you can code whatever you want but first let me show you the code to our animation so i'm starting out the butterfly because butterfly is just useless just flies there doing nothing so this is a butterfly feel free to pause because we're almost at the 20 minute mark so we gotta speed this up grill nah this is no code basically fire logs nope this is barely any code as well skewer so first i'm going to start out with the regular cat i i can't even zoom in i gotta i i could drag this thing down here so you can see it all right yeah yeah so this is for a regular cat so you could do this and and and you can make them talk back and forth like it's like a real conversation and then you can go to cat2 this is basically all the code feel free to pause remember and um yeah this is pretty good i mean like they're having like a conversation yeah i'm hungry yeah let me put out the fire and stuff so skewer this is where the skewer jumps onto the grill and starts burning itself so yeah nice you feel free to pause and then skewer two um codes everywhere so this looks great as well and then we got skewer two and then yeah and then take out oh wait i forgot to name this take out if you use the first uh costume a takeout it looks really like a bucket so you take out a it looks so much like a bucket if you do not know chinese food yeah i was like that always looks like a bucket uh outside so great um all this stuff fire gone fire put out all this stuff and then you can also do the backdrop add some music and then we have the fire tackling i did i didn't demo the fire code yet so here's the fire code and then there fighter sand oh so i just i think i think i actually got this from a real life fighter that i made a like a while ago and i just recorded like the fire just cackling and then at the camp so i just took some sound from that so yeah that's what i did so yeah that's about it guys and you guys remember to make your own story or you can just copy our story i don't know you can if you want to but remember you can be creative make your own story and you might even get it favorited so bye guys it's the end of this video and see you guys next time
