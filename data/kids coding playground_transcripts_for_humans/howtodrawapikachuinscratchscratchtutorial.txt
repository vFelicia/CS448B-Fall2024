00:12 - back for another video in scratch and
00:13 - today we'll be drawing pikachu on
00:16 - scratch and it was suggested by somebody
00:18 - named coding with srihas and
00:21 - uh they wanted us to draw a pokemon
00:24 - pikachu
00:26 - so we have tried to attempt that so i'm
00:29 - going to close this now and
00:33 - yeah let's just close this and then
00:35 - um
00:36 - so
00:37 - there's i'm going to be drawing this
00:39 - pikachu today and in the costumes as you
00:42 - can see i made all these new costumes
00:44 - like red pikachu
00:46 - relic pikachu checkerboard
00:49 - uh whatever this thing is rose rose
00:54 - uh
00:55 - futuristic
00:58 - and a lot more okay so
01:00 - yeah let's start
01:04 - so we'll be trying to attempt to draw a
01:05 - pikachu
01:08 - so i'm painting a new sprite
01:11 - well let's get started
01:12 - so first you draw a line to for the top
01:16 - portion of the
01:17 - head so just draw a straight line
01:20 - and now we'll do some insane
01:24 - reshaping move that thing up
01:27 - move this thing up and like make it kind
01:30 - of round and kind of look like a hexagon
01:32 - or octagon
01:34 - and
01:35 - move that out and yeah you can make
01:38 - these
01:41 - yeah move it out
01:43 - move it out
01:46 - yeah
01:48 - and then so we have that
01:54 - so we have the top portion of it said
01:58 - so now we color it so actually we get
02:01 - the mouse
02:03 - and we click on it
02:05 - and then there's this fill button so you
02:06 - like go
02:08 - around 14 100 same thing whatever it
02:11 - doesn't matter
02:12 - doesn't matter so 14 yep we have the
02:16 - right color and now
02:18 - we make the body
02:20 - so the body has it's just a complex of
02:24 - lines so line up
02:27 - line down kinda down
02:30 - so line up line down
02:34 - line up
02:37 - line to the side kinda down
02:40 - and
02:41 - line
02:42 - [Music]
02:43 - down downish right
02:46 - and we keep on going so lying down
02:50 - straight line
02:53 - line to the side
02:56 - line up
03:01 - lines at the side
03:06 - line up
03:08 - line to the left
03:11 - line up
03:15 - and
03:16 - line to the left
03:18 - so now we have its body
03:20 - finished and
03:22 - done
03:23 - so yeah
03:24 - uh one one arm is more fatter than the
03:27 - other arm so it might need some tuning
03:30 - so
03:32 - get the right shape so we're going to
03:34 - change this to the color
03:38 - oh first we have to reshape it to make
03:40 - it look more round because
03:42 - like you know
03:46 - it looks better
03:47 - and we have to make it
03:50 - curve in the
03:51 - side
03:53 - curve
03:53 - [Music]
03:55 - so we just have to curve this a little
03:57 - bit
04:00 - turn it down
04:02 - curve it down
04:06 - and
04:07 - a little bit to the side
04:10 - and then yeah we have right
04:13 - curved pikachu's body
04:16 - so now we have to work on the fill for
04:19 - this thing so
04:25 - pointer
04:27 - and then you get the fill color
04:30 - so there we have it
04:33 - and then you have that and then move it
04:37 - a little bit yeah make the head a little
04:39 - bit larger so then it'll fit on so yep
04:42 - now we've done it and now we have to do
04:45 - the
04:47 - nose
04:48 - the mouth
04:50 - the cheek
04:51 - and the eyes
04:53 - so yeah i have to round this back out
04:55 - it's too
04:56 - round
04:59 - a little bit down yeah
05:01 - that looks fine
05:04 - so now we're going to do the legs
05:06 - actually because it seems more easier it
05:08 - looks like you're more done with the
05:10 - project when you do that ctrl c ctrl v
05:13 - and then we move it to the other side
05:16 - and make it go backwards and make the
05:18 - other one go backwards as well
05:22 - so now we're focusing on the ears
05:25 - so let's do that oval shape kind of like
05:28 - a lips like how
05:31 - yeah a black oval
05:35 - and
05:36 - a yellow oval on top of the black oval
05:40 - so let's get that
05:41 - i
05:44 - no color
05:50 - put that on top
05:53 - like that and we have an ear
05:57 - just like that and now
05:59 - we move that
06:04 - and we have the ear
06:10 - we group them
06:11 - and then we rotate
06:14 - and place it on
06:17 - control c control v and then put it on
06:20 - the other side and rotate
06:26 - make it go back
06:28 - make the other ones go back
06:31 - there we have it we have the two little
06:33 - ears
06:34 - and now we're gonna work on the eyes
06:38 - the nose
06:40 - the mouth
06:41 - the cheekbones and the tongue so first
06:44 - we start out the eyes which is just hold
06:46 - shift down when you're making a circle
06:50 - move it to the other side
06:54 - we oh yeah we make this smaller circle
06:55 - in first make the pupil
06:58 - so zoom in make the pupil
07:02 - and then
07:04 - put that near them kind of the side
07:08 - and then you do that ctrl c
07:10 - group ctrl v
07:13 - and then we move it
07:15 - on the other side of the head
07:17 - and we move this one on this side of the
07:19 - head
07:21 - so now
07:22 - we can make the nose
07:25 - which is just a four thickness line
07:27 - that's really small and we just curve it
07:29 - up a little bit it's really easy to make
07:31 - the nose and just click right click
07:33 - reshape done
07:39 - and then we put it on
07:42 - so we have that and now
07:44 - we're going to make the mouth
07:46 - which is just a straight line
07:49 - make him say
07:51 - stay neutral but we curve it so curve
07:54 - down
07:56 - curve up double click
07:59 - curve down
08:06 - and
08:07 - we are done so it's like a squiggly line
08:10 - like up and down and
08:12 - up
08:13 - ah so it's like a w kind of
08:21 - so i place down the mouth now i might
08:24 - have yeah so i placed on the mouse now
08:26 - so
08:27 - yeah we have that
08:29 - and
08:31 - we make it like that
08:33 - and now
08:34 - we have the mouse
08:38 - so now we make a black part of the
08:41 - tongue which is just pure black
08:43 - and it's circle
08:46 - and we have a circle
08:49 - and now we have a red circle on top of a
08:52 - black circle so we have a red circle
08:55 - and then the outline no outline and then
08:58 - we have that
09:01 - and
09:02 - we
09:04 - reshape it move it down a little bit
09:08 - just a little bit and then
09:12 - we have our tongue
09:16 - so and then we place it on with the
09:17 - pointer tool
09:19 - and
09:22 - and yeah make it a little bit out
09:27 - yeah and we're basically done with the
09:29 - tongue here and then we have to group it
09:34 - and then move it on
09:39 - and we have our tongue
09:41 - now it's time to draw the cheekbones uh
09:44 - which is just red circle
09:47 - on uh the
09:50 - side
09:54 - uh and we have that
09:56 - place it on
09:58 - ctrl c ctrl v and we have the other
10:01 - cheaper
10:02 - and now we just have to draw a complex
10:04 - of lines to make the
10:07 - uh tail so it's just one line
10:11 - oh that's thickness one four
10:20 - so we got four and
10:22 - here we have
10:24 - up
10:25 - upright
10:27 - up
10:28 - up right

10:34 - down
10:36 - left
10:38 - and we
10:40 - and down
10:41 - up so we have that and we make the fill
10:44 - inside
10:49 - and we have the tail
10:51 - first we must make the fill size
10:56 - pretty sizable here
10:59 - so
