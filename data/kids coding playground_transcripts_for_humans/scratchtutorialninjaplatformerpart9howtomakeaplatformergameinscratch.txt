00:34 - introductions over now let's get started
00:37 - okay before we can just kind of overview
00:41 - what we had on the last time the code so
00:45 - you guys can pause the video if you need
00:47 - to just check through the code so these
00:50 - are some of the custom block we define
00:52 - for the code I think I went through that
00:55 - previous lessons so just one go through
00:59 - slowly so you guys can check so this is
01:04 - the begin this is the attack and okay
01:09 - here we had the standing movement and
01:13 - just then please don't tell me anything
01:15 - this is what we had in the previous
01:17 - lesson the ninja touched the water or
01:20 - they'll die we'll have to have something
01:24 - for the if the ninja touched Iran the to
01:26 - sell so he'll die also we added this at
01:31 - next level right previous lesson I think
01:34 - the attack ninja or that should be the
01:37 - same we didn't make any change to that
01:40 - the throwing ninja same thing the
01:43 - colliding ninja same thing we didn't do
01:45 - anything
01:46 - a platform just just the level that I
01:50 - think we say next levels changed a
01:52 - different level yes the way I mean the
01:55 - preview lesson we had that the crate
01:58 - same thing here if the depending on the
02:01 - level will move the crater a different
02:03 - position so we have that okay and then
02:08 - the waters no change here hitbox one
02:12 - here and then the knife hitbox is not
02:16 - much go right to
02:18 - that making clothes effect and then the
02:21 - night the gym the portal and then you
02:26 - win okay all right so today we'll add
02:31 - that Medusa with the Medusa I think you
02:34 - don't know look at the first video I
02:36 - mentioned where to download so once you
02:39 - download it you can just say pain a new
02:42 - sprite in here you can upload all your
02:46 - costume for them
02:48 - the - zaheer I think is under here we
02:54 - downloaded it last time let's see
02:59 - not this one maybe mmm this one I don't
03:04 - know
03:05 - wanna see here so we have this deucey so
03:08 - you see there a lot of different one
03:11 - I think I added the walk right and then
03:16 - death you can add flex the attack and
03:18 - all that also different things - oh I
03:21 - didn't I mean you can add them like
03:24 - Medusa attack and all shootout but for
03:27 - now I just only added to death and then
03:30 - the walk one so thing I think on my
03:34 - previous game also I did not have all of
03:36 - him I just added depth and then I added
03:41 - them walk okay alright let's see just so
03:48 - you cannot have up stuff to the stone
03:50 - and stuff like that and you like to put
03:54 - in different things okay so we'll just
03:57 - upload all the Medusa here you can zoom
04:01 - in a little bit of me like okay so to
04:05 - say ya won't trash the first custom okay
04:09 - let's take a look okay
04:12 - oh we have the Medusa with us so let's
04:14 - go back to the first level so
04:18 - we have tonight so I don't think we we
04:21 - don't really need her for the first
04:22 - level we just can let the music and use
04:25 - to the movement of the ninja so I would
04:29 - say by would only reduce on the first
04:31 - level we can start with second levels
04:33 - but before we do that we need to create
04:36 - some variable for the Medusa so just
04:40 - like similar to the you know the
04:42 - costumes who use a ninja to move we can
04:46 - create same thing like Medusa I still so
04:55 - this will keep a keep track of the that
04:59 - what costume the Medusa will have right
05:04 - just so we can rename her okay or
05:10 - remember - Medusa here okay so and then
05:17 - we'll need more variable we're gonna
05:19 - keep track of how them to do some wall
05:21 - so there's left and right so we're gonna
05:23 - use some position so that we couldn't
05:26 - find a position of the space here
05:29 - depending on the level and all in
05:32 - position the Medusa won't use that so
05:36 - let's create something called the right
05:42 - position and okay so the right position
06:03 - the left position will keep track of
06:04 - what we're moving the Medusa phone line
06:07 - left right here or any other Enya level
06:13 - okay and then now we'll create a new
06:16 - block my block will call it my two
06:24 - stop okay so this block wall you know
06:30 - define how them because I will start
06:33 - okay so the first thing what to do is we
06:37 - are going to show her in case you die
06:40 - she hides a letter show and then we have
06:43 - to say go to the front layer and that
06:49 - will clear any graphics so the tips are
06:52 - die we can like give you one you can
06:53 - make like those are flashing or whatever
06:57 - like oh cosa fact or whatever who can do
07:01 - that and then we can set up up with him
07:03 - one more very long look who's HP right
07:10 - this is like the health point of the
07:12 - Medusa so we can give them give her like
07:16 - five points or whatever done her eye
07:19 - water three you know I think make it new
07:22 - be faster when we're doing testing so
07:25 - the monster and then whether set the
07:31 - custom in next that's the walk in
07:35 - costume so I'm not going to use the
07:40 - death costume my parents which fishing
07:42 - one to death custom within that's good
07:45 - now this is for walking so we can't stop
07:48 - one so if we see here custom we have
07:54 - like walk walk one two three four eight
07:59 - so just look through that phone number
08:02 - okay and we have the use of ever loop
08:10 - yeah and then we'll check a bit attacked
08:14 - by the ninja so it'll say if condition
08:18 - here where the color sensing touching
08:24 - source they touching the ninja attack
08:29 - which is this ninja so they use a
08:31 - Madusa then you know she don't get
08:34 - damaged what we can do is we're gonna or
08:38 - cast the event and wait so wish you use
08:42 - the weight so that way you don't get
08:44 - more than one damage on her when you
08:46 - slice her okay what what cast got hit
08:50 - the middle so got hit and duplicate this
08:56 - as well so you can duplicate this as
08:58 - well or you can do or statement right so
09:01 - like you can say yeah gotten hit by this
09:06 - as well right you can say get hit or you
09:08 - can say the or statement so you take
09:10 - this out you can take this down
09:13 - isn't there something called all
09:14 - operator put this here and you can drop
09:18 - this inside here it's just the same
09:20 - thing you know so you don't need that to
09:21 - your statement
09:22 - yeah let me stop the game okay all right
09:27 - so we've got that so next won't make
09:30 - them to do some move so to say we'll
09:34 - keep on moving five step at the time and
09:37 - we will check some position so let's say
09:44 - yeah we can make them into saving on the
09:46 - first stage and maybe fine let's say
09:49 - yeah okay now if we use some condition
09:55 - here so we'll say if the exposition
10:00 - which is the current person where the
10:02 - Medusa is you know the exposition okay
10:05 - for her so we'll stay here exposition
10:11 - will take that out and what he is the
10:14 - operator here will use so the exposition
10:19 - is created then the Medusa so what the
10:26 - finding position for her know like here
10:30 - in here so before could actually get the
10:34 - exposition comparison what they'll come
10:37 - and check the Medusa so this is a pretty
10:40 - big platform we can put her someone the
10:42 - middle
10:42 - here what we can do is this we you
10:46 - remember we have a events a podcast stop
10:49 - set up where were you then here
10:52 - somewhere I that podcaster set up when
10:55 - the game started that's where that is
11:01 - thinking is on the other co okay we need
11:06 - look for that cell but I think I found
11:07 - it
11:08 - there's too many Co here but it's right
11:10 - here so when this thought of the
11:12 - greenback is click with podcast is set
11:14 - up so we can use that to set up the
11:16 - Medusa first so we'll say when I receive
11:25 - set up so now we're going to check what
11:30 - level it is so it is done so this level
11:34 - one will do something different the
11:36 - visible to will be something different
11:38 - so we'll check if equal so level if
11:50 - level was one which is this level right
11:52 - now we're using your levels one won't
11:55 - move
11:56 - so put that over here is the one here
12:00 - okay and then we'll put down for the
12:04 - next level that's a platform won't
12:06 - switch it to a second costume so when I
12:10 - say what is it box for now okay so the
12:15 - second customers say what matters are
12:17 - here don't worry about all the other
12:19 - things right now we just check in the
12:22 - position so here this is the second
12:24 - level so we'll just duplicate this one
12:28 - we kiss - and we'll take this down sorry
12:35 - I think it clicked on it this way so
12:37 - what I'm like right oh wait here okay so
12:41 - we'll say take that so it's you can't in
12:46 - here like you see this like Kenna you
12:49 - kind of guess so you can see how this
12:51 - exchange
12:52 - so from here
12:54 - - all the way here like this is 38 38
13:00 - plus you know 75 ish you'll be on this
13:05 - side so what we're going to do is we're
13:07 - gonna add an - I mean add and minus 75
13:12 - for that position so that we know when
13:14 - we will tell them that this to turn back
13:16 - around one one other walk off the edge
13:18 - right so that's what we use that left
13:20 - and right position for okay so this is
13:24 - the the to solve the second stage right
13:28 - hmm think this looks better than this
13:32 - just take that and then now let's look
13:34 - at third stage and we'll use the ask
13:38 - them to third stage we can put her like
13:41 - maybe right here right so go back to the
13:47 - code so in this level three go move her
13:52 - to this position here it's four one two
13:57 - three so we set up for all three level
13:59 - okay and what we can do is we are going
14:05 - to set the variable so no every time to
14:10 - set up start we'll set the variable so
14:12 - we know where the left position the
14:14 - maximum left position she can go and
14:17 - right position okay so what the vision
14:20 - is was that the right position so we can
14:24 - take the x position of this unit this
14:28 - right here and we come and use the
14:31 - operator - so this is x position oops
14:39 - - 75 and the y position we then the
14:46 - other position the right position one
14:48 - use plus service is the same so x
14:53 - position plus 75 okay now let's run a
15:00 - check later watch this and then we'll
15:04 - this will call this my paw
15:07 - mittens s-stop soak call this block here
15:11 - so let's go back to our block for the
15:14 - matusa start so now we know the position
15:17 - right now we can check so Calista so
15:23 - what will run this you'll see the
15:25 - exposition in my position of the unit
15:29 - so now let's see okay so the so whether
15:33 - compared is a exposition of the Medusa
15:37 - to the right okay so the exposition is
15:46 - greater than the right somewhere to make
15:48 - her to turn pointed in a 90-degree okay
15:58 - and then we'll say would not need
16:02 - another condition here okay we'll say if
16:07 - the exposition open the operator here
16:16 - then less than and we'll need to
16:20 - variable the left position so basically
16:25 - we won t it was too far
16:28 - the Medusa walk too far greater than the
16:32 - right right position that wanted to turn
16:34 - around so so right now the 90 so this is
16:41 - here's negative 90 not sure whether turn
16:45 - her back around why so close like
16:47 - negative 90 so she's to father right
16:49 - would has turned to the left and it was
16:52 - too far to the left will say turn to the
16:57 - right this is my knee and was a 1 keep
17:00 - her stop her for now we also want to
17:04 - keep her from rotating click on this
17:08 - okay okay let's and then we will or
17:17 - check them a do some costume okay we'll
17:23 - say if the costume okay so check the
17:36 - costume because we're gonna keep on
17:41 - adding right if the costume is created
17:45 - in three then four so I have it done
17:55 - I'll have to change it back we'll have
17:58 - to set it back to one set them with
18:05 - there's a custom back to one okay and
18:11 - what we could want to do is we're gonna
18:13 - switch to costume over here and we're
18:18 - gonna use the join operator okay so you
18:23 - can see our custom for walk is walk one
18:27 - right so we need to have something walk
18:29 - one two and three and four
18:31 - so what walk I just copied it delete
18:36 - that and I can only use the variable so
18:41 - this is what one what to walk three walk
18:43 - for it and then we can put a weight in
18:46 - between and what was it 0.1 and then
18:54 - we'll change the variable increase it by
18:57 - one that way we'll walk this Medusa what
19:03 - the next costume okay so as you can see
19:09 - she found move like this right okay
19:12 - stop this so let's go back to the
19:15 - beginning so let's see so you see she
19:18 - walk although she kept it in Jonathan
19:20 - and she won't back so you can adjust
19:25 - this right maybe I don't know six
19:28 - seventy maybe also okay this is
19:30 - depending on the DL the how big a
19:35 - platform is so now not walk as far and
19:43 - you see all turn around just just just
19:48 - fix that so that you can get them with
19:51 - this I kind of look back and forth back
19:52 - and format that okay
19:56 - [Music]
19:58 - all right we'll stop here for now and
20:01 - we'll continue on the next lesson I
20:03 - don't want to keep the video too long

alright guys welcome back to the channel today we'll walk on the Medusa so that the ninja can attack the Medusa so before we get started please like share and subscribe to our Channel and ring the notification bell to receive their latest update from this channel and if you know anyone who's interested please share our channel to them alright introductions over now let's get started okay before we can just kind of overview what we had on the last time the code so you guys can pause the video if you need to just check through the code so these are some of the custom block we define for the code I think I went through that previous lessons so just one go through slowly so you guys can check so this is the begin this is the attack and okay here we had the standing movement and just then please don't tell me anything this is what we had in the previous lesson the ninja touched the water or they'll die we'll have to have something for the if the ninja touched Iran the to sell so he'll die also we added this at next level right previous lesson I think the attack ninja or that should be the same we didn't make any change to that the throwing ninja same thing the colliding ninja same thing we didn't do anything a platform just just the level that I think we say next levels changed a different level yes the way I mean the preview lesson we had that the crate same thing here if the depending on the level will move the crater a different position so we have that okay and then the waters no change here hitbox one here and then the knife hitbox is not much go right to that making clothes effect and then the night the gym the portal and then you win okay all right so today we'll add that Medusa with the Medusa I think you don't know look at the first video I mentioned where to download so once you download it you can just say pain a new sprite in here you can upload all your costume for them the zaheer I think is under here we downloaded it last time let's see not this one maybe mmm this one I don't know wanna see here so we have this deucey so you see there a lot of different one I think I added the walk right and then death you can add flex the attack and all that also different things oh I didn't I mean you can add them like Medusa attack and all shootout but for now I just only added to death and then the walk one so thing I think on my previous game also I did not have all of him I just added depth and then I added them walk okay alright let's see just so you cannot have up stuff to the stone and stuff like that and you like to put in different things okay so we'll just upload all the Medusa here you can zoom in a little bit of me like okay so to say ya won't trash the first custom okay let's take a look okay oh we have the Medusa with us so let's go back to the first level so we have tonight so I don't think we we don't really need her for the first level we just can let the music and use to the movement of the ninja so I would say by would only reduce on the first level we can start with second levels but before we do that we need to create some variable for the Medusa so just like similar to the you know the costumes who use a ninja to move we can create same thing like Medusa I still so this will keep a keep track of the that what costume the Medusa will have right just so we can rename her okay or remember Medusa here okay so and then we'll need more variable we're gonna keep track of how them to do some wall so there's left and right so we're gonna use some position so that we couldn't find a position of the space here depending on the level and all in position the Medusa won't use that so let's create something called the right position and okay so the right position the left position will keep track of what we're moving the Medusa phone line left right here or any other Enya level okay and then now we'll create a new block my block will call it my two stop okay so this block wall you know define how them because I will start okay so the first thing what to do is we are going to show her in case you die she hides a letter show and then we have to say go to the front layer and that will clear any graphics so the tips are die we can like give you one you can make like those are flashing or whatever like oh cosa fact or whatever who can do that and then we can set up up with him one more very long look who's HP right this is like the health point of the Medusa so we can give them give her like five points or whatever done her eye water three you know I think make it new be faster when we're doing testing so the monster and then whether set the custom in next that's the walk in costume so I'm not going to use the death costume my parents which fishing one to death custom within that's good now this is for walking so we can't stop one so if we see here custom we have like walk walk one two three four eight so just look through that phone number okay and we have the use of ever loop yeah and then we'll check a bit attacked by the ninja so it'll say if condition here where the color sensing touching source they touching the ninja attack which is this ninja so they use a Madusa then you know she don't get damaged what we can do is we're gonna or cast the event and wait so wish you use the weight so that way you don't get more than one damage on her when you slice her okay what what cast got hit the middle so got hit and duplicate this as well so you can duplicate this as well or you can do or statement right so like you can say yeah gotten hit by this as well right you can say get hit or you can say the or statement so you take this out you can take this down isn't there something called all operator put this here and you can drop this inside here it's just the same thing you know so you don't need that to your statement yeah let me stop the game okay all right so we've got that so next won't make them to do some move so to say we'll keep on moving five step at the time and we will check some position so let's say yeah we can make them into saving on the first stage and maybe fine let's say yeah okay now if we use some condition here so we'll say if the exposition which is the current person where the Medusa is you know the exposition okay for her so we'll stay here exposition will take that out and what he is the operator here will use so the exposition is created then the Medusa so what the finding position for her know like here in here so before could actually get the exposition comparison what they'll come and check the Medusa so this is a pretty big platform we can put her someone the middle here what we can do is this we you remember we have a events a podcast stop set up where were you then here somewhere I that podcaster set up when the game started that's where that is thinking is on the other co okay we need look for that cell but I think I found it there's too many Co here but it's right here so when this thought of the greenback is click with podcast is set up so we can use that to set up the Medusa first so we'll say when I receive set up so now we're going to check what level it is so it is done so this level one will do something different the visible to will be something different so we'll check if equal so level if level was one which is this level right now we're using your levels one won't move so put that over here is the one here okay and then we'll put down for the next level that's a platform won't switch it to a second costume so when I say what is it box for now okay so the second customers say what matters are here don't worry about all the other things right now we just check in the position so here this is the second level so we'll just duplicate this one we kiss and we'll take this down sorry I think it clicked on it this way so what I'm like right oh wait here okay so we'll say take that so it's you can't in here like you see this like Kenna you kind of guess so you can see how this exchange so from here all the way here like this is 38 38 plus you know 75 ish you'll be on this side so what we're going to do is we're gonna add an I mean add and minus 75 for that position so that we know when we will tell them that this to turn back around one one other walk off the edge right so that's what we use that left and right position for okay so this is the the to solve the second stage right hmm think this looks better than this just take that and then now let's look at third stage and we'll use the ask them to third stage we can put her like maybe right here right so go back to the code so in this level three go move her to this position here it's four one two three so we set up for all three level okay and what we can do is we are going to set the variable so no every time to set up start we'll set the variable so we know where the left position the maximum left position she can go and right position okay so what the vision is was that the right position so we can take the x position of this unit this right here and we come and use the operator so this is x position oops 75 and the y position we then the other position the right position one use plus service is the same so x position plus 75 okay now let's run a check later watch this and then we'll this will call this my paw mittens sstop soak call this block here so let's go back to our block for the matusa start so now we know the position right now we can check so Calista so what will run this you'll see the exposition in my position of the unit so now let's see okay so the so whether compared is a exposition of the Medusa to the right okay so the exposition is greater than the right somewhere to make her to turn pointed in a 90degree okay and then we'll say would not need another condition here okay we'll say if the exposition open the operator here then less than and we'll need to variable the left position so basically we won t it was too far the Medusa walk too far greater than the right right position that wanted to turn around so so right now the 90 so this is here's negative 90 not sure whether turn her back around why so close like negative 90 so she's to father right would has turned to the left and it was too far to the left will say turn to the right this is my knee and was a 1 keep her stop her for now we also want to keep her from rotating click on this okay okay let's and then we will or check them a do some costume okay we'll say if the costume okay so check the costume because we're gonna keep on adding right if the costume is created in three then four so I have it done I'll have to change it back we'll have to set it back to one set them with there's a custom back to one okay and what we could want to do is we're gonna switch to costume over here and we're gonna use the join operator okay so you can see our custom for walk is walk one right so we need to have something walk one two and three and four so what walk I just copied it delete that and I can only use the variable so this is what one what to walk three walk for it and then we can put a weight in between and what was it 0.1 and then we'll change the variable increase it by one that way we'll walk this Medusa what the next costume okay so as you can see she found move like this right okay stop this so let's go back to the beginning so let's see so you see she walk although she kept it in Jonathan and she won't back so you can adjust this right maybe I don't know six seventy maybe also okay this is depending on the DL the how big a platform is so now not walk as far and you see all turn around just just just fix that so that you can get them with this I kind of look back and forth back and format that okay all right we'll stop here for now and we'll continue on the next lesson I don't want to keep the video too long all right thank you guys please like share and subscribe to our channel bye
