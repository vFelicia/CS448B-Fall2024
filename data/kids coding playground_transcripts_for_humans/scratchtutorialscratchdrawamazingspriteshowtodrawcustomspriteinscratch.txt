00:01 - [Music]
00:08 - hello guys welcome back to
00:10 - kidscoolingplayground so today we are
00:12 - going to work on a project kind of like
00:13 - a drawing project
00:15 - i think some someone asked us to make
00:18 - some kind of game related helping
00:20 - patients in the hospital or something so
00:23 - before we we can do that you know you
00:25 - can let's say you can
00:26 - have some
00:27 - sprite that you can draw you make a
00:29 - story like let's say you have a hospital
00:31 - the cat going in
00:33 - getting his vaccine shot or whatever
00:35 - right so so for this kind of thing you
00:37 - know let's say you don't have the
00:38 - hospital sprite in the in the day in the
00:41 - in the sprite library what you can do is
00:43 - you can go to like google just look at
00:45 - like hospital cartoon image you can just
00:47 - download one of them
00:49 - and after you download it you can just
00:51 - kind of draw it so i can show you guys
00:53 - how to deal with that so as you can see
00:55 - my hospital i took the uh i took the
00:58 - image from here this is the actual image
01:00 - from the hospital and i drew this one so
01:02 - mine is look kind of exactly like that
01:04 - it takes a lot of time but we can just
01:06 - go through some of the steps to how you
01:08 - would draw something like this right
01:10 - so now let's say
01:12 - you can close a new project
01:14 - right and then let's say whatever sprite
01:17 - that you downloaded you can just upload
01:19 - it to the to the scratch cat i mean
01:21 - that's your project here and then you
01:23 - can go to the costume here so so for
01:26 - this let's convert to vector
01:28 - okay and then let's say you want to draw
01:30 - something like this you can select the
01:32 - line
01:33 - and let's put
01:35 - this black is fine let's do 10 so you
01:37 - can just kind of trace through this so
01:39 - you can let's add trace through here
01:42 - right and then here i gotta trace
01:44 - through that on the bottom
01:47 - and then
01:48 - right here
01:50 - then right here
01:52 - and then the other one i can just draw
01:54 - another line like this
01:57 - like this just kind of trace that
01:59 - objects here and then
02:02 - at the end over here okay
02:04 - all right so you have this box here that
02:07 - we kind of draw so if you actually move
02:08 - this you can see i can have the box here
02:10 - right
02:11 - so that is just my box
02:14 - so now let's let's fill in the color
02:16 - right for this box
02:17 - so
02:19 - you can just say hey let's click on this
02:21 - so you can click on this box
02:23 - and you can click on this you can set
02:25 - the color like this so now you fill it
02:27 - up
02:28 - right so same thing for this one
02:30 - you can click on this select this select
02:33 - the color now you fill it up
02:35 - but now we we just have the outside of
02:37 - the box right so what we need to do
02:39 - still is we have to draw the
02:41 - you know so with the draw the um
02:44 - so this one go to the front so we still
02:46 - have to draw the whole
02:48 - whole whole sprite right so now
02:51 - so i have my um background sprite let's
02:53 - just bring them back to the front
02:55 - so this is the uh the hospital i want to
02:57 - draw so i got the box around so far
02:59 - right so let's say i want to draw this
03:01 - window here you can zoom in a little bit
03:04 - so window you can see black blue
03:06 - so what we have to do is we cannot just
03:08 - use black and blue and select that and
03:10 - create that because you have to have
03:12 - different layers so what you can do is
03:14 - this so you can select uh no fill here
03:17 - this one you can go black
03:20 - you can say 10
03:23 - or 7 or whatever that matter let's do
03:25 - seven i didn't originally have ten so
03:28 - let's see you can just try trace through
03:30 - this let's
03:31 - kind of trace that so now you have this
03:33 - square box
03:35 - right for the uh for the for that and
03:37 - now you have to draw another blue box
03:39 - inside so what we can do is we have to
03:41 - do that because we're gonna have to
03:42 - cover this blue line later so now let's
03:45 - um so select outside click on this thing
03:48 - again let's pick another color so i'm
03:50 - going to take this dark blue color
03:54 - now we're going to draw this blue box
03:56 - inside here
03:59 - so now i have the blue box inside right
04:01 - so far and then
04:03 - next you can just say hey i want to draw
04:06 - this blue bar so go back here you can
04:09 - select this color
04:11 - select this blue bar
04:12 - i'm go to 15
04:15 - and then let's just draw something like
04:17 - this
04:19 - so you can see mine's a little bit too
04:22 - big let's make it a little bit smaller
04:25 - just enough don't worry about that it's
04:27 - not covering the blue i mean the blue
04:29 - covering no problem we're gonna fix that
04:30 - later so now let's let's click on this
04:33 - again
04:35 - so we're gonna have to draw another
04:36 - smaller line down here
04:38 - so what you can do is you just draw one
04:40 - more oops sorry why did i have black on
04:44 - i do not want black i'm sorry about that
04:47 - uh make sure you're selecting this color
04:50 - okay
04:50 - oh because i i selected another one when
04:53 - i clicked it outside that's the problem
04:55 - okay so
04:57 - that's why so let's draw this little
04:59 - line here in the bottom
05:01 - so now you have two little lines right
05:03 - which is this two little line but you
05:05 - still have this
05:06 - color boxes right so what you can do is
05:08 - you can use this
05:10 - and then say hey let's select this color
05:12 - box
05:13 - and then let's do a no outline
05:16 - okay let's draw a square shape
05:19 - kind of square shape like this
05:21 - and then click on the reshape tool
05:23 - delete this
05:25 - so now you have the triangle so use that
05:29 - you can kind of paste this guy in here
05:31 - kind of thing right
05:33 - so now you just just send this back say
05:35 - backward you can see it i did it so now
05:38 - it's back so what you can see these two
05:40 - lines still in the front so what you can
05:42 - do is select this guy
05:44 - click in the front you can see my window
05:46 - look kind of exactly like this window
05:49 - here
05:50 - right okay so i have this window now i
05:53 - want to group this window so i can move
05:55 - this guy out of the way
05:56 - a little bit so that i have this window
05:59 - so you can see oh sorry i don't want to
06:01 - move that
06:02 - so i have my window right so let's
06:03 - select
06:04 - everything
06:06 - now what you can do is you can select
06:08 - all
06:09 - go to another one i think it's pretty
06:11 - easy so you can delete it
06:13 - okay so what i'm going to do is going to
06:15 - delete all this thing here
06:18 - i don't care about all that so now i
06:20 - have my window i can group it
06:22 - ctrl c group it
06:24 - so when i go back over here
06:27 - right this this the screen that we were
06:29 - having earlier so now my window this is
06:32 - my first window so let's say i want a
06:34 - more window so i can control v
06:37 - right and then i say group
06:39 - and then i'm gonna move it so this is my
06:41 - second window you can see right
06:44 - so
06:45 - third window right
06:47 - [Music]
06:49 - fourth window
06:52 - so
06:52 - you can get the point right so this is
06:55 - fifth
06:57 - six
06:58 - oopsie got the wrong one
07:01 - so it takes a lot of time kind of thing
07:04 - to do that
07:05 - but uh as you can see i almost almost
07:07 - done so there's some more
07:10 - that
07:11 - we need to do
07:14 - i think this one doesn't have one yet
07:16 - production and they moved it
07:21 - so make sure you do have it all group
07:23 - right so that way you can
07:26 - you can do uh you know
07:29 - to uh to um easier to move so you can
07:32 - see i have all the uh window done so
07:34 - these sides are smaller window what you
07:37 - can do is uh you can you can just make
07:39 - it smaller right just kind of
07:41 - smaller size a bit right
07:45 - so like this it takes some time to to do
07:48 - that so as you can see i'm trying to
07:51 - not doing way
07:53 - proficient i guess it's because i'm
07:55 - trying to do it fast for the video
07:57 - so but as you can see
08:00 - i have all my window
08:02 - pretty much
08:04 - right
08:06 - and then that's the last window so you
08:08 - see all the windows done
08:10 - so one thing is now you have to draw the
08:13 - door similar thing right the door
08:16 - just um so for the door you can select
08:18 - this box here select the color inside
08:21 - okay select this color
08:23 - and then here just make a black i'll do
08:26 - a five outline
08:28 - and then you can just kind of trace
08:29 - through that so you can see i just draw
08:31 - the top portion of it
08:34 - right don't have to be exactly right and
08:37 - then
08:37 - next i'm gonna draw the bottom portion
08:40 - of this
08:42 - right
08:43 - i'll move it one block
08:45 - i'll draw this guy here
08:49 - right
08:50 - and then for the stair same thing right
08:52 - for the staircase just a different color
08:54 - inside
08:56 - oops sorry make sure you select it out
08:58 - and then select this color
09:00 - and then for the stair we can just draw
09:03 - the little stair here
09:06 - and then next
09:08 - draw another one
09:11 - and then draw the final
09:13 - stair here
09:16 - okay so you can move it so you i have my
09:19 - door i have to stare but i don't have to
09:21 - do it right i don't have this door yet
09:23 - um so something similar let's finish
09:25 - this side first so we're going to use
09:27 - the same thing for this side
09:30 - so here
09:32 - let's draw like this
09:35 - and then what you can do is you can go
09:37 - back
09:38 - one layer
09:40 - so making sure that other ones cover it
09:42 - we can do that later too doesn't really
09:44 - matter
09:45 - uh and then next you can draw this like
09:47 - this
09:48 - right so now this side is pretty much
09:50 - done but we still have to do this green
09:51 - bar and all that stuff so i'll show you
09:53 - how to do that later same thing so for
09:55 - the door where to draw like something
09:57 - like this right
10:01 - okay so for this little throw we're
10:03 - going to do like uh five and then we're
10:06 - not gonna use the inside fill because
10:08 - we're gonna have to cover the line just
10:09 - like how we did the window so you can
10:11 - just draw uh the door like this
10:15 - okay
10:16 - and then and then another door like this
10:22 - so now you have two door right
10:24 - and then what you need to do you just
10:26 - draw this big line right just like how
10:28 - we had this earlier
10:29 - uh what you can do is draw a line i'm
10:32 - going to do 15
10:34 - and we're going to select this color
10:36 - here select this dark color so what you
10:39 - can do is uh draw this
10:43 - you can draw the gray box first oh let's
10:45 - draw the box first so let me go back
10:47 - sorry let's do this one first i think
10:49 - that would be easier actually so we're
10:50 - going to select this color
10:53 - to uh
10:54 - um
10:55 - no fill uh no no our line
10:58 - so what we're going to do is we're going
10:59 - to draw this little box here
11:02 - so control this little box
11:05 - we're going to send it backward
11:11 - okay
11:13 - let's send them all the way to the back
11:14 - for now we'll fix it later
11:16 - so let's draw another box here
11:22 - okay we're going to send it all the way
11:23 - to the back so we have the two glass
11:26 - blocks now whether draw this big line so
11:29 - go back to this let's do uh
11:32 - this color
11:34 - right
11:36 - 215
11:39 - and then we'll draw one
11:41 - kind of big line like this down
11:44 - so what you can do is just kind of touch
11:46 - the black
11:48 - a little bit
11:51 - so let's move this a little bit i mean
11:53 - this uh this is a little bit harder to
11:55 - draw
11:56 - you know the doors
11:58 - you know because of the uh
12:01 - kind of
12:03 - it's uh you know it's a it's a little
12:06 - challenging uh because you know you have
12:07 - to kind of position correctly so let's
12:10 - say my door like this
12:14 - okay so now you have the the line and
12:16 - then same thing you can do a little
12:18 - triangle here
12:19 - just like
12:21 - use the no fill here
12:23 - i'm not sure if you guys are able to
12:24 - catch up i mean do all this but uh you
12:27 - can just give it you know you have to
12:28 - try more so you can draw the little
12:31 - triangle like this
12:33 - let's say like this
12:35 - and then you can delete one of the
12:37 - corner
12:39 - to make it like a triangle right and
12:41 - then use this thing you can move it in
12:43 - here like this
12:46 - right
12:47 - uh you can use a reshape tool to reshape
12:50 - a little bit
12:51 - move it like this
12:53 - so you have the triangle
12:56 - right
12:57 - and then copy that
13:00 - ctrl v
13:02 - here and put it on this side as well
13:05 - so now you have this triangle
13:08 - but you still have one more triangle on
13:10 - the back
13:11 - i mean you don't have to be so detailed
13:13 - but if you want to do really detail then
13:15 - yeah you have to do something like that
13:18 - so
13:19 - so now let me copy this triangle i'm
13:21 - gonna paste it again
13:22 - so this time i'm gonna make a make the
13:24 - color in the back so i'm gonna use this
13:26 - color here
13:28 - in the back in between there
13:31 - and this triangle i'm gonna put it
13:33 - around here
13:37 - all right and then i'm going to make
13:39 - this one
13:41 - sorry
13:43 - select this tool make it a little bit
13:45 - wider
13:48 - let's go up
13:52 - so i know it doesn't look right yet but
13:54 - uh once we kind of
13:56 - put it together it will look right so
13:58 - let's put that over here as well
14:01 - all right so we have all of them let's
14:03 - just delete the background first for now
14:07 - so if i just delete the background you
14:09 - can see kind of like this right my whole
14:12 - building looks like this right
14:15 - so what you can do you can see this this
14:18 - this this one right
14:20 - so what you say hey um
14:22 - kind of cover it actually more actually
14:24 - i didn't have it enough you see
14:26 - didn't have it covered enough so i'm
14:28 - gonna cover a little bit more
14:31 - and then
14:32 - put this up here like this
14:36 - a bit more this one same thing
14:40 - so now i have it kind of cover right all
14:42 - of them uh the bottom one maybe a little
14:46 - bit drag a little bit down okay so you
14:48 - can see
14:50 - this one what you can do is you can say
14:51 - send to the back
14:53 - right
14:54 - and then you can go back forward
14:56 - forward
14:57 - forward for you see i can see it
15:00 - now right so this one is a little bit so
15:03 - you can see you can see this one right
15:06 - so same thing for this you can say
15:07 - center the back
15:09 - can say forward
15:11 - forward forward forward see
15:14 - so now you see this triangle you can
15:16 - still make this a little bit bigger okay
15:18 - so this one you can make this a little
15:20 - bit bigger
15:21 - okay so what we have is that we have the
15:24 - sprite here so far so what you can do is
15:26 - you can just click on this and you say
15:28 - front
15:30 - click on this go to front
15:32 - so you can see
15:35 - you kind of hide it
15:36 - right
15:40 - and then this one is um
15:43 - should be like this
15:46 - okay so
15:48 - so let's go front on this guy
15:51 - front on this guy
15:54 - okay
15:55 - this guy should be in front
15:58 - and this guy should be in the front so
15:59 - now you have
16:01 - the hospital kind of door what are you
16:03 - missing is just the knob right uh if you
16:05 - want to kind of
16:08 - you know just kind of line that you can
16:10 - just
16:11 - kind of line that doesn't really matter
16:13 - i thought to be exactly perfect and then
16:16 - you did draw this little
16:19 - uh the house right earlier we have the
16:22 - color we can upload again let me upload
16:24 - the other sprite here
16:26 - so i think we're missing the the
16:28 - doorknob right that's thrown up so we
16:30 - can just say hey i want the circle
16:33 - uh draw the circle here select this
16:36 - color right
16:38 - this
16:40 - and then the box
16:41 - and then here you can select black
16:45 - five
16:47 - and then just go back to our thing we
16:50 - can just draw here then we can move it
16:52 - so let's say hold shift if you like
16:56 - uh this will draw the little dot copy
16:58 - ctrl c ctrl v
17:01 - so you have both little dots so let's
17:03 - say copy both of them select open put it
17:06 - on your door
17:07 - obviously you have to kind of move it
17:09 - you can use that
17:11 - the arrow key to move it right
17:14 - so any way you want so this is my
17:17 - hospital pretty much
17:19 - um this guy maybe let him go back a
17:21 - little bit
17:23 - go forward
17:26 - see
17:28 - there you go
17:29 - right
17:30 - so now what we're missing is some kind
17:32 - of um you know you have to cross on top
17:34 - right so the cross is pretty much really
17:36 - simple right you have two square
17:40 - uh
17:40 - no fill right
17:42 - uh select this one select the red color
17:45 - right
17:48 - just draw the square right draw your
17:50 - square shape
17:52 - see
17:53 - and then draw another square
17:58 - okay and then you can just select them
18:00 - both
18:01 - copy
18:02 - go back to your first one put it on
18:04 - there see there you go so but there's
18:07 - still some green stuff right you see
18:08 - this green stuff what you can do is just
18:10 - like how we do the window right so
18:14 - what you can do is say hey let me draw
18:16 - this here
18:17 - so here there's no fill let's take this
18:20 - color green
18:22 - right and then you can draw the track uh
18:25 - square shape kind of thing right it
18:27 - doesn't matter so this is not our
18:30 - thing right let's go like this
18:33 - and then this one let's go all the way
18:34 - over here so far
18:36 - and then we're going to use a reshape
18:38 - tool so reshape tool can say hey let's
18:40 - reshape this all the way here
18:44 - right
18:45 - and then this one how how did they do it
18:47 - they had like kind of like this
18:50 - i don't know it doesn't really matter
18:53 - you know
18:55 - i mean just some green stuff that you
18:58 - want
18:59 - the hospital to have
19:01 - some
19:02 - player i guess
19:07 - right so let's say you have this
19:09 - so what you can do is just take this
19:11 - copy
19:13 - ctrl v
19:14 - right and then you can say center back
19:16 - layer first
19:18 - and then click forward forward forward
19:20 - forward forward see
19:23 - there you go so but you see this one is
19:25 - covering right what you can do is just
19:27 - select this go to front
19:30 - oops sorry
19:31 - um go back sorry
19:33 - um
19:35 - this one this this box is not on the
19:37 - front side so this guy gonna have to
19:40 - move him a little bit in
19:42 - actually
19:46 - and then
19:48 - just kind
19:50 - of change this a little bit
20:06 - i think i messed it up earlier so now
20:08 - something like this
20:09 - right
20:10 - that should be good enough see there you
20:12 - go you have some kind of green kind of
20:14 - outline there
20:16 - with that and that's similar you can do
20:18 - something similar on this side right
20:21 - so this side has like the green thing
20:23 - also right so what you can do is let's
20:25 - click that
20:27 - let's just use another square
20:31 - and then
20:33 - what we can do is just use a reshape
20:35 - tool
20:36 - right
20:38 - just put this over here
20:41 - uh
20:42 - you don't have to be exact but let's go
20:45 - something like this
20:48 - and then this one doesn't really matter
20:50 - i think
20:52 - uh you can go on top
20:56 - and then this one you can go like this
21:01 - uh you can go something like this this
21:03 - one you can delete
21:04 - i think this should be good enough
21:06 - actually
21:08 - um
21:10 - it's a line like this
21:11 - so let's take this
21:13 - copy go back
21:15 - paste it here
21:16 - we might have to kind of
21:19 - try to adjust it a little bit
21:22 - let's just use this
21:24 - so adjust this a little bit
21:27 - adjust the bottom a little bit so
21:32 - okay and then you can say go back
21:35 - and then say forward forward forward
21:38 - forward see
21:39 - there you go
21:40 - so you have the whole hospital like that
21:43 - so
21:44 - pretty um that's how you actually do it
21:47 - so you have to use the layer
21:49 - like the window right you have the
21:52 - the first layer right let's go back so
21:54 - you have the
21:56 - let me ungroup this thing
21:58 - oh sorry
22:00 - so what you have is the
22:02 - black square then you have the
22:04 - dark blue square and then you have the
22:07 - uh the light darker blue line darker
22:10 - blue line then you have the lighter
22:11 - triangle
22:12 - so
22:13 - i hope you guys know uh you know how to
22:15 - draw it so not that
22:18 - i mean it looks pretty good i mean you
22:21 - can really use it for your you know your
22:23 - game or something like that and you
22:25 - wanna
22:26 - you don't have a hospital or you don't
22:28 - have any kind of sprite you can just
22:29 - download online and kind of kind of
22:31 - trace through the
22:33 - the sprite
22:34 - and make your own so
22:36 - there you go so hope you guys enjoy the
22:38 - video
22:39 - and i'll see you guys next time bye

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome back to kidscoolingplayground so today we are going to work on a project kind of like a drawing project i think some someone asked us to make some kind of game related helping patients in the hospital or something so before we we can do that you know you can let's say you can have some sprite that you can draw you make a story like let's say you have a hospital the cat going in getting his vaccine shot or whatever right so so for this kind of thing you know let's say you don't have the hospital sprite in the in the day in the in the sprite library what you can do is you can go to like google just look at like hospital cartoon image you can just download one of them and after you download it you can just kind of draw it so i can show you guys how to deal with that so as you can see my hospital i took the uh i took the image from here this is the actual image from the hospital and i drew this one so mine is look kind of exactly like that it takes a lot of time but we can just go through some of the steps to how you would draw something like this right so now let's say you can close a new project right and then let's say whatever sprite that you downloaded you can just upload it to the to the scratch cat i mean that's your project here and then you can go to the costume here so so for this let's convert to vector okay and then let's say you want to draw something like this you can select the line and let's put this black is fine let's do 10 so you can just kind of trace through this so you can let's add trace through here right and then here i gotta trace through that on the bottom and then right here then right here and then the other one i can just draw another line like this like this just kind of trace that objects here and then at the end over here okay all right so you have this box here that we kind of draw so if you actually move this you can see i can have the box here right so that is just my box so now let's let's fill in the color right for this box so you can just say hey let's click on this so you can click on this box and you can click on this you can set the color like this so now you fill it up right so same thing for this one you can click on this select this select the color now you fill it up but now we we just have the outside of the box right so what we need to do still is we have to draw the you know so with the draw the um so this one go to the front so we still have to draw the whole whole whole sprite right so now so i have my um background sprite let's just bring them back to the front so this is the uh the hospital i want to draw so i got the box around so far right so let's say i want to draw this window here you can zoom in a little bit so window you can see black blue so what we have to do is we cannot just use black and blue and select that and create that because you have to have different layers so what you can do is this so you can select uh no fill here this one you can go black you can say 10 or 7 or whatever that matter let's do seven i didn't originally have ten so let's see you can just try trace through this let's kind of trace that so now you have this square box right for the uh for the for that and now you have to draw another blue box inside so what we can do is we have to do that because we're gonna have to cover this blue line later so now let's um so select outside click on this thing again let's pick another color so i'm going to take this dark blue color now we're going to draw this blue box inside here so now i have the blue box inside right so far and then next you can just say hey i want to draw this blue bar so go back here you can select this color select this blue bar i'm go to 15 and then let's just draw something like this so you can see mine's a little bit too big let's make it a little bit smaller just enough don't worry about that it's not covering the blue i mean the blue covering no problem we're gonna fix that later so now let's let's click on this again so we're gonna have to draw another smaller line down here so what you can do is you just draw one more oops sorry why did i have black on i do not want black i'm sorry about that uh make sure you're selecting this color okay oh because i i selected another one when i clicked it outside that's the problem okay so that's why so let's draw this little line here in the bottom so now you have two little lines right which is this two little line but you still have this color boxes right so what you can do is you can use this and then say hey let's select this color box and then let's do a no outline okay let's draw a square shape kind of square shape like this and then click on the reshape tool delete this so now you have the triangle so use that you can kind of paste this guy in here kind of thing right so now you just just send this back say backward you can see it i did it so now it's back so what you can see these two lines still in the front so what you can do is select this guy click in the front you can see my window look kind of exactly like this window here right okay so i have this window now i want to group this window so i can move this guy out of the way a little bit so that i have this window so you can see oh sorry i don't want to move that so i have my window right so let's select everything now what you can do is you can select all go to another one i think it's pretty easy so you can delete it okay so what i'm going to do is going to delete all this thing here i don't care about all that so now i have my window i can group it ctrl c group it so when i go back over here right this this the screen that we were having earlier so now my window this is my first window so let's say i want a more window so i can control v right and then i say group and then i'm gonna move it so this is my second window you can see right so third window right fourth window so you can get the point right so this is fifth six oopsie got the wrong one so it takes a lot of time kind of thing to do that but uh as you can see i almost almost done so there's some more that we need to do i think this one doesn't have one yet production and they moved it so make sure you do have it all group right so that way you can you can do uh you know to uh to um easier to move so you can see i have all the uh window done so these sides are smaller window what you can do is uh you can you can just make it smaller right just kind of smaller size a bit right so like this it takes some time to to do that so as you can see i'm trying to not doing way proficient i guess it's because i'm trying to do it fast for the video so but as you can see i have all my window pretty much right and then that's the last window so you see all the windows done so one thing is now you have to draw the door similar thing right the door just um so for the door you can select this box here select the color inside okay select this color and then here just make a black i'll do a five outline and then you can just kind of trace through that so you can see i just draw the top portion of it right don't have to be exactly right and then next i'm gonna draw the bottom portion of this right i'll move it one block i'll draw this guy here right and then for the stair same thing right for the staircase just a different color inside oops sorry make sure you select it out and then select this color and then for the stair we can just draw the little stair here and then next draw another one and then draw the final stair here okay so you can move it so you i have my door i have to stare but i don't have to do it right i don't have this door yet um so something similar let's finish this side first so we're going to use the same thing for this side so here let's draw like this and then what you can do is you can go back one layer so making sure that other ones cover it we can do that later too doesn't really matter uh and then next you can draw this like this right so now this side is pretty much done but we still have to do this green bar and all that stuff so i'll show you how to do that later same thing so for the door where to draw like something like this right okay so for this little throw we're going to do like uh five and then we're not gonna use the inside fill because we're gonna have to cover the line just like how we did the window so you can just draw uh the door like this okay and then and then another door like this so now you have two door right and then what you need to do you just draw this big line right just like how we had this earlier uh what you can do is draw a line i'm going to do 15 and we're going to select this color here select this dark color so what you can do is uh draw this you can draw the gray box first oh let's draw the box first so let me go back sorry let's do this one first i think that would be easier actually so we're going to select this color to uh um no fill uh no no our line so what we're going to do is we're going to draw this little box here so control this little box we're going to send it backward okay let's send them all the way to the back for now we'll fix it later so let's draw another box here okay we're going to send it all the way to the back so we have the two glass blocks now whether draw this big line so go back to this let's do uh this color right 215 and then we'll draw one kind of big line like this down so what you can do is just kind of touch the black a little bit so let's move this a little bit i mean this uh this is a little bit harder to draw you know the doors you know because of the uh kind of it's uh you know it's a it's a little challenging uh because you know you have to kind of position correctly so let's say my door like this okay so now you have the the line and then same thing you can do a little triangle here just like use the no fill here i'm not sure if you guys are able to catch up i mean do all this but uh you can just give it you know you have to try more so you can draw the little triangle like this let's say like this and then you can delete one of the corner to make it like a triangle right and then use this thing you can move it in here like this right uh you can use a reshape tool to reshape a little bit move it like this so you have the triangle right and then copy that ctrl v here and put it on this side as well so now you have this triangle but you still have one more triangle on the back i mean you don't have to be so detailed but if you want to do really detail then yeah you have to do something like that so so now let me copy this triangle i'm gonna paste it again so this time i'm gonna make a make the color in the back so i'm gonna use this color here in the back in between there and this triangle i'm gonna put it around here all right and then i'm going to make this one sorry select this tool make it a little bit wider let's go up so i know it doesn't look right yet but uh once we kind of put it together it will look right so let's put that over here as well all right so we have all of them let's just delete the background first for now so if i just delete the background you can see kind of like this right my whole building looks like this right so what you can do you can see this this this this one right so what you say hey um kind of cover it actually more actually i didn't have it enough you see didn't have it covered enough so i'm gonna cover a little bit more and then put this up here like this a bit more this one same thing so now i have it kind of cover right all of them uh the bottom one maybe a little bit drag a little bit down okay so you can see this one what you can do is you can say send to the back right and then you can go back forward forward forward for you see i can see it now right so this one is a little bit so you can see you can see this one right so same thing for this you can say center the back can say forward forward forward forward see so now you see this triangle you can still make this a little bit bigger okay so this one you can make this a little bit bigger okay so what we have is that we have the sprite here so far so what you can do is you can just click on this and you say front click on this go to front so you can see you kind of hide it right and then this one is um should be like this okay so so let's go front on this guy front on this guy okay this guy should be in front and this guy should be in the front so now you have the hospital kind of door what are you missing is just the knob right uh if you want to kind of you know just kind of line that you can just kind of line that doesn't really matter i thought to be exactly perfect and then you did draw this little uh the house right earlier we have the color we can upload again let me upload the other sprite here so i think we're missing the the doorknob right that's thrown up so we can just say hey i want the circle uh draw the circle here select this color right this and then the box and then here you can select black five and then just go back to our thing we can just draw here then we can move it so let's say hold shift if you like uh this will draw the little dot copy ctrl c ctrl v so you have both little dots so let's say copy both of them select open put it on your door obviously you have to kind of move it you can use that the arrow key to move it right so any way you want so this is my hospital pretty much um this guy maybe let him go back a little bit go forward see there you go right so now what we're missing is some kind of um you know you have to cross on top right so the cross is pretty much really simple right you have two square uh no fill right uh select this one select the red color right just draw the square right draw your square shape see and then draw another square okay and then you can just select them both copy go back to your first one put it on there see there you go so but there's still some green stuff right you see this green stuff what you can do is just like how we do the window right so what you can do is say hey let me draw this here so here there's no fill let's take this color green right and then you can draw the track uh square shape kind of thing right it doesn't matter so this is not our thing right let's go like this and then this one let's go all the way over here so far and then we're going to use a reshape tool so reshape tool can say hey let's reshape this all the way here right and then this one how how did they do it they had like kind of like this i don't know it doesn't really matter you know i mean just some green stuff that you want the hospital to have some player i guess right so let's say you have this so what you can do is just take this copy ctrl v right and then you can say center back layer first and then click forward forward forward forward forward see there you go so but you see this one is covering right what you can do is just select this go to front oops sorry um go back sorry um this one this this box is not on the front side so this guy gonna have to move him a little bit in actually and then just kind of change this a little bit i think i messed it up earlier so now something like this right that should be good enough see there you go you have some kind of green kind of outline there with that and that's similar you can do something similar on this side right so this side has like the green thing also right so what you can do is let's click that let's just use another square and then what we can do is just use a reshape tool right just put this over here uh you don't have to be exact but let's go something like this and then this one doesn't really matter i think uh you can go on top and then this one you can go like this uh you can go something like this this one you can delete i think this should be good enough actually um it's a line like this so let's take this copy go back paste it here we might have to kind of try to adjust it a little bit let's just use this so adjust this a little bit adjust the bottom a little bit so okay and then you can say go back and then say forward forward forward forward see there you go so you have the whole hospital like that so pretty um that's how you actually do it so you have to use the layer like the window right you have the the first layer right let's go back so you have the let me ungroup this thing oh sorry so what you have is the black square then you have the dark blue square and then you have the uh the light darker blue line darker blue line then you have the lighter triangle so i hope you guys know uh you know how to draw it so not that i mean it looks pretty good i mean you can really use it for your you know your game or something like that and you wanna you don't have a hospital or you don't have any kind of sprite you can just download online and kind of kind of trace through the the sprite and make your own so there you go so hope you guys enjoy the video and i'll see you guys next time bye
