00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids coming
00:09 - playground here and today we're back for
00:11 - another video of scratch
00:14 - and today we are doing an earth day
00:16 - project
00:17 - some of you might have already seen that
00:18 - on my profile
00:21 - um uh because i already shared the
00:24 - project
00:26 - so you guys probably seen that but today
00:29 - i'll be teaching you how to make
00:31 - the game so
00:34 - yeah let's get started
00:39 - some music april 22nd is birthday if you
00:42 - did not know
00:43 - then please help me clean up some trash
00:44 - in the ocean
00:47 - and it'll just grow larger and guys i'm
00:50 - eating something right now so
00:52 - yeah so there's a little diver
00:56 - he's collecting the trash
00:58 - [Music]
01:03 - soda cans there's a trap turtle save the
01:06 - turtles
01:07 - save the trees save the earth
01:12 - we should always save the earth because
01:14 - that's where we live
01:17 - and earth is important
01:25 - so look i saved the fish
01:29 - now the portal opened and now i can
01:32 - enter it
01:35 - look i'm gonna get the bag let me get
01:38 - the soda can real
01:39 - [Music]
01:51 - of course so do your part clean up them
02:05 - now on the third level this going to be
02:07 - the last level so
02:09 - sort of can
02:13 - that's normal oh yeah and sometimes
02:16 - you can get stuck
02:20 - i couldn't do anything about it so the
02:24 - diver's legs are a little bit long so
02:26 - you can not
02:27 - you'll get stuck so the only way to get
02:30 - unstuck is click r to reset so
02:35 - sorry guys but i couldn't figure out
02:36 - anything because the diver has really
02:39 - big flippers and
02:41 - if you didn't have flippers or swim this
02:43 - would be really way better
02:45 - you can cut off the flippers if you want
02:47 - but i mean like he's not a diver anymore
02:51 - so it says you did a great job thank you
02:54 - for your help
02:56 - and then that'll be the end of this game
02:59 - so
03:01 - let's get started
03:05 - so let's get started so first
03:09 - we got a scratch cap um
03:12 - so we have to do our cat our earth
03:15 - our maze our bag everything so i'm gonna
03:18 - do the cat
03:21 - so when the green flag is clicked
03:25 - i'll show
03:32 - and say april
03:38 - 22nd is earth day
03:49 - and then
03:53 - so i'll also say
03:59 - we need
04:03 - to do our part
04:07 - to help and keep
04:11 - our earth
04:15 - clean
04:20 - we have to keep our earth clean guys do
04:23 - your part
04:24 - help the world out so
04:28 - and we have one last thing that you have
04:30 - to say
04:32 - sorry i'm still eating my gummies guys
04:36 - so
04:40 - sorry
04:42 - next thing i'll say please
04:45 - help me
04:49 - to clean up some of
04:53 - the trash in
04:56 - the ocean all right so now we can
05:00 - finally code because i'm done eating my
05:02 - gummies
05:03 - so yeah broadcast
05:07 - zoom in
05:11 - and then this zoom in will do a lot it's
05:13 - the start of the chain
05:15 - so we have to get our earth
05:21 - i'm gonna drag both of these earth
05:22 - you'll find out why we need both
05:25 - we don't need both but like i'm just
05:26 - going to show you uh so now there's two
05:29 - earths
05:30 - in a parallel universe so
05:36 - the earth this is the baby earth which
05:39 - is the regular earth we're going to work
05:41 - we'll
05:41 - not not work with but i'm going to
05:43 - demonstrate so
05:46 - when you duplicate it you can make one
05:49 - each
05:49 - every larger a little bit larger because
05:51 - that's what we did
05:53 - to make the zoom in so that's basically
05:55 - what we did to
05:56 - go into the ocean so
06:02 - yeah and we can just keep on doing that
06:04 - you get the point
06:06 - or you can just go on google drive and
06:07 - download everything
06:09 - we have so right now i'm making the
06:12 - earth
06:13 - larger and larger you have to center it
06:15 - so then it will
06:17 - stay in the center and will not go
06:21 - off off the thing so
06:25 - so this is basically what we have five
06:27 - earths and then this one
06:29 - we made 10 earths and it'll slowly get
06:32 - larger
06:33 - and then number 10 is just big
06:38 - so as you can see that's number 10 so
06:40 - you should basically get the point right
06:42 - if you zoom in and that's important maze
06:45 - so you can customize your own mazes it's
06:47 - pretty fun
06:48 - you can drag like you can just customize
06:50 - your own mesis
06:52 - i mean people can be creative and make
06:54 - their own mazes
06:56 - all around so that's great
06:59 - so you gotta use the rectangular blocks
07:02 - these and then you gotta drag them like
07:03 - that and then
07:04 - you get a piece
07:08 - so or you can drag it like that which
07:10 - would be impossible to get to but that's
07:12 - fine
07:13 - uh so yeah we have that and then there
07:17 - is the maze so we need the bag
07:20 - the turtle the fish and the soda can
07:24 - and the um
07:28 - and the portal and uh
07:31 - they already dragged the fish i think
07:34 - maybe it's still loading on it
07:38 - and then we need the still saving
07:45 - and then we need the soda can and then
07:48 - we need the
07:49 - portal and then we need the bottle
07:52 - so we have seven spur no no it's
07:56 - not nine sprites
07:59 - now we need to continue on the earth
08:02 - so zoom in is when you zoom in into the
08:04 - earth so then
08:05 - you can get started on the real project
08:09 - so when the green flag is clicked
08:12 - it will show
08:16 - then we'll switch costume to earth which
08:18 - is the first costume
08:22 - it will go to zero zero
08:27 - and then when i receive zoom in
08:30 - it'll repeat 10 times
08:34 - oh wait 0.1 seconds
08:39 - one and
08:42 - uh switch costume
08:45 - any next costume
08:50 - and then broadcast
08:53 - and ocean and this is where the big
08:55 - broadcast is because this is where
08:57 - everything starts
09:00 - broadcast
09:06 - oh an ocean i wrote broadcast
09:10 - so an ocean so now we gotta go back
09:13 - to the cat and make it hide
09:18 - so and then it'll hide
09:23 - and then now michelle april 22nd is
09:27 - earth day we need to do our part and
09:28 - help and
09:31 - they'll zoom in
09:35 - into the earth and then you'll see the
09:36 - diver and everything so
09:38 - now so we need to hide after that sorry
09:41 - i didn't put that and now
09:43 - we can get started on the maze
09:47 - the and basically everything else so
09:51 - when the green oh we gotta get the diver
09:53 - sorry
09:54 - that is the main thing we have here
09:57 - diver diver
09:58 - diver two and then
10:02 - we have the maze so when the green flag
10:04 - is clicked it'll go to zero
10:06 - zero and it will
10:09 - switch costume to costume one which is
10:11 - the first level basically
10:13 - because um costly one
10:16 - no hide
10:19 - it will when i receive
10:24 - an ocean it will show of course because
10:28 - it will show if it's in the ocean
10:30 - and then you need to
10:34 - so we're going to work on the diver next
10:36 - because the diver is the most important
10:39 - and so we have when the green flag is
10:42 - clicked
10:43 - it'll set level to one so we're going to
10:45 - make a new variable
10:48 - level
10:52 - level
10:55 - 11. and now we have to do
11:00 - set level to one
11:03 - first level is always home one so we
11:06 - have to name this happy earth day i
11:08 - forgot to name it
11:14 - and then i'll go to x 170
11:19 - negative 170
11:24 - and now the x is 135.
11:29 - why why why and the x is what negative
11:31 - 170.
11:32 - it'll point in direction 90
11:37 - and it will hide
11:40 - so that's the basically the diver code
11:42 - except we have a big
11:44 - chunk for the left arrow and right arrow
11:46 - keys oh
11:47 - so um this is to get the diver over
11:50 - there i'm just changing the size to 40
11:52 - real quick
11:54 - just to get the diver all the way over
11:56 - here
11:58 - so when i receive in ocean it will go to
12:02 - that position
12:09 - the point of direction 90 of course
12:11 - it'll show
12:15 - it'll go forever so this is for the left
12:17 - arrow right arrow type of thing
12:19 - and then you need an if then statement
12:22 - touching
12:24 - the color i'll go show this real quick
12:28 - if it's touching the color
12:31 - then i'll switch to the next level uh
12:35 - eyedropper yellow
12:40 - stop save now and then
12:44 - so if you did not notice from my demo
12:46 - when you collect all the trash it will
12:48 - be yellow but if you don't it's going to
12:50 - be black
12:50 - so that's how it is and then you have
12:53 - the diver
12:54 - so touching the color yellow it will
12:57 - hide
12:59 - it'll broadcast next level
13:10 - it will stop this script
13:17 - and then we need to if then all the
13:20 - arrows so this will take quite a while
13:24 - so if then the
13:27 - up arrow is clicked pressed
13:30 - same thing uh then it will
13:35 - be if then the touching
13:38 - if then touching i gotta make the
13:42 - backdrop
13:45 - if then touching the color
13:51 - you gotta make the backdrop
13:54 - you gotta make the backdrop for the
13:58 - so um i'm gonna make the backdrop i
14:01 - actually did not need the backdrop
14:02 - right now so you need the if then
14:06 - touching color
14:09 - this is the best i can do to prevent
14:12 - this
14:13 - then it will change y by
14:16 - minus 10.
14:24 - and then so now we need to
14:28 - do set rotation style to all around
14:30 - because one of them
14:31 - on the left side is left right
14:36 - so it won't flip over so you need some
14:38 - rotation style to
14:40 - all around a point in direction zero
14:49 - and it'll move ten steps
14:53 - it will wait 0.1 seconds
15:00 - so we got the up arrow and now we can
15:03 - make the
15:04 - down arrow oopsies
15:10 - which is right under the up arrow but
15:13 - instill in the forever loop
15:15 - so instead now you gotta go down arrow
15:19 - and then instead you gotta change y by
15:21 - ten that's pretty obvious
15:24 - and then you gotta set rotations out all
15:26 - around still and then
15:27 - this point direction is 180 so it'll be
15:30 - like that
15:31 - and then it'll move 10 steps and wait
15:33 - 0.1 seconds
15:35 - left arrow is way different but i'm just
15:36 - going to duplicate it
15:38 - so then it will feel
15:42 - it's almost the same a little bit
15:43 - different so it says x so left arrow
15:48 - change x by 10
15:52 - and the set rotation style to left right
15:54 - so it will not flip around
15:56 - because if you did left left side it'll
15:58 - be a back stroke so
16:00 - you want it freestyle you know point
16:02 - direction negative 90
16:07 - and move 10 steps and wait 0.1 seconds
16:10 - okay so now we're going to do the right
16:13 - arrow
16:18 - which is pretty much the same as the
16:20 - left arrow just a tinge difference
16:23 - and it'll change x by
16:27 - minus 10 sub rotation styles are all
16:31 - around
16:33 - point in direction 90 and then there you
16:36 - got it
16:36 - right arrow so now i'm gonna make the
16:40 - backdrop
16:40 - all around left and left and right is
16:43 - all okay but now i'm gonna make the
16:44 - backdrop so
16:46 - just a shade of blue
16:54 - uh a shade of blue
16:58 - so you can just make a gigantic square
17:02 - because that's
17:03 - and bitmap it's not the best so then you
17:06 - need to do this
17:07 - and then you gotta go like that
17:10 - doesn't matter if there's a blackout
17:11 - line you won't be able to see it anyways
17:14 - so now we got that covered now i'm gonna
17:17 - make the
17:19 - bag
17:22 - so in my original game i had a double
17:24 - backdrop i just switched the
17:26 - the first backdrop so i think that's
17:27 - fine you don't really need it
17:29 - backdrops don't really matter unless if
17:31 - it's like an animation plot or something
17:34 - so then so i'm going to demo the game
17:37 - for you
17:45 - so so i'm gonna put that back in wait a
17:48 - second
17:49 - so i'm gonna broadcast zoom in
17:54 - so there we go we have the diver
17:57 - moving and still can get stuck
18:01 - so i think there is a way out of this
18:06 - so this is i would do the reset code
18:10 - because there's nothing that i can
18:11 - possibly do about this if you can find a
18:13 - solution
18:14 - you guys can come in the comment section
18:16 - below and see
18:18 - what you can do and then we can get off
18:21 - of that idea
18:22 - and make our original a little bit
18:26 - more better i mean i it's still
18:30 - not it's still
18:33 - i still can't do it like
18:36 - i still can't put it i can't i still
18:38 - can't get him out of this
18:39 - maze but that is absolutely fine
18:43 - uh we do have a redo button that's the
18:45 - best i can do for this one so
18:48 - yeah now we have to do
18:51 - we're almost done with the diver we'll
18:53 - do the rest later
18:54 - so you need r to reset so and click on
18:56 - look we reset it
19:00 - chuck r
19:03 - i'm gonna move a little bit or
19:08 - get stuck in the wall what am i gonna do
19:10 - r
19:11 - so that's all we have for now and i'm
19:14 - gonna
19:14 - also put back these lines
19:19 - so then the cat can say something and
19:22 - then now we have to work on the
19:24 - bag so the bag
19:28 - we have to work on so when the green
19:31 - flag is clicked
19:33 - it will hide
19:38 - oopsies too close and then when i
19:42 - receive
19:42 - an ocean
19:48 - then it will go if then level one
19:53 - if you make your level one different it
19:55 - could end up in a different spot because
19:57 - of the way it's positioned so if then
20:00 - level
20:01 - equals one you'll go to this position i
20:05 - have
20:06 - already so the back has to go to
20:09 - [Music]
20:12 - one i mean it's fine but you know
20:15 - just here let's just put it here it's
20:19 - close enough
20:20 - there's only three digits on the x away
20:22 - and four digits in the y
20:24 - so and then the um duplicate nope nope
20:27 - not that
20:31 - on level two it's going to be a way
20:33 - different story than level one
20:35 - so on level two it will be a different
20:38 - position so look level two is different
20:42 - level three is different
20:44 - so this is where level two is you put it
20:47 - anywhere you want so i'm putting it over
20:49 - there i'm pretty sure the original
20:51 - is over there if i'm not mistaken
20:56 - so and then level three
21:01 - it's a whole different story as well as
21:04 - level
21:04 - two so it can be over there
21:09 - but i'm gonna put the same coordinate
21:12 - so it will work
21:17 - all level 3 negative 173
21:22 - positive no negative 114
21:26 - and it'll show
21:29 - e and then it will go forever
21:33 - we're almost done uh bear with me on the
21:35 - turtle the fish
21:36 - the cannon the bottle it's actually not
21:38 - even that
21:39 - far because we all we have to do is just
21:41 - change just a little bit and then we'll
21:43 - be done
21:44 - so touching diver two
21:47 - oopsies dive into
21:50 - then it will hide
21:55 - and it will change items to pick up by
21:57 - minus one so we have
21:59 - items to pick up
22:04 - to change items to pick up by
22:07 - minus one you know stop the script
22:11 - so we gotta make the items to pick up
22:12 - five
22:15 - but first we have to put all of this
22:19 - into here make the items to pick up five
22:23 - on each level so i'm gonna work on
22:27 - the maze so we can do the
22:30 - when i receive in next level
22:34 - then i will so the diver broadcasts it
22:37 - right here then i will
22:41 - change level by minus one i mean
22:44 - plus one
22:48 - and i will go if then else
22:51 - if then the level equals four
22:54 - no four if the level if four is greater
22:58 - than level which means
23:00 - it is level four which is the end
23:04 - three i mean it's greater than three
23:06 - which is basically level four
23:08 - it'll set items to pick up
23:12 - so um this is on level three and this is
23:14 - on level four
23:16 - now so there's one two three right here
23:18 - and this is
23:19 - level four and i'll set items to pick up
23:23 - to five in the beginning of all the
23:25 - levels
23:27 - next costume
23:31 - and it will broadcast an ocean
23:38 - and wait
23:42 - you know broadcast
23:45 - cleanup finished
23:52 - that's all right yeah i think i did and
23:54 - then it will
23:55 - goes clean up finished and then
23:58 - that means it will hide this thing so
24:02 - clean up finished then it will hide
24:07 - and you basically got to do this for all
24:10 - of them so
24:12 - on the diver
24:16 - on the bag
24:19 - on the maze itself it already has it on
24:22 - the turtle
24:24 - on the fish on the
24:28 - sorry on the can
24:31 - on the water bottle and on the
24:35 - exit so we have it all
24:40 - so on the diver let it go
24:47 - wow it didn't even save you didn't even
24:50 - put it in
24:52 - so i'm going to put it back in the diver
24:55 - i remember putting it in the diver right
24:58 - there and then
25:00 - let's see let's see now just zoom out so
25:02 - i can
25:04 - see in the bag right
25:07 - in the turtle and the fish in the bottom
25:10 - can in the bottle and the exit
25:12 - so we have it all and then now we gotta
25:14 - work on the bag
25:16 - which are we done we are done with the
25:20 - bag
25:20 - so these three scripts so now we just
25:23 - have to do
25:24 - this and put them in different spots
25:27 - this
25:30 - this
25:33 - this so now let's work on the turtle
25:36 - so let's see where this will go so we're
25:39 - going to move this to the
25:41 - exit as well and now i'm going to work
25:44 - on the turtle
25:48 - so you also need this
25:52 - on all of them
25:56 - this on all of them
26:01 - and this
26:06 - so i already put it there so when the
26:09 - green
26:10 - fla i mean the thing is negative 184
26:14 - then the y is negative 106.
26:18 - so sorry guys i'm on the turtle so that
26:21 - means
26:22 - this is 142 this is
26:25 - 122 150
26:32 - 30 159
26:38 - seven so we have that
26:43 - so you can just adjust and move wherever
26:45 - you want but these are my old
26:46 - coordinates i had from my old game
26:48 - so this is why i'm using these precisely
26:51 - numbers
26:52 - now fish level one is
26:57 - 153 level
27:00 - negative 122
27:05 - negative 118
27:09 - negative 60
27:13 - 76
27:17 - negative 123. now the can
27:22 - uh so let's move that move that
27:26 - negative 106
27:30 - negative 43.
27:34 - that's for the can 173
27:41 - 102
27:45 - negative 184
27:48 - and five
27:52 - so yeah now we have to work on the
27:54 - bottle
27:57 - so the bottle is
28:02 - negative 23
28:06 - y negative 107
28:10 - negative 23
28:13 - negative 107.
28:16 - 150 108
28:21 - so that's for the bottle and now the
28:23 - exit
28:25 - so this is remember you don't have to
28:27 - have the precise numbers as me but you
28:29 - can
28:29 - do that if you want to 190
28:34 - 40
28:37 - 190
28:40 - negative 121
28:43 - negative 5
28:46 - or negative 123
28:50 - so that is it so we need the forever
28:54 - you need the if then
29:00 - items to pick up equals zero
29:06 - then it will switch
29:10 - costume to costume too
29:14 - and then there we go and back to the
29:17 - earth and then the cat and then we will
29:19 - end this
29:20 - so if there's no more um
29:23 - [Music]
29:24 - so if the items would pick up equals
29:26 - zero then i'll switch to the costume
29:28 - costume two which is basically the
29:29 - yellow one
29:30 - and not the black one so
29:33 - we have that and then now we gotta
29:35 - switch back to earth in the cat
29:37 - so so i changed the back so it'll be the
29:40 - same as the old coordinates
29:42 - so now we gotta go back to the earth so
29:45 - when
29:45 - it is cleaned up then it will
29:49 - switch costume to number 10.
29:53 - it'll show it will repeat
29:57 - 10 times
30:00 - so it will just shrink
30:03 - it'll wait 0.1 seconds
30:09 - and it'll switch costume
30:13 - to costume number
30:19 - minus one
30:24 - so go backwards basically um so we need
30:27 - the costume number
30:29 - minus one so we'll go backwards and then
30:31 - now we'll broadcast
30:33 - thank you
30:41 - we're so close to be finished so this
30:44 - cat is when i receive
30:49 - you
30:53 - and it will
30:57 - say show
31:02 - say you did a great job
31:10 - job thank you for
31:14 - your your
31:17 - help
31:20 - and then for four seconds and then now
31:24 - it will stop all first we have to make
31:27 - the music
31:28 - so the music is when the
31:32 - green flag is clicked the switch costume
31:35 - to
31:36 - back draw oh we don't have backdrop one
31:40 - that's so the other one so
31:44 - we have a backdrop one but not a
31:46 - backdrop too so that's still blue
31:48 - so then we'll play emotional piano
31:54 - [Music]
31:58 - so we'll put that
32:03 - i'm gonna set the volume to
32:06 - 25 real quick
32:11 - and then when i receive in the ocean
32:14 - it's the same thing so we already have
32:16 - one backstroke so you can make two if
32:17 - you want to but
32:18 - let's check out our game
32:24 - sorry i like one on each side
32:29 - [Music]
32:37 - so burrito
32:41 - so you see the items of pickup is
32:43 - working
32:46 - getting the turtle save the turtles save
32:48 - the fish
32:49 - save the water bottles
32:52 - save the world so you can see it's
32:56 - working
33:03 - so oh oh yeah one more thing i forgot to
33:07 - do the exit so it will turn black
33:11 - when it's not completely finished so
33:15 - we need a switch costume to costume one
33:19 - right over here and then that should be
33:22 - great so
33:25 - as you can see this is this new scripted
33:27 - code we added the switch comes from the
33:28 - costume one so i'll see you when i
33:30 - finish what i just finished
33:32 - so i'm gonna add it in the diver to set
33:34 - the items to pick up back to one
33:36 - fives because it keeps on going negative
33:38 - one for some reason
33:39 - and i did the exact same code as the
33:41 - last one uh
33:42 - and somehow the last one is getting set
33:45 - for some
33:46 - apparent reason i do not know why and
33:49 - for some reason this one isn't getting
33:51 - set even if i
33:52 - don't even put it but the other one is
33:54 - not even getting set
33:55 - and i didn't even put it so now
33:59 - it's working so yeah
34:10 - so as you can see um this is the
34:15 - let's see like the portals black i fixed
34:18 - that and
34:18 - look i'm stuck so let's redo
34:22 - and then we need to again
34:26 - and then now we need to
34:30 - get the water bottle and now we gotta
34:32 - get the fish
34:35 - he's stuck in some net gatorade bottle
34:42 - so now we gotta get in and then look we
34:45 - have level two
34:49 - i honestly hate getting the soda can
34:52 - i made some parf
35:02 - [Music]
35:11 - we got it and
35:16 - the last level it's been 35 minutes and
35:19 - 26 seconds
35:20 - so almost 40 minutes
35:24 - i'm about to beat the game so i'm going
35:26 - to show you the whole game
35:29 - for you guys to see
35:35 - [Music]
35:37 - and we are done it took 40 minutes but
35:41 - like the globe is going back you did a
35:43 - great job thank you for your help
35:45 - and that is the end of the game so
35:48 - please like share subscribe and comment
35:52 - if you can fix the
35:54 - glitch on the diver getting stuck in the
35:57 - walls
35:58 - if you can please comment please please
36:00 - please please comment so we can fix it
36:03 - and everything will be in the google
36:04 - drive so see you guys
36:07 - and happy earth day
36:16 - [Music]
36:19 - you

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's kids coming playground here and today we're back for another video of scratch and today we are doing an earth day project some of you might have already seen that on my profile um uh because i already shared the project so you guys probably seen that but today i'll be teaching you how to make the game so yeah let's get started some music april 22nd is birthday if you did not know then please help me clean up some trash in the ocean and it'll just grow larger and guys i'm eating something right now so yeah so there's a little diver he's collecting the trash soda cans there's a trap turtle save the turtles save the trees save the earth we should always save the earth because that's where we live and earth is important so look i saved the fish now the portal opened and now i can enter it look i'm gonna get the bag let me get the soda can real of course so do your part clean up them now on the third level this going to be the last level so sort of can that's normal oh yeah and sometimes you can get stuck i couldn't do anything about it so the diver's legs are a little bit long so you can not you'll get stuck so the only way to get unstuck is click r to reset so sorry guys but i couldn't figure out anything because the diver has really big flippers and if you didn't have flippers or swim this would be really way better you can cut off the flippers if you want but i mean like he's not a diver anymore so it says you did a great job thank you for your help and then that'll be the end of this game so let's get started so let's get started so first we got a scratch cap um so we have to do our cat our earth our maze our bag everything so i'm gonna do the cat so when the green flag is clicked i'll show and say april 22nd is earth day and then so i'll also say we need to do our part to help and keep our earth clean we have to keep our earth clean guys do your part help the world out so and we have one last thing that you have to say sorry i'm still eating my gummies guys so sorry next thing i'll say please help me to clean up some of the trash in the ocean all right so now we can finally code because i'm done eating my gummies so yeah broadcast zoom in and then this zoom in will do a lot it's the start of the chain so we have to get our earth i'm gonna drag both of these earth you'll find out why we need both we don't need both but like i'm just going to show you uh so now there's two earths in a parallel universe so the earth this is the baby earth which is the regular earth we're going to work we'll not not work with but i'm going to demonstrate so when you duplicate it you can make one each every larger a little bit larger because that's what we did to make the zoom in so that's basically what we did to go into the ocean so yeah and we can just keep on doing that you get the point or you can just go on google drive and download everything we have so right now i'm making the earth larger and larger you have to center it so then it will stay in the center and will not go off off the thing so so this is basically what we have five earths and then this one we made 10 earths and it'll slowly get larger and then number 10 is just big so as you can see that's number 10 so you should basically get the point right if you zoom in and that's important maze so you can customize your own mazes it's pretty fun you can drag like you can just customize your own mesis i mean people can be creative and make their own mazes all around so that's great so you gotta use the rectangular blocks these and then you gotta drag them like that and then you get a piece so or you can drag it like that which would be impossible to get to but that's fine uh so yeah we have that and then there is the maze so we need the bag the turtle the fish and the soda can and the um and the portal and uh they already dragged the fish i think maybe it's still loading on it and then we need the still saving and then we need the soda can and then we need the portal and then we need the bottle so we have seven spur no no it's not nine sprites now we need to continue on the earth so zoom in is when you zoom in into the earth so then you can get started on the real project so when the green flag is clicked it will show then we'll switch costume to earth which is the first costume it will go to zero zero and then when i receive zoom in it'll repeat 10 times oh wait 0.1 seconds one and uh switch costume any next costume and then broadcast and ocean and this is where the big broadcast is because this is where everything starts broadcast oh an ocean i wrote broadcast so an ocean so now we gotta go back to the cat and make it hide so and then it'll hide and then now michelle april 22nd is earth day we need to do our part and help and they'll zoom in into the earth and then you'll see the diver and everything so now so we need to hide after that sorry i didn't put that and now we can get started on the maze the and basically everything else so when the green oh we gotta get the diver sorry that is the main thing we have here diver diver diver two and then we have the maze so when the green flag is clicked it'll go to zero zero and it will switch costume to costume one which is the first level basically because um costly one no hide it will when i receive an ocean it will show of course because it will show if it's in the ocean and then you need to so we're going to work on the diver next because the diver is the most important and so we have when the green flag is clicked it'll set level to one so we're going to make a new variable level level 11. and now we have to do set level to one first level is always home one so we have to name this happy earth day i forgot to name it and then i'll go to x 170 negative 170 and now the x is 135. why why why and the x is what negative 170. it'll point in direction 90 and it will hide so that's the basically the diver code except we have a big chunk for the left arrow and right arrow keys oh so um this is to get the diver over there i'm just changing the size to 40 real quick just to get the diver all the way over here so when i receive in ocean it will go to that position the point of direction 90 of course it'll show it'll go forever so this is for the left arrow right arrow type of thing and then you need an if then statement touching the color i'll go show this real quick if it's touching the color then i'll switch to the next level uh eyedropper yellow stop save now and then so if you did not notice from my demo when you collect all the trash it will be yellow but if you don't it's going to be black so that's how it is and then you have the diver so touching the color yellow it will hide it'll broadcast next level it will stop this script and then we need to if then all the arrows so this will take quite a while so if then the up arrow is clicked pressed same thing uh then it will be if then the touching if then touching i gotta make the backdrop if then touching the color you gotta make the backdrop you gotta make the backdrop for the so um i'm gonna make the backdrop i actually did not need the backdrop right now so you need the if then touching color this is the best i can do to prevent this then it will change y by minus 10. and then so now we need to do set rotation style to all around because one of them on the left side is left right so it won't flip over so you need some rotation style to all around a point in direction zero and it'll move ten steps it will wait 0.1 seconds so we got the up arrow and now we can make the down arrow oopsies which is right under the up arrow but instill in the forever loop so instead now you gotta go down arrow and then instead you gotta change y by ten that's pretty obvious and then you gotta set rotations out all around still and then this point direction is 180 so it'll be like that and then it'll move 10 steps and wait 0.1 seconds left arrow is way different but i'm just going to duplicate it so then it will feel it's almost the same a little bit different so it says x so left arrow change x by 10 and the set rotation style to left right so it will not flip around because if you did left left side it'll be a back stroke so you want it freestyle you know point direction negative 90 and move 10 steps and wait 0.1 seconds okay so now we're going to do the right arrow which is pretty much the same as the left arrow just a tinge difference and it'll change x by minus 10 sub rotation styles are all around point in direction 90 and then there you got it right arrow so now i'm gonna make the backdrop all around left and left and right is all okay but now i'm gonna make the backdrop so just a shade of blue uh a shade of blue so you can just make a gigantic square because that's and bitmap it's not the best so then you need to do this and then you gotta go like that doesn't matter if there's a blackout line you won't be able to see it anyways so now we got that covered now i'm gonna make the bag so in my original game i had a double backdrop i just switched the the first backdrop so i think that's fine you don't really need it backdrops don't really matter unless if it's like an animation plot or something so then so i'm going to demo the game for you so so i'm gonna put that back in wait a second so i'm gonna broadcast zoom in so there we go we have the diver moving and still can get stuck so i think there is a way out of this so this is i would do the reset code because there's nothing that i can possibly do about this if you can find a solution you guys can come in the comment section below and see what you can do and then we can get off of that idea and make our original a little bit more better i mean i it's still not it's still i still can't do it like i still can't put it i can't i still can't get him out of this maze but that is absolutely fine uh we do have a redo button that's the best i can do for this one so yeah now we have to do we're almost done with the diver we'll do the rest later so you need r to reset so and click on look we reset it chuck r i'm gonna move a little bit or get stuck in the wall what am i gonna do r so that's all we have for now and i'm gonna also put back these lines so then the cat can say something and then now we have to work on the bag so the bag we have to work on so when the green flag is clicked it will hide oopsies too close and then when i receive an ocean then it will go if then level one if you make your level one different it could end up in a different spot because of the way it's positioned so if then level equals one you'll go to this position i have already so the back has to go to one i mean it's fine but you know just here let's just put it here it's close enough there's only three digits on the x away and four digits in the y so and then the um duplicate nope nope not that on level two it's going to be a way different story than level one so on level two it will be a different position so look level two is different level three is different so this is where level two is you put it anywhere you want so i'm putting it over there i'm pretty sure the original is over there if i'm not mistaken so and then level three it's a whole different story as well as level two so it can be over there but i'm gonna put the same coordinate so it will work all level 3 negative 173 positive no negative 114 and it'll show e and then it will go forever we're almost done uh bear with me on the turtle the fish the cannon the bottle it's actually not even that far because we all we have to do is just change just a little bit and then we'll be done so touching diver two oopsies dive into then it will hide and it will change items to pick up by minus one so we have items to pick up to change items to pick up by minus one you know stop the script so we gotta make the items to pick up five but first we have to put all of this into here make the items to pick up five on each level so i'm gonna work on the maze so we can do the when i receive in next level then i will so the diver broadcasts it right here then i will change level by minus one i mean plus one and i will go if then else if then the level equals four no four if the level if four is greater than level which means it is level four which is the end three i mean it's greater than three which is basically level four it'll set items to pick up so um this is on level three and this is on level four now so there's one two three right here and this is level four and i'll set items to pick up to five in the beginning of all the levels next costume and it will broadcast an ocean and wait you know broadcast cleanup finished that's all right yeah i think i did and then it will goes clean up finished and then that means it will hide this thing so clean up finished then it will hide and you basically got to do this for all of them so on the diver on the bag on the maze itself it already has it on the turtle on the fish on the sorry on the can on the water bottle and on the exit so we have it all so on the diver let it go wow it didn't even save you didn't even put it in so i'm going to put it back in the diver i remember putting it in the diver right there and then let's see let's see now just zoom out so i can see in the bag right in the turtle and the fish in the bottom can in the bottle and the exit so we have it all and then now we gotta work on the bag which are we done we are done with the bag so these three scripts so now we just have to do this and put them in different spots this this this so now let's work on the turtle so let's see where this will go so we're going to move this to the exit as well and now i'm going to work on the turtle so you also need this on all of them this on all of them and this so i already put it there so when the green fla i mean the thing is negative 184 then the y is negative 106. so sorry guys i'm on the turtle so that means this is 142 this is 122 150 30 159 seven so we have that so you can just adjust and move wherever you want but these are my old coordinates i had from my old game so this is why i'm using these precisely numbers now fish level one is 153 level negative 122 negative 118 negative 60 76 negative 123. now the can uh so let's move that move that negative 106 negative 43. that's for the can 173 102 negative 184 and five so yeah now we have to work on the bottle so the bottle is negative 23 y negative 107 negative 23 negative 107. 150 108 so that's for the bottle and now the exit so this is remember you don't have to have the precise numbers as me but you can do that if you want to 190 40 190 negative 121 negative 5 or negative 123 so that is it so we need the forever you need the if then items to pick up equals zero then it will switch costume to costume too and then there we go and back to the earth and then the cat and then we will end this so if there's no more um so if the items would pick up equals zero then i'll switch to the costume costume two which is basically the yellow one and not the black one so we have that and then now we gotta switch back to earth in the cat so so i changed the back so it'll be the same as the old coordinates so now we gotta go back to the earth so when it is cleaned up then it will switch costume to number 10. it'll show it will repeat 10 times so it will just shrink it'll wait 0.1 seconds and it'll switch costume to costume number minus one so go backwards basically um so we need the costume number minus one so we'll go backwards and then now we'll broadcast thank you we're so close to be finished so this cat is when i receive you and it will say show say you did a great job job thank you for your your help and then for four seconds and then now it will stop all first we have to make the music so the music is when the green flag is clicked the switch costume to back draw oh we don't have backdrop one that's so the other one so we have a backdrop one but not a backdrop too so that's still blue so then we'll play emotional piano so we'll put that i'm gonna set the volume to 25 real quick and then when i receive in the ocean it's the same thing so we already have one backstroke so you can make two if you want to but let's check out our game sorry i like one on each side so burrito so you see the items of pickup is working getting the turtle save the turtles save the fish save the water bottles save the world so you can see it's working so oh oh yeah one more thing i forgot to do the exit so it will turn black when it's not completely finished so we need a switch costume to costume one right over here and then that should be great so as you can see this is this new scripted code we added the switch comes from the costume one so i'll see you when i finish what i just finished so i'm gonna add it in the diver to set the items to pick up back to one fives because it keeps on going negative one for some reason and i did the exact same code as the last one uh and somehow the last one is getting set for some apparent reason i do not know why and for some reason this one isn't getting set even if i don't even put it but the other one is not even getting set and i didn't even put it so now it's working so yeah so as you can see um this is the let's see like the portals black i fixed that and look i'm stuck so let's redo and then we need to again and then now we need to get the water bottle and now we gotta get the fish he's stuck in some net gatorade bottle so now we gotta get in and then look we have level two i honestly hate getting the soda can i made some parf we got it and the last level it's been 35 minutes and 26 seconds so almost 40 minutes i'm about to beat the game so i'm going to show you the whole game for you guys to see and we are done it took 40 minutes but like the globe is going back you did a great job thank you for your help and that is the end of the game so please like share subscribe and comment if you can fix the glitch on the diver getting stuck in the walls if you can please comment please please please please comment so we can fix it and everything will be in the google drive so see you guys and happy earth day you
