00:07 - hello and welcome back guys to kids
00:08 - coding playground today i'll be making a
00:10 - video on how to make
00:12 - your titles look attractive and make
00:15 - them look good overall so instead of
00:17 - making those simple just like text we're
00:19 - going to be making them more advanced
00:21 - so here we have a text from one of our
00:24 - thumbnails
00:25 - so right here says game right but it
00:27 - looks like it's like kind of 3d like
00:29 - block letters so i'll be showing you
00:31 - guys how to do that today so
00:33 - without further ado let's start a new
00:35 - project so we're going to create a new
00:36 - project
00:37 - okay so we're going to delete the
00:38 - scratch hat
00:40 - um and then so basically what you do is
00:42 - you paint a new sprites
00:44 - and as you notice when you try to type
00:46 - text you cannot use the outline but what
00:48 - you do
00:49 - it's kind of weird how scratch works
00:51 - this way okay so you can just draw us
00:54 - like a circle right just draw a circle
00:57 - go to your text
00:58 - i'll zoom in so go to your text
01:01 - and type something so we're going to
01:02 - name this we're just going to say hello
01:04 - or something
01:04 - so you write that
01:06 - and then you click here first and then
01:08 - you click here and then you get outline
01:10 - for some reason this works
01:12 - um i don't think it's supposed to work
01:14 - like that but i guess you can actually
01:16 - do that you can actually make it have
01:18 - outlined so what we're going to do is
01:19 - make
01:20 - this all black so we're going to make
01:22 - our back
01:23 - our hello black this is the back layer
01:25 - and then we're gonna make the outline to
01:27 - eight
01:28 - so it's kind of hard to see like
01:30 - you're gonna make it something like that
01:33 - and then we can delete our circle sprite
01:35 - and then we can enlarge our spriter here
01:38 - so we hold down alt so then it will stay
01:41 - you make it a little bit bigger okay so
01:42 - there we have our hello so what we're
01:44 - going to do ctrl c ctrl v and then we
01:46 - have our second one
01:48 - and then we're just going to remove the
01:50 - outline and now we're just going to make
01:52 - it
01:52 - red so here we have our hello
01:55 - and then try to center it a little bit
01:57 - and there you go so now you have your
01:59 - block letters
02:01 - and as you can see we had some brown
02:03 - shadow so if you can also add shadow if
02:05 - you want to make it even more better
02:07 - it's for extra bonus points you can
02:09 - control c ctrl v
02:10 - you get another one uh you can probably
02:13 - you make it brown
02:16 - let's make the color like kind of
02:17 - brownish like dark brown like that
02:21 - and then so you basically just want to
02:23 - make this go back one layer
02:25 - not to the back sorry back one layer
02:28 - and then this red one you just try to
02:30 - get make it look
02:32 - like it's a shadow
02:34 - so
02:37 - you can like move this one
02:39 - a little bit
02:40 - that and then this one
02:43 - kind of like this
02:45 - so as you can see you kind of got like
02:47 - a shadow behind your letters so
02:50 - that's pretty much it for this tutorial
02:52 - on how to make your text look way more
02:55 - attractive and more awesome
02:57 - and also a quick update from youtube
02:59 - they um didn't let us re-upload our
03:02 - python video on how to download uh
03:04 - youtube videos into mp4 files because
03:07 - like
03:07 - it uh it was against the terms of
03:10 - service
03:11 - so
03:12 - that will not be on be able to upload
03:15 - again so
