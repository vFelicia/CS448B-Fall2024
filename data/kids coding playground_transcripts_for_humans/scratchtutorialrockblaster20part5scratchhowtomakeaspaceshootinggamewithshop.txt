00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to another video in
00:09 - kids coding playground
00:10 - today we'll be finishing the rock
00:12 - blaster 2.0
00:13 - so before i start i'm just going to
00:15 - scroll through the code
00:16 - and do before i uh before i start uh
00:19 - please like
00:20 - share and subscribe and ring the
00:22 - notification bell
00:24 - so now let's so you can just pause the
00:27 - video if you want
00:28 - any um if you missed any code you could
00:31 - just pause the video and put it down
00:34 - so i'm just going to spend like two
00:35 - seconds you can pause it
00:38 - and then this is the rock blaster player
00:41 - the player
00:44 - so there's a player i'm just gonna put
00:45 - this on so it's easier to see
00:48 - then you have the laser
00:52 - the laser code um the game over sprite
00:55 - i can actually rename this
00:58 - [Music]
01:01 - and and then next we'll get the shop
01:05 - so for the shop this is the code
01:09 - um and then for the exit
01:13 - exit button
01:16 - exit button
01:19 - shop background this is just the
01:22 - background to switch
01:23 - when the shop opens you have the pause
01:26 - button
01:29 - this is the blue spaceship skin
01:38 - and the force field we will be working
01:40 - on today
01:41 - uh we'll be working on these three today
01:43 - and then we have the
01:44 - change back to default skin and finally
01:47 - last but not least
01:48 - we have the cool station
01:54 - okay so first let's start out by making
01:57 - the scatter shot button so
01:58 - we're gonna uh direct and drop all this
02:01 - code into the scatter shot
02:03 - sprite we just have to change up some
02:07 - variables and broadcasts
02:09 - so just drag this on here
02:12 - [Music]
02:15 - and i'm just going to separate this a
02:16 - little bit
02:19 - move this right here so be a little bit
02:22 - more organized
02:24 - [Music]
02:26 - and so for here instead we
02:30 - have to put a new x and y position so
02:32 - for the scatter shot
02:33 - i put it at negative 50 for the x and
02:35 - negative 30 for the y
02:38 - and then i set the size 100 show all the
02:40 - same thing
02:42 - up until here instead of broadcasting
02:44 - check cool spaceship purchase we have to
02:46 - make a new
02:47 - message called check
02:50 - triple triple
02:54 - shot purchase
03:03 - um and then um so we got the check
03:05 - triple shot purchase
03:07 - and then right here instead we have to
03:09 - uh check this check triple shot purchase
03:12 - and then we have to um get a new
03:15 - variable
03:15 - let's make a new variable it's called a
03:18 - triple shot triple
03:20 - [Music]
03:22 - triple shot purchase
03:25 - status so
03:28 - get that variable so instead of here
03:31 - we're going to change it to triple shot
03:33 - purchase status
03:34 - unlocked all the same and then we have
03:36 - to do switch to triple shot
03:39 - new uh uh broadcast let's name it switch
03:45 - switch to triple shot
03:49 - and stop the script all the same instead
03:51 - of 2 500
03:52 - i'm making triple shot 5 000 coins
03:56 - so it'll take a quite some time
03:59 - to get that and instead of negative
04:03 - 2 2 500 we're going to be minus 5 000
04:06 - of course because it's 5 000 money and
04:09 - then right here instead we're going to
04:11 - set the triple shot
04:12 - purchase status to unlocked and then
04:15 - instead of right here we're gonna
04:16 - broadcast switch to triple shot
04:20 - and then right here we're gonna have to
04:22 - do the triple shot purchase status
04:24 - the variable and then let's move to the
04:27 - right we have to check
04:29 - here right here we're going to do the
04:31 - swish to triple shot right here
04:34 - switch triple shot right here and then
04:37 - next we're going to get the um start
04:40 - game and then when flag clicked
04:43 - locked and then we have to change this
04:46 - so now we have all of that let's go to
04:48 - the player so
04:50 - and then also right here forgot about
04:52 - that so let's go to triple shot
04:53 - status so then let's go to the player
04:56 - now
04:57 - i'm uh starting with the player the
04:59 - laser
05:00 - so the laser we will be broadcasting the
05:02 - message so when i receive
05:06 - when i receive um triple shot
05:10 - switches triple shot we are going to
05:12 - switch the costume
05:14 - to triple shot which is the second
05:16 - costume with the
05:17 - three lasers so we're gonna switch to
05:20 - that
05:22 - so now let's try it out
05:25 - so i'm i already gave myself some money
05:29 - so let's try it out so i'm going to play
05:31 - it open the shop i already started out
05:34 - five thousand dollars
05:35 - um let's click on this door
05:39 - buy it and now you can't buy it anymore
05:41 - as you can see
05:42 - let's go exit and now you get triple
05:44 - shot as you can see
05:47 - now you can kill enemies much faster
05:50 - rather than using the single shot and we
05:53 - did not do the transition where you
05:54 - could uh
05:55 - go to the um back to the regular um
05:59 - single shot but um
06:02 - right now we just had the triple shot
06:04 - you cannot go back to the single shot so
06:06 - it's just a one-time purchase
06:07 - but you can add that if you guys want
06:10 - but
06:10 - next let's work on the force field so
06:14 - for the force field
06:15 - i made it that you have to click f to uh
06:18 - activate the force field so when key f
06:20 - is pressed
06:22 - then with um oh yeah and let's make this
06:26 - first because
06:26 - you have to click on that to make the
06:28 - force feel so
06:30 - for here same as pretty much all of
06:33 - these let's just
06:34 - um accept that except it's a little bit
06:37 - different
06:38 - just because um you can buy multiple
06:40 - force fields so
06:42 - so if i drag and drop this we're gonna
06:45 - um
06:46 - change it up a little bit so right here
06:48 - we're gonna change the x and y position
06:50 - so i made the x and y position
06:52 - negative 175 and negative 30.
06:57 - and for here it's all the same
07:00 - but then wait until right here instead
07:03 - we're gonna have to make a new
07:04 - variable and um we're just gonna put a
07:07 - wait until right here
07:09 - wait until um not
07:12 - not instead we're gonna have to do this
07:14 - wait until not
07:16 - uh mouse down so wait until it's not
07:19 - messed down
07:20 - and then we switch costume costume two
07:24 - and then we may make a new variable
07:25 - called start buying
07:28 - so then buy multiple of them start
07:31 - buying
07:33 - so we're going to set the start buying
07:35 - to yes right here since it's
07:37 - getting clicked on so start buying to
07:40 - yes
07:42 - so yes and then we're going to have to
07:44 - um make a
07:46 - a new broadcast message so i'm going to
07:48 - name it
07:49 - check check
07:53 - uh force field
07:57 - purchase
08:00 - check force field purchase and then
08:02 - let's get a one flight clicked
08:06 - let's get a one flag clicked and this is
08:07 - a setup so switch back to the first
08:09 - costume
08:10 - in the beginning and then we want to
08:13 - hide in the beginning
08:15 - and when i receive start game we also
08:19 - want to
08:19 - hide and switch costume to costume one
08:24 - like that and then we're gonna get a one
08:27 - i receive when i receive check force
08:29 - field purchase
08:32 - force field purchase and if
08:36 - uh start buying is equal to yes that
08:38 - means they have they're trying to buy it
08:40 - so if start buying is a yes
08:45 - um then you want to set it to no
08:49 - set it back to no and then you have to
08:51 - and then you can click it again to buy
08:53 - it again so start buying back to no
08:56 - and then if the money is equal to or
08:58 - less than a
08:59 - greater than 500 so we're gonna make it
09:02 - 500 coins but you guys can make it any
09:04 - value one
09:06 - so if it's uh equal to or
09:09 - greater than greater than 500
09:15 - [Music]
09:17 - if the money is greater than or equal to
09:20 - 500
09:22 - the money then we will change the money
09:24 - by
09:25 - negative 500 so they'll lose 500 money
09:30 - and switch costs from costume 2
09:32 - [Music]
09:34 - switch cost more costume too so it'll
09:37 - become the by
09:38 - bot the bot um uh costume
09:41 - and then um we have to change we have to
09:45 - change the force fields we made this
09:46 - variable earlier i think
09:48 - so we're gonna have to change the force
09:49 - field by one um
09:51 - letting the player know they bought one
09:52 - force field
09:55 - uh or sportsmail up here okay change
09:58 - force field two by one
09:59 - and then we're gonna make a little
10:00 - weight in 0.5 seconds so they can't just
10:02 - keep on spamming the
10:04 - uh button to keep on buying it um you
10:07 - can keep on buying more
10:08 - as long as you have the money but we're
10:09 - just going to keep a little delay right
10:11 - here
10:12 - and then um we're going to switch
10:13 - costume back to costume one
10:16 - so we're actually going to add a little
10:17 - bit more code to this so
10:19 - this was just like oh so we're gonna in
10:21 - the beginning right here we're gonna set
10:23 - the start bind to no
10:24 - so it will always be no no matter what
10:28 - so let's say sometimes it might start as
10:30 - yes
10:32 - so we we just want to reset it back to
10:34 - no it will probably improve your code
10:36 - and then right here we want to um set
10:39 - the force fields
10:40 - to zero in the beginning so they have no
10:42 - force field
10:44 - and then finally let's work on the force
10:46 - field
10:47 - so for the force field i did the f key
10:49 - because
10:50 - f for force field and then um yeah yeah
10:53 - and then we'll do a if then statement
10:57 - and then let's get an and
11:02 - and then let's get in uh and um
11:05 - so we got greater than symbol so if
11:08 - and so great the force field
11:12 - is greater than zero so if they have
11:14 - more than one
11:15 - zero more than zero force fields which
11:17 - means any
11:18 - positive number and not
11:23 - force fetal equals on so force field
11:25 - status equals to on so we need to make a
11:27 - new variable
11:28 - force field status
11:32 - [Music]
11:36 - force field status so what this variable
11:39 - is for
11:40 - is once you have a force field activated
11:42 - you can't click it again
11:43 - so let's get an equal sign so equal
11:47 - force field is equal to on so force
11:50 - field status
11:51 - is equal to on then we will set the
11:54 - force field timer for five seconds
11:56 - so uh i'm gonna make a new variable
11:58 - called force field timer
12:00 - force field timer
12:05 - so we're gonna set the force field timer
12:09 - force field timer to five so this is
12:10 - just a countdown for five seconds i've
12:12 - made the force field last for five
12:14 - seconds
12:15 - but you guys can make it last pretty
12:16 - much any however much time you want
12:19 - and then we're going to broadcast a new
12:21 - variable called start game
12:23 - um start timer sorry about that start
12:26 - timer so
12:27 - that so the uh timer will start running
12:31 - for the force field and then after that
12:34 - we want to show
12:36 - and then go to front layer so go to the
12:39 - uh
12:40 - front and then next
12:43 - in a forever loop okay so let's get a
12:45 - forever loop
12:47 - um let's put it right here under here
12:50 - forever let's get an if else statement
12:53 - if
12:56 - the force field timer is greater than
12:57 - zero that means the force field timer
12:59 - has not run out yet
13:01 - force field timer is greater than zero
13:06 - go to player and turn 10 degrees so
13:09 - it'll go to the player and it will um
13:11 - turn so in the other video in the two
13:14 - player space dual game
13:16 - we made the force field uh spin so we're
13:19 - gonna make it spin here
13:20 - as well so i made it turn 10 degrees um
13:23 - else we're going to set the force field
13:25 - status off because
13:26 - the timer has run out
13:30 - off i'm going to set set the force field
13:33 - status sorry about that
13:34 - not not the timer status and then i'm
13:37 - gonna hide and stop the script because
13:39 - the timer has run out stop the script
13:46 - and then next we want to get a winner
13:48 - when we receive start game beyond hide
13:50 - in the beginning
13:52 - and receive start game hide
13:58 - and then we're going to get one fly
13:59 - clicked in the beginning we want to set
14:01 - the force field status
14:03 - to off so you will not get any force
14:07 - fields at the beginning and
14:08 - force will not be running so force field
14:11 - status should be off at the beginning
14:13 - all the time and then we want to hide in
14:15 - the beginning
14:16 - [Music]
14:18 - and then let's get a when i receive
14:19 - start timer that's from the
14:21 - when you press the f key whether it's
14:24 - you start timer
14:27 - start timer i'm gonna get set the force
14:30 - field status to on
14:32 - because you're using the force field
14:33 - right now set the force field status
14:37 - to on
14:42 - set it to on and then we're going to
14:44 - change the force fields by one
14:46 - because you're using a force field so
14:47 - you're going to minus one for the force
14:49 - fields
14:50 - so we subtract one and then we're going
14:53 - to repeat the force field timer
14:55 - times so the force wheel timer times um
14:59 - is five so i'll repeat five seconds
15:02 - repeat five times sorry repeat five
15:05 - times
15:05 - not five seconds so it'll repeat five
15:08 - times the force field timer
15:10 - and then we'll wait one second so it
15:13 - will
15:13 - and then we're gonna change the force
15:15 - wheel timer by negative one so it'll go
15:17 - down
15:17 - the timer will go down change the force
15:20 - field
15:25 - so basically this is uh repeating five
15:28 - times
15:28 - waiting one second and then change the
15:30 - force field timer by one
15:32 - negative one so it'll be five seconds
15:36 - okay so now we have all of that uh
15:40 - let's try it out and i forgot one last
15:43 - thing
15:43 - i almost forgot this so in the enemies
15:46 - we have to get an if-then statement so
15:48 - when it's touching the force field
15:50 - it'll actually deflect the enemies from
15:52 - uh hitting him
15:54 - so let's get an if-then statement if
15:57 - touching force field
15:59 - [Music]
16:01 - for the force field when they're
16:03 - touching the force field
16:04 - i'm not going to make them gain points
16:07 - when they kill the aliens with the force
16:09 - field
16:09 - i'm just gonna um i'll make the aliens
16:13 - die
16:14 - so let's go get a go-to
16:17 - i'm just gonna copy paste this actually
16:19 - just duplicate it put it in here
16:21 - so yeah so now when it touches it it
16:23 - will actually die
16:25 - and then um so yeah that's pretty much
16:28 - it so let's try it out
16:31 - so i'm gonna turn on the force field
16:36 - i'm gonna take out this so then you can
16:38 - see clearly and then turn on the force
16:40 - field
16:42 - so i have zero force fields right now so
16:44 - click the p button
16:46 - open the shop so you can continually you
16:48 - can continuously buy force fields
16:51 - it'll keep on going up and up so
16:54 - as you can see
16:56 - [Music]
16:57 - so now you can like shield yourself for
16:59 - five seconds
17:03 - [Music]
17:05 - and when you restart the force fields
17:07 - will go back to normal
17:08 - i'm just going to buy some more real
17:10 - quick and show you guys one more time
17:13 - so as you can see the force field is
17:14 - pretty good for defending and you can
17:16 - shoot enemies at the same time
17:19 - so yeah uh it's pretty cool the force
17:22 - field
17:23 - [Music]
17:25 - so yeah it's pretty cool so thank you
17:27 - guys for watching don't forget to like
17:30 - share subscribe and i'll see you guys in
17:33 - the next video

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys to another video in kids coding playground today we'll be finishing the rock blaster 2.0 so before i start i'm just going to scroll through the code and do before i uh before i start uh please like share and subscribe and ring the notification bell so now let's so you can just pause the video if you want any um if you missed any code you could just pause the video and put it down so i'm just going to spend like two seconds you can pause it and then this is the rock blaster player the player so there's a player i'm just gonna put this on so it's easier to see then you have the laser the laser code um the game over sprite i can actually rename this and and then next we'll get the shop so for the shop this is the code um and then for the exit exit button exit button shop background this is just the background to switch when the shop opens you have the pause button this is the blue spaceship skin and the force field we will be working on today uh we'll be working on these three today and then we have the change back to default skin and finally last but not least we have the cool station okay so first let's start out by making the scatter shot button so we're gonna uh direct and drop all this code into the scatter shot sprite we just have to change up some variables and broadcasts so just drag this on here and i'm just going to separate this a little bit move this right here so be a little bit more organized and so for here instead we have to put a new x and y position so for the scatter shot i put it at negative 50 for the x and negative 30 for the y and then i set the size 100 show all the same thing up until here instead of broadcasting check cool spaceship purchase we have to make a new message called check triple triple shot purchase um and then um so we got the check triple shot purchase and then right here instead we have to uh check this check triple shot purchase and then we have to um get a new variable let's make a new variable it's called a triple shot triple triple shot purchase status so get that variable so instead of here we're going to change it to triple shot purchase status unlocked all the same and then we have to do switch to triple shot new uh uh broadcast let's name it switch switch to triple shot and stop the script all the same instead of 2 500 i'm making triple shot 5 000 coins so it'll take a quite some time to get that and instead of negative 2 2 500 we're going to be minus 5 000 of course because it's 5 000 money and then right here instead we're going to set the triple shot purchase status to unlocked and then instead of right here we're gonna broadcast switch to triple shot and then right here we're gonna have to do the triple shot purchase status the variable and then let's move to the right we have to check here right here we're going to do the swish to triple shot right here switch triple shot right here and then next we're going to get the um start game and then when flag clicked locked and then we have to change this so now we have all of that let's go to the player so and then also right here forgot about that so let's go to triple shot status so then let's go to the player now i'm uh starting with the player the laser so the laser we will be broadcasting the message so when i receive when i receive um triple shot switches triple shot we are going to switch the costume to triple shot which is the second costume with the three lasers so we're gonna switch to that so now let's try it out so i'm i already gave myself some money so let's try it out so i'm going to play it open the shop i already started out five thousand dollars um let's click on this door buy it and now you can't buy it anymore as you can see let's go exit and now you get triple shot as you can see now you can kill enemies much faster rather than using the single shot and we did not do the transition where you could uh go to the um back to the regular um single shot but um right now we just had the triple shot you cannot go back to the single shot so it's just a onetime purchase but you can add that if you guys want but next let's work on the force field so for the force field i made it that you have to click f to uh activate the force field so when key f is pressed then with um oh yeah and let's make this first because you have to click on that to make the force feel so for here same as pretty much all of these let's just um accept that except it's a little bit different just because um you can buy multiple force fields so so if i drag and drop this we're gonna um change it up a little bit so right here we're gonna change the x and y position so i made the x and y position negative 175 and negative 30. and for here it's all the same but then wait until right here instead we're gonna have to make a new variable and um we're just gonna put a wait until right here wait until um not not instead we're gonna have to do this wait until not uh mouse down so wait until it's not messed down and then we switch costume costume two and then we may make a new variable called start buying so then buy multiple of them start buying so we're going to set the start buying to yes right here since it's getting clicked on so start buying to yes so yes and then we're going to have to um make a a new broadcast message so i'm going to name it check check uh force field purchase check force field purchase and then let's get a one flight clicked let's get a one flag clicked and this is a setup so switch back to the first costume in the beginning and then we want to hide in the beginning and when i receive start game we also want to hide and switch costume to costume one like that and then we're gonna get a one i receive when i receive check force field purchase force field purchase and if uh start buying is equal to yes that means they have they're trying to buy it so if start buying is a yes um then you want to set it to no set it back to no and then you have to and then you can click it again to buy it again so start buying back to no and then if the money is equal to or less than a greater than 500 so we're gonna make it 500 coins but you guys can make it any value one so if it's uh equal to or greater than greater than 500 if the money is greater than or equal to 500 the money then we will change the money by negative 500 so they'll lose 500 money and switch costs from costume 2 switch cost more costume too so it'll become the by bot the bot um uh costume and then um we have to change we have to change the force fields we made this variable earlier i think so we're gonna have to change the force field by one um letting the player know they bought one force field uh or sportsmail up here okay change force field two by one and then we're gonna make a little weight in 0.5 seconds so they can't just keep on spamming the uh button to keep on buying it um you can keep on buying more as long as you have the money but we're just going to keep a little delay right here and then um we're going to switch costume back to costume one so we're actually going to add a little bit more code to this so this was just like oh so we're gonna in the beginning right here we're gonna set the start bind to no so it will always be no no matter what so let's say sometimes it might start as yes so we we just want to reset it back to no it will probably improve your code and then right here we want to um set the force fields to zero in the beginning so they have no force field and then finally let's work on the force field so for the force field i did the f key because f for force field and then um yeah yeah and then we'll do a if then statement and then let's get an and and then let's get in uh and um so we got greater than symbol so if and so great the force field is greater than zero so if they have more than one zero more than zero force fields which means any positive number and not force fetal equals on so force field status equals to on so we need to make a new variable force field status force field status so what this variable is for is once you have a force field activated you can't click it again so let's get an equal sign so equal force field is equal to on so force field status is equal to on then we will set the force field timer for five seconds so uh i'm gonna make a new variable called force field timer force field timer so we're gonna set the force field timer force field timer to five so this is just a countdown for five seconds i've made the force field last for five seconds but you guys can make it last pretty much any however much time you want and then we're going to broadcast a new variable called start game um start timer sorry about that start timer so that so the uh timer will start running for the force field and then after that we want to show and then go to front layer so go to the uh front and then next in a forever loop okay so let's get a forever loop um let's put it right here under here forever let's get an if else statement if the force field timer is greater than zero that means the force field timer has not run out yet force field timer is greater than zero go to player and turn 10 degrees so it'll go to the player and it will um turn so in the other video in the two player space dual game we made the force field uh spin so we're gonna make it spin here as well so i made it turn 10 degrees um else we're going to set the force field status off because the timer has run out off i'm going to set set the force field status sorry about that not not the timer status and then i'm gonna hide and stop the script because the timer has run out stop the script and then next we want to get a winner when we receive start game beyond hide in the beginning and receive start game hide and then we're going to get one fly clicked in the beginning we want to set the force field status to off so you will not get any force fields at the beginning and force will not be running so force field status should be off at the beginning all the time and then we want to hide in the beginning and then let's get a when i receive start timer that's from the when you press the f key whether it's you start timer start timer i'm gonna get set the force field status to on because you're using the force field right now set the force field status to on set it to on and then we're going to change the force fields by one because you're using a force field so you're going to minus one for the force fields so we subtract one and then we're going to repeat the force field timer times so the force wheel timer times um is five so i'll repeat five seconds repeat five times sorry repeat five times not five seconds so it'll repeat five times the force field timer and then we'll wait one second so it will and then we're gonna change the force wheel timer by negative one so it'll go down the timer will go down change the force field so basically this is uh repeating five times waiting one second and then change the force field timer by one negative one so it'll be five seconds okay so now we have all of that uh let's try it out and i forgot one last thing i almost forgot this so in the enemies we have to get an ifthen statement so when it's touching the force field it'll actually deflect the enemies from uh hitting him so let's get an ifthen statement if touching force field for the force field when they're touching the force field i'm not going to make them gain points when they kill the aliens with the force field i'm just gonna um i'll make the aliens die so let's go get a goto i'm just gonna copy paste this actually just duplicate it put it in here so yeah so now when it touches it it will actually die and then um so yeah that's pretty much it so let's try it out so i'm gonna turn on the force field i'm gonna take out this so then you can see clearly and then turn on the force field so i have zero force fields right now so click the p button open the shop so you can continually you can continuously buy force fields it'll keep on going up and up so as you can see so now you can like shield yourself for five seconds and when you restart the force fields will go back to normal i'm just going to buy some more real quick and show you guys one more time so as you can see the force field is pretty good for defending and you can shoot enemies at the same time so yeah uh it's pretty cool the force field so yeah it's pretty cool so thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share subscribe and i'll see you guys in the next video
