00:01 - [Music]
00:08 - hello guys welcome back to kids calling
00:10 - playground once again we will be walking
00:13 - on an easier platform game today I think
00:16 - the ninja one that I started earlier
00:18 - it's a little bit too tough I think
00:21 - maybe if kids doesn't have a good
00:23 - understanding of scratch maybe too
00:25 - difficult so this is a little easier and
00:28 - also I have fixed it the some of the
00:30 - issue with the ninja game I encounter
00:33 - before the ninja getting away kind of
00:35 - stuck in the in the middle of the tiles
00:39 - here on the floor
00:41 - those are above platform so I fixed that
00:45 - a little bit so if you watch this video
00:47 - later you work on the ninja game you can
00:49 - make that changes there okay so today
00:52 - we'll make this a simple scratch
00:54 - platform again so as you can see we have
00:56 - a one treasure hunter guy here we have
01:00 - about three small platform on the top
01:02 - and the bottom platform on the bottom so
01:05 - the point of this game is the discharge
01:07 - of hunter how it jumps around and
01:09 - collect the gym so I don't have any
01:13 - level is only one level so this is just
01:16 - demonstrating of the simple scratch
01:18 - platform again okay alright let's go on
01:22 - to the second page okay so this video
01:26 - this tutorial you can learn about the
01:28 - custom block how to edit the sprite
01:31 - custom sprite a platform editing editing
01:33 - that platform and also you can control
01:37 - the sprite within the central platform
01:39 - learning how to do the control I will
01:41 - need there's a gravity pouring porta the
01:44 - sprite down right and then you cannot
01:46 - kind of hold a sprite back up you know
01:50 - if it touch certain color or the
01:52 - platform also you want to know where to
01:55 - download these sprites and tileset you
01:58 - can go to this URL below I will also
02:01 - have that in my
02:03 - description as well on the on the video
02:06 - alright okay let's get started
02:08 - okay alright let me demo the game once
02:12 - to you guys and then we'll get started
02:14 - okay so let me go to Mac screen okay so
02:21 - you see the this is the treasure hunter
02:25 - guy he can run and laugh and right jump
02:30 - this if you want to slice haha so you
02:47 - can run and slide how about than that
02:53 - it's really simple you just gonna jump
02:56 - around so I just can see if he's tried
03:00 - jungle pushing back down will show you
03:05 - so this is a little bit more smoother
03:08 - than the ninja ones so don't get stuck
03:11 - over there and also as you can see the
03:13 - smallest changes yeah alright so let's
03:20 - get on to the coding scheme gonna start
03:23 - this alright okay so before I begin
03:27 - please like share and subscribe to our
03:30 - channel and if you know anybody who's
03:32 - interested learning scratch you can pass
03:35 - our channel to them greatly appreciate
03:37 - it and if you have any comment or
03:39 - question just know down on the video
03:42 - below the comment below the video
03:44 - okay let's get started so we'll go file
03:47 - new okay so what do we need to do first
03:53 - so first will actually lower sprite into
03:56 - the game we can delete this cat we don't
03:58 - need we can say paint so this is
04:01 - painting the sprite so after you click
04:03 - on this paint sprite you go into here
04:05 - you can upload all your costume so I
04:09 - this is my tile set let me download my
04:12 - character first so this is the cake I'm
04:15 - using so the objector how many about we
04:19 - don't really need all the different
04:20 - sprite for the idol because I find that
04:24 - if we make idle switching costume it
04:26 - it's not that good actually the game
04:28 - doesn't run away well so we'll take the
04:30 - first or take all the jump okay let's do
04:34 - jump here from jump zero to jump nine
04:37 - and then run zero to run nine and sly
04:40 - okay so we take all this was hold the
04:44 - shift key and select and then hold ctrl
04:46 - P just selected the first Idol okay so
04:51 - we click open so as you can see all
04:55 - these are getting loaded so you have
04:57 - Idol you have jump and then you have run
05:02 - and you have slide right so where all
05:05 - the costume okay so the first custom
05:07 - would we did we can delete that okay so
05:10 - we have our guy over here okay so next
05:15 - we can get the platform so uh to make
05:18 - the video shorter I already have my
05:19 - platform but I'll show you guys how you
05:21 - would actually do it
05:22 - so let me go to demo I already created
05:24 - my platform okay Salo okay so how do you
05:31 - do the platform so in the platform the
05:33 - same way so what you do is you can just
05:36 - kind of upload all your platform in here
05:39 - and then you just kind of click on the
05:42 - platform say convert to vector so this
05:44 - is my let's say this B this is a bit nap
05:47 - Rice's connective a convert to vector
05:49 - and then you can use this arrow key
05:51 - selected say ctrl C copy and then you
05:55 - can go to your platform and then you can
05:57 - paste it there and you can just like
05:58 - kind of lined up like this you know
06:00 - however you want to line up your
06:01 - platform right so that's how we did the
06:04 - platform so same thing you will just
06:06 - upload right so you upload the custom
06:09 - and you have to go to the desert tile
06:12 - set go to the PNG go to the tile and
06:15 - just upload all your tile just say click
06:18 - on the first one hold the shift 3 click
06:21 - the last one say upload open so it will
06:23 - upload everything to here and
06:25 - after that you can just say convert to
06:27 - vector and then you can build a platform
06:28 - or you can just make like simple
06:31 - platform like this as well view like
06:33 - right so it doesn't matter so let me
06:35 - just delete that so I'm just so so what
06:39 - do you do is you can just make your
06:40 - platform and then you can resize them
06:42 - right you can say resize bigger and
06:44 - solar so when I say let me do an example
06:47 - for this one let's say for this will
06:49 - let's say we'll take one here right
06:52 - let's say we do one yeah I'm just doing
06:53 - over here let's say I put it here right
06:55 - this isn't one and then let's say I put
06:59 - this guy I copy this I go here control C
07:03 - control V and then this is the second
07:06 - block and this is the third block click
07:09 - here go back here and I can put it here
07:13 - so as you can see I kind of form one
07:16 - platform right you can come look into it
07:19 - a little bit make sure they're all
07:20 - aligned and you can like select them and
07:23 - move this guy out of the way and you can
07:25 - move this down and then what you can do
07:28 - is make sure you have this arrow here
07:29 - select them and you can kind of resize
07:32 - them right so how big you want how small
07:34 - you want so this is how you go the
07:37 - platform okay so you guys kind of get
07:42 - the idea how you would do the platform
07:44 - right okay so let me just trash this
07:48 - just delete this okay so we have the
07:52 - little man here with the platform I'll
07:54 - go back to my first platform this is the
07:56 - one I'm using so you can I move it
07:58 - around make sure you cover all the
08:00 - bigger than outside so that he actually
08:02 - doesn't fall off here so make sure that
08:04 - the platform's a little bit out bigger
08:07 - than the box around here okay
08:10 - all right so we've got the platform out
08:12 - of the way what we can do is we can you
08:15 - can decorate this a little bit later
08:17 - also and also we need to a background
08:20 - ISO habló to go back to the desert tile
08:22 - and there's something called background
08:24 - here background select that say open so
08:28 - this will fill the background in the
08:30 - back so you have the kind of the desert
08:32 - look and feel for the girl thought I
08:34 - came and then so now we have the
08:36 - background and you can add music later
08:39 - on and all that we can do that later but
08:41 - for now let's get the get create some
08:44 - variable and get going okay so what we
08:47 - need to do is we can change this one to
08:49 - rename it to score okay and we'll have
08:55 - to mix them all variable we have our
08:57 - fall speed this is basically detecting
09:01 - how fast the sprite going to fall down
09:05 - and then we are using run costume index
09:11 - this is kind of how I show how the
09:14 - running animation for the photo sprites
09:16 - since they have multiple costume we are
09:18 - going to use the index so if you can see
09:21 - here go back to this sprite you can see
09:26 - here you see jump zero zero three zero
09:28 - zero four so we've kind of run through
09:30 - that either run or jump or whatever
09:32 - right so that's why that's four and then
09:35 - we'll make another variable called Chun
09:39 - costume index this is like the the loop
09:43 - for the index for loop then we can use
09:46 - something like and we can specify it
09:48 - like a speed the jump speed for it as a
09:52 - variable so we can change it later of
09:53 - you when you're moving the game you
09:56 - don't have to like change the code at
09:58 - all for that and you can say run the
10:01 - speed so we're gonna make something so
10:05 - very very simple here so we have a
10:07 - couple of variable the fall speed
10:09 - basically keep track of the sprite
10:11 - falling down with gravity you have the
10:13 - running costume with the jumping costume
10:17 - right okay all right so that's all we
10:22 - have for right now and then we can
10:25 - decorate this costume thing later so
10:28 - let's kind of take out this I mean I can
10:31 - put it here for now maybe you guys yeah
10:33 - we can see this custom house change
10:35 - right okay so we we have and we can add
10:39 - the gym and other stuff so you know
10:43 - want to add the sign you can call the
10:45 - object you can get the sign out right
10:47 - and you can put the sign somewhere here
10:50 - and if you like all right wherever you
10:51 - want to put it and you can change the
10:54 - size maybe 75 right here this is the
10:58 - sign okay all right we have the sign and
11:01 - let's upload the magic Kim
11:03 - so I uploaded form I have a lot of game
11:06 - before and then we can upload some
11:08 - cactus let's take this one
11:10 - okay and let's get another one let's
11:15 - take a tree and we'll take one more at
11:20 - the bush we want the one too much stuff
11:23 - on here but just a couple and then we
11:27 - take one the magic gym that we had I
11:30 - created already from the other game okay
11:33 - so we have kind of order called things
11:36 - that we need it and you can adjust it
11:39 - any way you want
11:40 - make the tree I say smaller all right
11:42 - you can put in 75% you can make the tree
11:45 - smaller the cactus you can put it
11:49 - anywhere you want let's say you want to
11:50 - put the cactus up here or here or
11:53 - whatever you can do that let's put the
11:56 - cactus down here maybe maybe you're like
11:59 - great I don't know right here that looks
12:02 - like he's not blocking right let's put
12:04 - him up here okay so you can make this
12:07 - cactus 75 or 50 or whatever you like and
12:14 - and then this little tree you can put
12:17 - them on top if you like okay so the tree
12:22 - will quote me 50 oh okay maybe 75 will
12:27 - put the tree 75 in 50 a little small
12:30 - okay okay
12:35 - all right try to get it aligned
12:38 - perfectly but I think it's a little bit
12:41 - tough but I think it's good enough okay
12:43 - so we have that we have the gym so what
12:46 - we're going to do is we're gonna make
12:47 - this a little smaller maybe 25% so he is
12:53 - about 25%
12:54 - we're gonna start him somewhere let's
12:56 - say like right here doesn't matter and
12:57 - then we can code it so that's why when
13:00 - he dropped down we kind of stopped him
13:02 - over here
13:02 - okay wait without though it's a South
13:05 - Bush there's our cactus this is our tree
13:08 - and this our scientist our magic Jim and
13:11 - this is our sprite so we have everything
13:13 - okay all right we have all the variable
13:16 - we have the platform now let's work on
13:18 - the treasure hunter so we'll call this
13:20 - guy treasure hunter okay so we have the
13:27 - nice filtration wrong okay so with a
13:33 - treasure hunter so what we want to do is
13:35 - we can define some custom block here so
13:38 - that every time is start in a way we we
13:42 - can call this block I just call it start
13:45 - again but like if you're making a more
13:47 - than one level right you can call this
13:49 - function start again and then we set
13:51 - everything so what we want to do the
13:53 - first thing we want to do it in case the
13:56 - characters hop we want to show so zoom
14:00 - in a little bit
14:02 - say show and then we will switch to the
14:06 - first costume which is the idle right I
14:09 - don't custom by standing and we can say
14:12 - okay go to this position here so ever
14:15 - position we just move this guy here so
14:17 - go with this position here and make sure
14:21 - that we also have to make sure that you
14:23 - have selected list so that he doesn't
14:24 - rotate upside down and you can say at
14:28 - the beginning we want to make him point
14:30 - to ninety basically pointing to the
14:33 - right and also we want to make this guy
14:36 - go to the front layer so that he will
14:40 - not get blocked by either the tree or
14:42 - the cactus or something like that right
14:44 - okay and we will try to initialize some
14:48 - variable in the beginning so let's
14:50 - initialize some variable I will say the
14:53 - run speed so run speed will be 10 T for
14:58 - 10 and then will can't replicate this we
15:02 - can say jum speed let's say 15 like you
15:07 - can put any speed you want and we can we
15:10 - are going to put the for speed this is
15:13 - like when he's dropping down or football
15:15 - speed zero in the beginning okay and
15:19 - then we can set the custom index to zero
15:22 - also in the beginning so that we set it
15:25 - so that run custom index is zero
15:29 - duplicate that we can put in the jump
15:32 - custom index also zero okay all right
15:36 - that's how much we have for now okay so
15:42 - this is our custom block for these start
15:44 - and now let's walk on this next one is
15:47 - these simulating gravity so this is kind
15:50 - of making the the sprite fall keep
15:53 - falling down and making it either when
15:59 - it's falling down I kind of keep him up
16:01 - in the in the in the platform so we will
16:04 - meet that and what we can do is we are
16:07 - going to change first thing we do is
16:10 - that we're gonna change Y basically
16:12 - changing this position of this uh this
16:15 - uh yeah check your hunter by the fall
16:18 - speed so we will actually go into a yeah
16:22 - change the fall speed later but the
16:24 - another loop but uh basically every time
16:27 - this run or change the force bit making
16:29 - it go down okay and then we will say I
16:32 - will put an if condition here so we'll
16:35 - say if okay if the touching the platform
16:41 - so we need an end condition so we want
16:44 - to use a in the way that it can check
16:46 - both the its touching a platform and
16:49 - color because we don't want the other
16:51 - color array or any other thing else that
16:53 - could be on the platform
16:54 - so we'll say if touching oops
17:01 - I think I should do that over here let's
17:03 - jump
17:04 - first if touching the platform and or
17:09 - say touching color so what I'm going to
17:13 - do is I can click on this little dropper
17:15 - here kind of go in here so we're gonna
17:18 - drop this this one this color here okay
17:22 - so it was touching the platform and it's
17:25 - this color okay we are going to do okay
17:34 - so we'll check the fall speed so we'll
17:38 - say we'll use what the uses if an else
17:41 - statement here so this is a little bit
17:43 - different than the ninja platformer I
17:45 - initially did I think this works a
17:47 - little bit better so if you're working
17:50 - on the ninja platform later on after you
17:52 - watch this video you can try to change
17:54 - that to match this okay so we can say
17:59 - put this check here we'll say fall speed
18:03 - you have the fall speed it's greater
18:06 - than zero
18:08 - okay and what we did is we need another
18:13 - loop put a repeat until in here I'll
18:18 - explain what it all means something let
18:20 - me just call this first okay this and
18:26 - say here change Y by minus one so what
18:34 - is this doing is if the fall speed so
18:37 - basically the jump up right we're gonna
18:39 - set the fall speed to there to the jump
18:43 - it to the fall speed so it was a
18:44 - positive number of the fall speed and
18:47 - he's not touching this color we want to
18:51 - make sure that he's going down so and
18:53 - we'll jump up we wanna make sure bring
18:55 - him back down okay that's what this
18:56 - shows mean and we need another one here
19:01 - and this one we are going to put a
19:04 - positive so what happened is if the fall
19:06 - speed is negative basically he's falling
19:08 - down right now he's falling down point
19:12 - up on down become
19:13 - it was not touching this will put a plus
19:16 - one so make sure that he stand back up
19:18 - on here so make sure that when he's uh
19:20 - when he's jumping he either on the top
19:22 - of the platform or below the platform
19:24 - okay that's what this what is called us
19:26 - okay and then at the end we want to set
19:29 - the ball speed back to zero no sigh here
19:33 - okay okay so every time let me add some
19:38 - code and we can actually test this out
19:40 - so okay so we have already defined this
19:46 - to custom block what we're going to do
19:49 - is we're gonna use this custom block
19:51 - when the stop green flag is clicked so
19:53 - what we can do is go back over here in
19:55 - this event we say when the green flag is
20:00 - clicked we are going to call this start
20:03 - again basically that resets everything
20:05 - and we need to have a forever loop here
20:08 - to make this sprite going down and we
20:11 - have to go back to the variable we say
20:14 - change fall speed by minus one basically
20:17 - making this sprite keep on going down
20:19 - okay and then we need another control us
20:25 - the spring trackers click here and we
20:29 - need to have another forever loop here
20:31 - so this will keep on checking the
20:34 - gravity make sure the user the player
20:37 - stay on top or the bottom of the year of
20:40 - that platform okay so if I run this you
20:43 - can see how they player react so you can
20:46 - see the player can't drop down all right
20:48 - let me move him a little bit higher
20:50 - let's say let's say I move this player
20:52 - let me stop this let me move him like
20:54 - maybe here let's see like this right you
20:58 - can kind of see let me just throw this
21:00 - in here throw it here just for testing
21:03 - purposes we have not made the ninja run
21:06 - and jump yet so as you can see you kind
21:09 - of fall down and it stops it stops right
21:13 - so it stops right there because of this
21:15 - KO here this one is touching the
21:17 - platform either going up or down we want
21:22 - to make sure that he is
21:23 - staying on top of the platform so that's
21:25 - what how and then after that after it
21:27 - written through this and when we're
21:31 - touching the platform and then we'll set
21:33 - the false bit to zero then they will not
21:35 - fall anymore right so that's how it is
21:37 - so you can see this fall speed here so
21:39 - let me run this again just pay attention
21:41 - to this number here on top you see it
21:44 - says you know apart from the power from
21:46 - that fall speed right keep on going
21:48 - negative in here and it gets here it's
21:50 - changing back to zero so you know they
21:52 - didn't just not only fall down anymore
21:54 - further so let's stop here for now we'll
21:57 - continue the blacks next lesson to make
21:59 - the ninja kind of running and jumping
22:01 - and sliding and then maybe one more
22:04 - lesson with the collecting the gym and
22:06 - all that ok we'll stop here for now
22:08 - thanks for watching please subscribe
22:10 - like share our video thank you very much
22:13 - bye bye

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome back to kids calling playground once again we will be walking on an easier platform game today I think the ninja one that I started earlier it's a little bit too tough I think maybe if kids doesn't have a good understanding of scratch maybe too difficult so this is a little easier and also I have fixed it the some of the issue with the ninja game I encounter before the ninja getting away kind of stuck in the in the middle of the tiles here on the floor those are above platform so I fixed that a little bit so if you watch this video later you work on the ninja game you can make that changes there okay so today we'll make this a simple scratch platform again so as you can see we have a one treasure hunter guy here we have about three small platform on the top and the bottom platform on the bottom so the point of this game is the discharge of hunter how it jumps around and collect the gym so I don't have any level is only one level so this is just demonstrating of the simple scratch platform again okay alright let's go on to the second page okay so this video this tutorial you can learn about the custom block how to edit the sprite custom sprite a platform editing editing that platform and also you can control the sprite within the central platform learning how to do the control I will need there's a gravity pouring porta the sprite down right and then you cannot kind of hold a sprite back up you know if it touch certain color or the platform also you want to know where to download these sprites and tileset you can go to this URL below I will also have that in my description as well on the on the video alright okay let's get started okay alright let me demo the game once to you guys and then we'll get started okay so let me go to Mac screen okay so you see the this is the treasure hunter guy he can run and laugh and right jump this if you want to slice haha so you can run and slide how about than that it's really simple you just gonna jump around so I just can see if he's tried jungle pushing back down will show you so this is a little bit more smoother than the ninja ones so don't get stuck over there and also as you can see the smallest changes yeah alright so let's get on to the coding scheme gonna start this alright okay so before I begin please like share and subscribe to our channel and if you know anybody who's interested learning scratch you can pass our channel to them greatly appreciate it and if you have any comment or question just know down on the video below the comment below the video okay let's get started so we'll go file new okay so what do we need to do first so first will actually lower sprite into the game we can delete this cat we don't need we can say paint so this is painting the sprite so after you click on this paint sprite you go into here you can upload all your costume so I this is my tile set let me download my character first so this is the cake I'm using so the objector how many about we don't really need all the different sprite for the idol because I find that if we make idle switching costume it it's not that good actually the game doesn't run away well so we'll take the first or take all the jump okay let's do jump here from jump zero to jump nine and then run zero to run nine and sly okay so we take all this was hold the shift key and select and then hold ctrl P just selected the first Idol okay so we click open so as you can see all these are getting loaded so you have Idol you have jump and then you have run and you have slide right so where all the costume okay so the first custom would we did we can delete that okay so we have our guy over here okay so next we can get the platform so uh to make the video shorter I already have my platform but I'll show you guys how you would actually do it so let me go to demo I already created my platform okay Salo okay so how do you do the platform so in the platform the same way so what you do is you can just kind of upload all your platform in here and then you just kind of click on the platform say convert to vector so this is my let's say this B this is a bit nap Rice's connective a convert to vector and then you can use this arrow key selected say ctrl C copy and then you can go to your platform and then you can paste it there and you can just like kind of lined up like this you know however you want to line up your platform right so that's how we did the platform so same thing you will just upload right so you upload the custom and you have to go to the desert tile set go to the PNG go to the tile and just upload all your tile just say click on the first one hold the shift 3 click the last one say upload open so it will upload everything to here and after that you can just say convert to vector and then you can build a platform or you can just make like simple platform like this as well view like right so it doesn't matter so let me just delete that so I'm just so so what do you do is you can just make your platform and then you can resize them right you can say resize bigger and solar so when I say let me do an example for this one let's say for this will let's say we'll take one here right let's say we do one yeah I'm just doing over here let's say I put it here right this isn't one and then let's say I put this guy I copy this I go here control C control V and then this is the second block and this is the third block click here go back here and I can put it here so as you can see I kind of form one platform right you can come look into it a little bit make sure they're all aligned and you can like select them and move this guy out of the way and you can move this down and then what you can do is make sure you have this arrow here select them and you can kind of resize them right so how big you want how small you want so this is how you go the platform okay so you guys kind of get the idea how you would do the platform right okay so let me just trash this just delete this okay so we have the little man here with the platform I'll go back to my first platform this is the one I'm using so you can I move it around make sure you cover all the bigger than outside so that he actually doesn't fall off here so make sure that the platform's a little bit out bigger than the box around here okay all right so we've got the platform out of the way what we can do is we can you can decorate this a little bit later also and also we need to a background ISO habló to go back to the desert tile and there's something called background here background select that say open so this will fill the background in the back so you have the kind of the desert look and feel for the girl thought I came and then so now we have the background and you can add music later on and all that we can do that later but for now let's get the get create some variable and get going okay so what we need to do is we can change this one to rename it to score okay and we'll have to mix them all variable we have our fall speed this is basically detecting how fast the sprite going to fall down and then we are using run costume index this is kind of how I show how the running animation for the photo sprites since they have multiple costume we are going to use the index so if you can see here go back to this sprite you can see here you see jump zero zero three zero zero four so we've kind of run through that either run or jump or whatever right so that's why that's four and then we'll make another variable called Chun costume index this is like the the loop for the index for loop then we can use something like and we can specify it like a speed the jump speed for it as a variable so we can change it later of you when you're moving the game you don't have to like change the code at all for that and you can say run the speed so we're gonna make something so very very simple here so we have a couple of variable the fall speed basically keep track of the sprite falling down with gravity you have the running costume with the jumping costume right okay all right so that's all we have for right now and then we can decorate this costume thing later so let's kind of take out this I mean I can put it here for now maybe you guys yeah we can see this custom house change right okay so we we have and we can add the gym and other stuff so you know want to add the sign you can call the object you can get the sign out right and you can put the sign somewhere here and if you like all right wherever you want to put it and you can change the size maybe 75 right here this is the sign okay all right we have the sign and let's upload the magic Kim so I uploaded form I have a lot of game before and then we can upload some cactus let's take this one okay and let's get another one let's take a tree and we'll take one more at the bush we want the one too much stuff on here but just a couple and then we take one the magic gym that we had I created already from the other game okay so we have kind of order called things that we need it and you can adjust it any way you want make the tree I say smaller all right you can put in 75% you can make the tree smaller the cactus you can put it anywhere you want let's say you want to put the cactus up here or here or whatever you can do that let's put the cactus down here maybe maybe you're like great I don't know right here that looks like he's not blocking right let's put him up here okay so you can make this cactus 75 or 50 or whatever you like and and then this little tree you can put them on top if you like okay so the tree will quote me 50 oh okay maybe 75 will put the tree 75 in 50 a little small okay okay all right try to get it aligned perfectly but I think it's a little bit tough but I think it's good enough okay so we have that we have the gym so what we're going to do is we're gonna make this a little smaller maybe 25% so he is about 25% we're gonna start him somewhere let's say like right here doesn't matter and then we can code it so that's why when he dropped down we kind of stopped him over here okay wait without though it's a South Bush there's our cactus this is our tree and this our scientist our magic Jim and this is our sprite so we have everything okay all right we have all the variable we have the platform now let's work on the treasure hunter so we'll call this guy treasure hunter okay so we have the nice filtration wrong okay so with a treasure hunter so what we want to do is we can define some custom block here so that every time is start in a way we we can call this block I just call it start again but like if you're making a more than one level right you can call this function start again and then we set everything so what we want to do the first thing we want to do it in case the characters hop we want to show so zoom in a little bit say show and then we will switch to the first costume which is the idle right I don't custom by standing and we can say okay go to this position here so ever position we just move this guy here so go with this position here and make sure that we also have to make sure that you have selected list so that he doesn't rotate upside down and you can say at the beginning we want to make him point to ninety basically pointing to the right and also we want to make this guy go to the front layer so that he will not get blocked by either the tree or the cactus or something like that right okay and we will try to initialize some variable in the beginning so let's initialize some variable I will say the run speed so run speed will be 10 T for 10 and then will can't replicate this we can say jum speed let's say 15 like you can put any speed you want and we can we are going to put the for speed this is like when he's dropping down or football speed zero in the beginning okay and then we can set the custom index to zero also in the beginning so that we set it so that run custom index is zero duplicate that we can put in the jump custom index also zero okay all right that's how much we have for now okay so this is our custom block for these start and now let's walk on this next one is these simulating gravity so this is kind of making the the sprite fall keep falling down and making it either when it's falling down I kind of keep him up in the in the in the platform so we will meet that and what we can do is we are going to change first thing we do is that we're gonna change Y basically changing this position of this uh this uh yeah check your hunter by the fall speed so we will actually go into a yeah change the fall speed later but the another loop but uh basically every time this run or change the force bit making it go down okay and then we will say I will put an if condition here so we'll say if okay if the touching the platform so we need an end condition so we want to use a in the way that it can check both the its touching a platform and color because we don't want the other color array or any other thing else that could be on the platform so we'll say if touching oops I think I should do that over here let's jump first if touching the platform and or say touching color so what I'm going to do is I can click on this little dropper here kind of go in here so we're gonna drop this this one this color here okay so it was touching the platform and it's this color okay we are going to do okay so we'll check the fall speed so we'll say we'll use what the uses if an else statement here so this is a little bit different than the ninja platformer I initially did I think this works a little bit better so if you're working on the ninja platform later on after you watch this video you can try to change that to match this okay so we can say put this check here we'll say fall speed you have the fall speed it's greater than zero okay and what we did is we need another loop put a repeat until in here I'll explain what it all means something let me just call this first okay this and say here change Y by minus one so what is this doing is if the fall speed so basically the jump up right we're gonna set the fall speed to there to the jump it to the fall speed so it was a positive number of the fall speed and he's not touching this color we want to make sure that he's going down so and we'll jump up we wanna make sure bring him back down okay that's what this shows mean and we need another one here and this one we are going to put a positive so what happened is if the fall speed is negative basically he's falling down right now he's falling down point up on down become it was not touching this will put a plus one so make sure that he stand back up on here so make sure that when he's uh when he's jumping he either on the top of the platform or below the platform okay that's what this what is called us okay and then at the end we want to set the ball speed back to zero no sigh here okay okay so every time let me add some code and we can actually test this out so okay so we have already defined this to custom block what we're going to do is we're gonna use this custom block when the stop green flag is clicked so what we can do is go back over here in this event we say when the green flag is clicked we are going to call this start again basically that resets everything and we need to have a forever loop here to make this sprite going down and we have to go back to the variable we say change fall speed by minus one basically making this sprite keep on going down okay and then we need another control us the spring trackers click here and we need to have another forever loop here so this will keep on checking the gravity make sure the user the player stay on top or the bottom of the year of that platform okay so if I run this you can see how they player react so you can see the player can't drop down all right let me move him a little bit higher let's say let's say I move this player let me stop this let me move him like maybe here let's see like this right you can kind of see let me just throw this in here throw it here just for testing purposes we have not made the ninja run and jump yet so as you can see you kind of fall down and it stops it stops right so it stops right there because of this KO here this one is touching the platform either going up or down we want to make sure that he is staying on top of the platform so that's what how and then after that after it written through this and when we're touching the platform and then we'll set the false bit to zero then they will not fall anymore right so that's how it is so you can see this fall speed here so let me run this again just pay attention to this number here on top you see it says you know apart from the power from that fall speed right keep on going negative in here and it gets here it's changing back to zero so you know they didn't just not only fall down anymore further so let's stop here for now we'll continue the blacks next lesson to make the ninja kind of running and jumping and sliding and then maybe one more lesson with the collecting the gym and all that ok we'll stop here for now thanks for watching please subscribe like share our video thank you very much bye bye
