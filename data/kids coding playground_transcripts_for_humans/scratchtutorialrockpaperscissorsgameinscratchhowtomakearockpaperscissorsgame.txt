00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - hello and welcome back to
00:08 - kids coding playground and today we will
00:10 - be doing another tutorial in scratch
00:13 - so today we'll be making a rock paper
00:15 - scissors game
00:16 - inside scratch so first i'm gonna show
00:19 - you how
00:19 - the game works so let's go full screen
00:22 - so the player can select either the
00:24 - paper
00:25 - rock or scissors rock paper scissors
00:28 - to say select rock um
00:31 - as you can see it said player wins
00:33 - because rock beats scissors and
00:34 - see if i paper i win again computer pick
00:37 - rock
00:38 - when i get scissors i win again because
00:40 - the computer uh
00:41 - played a paper so it's like a simple
00:44 - rock paper scissors yeah and if they
00:45 - both pick the same thing it's a tie
00:48 - and computer wins because they picked
00:50 - paper and i picked rock
00:51 - so yeah it's a simple rock paper
00:53 - scissors game it's like the one where i
00:54 - do a python tutorial on
00:56 - rock paper scissors it's like the same
00:58 - thing so
01:00 - all right so let's get started by
01:02 - creating a new account so
01:04 - i'm new new project so it's a new
01:06 - project we're gonna name it
01:07 - rock paper scissors game
01:11 - that's good okay let's delete the
01:12 - scratch cat let's import some sprites
01:15 - first i have the let me put this one
01:18 - first
01:18 - so this is a player and this is the um
01:20 - enemy uh computer
01:23 - so inside i have three costumes of rock
01:25 - costume
01:26 - paper costume and scissors same the
01:28 - computer i have the rock costume papers
01:30 - costume and the scissors costume so we
01:32 - will put these into google drive so you
01:34 - guys can download them
01:35 - i just got these images from online
01:38 - so yeah and then we also have the
01:41 - um button where you click the rock the
01:44 - paper button
01:45 - and the scissors button and also we have
01:49 - the result button
01:53 - yeah so this is just like the computer
01:56 - wins or the player wins
01:57 - thing and then finally we have a
01:59 - backdrop to put in here
02:03 - like that so the backdrop kind of looks
02:04 - like this we actually got this
02:06 - backdrop from like some other old
02:08 - scratch project
02:09 - i don't know what it's called but like i
02:11 - got this from somewhere
02:12 - all right so inside the player we are
02:14 - going to start coding
02:16 - actually now let's start coding in the
02:17 - backdrop so inside the backdrop
02:19 - we're going to code like all the results
02:22 - and all that stuff
02:23 - so first we're going to start off by
02:26 - making a new custom block we're going to
02:28 - name the
02:29 - custom block called check results
02:32 - so we're going to make a custom block
02:34 - called check result
02:36 - all right after we have created the
02:40 - custom block check results we will get
02:42 - back to that later first we will have to
02:43 - go to the buttons
02:44 - so in the button we are going to uh make
02:47 - a variable
02:48 - in the
02:52 - variable called choice one which is the
02:55 - choice for the player
02:57 - and inside the rock i'm just going to
02:58 - make it go to whatever this position is
03:02 - so there's a group like let's go to
03:03 - whatever negative 175 y 80 and we're
03:06 - going to show
03:09 - and when we click on the sprite
03:14 - we're going to set this choice 1 to rock
03:17 - so the player click picks brock we're
03:20 - gonna broadcast a message
03:21 - and we're gonna name it start game
03:27 - start game alright now let's go to the
03:28 - paper button
03:31 - inside the paper button we're also going
03:33 - to make it go to whatever this position
03:35 - is one green one clicked
03:37 - go to negative 109.80
03:40 - and we're going to show
03:45 - when this sprite is clicked we're going
03:48 - to
03:49 - set the choice one variable
03:52 - to paper
03:56 - and then we're gonna broadcast start
03:58 - after
03:59 - start game after you uh click this all
04:01 - right so
04:02 - and then finally we have the scissors
04:04 - which is also the same thing
04:05 - the button scissors we're going to get
04:07 - it when green fly clicks
04:09 - go to whatever this position is negative
04:11 - 45 y80
04:13 - and we're going to show
04:16 - and whenever when the sprite is clicked
04:20 - we're going to set the variable choice 1
04:23 - to scissors
04:26 - scissors and we're going to broadcast
04:29 - the message
04:29 - start start game so basically these
04:33 - sprites are basically the small mini
04:34 - version of these
04:35 - and we just drew a black uh box
04:39 - that covers it all right
04:42 - now let's go to the backdrop so inside
04:44 - the backdrop we are going to
04:46 - when i receive the start game bro
04:48 - broadcast message
04:50 - we are going to broadcast we have to
04:53 - broadcast and wait actually so then
04:55 - wait for the action to finish so we're
04:57 - gonna broadcast
04:58 - new game new game
05:02 - and we're going to uh broadcast
05:05 - and wait show result
05:10 - show result this is these uh broadcasts
05:12 - are for later but i will just
05:14 - uh put them right now and after that
05:17 - after showing the result we want to
05:18 - broadcast
05:19 - game over so obviously it does not do
05:22 - anything yet because we have not
05:23 - broadcasted the message
05:24 - so now we're going to work on the custom
05:26 - block so we're going to define whatever
05:27 - this custom block
05:28 - means so now we are going to
05:32 - um make the custom block define the
05:35 - check
05:36 - result so before we begin coding we're
05:38 - going to make a few variables
05:39 - so we're going to do choice 2 and choice
05:42 - 2 is the
05:43 - computer um like the
05:46 - your opponent the computer we're also
05:48 - going to make
05:49 - another variable called winners so you
05:51 - know who's going to win
05:53 - all right and we're going to get if
05:54 - elsington first so
05:57 - in this define we're going to get if the
05:59 - choice 1 is equal to choice 2
06:01 - meaning the if the player is equal to
06:03 - the
06:04 - computer so if they're both equal then
06:06 - that means it would be a tie right so
06:08 - we're going to set the variable winner
06:10 - to time
06:13 - and then um next we're going to get
06:15 - another if else
06:16 - statement so if else
06:19 - inside here so if choice one is equal to
06:22 - rock so
06:24 - let's say the player chooses rock so the
06:26 - player doesn't change you have to
06:27 - remember that
06:28 - so the players uses rock and then we're
06:31 - gonna get another if l statement put it
06:33 - right here
06:34 - and if the um computer chooses paper
06:38 - which is choice 2 paper
06:43 - then we're going to set the winner to
06:45 - computer because paper beats rock so
06:47 - we're going to set choice 2
06:48 - i mean winner wrong variables
06:52 - winner we're going to set winner to
06:54 - computer
06:57 - and next we will get and just duplicate
07:00 - this we're going to set else
07:02 - we're going to set it to player so the
07:04 - player will win because
07:05 - the computer will pick scissors and the
07:07 - player is rock
07:09 - all right and then we're just going to
07:11 - duplicate this
07:13 - right here put this in the else
07:17 - um just take this out so if
07:21 - choice one we're gonna need if else
07:23 - another if else in here so
07:25 - we can just remove that for now so if
07:27 - the choice one
07:28 - player is equal to paper get another if
07:31 - else
07:33 - and if the choice two
07:36 - let's duplicate this choice two is equal
07:39 - to
07:40 - oops choice two is equal to
07:43 - scissors well scissors
07:46 - beats paper and player uses paper and
07:49 - the computer chooses scissors
07:50 - so we're going to set the winner to
07:52 - computer
07:54 - set the winner to computer
07:58 - else right here we're going to set the
08:00 - winner to player
08:04 - player because the player will win
08:06 - because the computer picks rock
08:08 - and the player has chosen paper all
08:12 - right
08:13 - and then one last if else condition
08:15 - right here
08:16 - inside here we're going to get an if
08:18 - else statement so
08:20 - right here we're gonna get if else if
08:23 - this thing is equal to rock choice 2 is
08:26 - equal to rock
08:29 - rock so if the computer chooses rock
08:32 - then we will set the winner to
08:38 - computer
08:40 - because the player would have chosen
08:42 - scissors and we don't need to check
08:44 - like this if else condition on top
08:47 - because the player will pick scissors
08:51 - and then else we're going to set the
08:53 - winner
08:55 - to the player because the computer would
08:57 - have picked
08:58 - uh paper and the player would have
09:01 - chosen scissors
09:03 - so right this thing is basically the
09:05 - same thing as
09:06 - this thing but this isn't necessary
09:11 - so you can also do this if you want
09:16 - that is basically the same thing but
09:19 - we don't need to check the condition
09:20 - because the player will have picked
09:22 - scissors all right and after we're done
09:25 - defining this thing
09:27 - the check results we are going to go to
09:30 - my blocks
09:31 - and put this right there all right
09:34 - all right now let's go to the computer
09:38 - we're gonna start coding on the computer
09:40 - first
09:41 - so right here we broadcast a new game
09:43 - right so inside the computer we're going
09:45 - to receive a message
09:46 - when i receive new game
09:51 - new game let's zoom in then we're going
09:54 - to
09:54 - repeat five times
09:58 - next costume so when a new game starts
10:02 - like when the player chooses something
10:03 - we're going to like make it change
10:05 - costumes a little bit so
10:07 - it'll look a little bit cooler i guess i
10:11 - guess i don't know
10:12 - and we're going to set we're going to
10:14 - make a list actually so this we're going
10:16 - to make a list called computer
10:18 - choice so this is like a list for
10:21 - whatever the computer chooses
10:22 - so first we're gonna set the variable uh
10:25 - choice two
10:26 - um and we have to do one green five
10:30 - clicks
10:30 - first we have to code the list and then
10:32 - we can work on this one
10:34 - so first we're gonna have to delete
10:35 - everything of the list
10:37 - delete all of computer choice and we're
10:39 - gonna add
10:40 - three things we're gonna add rock paper
10:44 - and scissors so we're going to add these
10:46 - three things to the list
10:50 - scissor
10:53 - spell it wrong seriously
10:56 - and then we're going to get the item
10:59 - thing item
11:00 - one of computer choice we're going to uh
11:04 - set the choice to pick random
11:05 - one to three item of the
11:09 - computer choice like that
11:12 - now okay if else statement if
11:16 - if uh the choice two is equal to rock
11:20 - so let's say the computer picks rock
11:24 - if choice two is equal to rock then we
11:26 - will switch the costume to rock
11:29 - which is obviously the rock costume
11:34 - and then we can just duplicate this if l
11:36 - statement
11:38 - they're not common oops duplicate uh put
11:41 - that in here and the else
11:43 - and if choice two is equal to paper and
11:46 - the else
11:47 - then we're gonna search costing the
11:48 - paper else we're gonna switch it to
11:49 - scissors
11:52 - like that so yeah
11:55 - so this is just switching the costume
11:57 - okay now let's go to the player
11:58 - the player sprite we're gonna when i
12:00 - receive new game
12:03 - okay let's zoom in hello understand new
12:06 - game we are going to
12:08 - we can honestly just like drag and drop
12:10 - this into here just change a few things
12:12 - up
12:13 - obviously we are taking this out we can
12:16 - keep all this
12:17 - instead we're going to do choice one and
12:20 - choice one right here with new rock
12:23 - paper
12:24 - and scissors so yeah obviously you'll
12:27 - switch to the corresponding uh
12:28 - costumes like that
12:32 - all right the player was pretty simple
12:33 - now let's go back to the buttons
12:35 - we'll have to code a little bit more in
12:36 - here so it's just really simple when i
12:39 - receive
12:40 - new game we're going to hide
12:44 - hide and when i receive
12:47 - game over we're also going to hide just
12:50 - drag and drop this
12:50 - for each one like that
12:58 - all right we're not quite done yet
13:01 - because we have
13:02 - it's also the result code that one's
13:04 - pretty simple honestly um let's go to
13:06 - the results
13:07 - this thing so inside the result we will
13:10 - be
13:10 - uh when green fly clicks for us we have
13:12 - to like set the position now
13:15 - whatever this position is we're gonna
13:18 - hide
13:20 - and when i receive new game
13:25 - new game we are going to hide
13:28 - and when i receive game over just
13:30 - duplicate this let's
13:32 - receive game over we're also going to
13:34 - hide
13:36 - and then when i receive show result
13:41 - we're going to show
13:44 - so basically in the backdrop um
13:47 - we broadcast show results so like once
13:51 - the player and computer are done then it
13:53 - will show the results
13:55 - of who wins so right here we have two
13:57 - costumes
13:58 - i mean three costumes we have player
13:59 - wins computer wins and a tie
14:02 - and three costumes we're gonna show it
14:05 - and we're gonna do if else if
14:09 - the winner is equal to the
14:12 - tie so if they both tie
14:15 - we winner is equal to time
14:19 - then we are going to switch costume to
14:22 - the thai costume
14:24 - duplicate this if the winner is
14:27 - um player switch costume to player wins
14:33 - else is going to switch the costume to
14:34 - computer wins
14:36 - all right and then right here we're just
14:38 - going to make it look better by
14:40 - changing some graphic effects so we're
14:41 - going to
14:43 - uh bro repeat two times uh and then
14:46 - we're going to
14:47 - set the color effect to 50
14:50 - just make it turn purple that means turn
14:52 - purple i'm gonna wait
14:54 - 0.25 seconds and clear
14:58 - graphic effects and now we're going to
15:00 - wait another
15:01 - 0.25 seconds so boom like that
15:05 - all right so now let's save the project
15:08 - let's run the game so let's go full
15:10 - screen as you can see
15:12 - i lost because i had rock and the
15:14 - computer had
15:16 - the uh paper and one thing we could do
15:21 - is let's go back to the button inside
15:24 - the button
15:24 - right here this actually is supposed to
15:26 - be show sorry about that
15:27 - so then you can continuously play you
15:30 - don't have to stop like you don't even
15:31 - clicking the green flag
15:33 - to restart so you have to actually you
15:35 - can actually put show if you would like
15:37 - right here if you don't want the game to
15:38 - stop so you can put show
15:40 - like that all right
15:44 - the results pretty sure you also put
15:47 - show no you don't
15:48 - need i don't think you do so let's save
15:51 - it again
15:52 - let's try it again so all right
15:55 - as you can see i won as you can see you
15:57 - don't have to keep on clicking the green
15:58 - flag
15:58 - to get these things come back again so
16:01 - it's pretty good
16:02 - i win again hi
16:05 - uh computer wins so yeah
16:08 - it's pretty cool pretty simple rock
16:11 - paper scissors game on scratch
16:14 - um well thank you guys for watching and
16:16 - don't forget to leave a like and
16:18 - subscribe if you enjoyed this video
16:20 - and if you would like to check out our
16:22 - rock paper scissors game in python
16:24 - you're more than welcome to check it out
16:26 - and i'll see you guys next time thank
16:28 - you guys for watching

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome back to kids coding playground and today we will be doing another tutorial in scratch so today we'll be making a rock paper scissors game inside scratch so first i'm gonna show you how the game works so let's go full screen so the player can select either the paper rock or scissors rock paper scissors to say select rock um as you can see it said player wins because rock beats scissors and see if i paper i win again computer pick rock when i get scissors i win again because the computer uh played a paper so it's like a simple rock paper scissors yeah and if they both pick the same thing it's a tie and computer wins because they picked paper and i picked rock so yeah it's a simple rock paper scissors game it's like the one where i do a python tutorial on rock paper scissors it's like the same thing so all right so let's get started by creating a new account so i'm new new project so it's a new project we're gonna name it rock paper scissors game that's good okay let's delete the scratch cat let's import some sprites first i have the let me put this one first so this is a player and this is the um enemy uh computer so inside i have three costumes of rock costume paper costume and scissors same the computer i have the rock costume papers costume and the scissors costume so we will put these into google drive so you guys can download them i just got these images from online so yeah and then we also have the um button where you click the rock the paper button and the scissors button and also we have the result button yeah so this is just like the computer wins or the player wins thing and then finally we have a backdrop to put in here like that so the backdrop kind of looks like this we actually got this backdrop from like some other old scratch project i don't know what it's called but like i got this from somewhere all right so inside the player we are going to start coding actually now let's start coding in the backdrop so inside the backdrop we're going to code like all the results and all that stuff so first we're going to start off by making a new custom block we're going to name the custom block called check results so we're going to make a custom block called check result all right after we have created the custom block check results we will get back to that later first we will have to go to the buttons so in the button we are going to uh make a variable in the variable called choice one which is the choice for the player and inside the rock i'm just going to make it go to whatever this position is so there's a group like let's go to whatever negative 175 y 80 and we're going to show and when we click on the sprite we're going to set this choice 1 to rock so the player click picks brock we're gonna broadcast a message and we're gonna name it start game start game alright now let's go to the paper button inside the paper button we're also going to make it go to whatever this position is one green one clicked go to negative 109.80 and we're going to show when this sprite is clicked we're going to set the choice one variable to paper and then we're gonna broadcast start after start game after you uh click this all right so and then finally we have the scissors which is also the same thing the button scissors we're going to get it when green fly clicks go to whatever this position is negative 45 y80 and we're going to show and whenever when the sprite is clicked we're going to set the variable choice 1 to scissors scissors and we're going to broadcast the message start start game so basically these sprites are basically the small mini version of these and we just drew a black uh box that covers it all right now let's go to the backdrop so inside the backdrop we are going to when i receive the start game bro broadcast message we are going to broadcast we have to broadcast and wait actually so then wait for the action to finish so we're gonna broadcast new game new game and we're going to uh broadcast and wait show result show result this is these uh broadcasts are for later but i will just uh put them right now and after that after showing the result we want to broadcast game over so obviously it does not do anything yet because we have not broadcasted the message so now we're going to work on the custom block so we're going to define whatever this custom block means so now we are going to um make the custom block define the check result so before we begin coding we're going to make a few variables so we're going to do choice 2 and choice 2 is the computer um like the your opponent the computer we're also going to make another variable called winners so you know who's going to win all right and we're going to get if elsington first so in this define we're going to get if the choice 1 is equal to choice 2 meaning the if the player is equal to the computer so if they're both equal then that means it would be a tie right so we're going to set the variable winner to time and then um next we're going to get another if else statement so if else inside here so if choice one is equal to rock so let's say the player chooses rock so the player doesn't change you have to remember that so the players uses rock and then we're gonna get another if l statement put it right here and if the um computer chooses paper which is choice 2 paper then we're going to set the winner to computer because paper beats rock so we're going to set choice 2 i mean winner wrong variables winner we're going to set winner to computer and next we will get and just duplicate this we're going to set else we're going to set it to player so the player will win because the computer will pick scissors and the player is rock all right and then we're just going to duplicate this right here put this in the else um just take this out so if choice one we're gonna need if else another if else in here so we can just remove that for now so if the choice one player is equal to paper get another if else and if the choice two let's duplicate this choice two is equal to oops choice two is equal to scissors well scissors beats paper and player uses paper and the computer chooses scissors so we're going to set the winner to computer set the winner to computer else right here we're going to set the winner to player player because the player will win because the computer picks rock and the player has chosen paper all right and then one last if else condition right here inside here we're going to get an if else statement so right here we're gonna get if else if this thing is equal to rock choice 2 is equal to rock rock so if the computer chooses rock then we will set the winner to computer because the player would have chosen scissors and we don't need to check like this if else condition on top because the player will pick scissors and then else we're going to set the winner to the player because the computer would have picked uh paper and the player would have chosen scissors so right this thing is basically the same thing as this thing but this isn't necessary so you can also do this if you want that is basically the same thing but we don't need to check the condition because the player will have picked scissors all right and after we're done defining this thing the check results we are going to go to my blocks and put this right there all right all right now let's go to the computer we're gonna start coding on the computer first so right here we broadcast a new game right so inside the computer we're going to receive a message when i receive new game new game let's zoom in then we're going to repeat five times next costume so when a new game starts like when the player chooses something we're going to like make it change costumes a little bit so it'll look a little bit cooler i guess i guess i don't know and we're going to set we're going to make a list actually so this we're going to make a list called computer choice so this is like a list for whatever the computer chooses so first we're gonna set the variable uh choice two um and we have to do one green five clicks first we have to code the list and then we can work on this one so first we're gonna have to delete everything of the list delete all of computer choice and we're gonna add three things we're gonna add rock paper and scissors so we're going to add these three things to the list scissor spell it wrong seriously and then we're going to get the item thing item one of computer choice we're going to uh set the choice to pick random one to three item of the computer choice like that now okay if else statement if if uh the choice two is equal to rock so let's say the computer picks rock if choice two is equal to rock then we will switch the costume to rock which is obviously the rock costume and then we can just duplicate this if l statement they're not common oops duplicate uh put that in here and the else and if choice two is equal to paper and the else then we're gonna search costing the paper else we're gonna switch it to scissors like that so yeah so this is just switching the costume okay now let's go to the player the player sprite we're gonna when i receive new game okay let's zoom in hello understand new game we are going to we can honestly just like drag and drop this into here just change a few things up obviously we are taking this out we can keep all this instead we're going to do choice one and choice one right here with new rock paper and scissors so yeah obviously you'll switch to the corresponding uh costumes like that all right the player was pretty simple now let's go back to the buttons we'll have to code a little bit more in here so it's just really simple when i receive new game we're going to hide hide and when i receive game over we're also going to hide just drag and drop this for each one like that all right we're not quite done yet because we have it's also the result code that one's pretty simple honestly um let's go to the results this thing so inside the result we will be uh when green fly clicks for us we have to like set the position now whatever this position is we're gonna hide and when i receive new game new game we are going to hide and when i receive game over just duplicate this let's receive game over we're also going to hide and then when i receive show result we're going to show so basically in the backdrop um we broadcast show results so like once the player and computer are done then it will show the results of who wins so right here we have two costumes i mean three costumes we have player wins computer wins and a tie and three costumes we're gonna show it and we're gonna do if else if the winner is equal to the tie so if they both tie we winner is equal to time then we are going to switch costume to the thai costume duplicate this if the winner is um player switch costume to player wins else is going to switch the costume to computer wins all right and then right here we're just going to make it look better by changing some graphic effects so we're going to uh bro repeat two times uh and then we're going to set the color effect to 50 just make it turn purple that means turn purple i'm gonna wait 0.25 seconds and clear graphic effects and now we're going to wait another 0.25 seconds so boom like that all right so now let's save the project let's run the game so let's go full screen as you can see i lost because i had rock and the computer had the uh paper and one thing we could do is let's go back to the button inside the button right here this actually is supposed to be show sorry about that so then you can continuously play you don't have to stop like you don't even clicking the green flag to restart so you have to actually you can actually put show if you would like right here if you don't want the game to stop so you can put show like that all right the results pretty sure you also put show no you don't need i don't think you do so let's save it again let's try it again so all right as you can see i won as you can see you don't have to keep on clicking the green flag to get these things come back again so it's pretty good i win again hi uh computer wins so yeah it's pretty cool pretty simple rock paper scissors game on scratch um well thank you guys for watching and don't forget to leave a like and
