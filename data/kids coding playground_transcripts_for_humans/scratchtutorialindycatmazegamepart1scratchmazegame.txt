00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:09 - kids coding playground today we'll be
00:11 - making an Indiana cat 2 game it's kind
00:13 - of like Indiana Jones
00:14 - so you objective of the game is to get
00:17 - the gem which is right here and avoid
00:20 - all these traps and gets the exit which
00:23 - is right here
00:24 - you can find this game idea and a book
00:26 - called super Scratch programming
00:27 - adventures for more information check
00:30 - this link right here and we'll provide a
00:34 - link to our Google Drive in the
00:36 - description below on downloading these
00:39 - sprites and will be learned today we'll
00:43 - be learning these following concepts and
00:44 - scratch broadcasting messages custom
00:47 - blocks using operators touching colors
00:51 - using a list in your variables so I'll
00:55 - show you guys how the game works
00:57 - I took up I took out the Indiana Jones
01:02 - music because because YouTube can claim
01:06 - her video if we play copyrighted music
01:09 - so I've just decided to take a sound
01:11 - from the library so when you start and
01:17 - types out to say then churches and you
01:22 - can use arrow keys
01:24 - to move around when you get hit until it
01:27 - we're gonna sleep out and same yeah make
01:30 - a mess out so just try to get past all
01:33 - these traps because you can see if you
01:40 - get the key right here gets not a
01:42 - keyhole open then you can get them then
01:46 - you can get the gem and go to the exit
01:49 - OOP here avoid the spike and all these
02:02 - traps are sort of moving and I'll say
02:15 - you won it took you how many seconds and
02:18 - it took you how many attempts so let's
02:21 - go make a new - new project so first we
02:29 - need to get all our spread set up you
02:32 - still like the scratch pad I already
02:33 - have everything all the sprites in the
02:37 - backpack you can just load the sprites
02:40 - into here to load the Indiana I can load
02:45 - the gate just drag them into here
03:02 - so now we have everything set up so this
03:06 - is the layout you can just put all this
03:12 - and I forgot the keyhole yeah so now we
03:17 - have everything set up so let's go to
03:20 - the code for the cat the movement so
03:24 - first we'll be working on the movement
03:25 - and also since we put all these stuff in
03:29 - her backpack it's all in the right
03:31 - position so if it's not like this
03:33 - Dragons the right position like this you
03:36 - can do it any way you want of course but
03:38 - we're gonna do it like this and the Indy
03:42 - cat should be 90 size and the whiptail
03:45 - this thing should be 40 size I scaled it
03:48 - correctly that's the best size for them
03:51 - so let's go for the movement for the cat
03:56 - first so for the setup we'll need to
03:58 - make a couple variables so let's get our
04:03 - three variables we do not need the my
04:05 - variable just delete it make a new
04:07 - variable called attempts attempts so
04:15 - this is supposed to count how many
04:17 - attempts it takes it takes for you at
04:20 - the end make a new variable a letter
04:24 - letter that's the that's for so you know
04:29 - how when in the beginning it will type
04:31 - out the word we'll need that for the
04:33 - type text thing and we'll need make a
04:37 - new finally one more variable called
04:39 - timer and the timer supposed to be at
04:42 - the end I'll tell you how fast you
04:44 - completed the game in so and then we'll
04:47 - need one list called words this is for
04:49 - the type text again we'll get on to that
04:52 - later
04:53 - so now I have the variables we can
04:56 - actually start on the cat so I'm going
05:01 - to start on the movement of the cat so
05:04 - when clicked we have to set the attempts
05:08 - to one cuz at the end it'll show us one
05:12 - attempt so just set the attempts of one
05:13 - in the beginning
05:15 - hide the variable attempts hide all the
05:17 - variables in the beginning hide variable
05:19 - timer and set the timer to zero in the
05:23 - beginning so let's start on zero we can
05:29 - show these for now so I can show you how
05:31 - these variables work right now so next
05:36 - we want to set the size from the cat to
05:38 - 90% so hiding the variable is the same
05:43 - as unchecking them so you can either
05:45 - uncheck them in the beginning or
05:47 - anything - or you can use the hide fear
05:50 - pool
05:51 - so easy to uncheck or use hide variable
05:54 - so we want to set the size to 90 again
05:59 - set the size to 90 in the beginning I
06:01 - already know I know I already said it's
06:03 - a 90 but if you haven't then you can
06:05 - just put this block right there we want
06:08 - it to go to like somewhere right here I
06:12 - already set the coordinates for it
06:16 - so I've got negative 295 205 native 205
06:23 - and 150 that those are my coordinates I
06:25 - got it last time and forever loop and
06:31 - this is a movement like um arrow keys
06:36 - WASD so if then if the left arrow key he
06:44 - he left key opt or W the key up arrow or
06:50 - W is pressed
06:53 - that means if either one of these are
06:55 - oops X if either one of these keys are
06:59 - pressed then it will go up so if so
07:03 - we'll change the Y by three so we'll go
07:05 - up huge y by three and if then touching
07:13 - the color want to if then steam it in
07:16 - here if then touching the color of the
07:21 - edge like this thing the edge
07:26 - just select the edge of it that yeah it
07:30 - is touching that color which is 10 color
07:33 - 100 saturation and 95 brightness then it
07:37 - will change the Y by negative 3 so go
07:42 - back so you can't go through the wall so
07:51 - now let's work on the other arrow keys
07:55 - so you can just duplicate this put it
07:58 - right here if then let's say down arrow
08:02 - or s arrow s key is pressed then we'll
08:08 - change the Y by negative 3 mm and oh and
08:14 - if touching that color then I'll change
08:16 - the Y by 3 so you will always want it to
08:18 - be the opposite of it so go back and
08:20 - we'll go through the wall so you can
08:22 - just duplicate this typically both of
08:25 - them so put her here so if the now if
08:31 - the right arrow is press that or the D
08:37 - or D is press then we can change instead
08:42 - of Y with these X because we're going
08:44 - side to side
08:45 - so change the X by three-point direction
08:55 - of 90 so face the right side and you can
09:03 - just move take this out put the change X
09:07 - by negative 3 in here if it's touching
09:11 - the color so now we have this right
09:16 - arrow now let's work on the left arrow
09:20 - left arrow just pretty much the opposite
09:24 - of it it's pretty much the opposite of
09:26 - this thing duplicate left arrow left
09:31 - arrow key or a is press ok then we can
09:35 - change the X or negative 3
09:38 - pointing direction of negative 90 so
09:41 - we'll face the left side negative 90 and
09:45 - change X by three opposite so I won't
09:48 - come through the wall so now we have all
09:52 - this for the movement so now I can move
09:57 - left and right up and down you can use
09:59 - the WASD and it can't and when it
10:03 - touches the color it will not go through
10:06 - you can see it will go through the walls
10:10 - you just hide the letter they're gonna
10:12 - look so now let's see it won't go
10:16 - through so that's the movement and let's
10:26 - add we can do the type text thing today
10:29 - so we need to make a new block so today
10:34 - we'll just cover the cat movement and
10:36 - the text type a thing so we can name
10:41 - this type birds type words add two
10:46 - inputs one is one is gonna be told text
10:52 - one is called text and one is called
10:54 - type so two two inputs so you click OK
11:08 - so you have this so in the beginning you
11:11 - want to set the letter to one so you got
11:13 - one letter letter to one and delete all
11:20 - of words sort of delete the word list in
11:22 - the beginning so you want to get the
11:26 - repeat repeat the Len length of text
11:34 - this means they'll repeat however long
11:38 - the text you write is so if you write if
11:42 - you write like hi it's - its - so repeat
11:47 - two times so you will change so
11:51 - we'll add you need to go to variables
11:54 - add add letter it will add letter letter
12:05 - letter the variable put it into here of
12:10 - the text so add the letter you input to
12:16 - the text to the word list so you want to
12:19 - change the letter by one every time
12:22 - every time you write a new new letter so
12:28 - you change it by one you can take an
12:30 - if-else statement take it if then I'll
12:33 - stating it put it under here
12:35 - so if type is equal to say which means
12:42 - if the type is equal to same not not
12:45 - thinking so there's two types there's
12:47 - thinking and say if the type this thing
12:51 - is equal to say then I'll say say the
12:55 - words say or say okay say words you'll
13:05 - say the words in the word list you put
13:07 - in and else if it's not if the type is
13:11 - not equal to say if it's not true then
13:14 - I'll think the words so next you can do
13:22 - under here you can do a weight 0.1
13:25 - seconds just to make it a little slower
13:28 - so people can read it there for 1
13:32 - seconds wait one second down here and
13:35 - clear
13:36 - clear the words say so what you want to
13:40 - do right here is just clear and then we
13:46 - need to add something else let me zoom
13:48 - in so you guys can see you can stop
13:50 - you're done then we could take a few
13:54 - clicks forever
13:58 - set timer set the variable timer
14:03 - to the sensing timer so the timer will
14:07 - keep on going up second-by-second mm-hmm
14:11 - and in the beginning in the beginning we
14:14 - can um take the type text type words put
14:18 - it right here put the instructions like
14:21 - go get the Chan and escape like that and
14:32 - think so I put think right here so we'll
14:37 - think it not saying so so right here it
14:40 - says if type is equal to say then I'll
14:43 - say it else they'll think so if this is
14:45 - not say then I'll think it so if you put
14:48 - anything right here it will still think
14:50 - so let's play it I'll think she's
14:54 - thinking and say go get the gem and
14:56 - escape and type it up and the movements
14:59 - don't works and if you show the variable
15:05 - timer it's actually going up right here
15:09 - see so we'll actually stop right here so
15:15 - right now we have the movement the type
15:17 - text words and the timer done so
15:20 - tomorrow in the next video we will work
15:24 - on the UM work on the like the other
15:27 - deep the traps will work on the traps
15:31 - and the walk and the keys next time so
15:36 - I'll see you guys in the next video
15:37 - thanks to you guys for watching and
15:39 - please like share and subscribe to our
15:42 - Channel and I'll see you guys next time
15:45 - thank you for watching

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today we'll be making an Indiana cat 2 game it's kind of like Indiana Jones so you objective of the game is to get the gem which is right here and avoid all these traps and gets the exit which is right here you can find this game idea and a book called super Scratch programming adventures for more information check this link right here and we'll provide a link to our Google Drive in the description below on downloading these sprites and will be learned today we'll be learning these following concepts and scratch broadcasting messages custom blocks using operators touching colors using a list in your variables so I'll show you guys how the game works I took up I took out the Indiana Jones music because because YouTube can claim her video if we play copyrighted music so I've just decided to take a sound from the library so when you start and types out to say then churches and you can use arrow keys to move around when you get hit until it we're gonna sleep out and same yeah make a mess out so just try to get past all these traps because you can see if you get the key right here gets not a keyhole open then you can get them then you can get the gem and go to the exit OOP here avoid the spike and all these traps are sort of moving and I'll say you won it took you how many seconds and it took you how many attempts so let's go make a new new project so first we need to get all our spread set up you still like the scratch pad I already have everything all the sprites in the backpack you can just load the sprites into here to load the Indiana I can load the gate just drag them into here so now we have everything set up so this is the layout you can just put all this and I forgot the keyhole yeah so now we have everything set up so let's go to the code for the cat the movement so first we'll be working on the movement and also since we put all these stuff in her backpack it's all in the right position so if it's not like this Dragons the right position like this you can do it any way you want of course but we're gonna do it like this and the Indy cat should be 90 size and the whiptail this thing should be 40 size I scaled it correctly that's the best size for them so let's go for the movement for the cat first so for the setup we'll need to make a couple variables so let's get our three variables we do not need the my variable just delete it make a new variable called attempts attempts so this is supposed to count how many attempts it takes it takes for you at the end make a new variable a letter letter that's the that's for so you know how when in the beginning it will type out the word we'll need that for the type text thing and we'll need make a new finally one more variable called timer and the timer supposed to be at the end I'll tell you how fast you completed the game in so and then we'll need one list called words this is for the type text again we'll get on to that later so now I have the variables we can actually start on the cat so I'm going to start on the movement of the cat so when clicked we have to set the attempts to one cuz at the end it'll show us one attempt so just set the attempts of one in the beginning hide the variable attempts hide all the variables in the beginning hide variable timer and set the timer to zero in the beginning so let's start on zero we can show these for now so I can show you how these variables work right now so next we want to set the size from the cat to 90% so hiding the variable is the same as unchecking them so you can either uncheck them in the beginning or anything or you can use the hide fear pool so easy to uncheck or use hide variable so we want to set the size to 90 again set the size to 90 in the beginning I already know I know I already said it's a 90 but if you haven't then you can just put this block right there we want it to go to like somewhere right here I already set the coordinates for it so I've got negative 295 205 native 205 and 150 that those are my coordinates I got it last time and forever loop and this is a movement like um arrow keys WASD so if then if the left arrow key he he left key opt or W the key up arrow or W is pressed that means if either one of these are oops X if either one of these keys are pressed then it will go up so if so we'll change the Y by three so we'll go up huge y by three and if then touching the color want to if then steam it in here if then touching the color of the edge like this thing the edge just select the edge of it that yeah it is touching that color which is 10 color 100 saturation and 95 brightness then it will change the Y by negative 3 so go back so you can't go through the wall so now let's work on the other arrow keys so you can just duplicate this put it right here if then let's say down arrow or s arrow s key is pressed then we'll change the Y by negative 3 mm and oh and if touching that color then I'll change the Y by 3 so you will always want it to be the opposite of it so go back and we'll go through the wall so you can just duplicate this typically both of them so put her here so if the now if the right arrow is press that or the D or D is press then we can change instead of Y with these X because we're going side to side so change the X by threepoint direction of 90 so face the right side and you can just move take this out put the change X by negative 3 in here if it's touching the color so now we have this right arrow now let's work on the left arrow left arrow just pretty much the opposite of it it's pretty much the opposite of this thing duplicate left arrow left arrow key or a is press ok then we can change the X or negative 3 pointing direction of negative 90 so we'll face the left side negative 90 and change X by three opposite so I won't come through the wall so now we have all this for the movement so now I can move left and right up and down you can use the WASD and it can't and when it touches the color it will not go through you can see it will go through the walls you just hide the letter they're gonna look so now let's see it won't go through so that's the movement and let's add we can do the type text thing today so we need to make a new block so today we'll just cover the cat movement and the text type a thing so we can name this type birds type words add two inputs one is one is gonna be told text one is called text and one is called type so two two inputs so you click OK so you have this so in the beginning you want to set the letter to one so you got one letter letter to one and delete all of words sort of delete the word list in the beginning so you want to get the repeat repeat the Len length of text this means they'll repeat however long the text you write is so if you write if you write like hi it's its so repeat two times so you will change so we'll add you need to go to variables add add letter it will add letter letter letter the variable put it into here of the text so add the letter you input to the text to the word list so you want to change the letter by one every time every time you write a new new letter so you change it by one you can take an ifelse statement take it if then I'll stating it put it under here so if type is equal to say which means if the type is equal to same not not thinking so there's two types there's thinking and say if the type this thing is equal to say then I'll say say the words say or say okay say words you'll say the words in the word list you put in and else if it's not if the type is not equal to say if it's not true then I'll think the words so next you can do under here you can do a weight 0.1 seconds just to make it a little slower so people can read it there for 1 seconds wait one second down here and clear clear the words say so what you want to do right here is just clear and then we need to add something else let me zoom in so you guys can see you can stop you're done then we could take a few clicks forever set timer set the variable timer to the sensing timer so the timer will keep on going up secondbysecond mmhmm and in the beginning in the beginning we can um take the type text type words put it right here put the instructions like go get the Chan and escape like that and think so I put think right here so we'll think it not saying so so right here it says if type is equal to say then I'll say it else they'll think so if this is not say then I'll think it so if you put anything right here it will still think so let's play it I'll think she's thinking and say go get the gem and escape and type it up and the movements don't works and if you show the variable timer it's actually going up right here see so we'll actually stop right here so right now we have the movement the type text words and the timer done so tomorrow in the next video we will work on the UM work on the like the other deep the traps will work on the traps and the walk and the keys next time so I'll see you guys in the next video thanks to you guys for watching and please like share and subscribe to our Channel and I'll see you guys next time thank you for watching
