00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's
00:08 - kids coding playground here today we're
00:11 - back for another video
00:12 - and we're still working on the daily
00:16 - breaks game
00:17 - so yeah
00:20 - um so today we will be
00:23 - working on the laser and the power up so
00:26 - i was showing you the code um
00:28 - if you don't have this code right here
00:30 - feel free to pause
00:33 - and yeah yeah copy down all this code so
00:37 - and also the trees i'm pretty sure we
00:39 - did this one too
00:41 - so first let's rename this i forgot to
00:43 - rename that in part one
00:45 - [Music]
00:49 - family three
00:55 - okay okay you don't have to have the
00:57 - teaching but
00:59 - i'm gonna do this so yeah um i'm gonna
01:02 - work on the laser
01:03 - second secondly so the third thing
01:06 - because we already worked on trees and
01:08 - the
01:09 - other thing the player so when the green
01:12 - flag is clicked
01:13 - we'll set size to 20 percent
01:18 - then laser will be smaller because i'm
01:21 - pretty sure it's kind of
01:22 - big it's already at 20 but uh you
01:25 - probably don't have
01:26 - it's probably not 20 for you because you
01:28 - got the button
01:29 - so when i receive start game
01:35 - then oh sorry sorry sorry
01:39 - um sorry i forgot to show you where the
01:42 - start game is
01:44 - so as you can see it says broadcast
01:45 - start game when you click the space bar
01:48 - so when i receive start game it'll go
01:50 - forever
01:53 - and unit if then statement if then the
01:56 - key
01:59 - and um the key space is pressed
02:05 - and and the
02:08 - laser is more than zero
02:12 - [Music]
02:20 - so basically if you have more than one
02:22 - laser you can shoot okay
02:24 - so laser zero then change laser
02:28 - by minus one because you lost a laser
02:33 - that's a create clone of myself
02:37 - the laser is the button so yeah you can
02:39 - actually get it from here
02:41 - search up buttons right here i think
02:43 - around here but
02:46 - you can also use this button if you want
02:48 - any button you want you can even use a
02:49 - bat
02:50 - if you want but it's your game so
02:53 - wait until you wait until
02:59 - so wait until not key press so that will
03:01 - not spam so you cannot just
03:03 - hold the space key you know and go like
03:06 -  a machine gun
03:08 - so yeah so you might if you want to spam
03:11 - you can
03:12 - you don't you don't have to use this
03:13 - technically but
03:15 - if you want if you don't want you the
03:17 - player to spam
03:18 - then you can you add that so when when i
03:21 - start as a clone
03:24 - so as you can see it says create clone
03:26 - of myself so it brings to the
03:28 - when i start as a clone and when i start
03:30 - as a clone it'll go to the player
03:39 - and and the player is basically a
03:43 - convertible the car
03:44 - and go to the player point in direction
03:50 - um so i will show you a thing so point
03:53 - in direction
03:56 - direction of player so
03:59 - you always have to change the last one
04:01 - this is tricky
04:02 - player and you have to change this
04:05 - direction
04:07 - and i'll set y
04:13 - to wide position so we can just
04:17 - duplicate this
04:19 - and we need a plus
04:22 - so a plus negative 20 so
04:27 - a direction of a player so i will
04:29 - explain this later and i will show you
04:32 - what this basically means so instead you
04:35 - need
04:35 - a y position of player and then it'll
04:38 - move 50 steps
04:43 - [Music]
04:48 - so yeah i'll show you what this means
04:50 - later and
04:52 - so because if you don't have this it's
04:54 - just the y position of player
04:56 - it'll be like up here and that's not
04:58 - directly in the middle so
04:59 - i will actually show you later so yeah
05:02 - so move 50 steps so go in the front of
05:05 - the car
05:06 - it will show
05:10 - and repeat until you need to repeat
05:12 - until loop
05:14 - repeat until
05:18 - repeat until touching that
05:26 - sorry about that so it will repeat until
05:29 - touching the edge
05:30 - and it will move ten steps
05:34 - you also need an if then statement so
05:38 - you can get the if then statement inside
05:40 - here
05:42 - if that is touching the obstacle
05:47 - then it will hide until you shot the
05:51 - obstacles
05:52 - and it will change obstacle hp by one so
05:55 - i don't think we have that variable yet
05:57 - but you can make that
05:58 - and i'll get further into that later so
06:01 - obstacle hp
06:06 - so i will change obstacle hp
06:13 - by
06:17 - so then the rock like some so so some
06:20 - things have like two
06:21 - times to kill like the wall picks three
06:24 - times
06:24 - rox takes two times so you gotta change
06:26 - it by one because the laser does one
06:28 - damage
06:29 - and you also need a if then statement
06:36 - we need if then statement
06:39 - so if then we need an or
06:44 - if then the obstacle hp
06:51 - and you need another one
06:55 - the less than symbol so the obstacle hp
06:58 - equals zero
07:00 - variables
07:04 - [Music]
07:09 - so it was actually a glitch i just found
07:11 - out so when i
07:12 - when i saw there was no obstacle hp here
07:14 - i did it for all sprites so
07:17 - now it's working so i just clicked on
07:19 - one of these and
07:20 - obstacle hp was on there so it was
07:22 - actually and i clicked back on this one
07:24 - and it worked so it's actually a glitch
07:25 - so
07:26 - sorry about that so the obstacle or hp0
07:31 - or well or the obstacle hp is less than
07:35 - zero i don't know how that's supposed to
07:36 - happen
07:37 - but it's just in case because
07:40 - you can't spam but i don't i don't know
07:42 - how that can happen but
07:44 - just in case so yeah you know broadcast
07:46 - obstacle destroy so
07:48 - if i make a new uh broadcast some weight
07:51 - obstacles
07:52 - i always get confused alphabets so
07:55 - broadcast
07:56 - and destroy obstacle
07:59 - destroy
08:03 - and also delete this clone so you gotta
08:06 - put the delete this clone on the right
08:08 - place so it is not in here
08:11 - so it is right under this one and not
08:14 - under this one only under this one and
08:16 - also you need to delete this clone under
08:18 - this so yeah
08:21 - we're done with the lasers i will show
08:23 - you what this means
08:24 - in a while and i also showed you what
08:27 - you have it or not
08:28 - so basically delete the laser
08:32 - means that the um laser will go
08:35 - so i'll show you what how it is if you
08:38 - do the this one like with this because
08:41 - it's plus
08:42 - negative 20. i told you i'd do that so
08:44 - let's just start
08:45 - as you can see um the laser is
08:48 - directly where the car is
08:52 - in the middle of the car but we're going
08:55 - to try another one
08:56 - so we're just going to take out this put
08:59 - this inside and as you can see
09:04 - it might be a little bit different for
09:06 - you i'm not
09:08 - sure because sometimes as you can see
09:10 - it's unlike on top of the car
09:13 - so yeah so this could help
09:20 - so we're gonna move on to the power up
09:21 - next
09:22 - [Music]
09:24 - so this one has uh a hunk of code two
09:28 - so i'm gonna start easy and simple with
09:31 - one green flag clicked go to x
09:34 - so i have the coordinates so go to x
09:41 - 94
09:46 - 31 and no show
09:51 - so somewhere over here
09:54 - and when i receive start gain
10:01 - then i'll go forever
10:05 - i'll go to x
10:09 - 200 and y
10:12 - pick random pick random
10:18 - from negative 115
10:21 - [Music]
10:23 - to positive 50.
10:27 - so it'll be like around here and repeat
10:30 - until
10:33 - you need it or wait until
10:38 - or that it's touching the player
10:45 - or touching that edge
10:48 - and i'll change x by
10:55 - pick random negative three to negative
10:58 - something
11:01 - sometimes it's lower sometimes it's
11:03 - higher basically
11:06 - faster sorry
11:09 - so depending how big your costume is or
11:12 - how big your size is
11:14 - the thing could be like flashing around
11:16 - here because it's touching the
11:18 - edge so i'll show you that right now as
11:21 - you can see it's 250
11:25 - and i'm just gonna wait for this
11:31 - as you can see it's like flashing around
11:33 - here
11:34 - and that is just wrong so it depends how
11:37 - big your costume is
11:39 - and and your position
11:42 - also your size if you're caught if your
11:44 - thing is small or big
11:47 - so i'm also going to show you the this
11:49 - way how i did it with 200
11:51 - eggs
11:54 - as you can see it's not on the edge and
11:57 - it's not
11:58 - like right here going like this and that
11:59 - and this and that so
12:01 - yeah that's basically what it means
12:04 - and then you have to make when i receive
12:07 - got power up we're still coding
12:10 - so it's over here yep i'm touching power
12:14 - got power up hide
12:20 - i'll start sound magic spell already
12:24 - have that sound
12:26 - sorry sorry excuse me
12:29 - and magic spell you can get it from the
12:31 - scratch library
12:33 - so magic
12:38 - [Music]
12:41 - so yeah you use any sound you want like
12:43 - pop pop
12:44 - whatever you want so yeah
12:48 - and you need a if then statement
12:58 - so um the co so we're actually going to
13:01 - use costume number
13:03 - so um so it's you need it equal so if it
13:07 - the costume number is equal to one
13:09 - so the constant number is equal to one
13:11 - i'll describe all of this afterwards
13:12 - when i'm done
13:13 - coding so costume number equals one
13:15 - custom number
13:16 - is the heart so yeah
13:20 - so if the costume number equals one you
13:22 - need an if-then-else statement
13:26 - if then else i'll just code everything
13:29 - right now if the
13:32 - hp
13:35 - plus 20.
13:43 - each heart is 20 so you can make it like
13:45 - infinite if you want but the
13:47 - next block of code i'm doing it will
13:49 - stop that so
13:51 - and now it's over 100 then
13:54 - set hp to 100 so so i'll describe
13:57 - everything afterwards so
13:58 - set hp to 100 and
14:02 - it'll change else it'll change hp
14:05 - by 20. so basically you cannot your
14:08 - hearts cannot go
14:09 - over 800 so if you want to go over 100
14:13 - you can
14:14 - remove the script of code and make it
14:16 - differently and
14:17 - but i'm using this else i'll change hp
14:20 - by 20.
14:20 - so it will work and the set hp to 100
14:24 - means that won't go over a hundred so if
14:26 - you're like
14:27 - 70 hp you'll go to 90 hp but if you're
14:30 - at like a 90 hp
14:31 - it won't go to 110. it'll still it'll
14:34 - it'll stay at 100. we'll just add 10.
14:37 - if you're at 100 and you collect a heart
14:39 - it's still 100.
14:40 - so yeah that's basically what it means
14:45 - and also the second costume is star
14:48 - so this doesn't really have a use but
14:51 - it's just a flex
14:53 - it's basically like a score it's like a
14:55 - flex score so yeah
14:57 - if you want like a big um
15:00 - score you can always use the star so
15:03 - so yes so you need equals
15:07 - if the costume number equals two
15:11 - [Music]
15:16 - uh then it will change score by five
15:27 - you can make it like infinite score if
15:30 - you want
15:30 - like 10 million if you want i don't
15:33 - judge you but if you
15:34 - want to you can't and you just have to
15:37 - duplicate this it's just a little bit
15:39 - different
15:39 - sorry that you just make it aft
15:42 - out outside and you can make it three
15:45 - you know change score
15:46 - instead of change score let's change
15:48 - laser by ten so
15:50 - i'll show you what the next one is
15:53 - so you can make it five but i'm using
15:55 - ten so the laser
15:58 - so it'll have ten shots when you collect
16:00 - it so show your costume
16:02 - laser this costume three i don't know
16:04 - why it says costume two because this is
16:08 - and um wait three seconds
16:12 - it'll come again wait three seconds
16:17 - set x to
16:21 - 200 so it will go around here again and
16:24 - it won't
16:25 - flash around here so just go around here
16:27 - and
16:28 - next costume
16:30 - [Music]
16:34 - show so you get the powers yep
16:38 - and i think we might have a part three
16:41 - i'm not sure
16:43 - but let's see costume one costume two as
16:46 - you can see
16:47 - you can pause anytime you want feel free
16:51 - so we will actually have a part three
16:54 - i'll actually show you the game
16:56 - so it's not completely finished the
16:57 - obstacles are not here
17:00 - so we can move these down
17:04 - [Music]
17:12 - so if you do not know you can actually
17:14 - double click on this to make it like
17:16 - laser 10 and also do this and you can
17:19 - also double click to get this
17:21 - so um i'm gonna double click on i
17:24 - already
17:25 - i'm gonna double click on this drag the
17:28 - variable down
17:29 - here double click on this drag the
17:32 - variable down
17:33 - here double click on this drag the
17:36 - variable down here and let's start
17:41 - actually so as you can see please select
17:43 - the car using right and left arrow keys
17:45 - please press space when you're done
17:47 - so i'm gonna select yellow this time
17:50 - so as you can see the power-ups are
17:53 - going
17:54 - around and it's the on laser so yeah
17:57 - yeah i have 20 lasers now it's
17:58 - hard this time so stay at 100 as you can
18:01 - still stay at 105
18:05 - like five points and it's not that
18:08 - challenging right now
18:09 - but we will have part three for this and
18:12 - yeah
18:15 - so as you can see the hp i'm just gonna
18:18 - play this again so i'm gonna show you
18:20 - something
18:21 - with the car and as you can see it says
18:24 - um hp to let me set the hp to 50
18:29 - so then i can show you the heart so
18:33 - yeah let's just this
18:37 - i'm going to pick red so
18:40 - as you can see the hp is coming as you
18:42 - can see it went to 70.
18:44 - so yes it does work and i'm just gonna
18:46 - wait for another heart
18:50 - so it's just a power up this time so as
18:52 - you see it's changing spray
18:54 - oh i got a heart as you can see it's 90
18:56 - i hope there's another heart if i'm
18:57 - lucky enough
18:59 - this is another star
19:03 - and this dude
19:06 - and as you can see the heart it doesn't
19:07 - go hunting 110 i'll show you that again
19:10 - right here wait for heart to come
19:15 - wow why is it going in the same order i
19:18 - don't know why
19:20 - so as you can see 110 it doesn't go to
19:23 - it just goes there stays at 100.
19:27 - so i it looks like we have um next
19:29 - costume so it's always predictable
19:32 - so i will maybe change this to a random
19:35 - costume to make the
19:37 - game more challenging so let's say
19:39 - switch costume
19:41 - to pick random
19:44 - costume one two three because there's
19:47 - three costumes
19:49 - so i'll run it again and show you guys
19:52 - this time it's not that predictable
19:54 - and harder to guess i mean it's
19:57 - impossible to predict it
19:58 - uh so yeah as you see it's a star design
20:02 - instead of a heart
20:04 - i think the first one was supposed to be
20:05 - a heart and this time it's a
20:07 - heart i wonder what the next one's going
20:09 - to be
20:10 - it's a star see look it's not a towel
20:12 - anymore so yeah
20:14 - so you you can do next costume if you
20:16 - want but this is more fun in my opinion
20:19 - because you can't you don't know what it
20:21 - is so
20:22 - next part will be part three and yeah
20:26 - and we'll be working on the obstacles it
20:28 - might be really short
20:30 - but yes so please like share
20:33 - subscribe and comment in the comment
20:34 - section below for what else caught
20:36 - what anyways see you guys
20:48 - [Music]
20:49 - you

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here today we're back for another video and we're still working on the daily breaks game so yeah um so today we will be working on the laser and the power up so i was showing you the code um if you don't have this code right here feel free to pause and yeah yeah copy down all this code so and also the trees i'm pretty sure we did this one too so first let's rename this i forgot to rename that in part one family three okay okay you don't have to have the teaching but i'm gonna do this so yeah um i'm gonna work on the laser second secondly so the third thing because we already worked on trees and the other thing the player so when the green flag is clicked we'll set size to 20 percent then laser will be smaller because i'm pretty sure it's kind of big it's already at 20 but uh you probably don't have it's probably not 20 for you because you got the button so when i receive start game then oh sorry sorry sorry um sorry i forgot to show you where the start game is so as you can see it says broadcast start game when you click the space bar so when i receive start game it'll go forever and unit if then statement if then the key and um the key space is pressed and and the laser is more than zero so basically if you have more than one laser you can shoot okay so laser zero then change laser by minus one because you lost a laser that's a create clone of myself the laser is the button so yeah you can actually get it from here search up buttons right here i think around here but you can also use this button if you want any button you want you can even use a bat if you want but it's your game so wait until you wait until so wait until not key press so that will not spam so you cannot just hold the space key you know and go like a machine gun so yeah so you might if you want to spam you can you don't you don't have to use this technically but if you want if you don't want you the player to spam then you can you add that so when when i start as a clone so as you can see it says create clone of myself so it brings to the when i start as a clone and when i start as a clone it'll go to the player and and the player is basically a convertible the car and go to the player point in direction um so i will show you a thing so point in direction direction of player so you always have to change the last one this is tricky player and you have to change this direction and i'll set y to wide position so we can just duplicate this and we need a plus so a plus negative 20 so a direction of a player so i will explain this later and i will show you what this basically means so instead you need a y position of player and then it'll move 50 steps so yeah i'll show you what this means later and so because if you don't have this it's just the y position of player it'll be like up here and that's not directly in the middle so i will actually show you later so yeah so move 50 steps so go in the front of the car it will show and repeat until you need to repeat until loop repeat until repeat until touching that sorry about that so it will repeat until touching the edge and it will move ten steps you also need an if then statement so you can get the if then statement inside here if that is touching the obstacle then it will hide until you shot the obstacles and it will change obstacle hp by one so i don't think we have that variable yet but you can make that and i'll get further into that later so obstacle hp so i will change obstacle hp by so then the rock like some so so some things have like two times to kill like the wall picks three times rox takes two times so you gotta change it by one because the laser does one damage and you also need a if then statement we need if then statement so if then we need an or if then the obstacle hp and you need another one the less than symbol so the obstacle hp equals zero variables so it was actually a glitch i just found out so when i when i saw there was no obstacle hp here i did it for all sprites so now it's working so i just clicked on one of these and obstacle hp was on there so it was actually and i clicked back on this one and it worked so it's actually a glitch so sorry about that so the obstacle or hp0 or well or the obstacle hp is less than zero i don't know how that's supposed to happen but it's just in case because you can't spam but i don't i don't know how that can happen but just in case so yeah you know broadcast obstacle destroy so if i make a new uh broadcast some weight obstacles i always get confused alphabets so broadcast and destroy obstacle destroy and also delete this clone so you gotta put the delete this clone on the right place so it is not in here so it is right under this one and not under this one only under this one and also you need to delete this clone under this so yeah we're done with the lasers i will show you what this means in a while and i also showed you what you have it or not so basically delete the laser means that the um laser will go so i'll show you what how it is if you do the this one like with this because it's plus negative 20. i told you i'd do that so let's just start as you can see um the laser is directly where the car is in the middle of the car but we're going to try another one so we're just going to take out this put this inside and as you can see it might be a little bit different for you i'm not sure because sometimes as you can see it's unlike on top of the car so yeah so this could help so we're gonna move on to the power up next so this one has uh a hunk of code two so i'm gonna start easy and simple with one green flag clicked go to x so i have the coordinates so go to x 94 31 and no show so somewhere over here and when i receive start gain then i'll go forever i'll go to x 200 and y pick random pick random from negative 115 to positive 50. so it'll be like around here and repeat until you need it or wait until or that it's touching the player or touching that edge and i'll change x by pick random negative three to negative something sometimes it's lower sometimes it's higher basically faster sorry so depending how big your costume is or how big your size is the thing could be like flashing around here because it's touching the edge so i'll show you that right now as you can see it's 250 and i'm just gonna wait for this as you can see it's like flashing around here and that is just wrong so it depends how big your costume is and and your position also your size if you're caught if your thing is small or big so i'm also going to show you the this way how i did it with 200 eggs as you can see it's not on the edge and it's not like right here going like this and that and this and that so yeah that's basically what it means and then you have to make when i receive got power up we're still coding so it's over here yep i'm touching power got power up hide i'll start sound magic spell already have that sound sorry sorry excuse me and magic spell you can get it from the scratch library so magic so yeah you use any sound you want like pop pop whatever you want so yeah and you need a if then statement so um the co so we're actually going to use costume number so um so it's you need it equal so if it the costume number is equal to one so the constant number is equal to one i'll describe all of this afterwards when i'm done coding so costume number equals one custom number is the heart so yeah so if the costume number equals one you need an ifthenelse statement if then else i'll just code everything right now if the hp plus 20. each heart is 20 so you can make it like infinite if you want but the next block of code i'm doing it will stop that so and now it's over 100 then set hp to 100 so so i'll describe everything afterwards so set hp to 100 and it'll change else it'll change hp by 20. so basically you cannot your hearts cannot go over 800 so if you want to go over 100 you can remove the script of code and make it differently and but i'm using this else i'll change hp by 20. so it will work and the set hp to 100 means that won't go over a hundred so if you're like 70 hp you'll go to 90 hp but if you're at like a 90 hp it won't go to 110. it'll still it'll it'll stay at 100. we'll just add 10. if you're at 100 and you collect a heart it's still 100. so yeah that's basically what it means and also the second costume is star so this doesn't really have a use but it's just a flex it's basically like a score it's like a flex score so yeah if you want like a big um score you can always use the star so so yes so you need equals if the costume number equals two uh then it will change score by five you can make it like infinite score if you want like 10 million if you want i don't judge you but if you want to you can't and you just have to duplicate this it's just a little bit different sorry that you just make it aft out outside and you can make it three you know change score instead of change score let's change laser by ten so i'll show you what the next one is so you can make it five but i'm using ten so the laser so it'll have ten shots when you collect it so show your costume laser this costume three i don't know why it says costume two because this is and um wait three seconds it'll come again wait three seconds set x to 200 so it will go around here again and it won't flash around here so just go around here and next costume show so you get the powers yep and i think we might have a part three i'm not sure but let's see costume one costume two as you can see you can pause anytime you want feel free so we will actually have a part three i'll actually show you the game so it's not completely finished the obstacles are not here so we can move these down so if you do not know you can actually double click on this to make it like laser 10 and also do this and you can also double click to get this so um i'm gonna double click on i already i'm gonna double click on this drag the variable down here double click on this drag the variable down here double click on this drag the variable down here and let's start actually so as you can see please select the car using right and left arrow keys please press space when you're done so i'm gonna select yellow this time so as you can see the powerups are going around and it's the on laser so yeah yeah i have 20 lasers now it's hard this time so stay at 100 as you can still stay at 105 like five points and it's not that challenging right now but we will have part three for this and yeah so as you can see the hp i'm just gonna play this again so i'm gonna show you something with the car and as you can see it says um hp to let me set the hp to 50 so then i can show you the heart so yeah let's just this i'm going to pick red so as you can see the hp is coming as you can see it went to 70. so yes it does work and i'm just gonna wait for another heart so it's just a power up this time so as you see it's changing spray oh i got a heart as you can see it's 90 i hope there's another heart if i'm lucky enough this is another star and this dude and as you can see the heart it doesn't go hunting 110 i'll show you that again right here wait for heart to come wow why is it going in the same order i don't know why so as you can see 110 it doesn't go to it just goes there stays at 100. so i it looks like we have um next costume so it's always predictable so i will maybe change this to a random costume to make the game more challenging so let's say switch costume to pick random costume one two three because there's three costumes so i'll run it again and show you guys this time it's not that predictable and harder to guess i mean it's impossible to predict it uh so yeah as you see it's a star design instead of a heart i think the first one was supposed to be a heart and this time it's a heart i wonder what the next one's going to be it's a star see look it's not a towel anymore so yeah so you you can do next costume if you want but this is more fun in my opinion because you can't you don't know what it is so next part will be part three and yeah and we'll be working on the obstacles it might be really short but yes so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below for what else caught what anyways see you guys you
