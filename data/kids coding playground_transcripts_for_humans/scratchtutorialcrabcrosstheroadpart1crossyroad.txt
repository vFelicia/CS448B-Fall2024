00:08 - hello and welcome back to the channel
00:11 - today we'll be working on a new project
00:14 - called crack across the roll
00:16 - so this is a similar to the cross hero
00:19 - game I remember playing this similar
00:22 - game when I was a kid
00:23 - it's called Frogger way basically chimo
00:26 - cross the street the Frog and then go on
00:29 - to the river and then get the get to the
00:34 - other side so similarly we will make it
00:36 - came here with a crab trying to cross a
00:39 - road without getting hit by any of this
00:42 - a car truck to get to the cake once you
00:46 - grab the cake we'll move them back over
00:49 - here and he can go again and get it so
00:52 - that's a score here and then there's
00:53 - some life so once you lose all your life
00:56 - the game is over
00:57 - all right that's one so we will be
01:00 - looking at this concept today making
01:04 - custom sprite and backdrop if you don't
01:07 - know how to do that I suggest you watch
01:09 - the other video we had that should teach
01:14 - you how to do that so I will put a image
01:17 - she lay down to show you guys that video
01:21 - and you saw also the we're going to use
01:26 - the variable to control the action of
01:28 - the crab so basically if the crap isn't
01:31 - moving up we have to make sure that it
01:33 - doesn't move up when when you got hit by
01:36 - a car I had this top so we'll talk about
01:40 - that and then we'll use it loop and
01:42 - understanding the position of sprite how
01:45 - we can search the sprite let's say for a
01:48 - car that's going left or right depending
01:50 - on the position you might have to change
01:52 - the movements move by minus plus okay
01:57 - we'll talk about that also and then
02:00 - touching the sprite I think we have
02:02 - touched we have done that many time and
02:04 - then pick random okay all right let's
02:07 - jump into the game I can show you how it
02:09 - actually looks like so so here's the
02:14 - game so
02:16 - so if you start up there's all these
02:20 - cars running around and then the crap is
02:23 - trying to cross the road let me increase
02:28 - the stand with a little bit you can see
02:29 - added some music in the background okay
02:34 - you can move up alright so as you can
02:40 - see the kick is on this side we're
02:43 - trying to get across I mean let's see a
02:50 - little tough so as you see I got hit my
02:53 - car did not make it so uh basically you
02:58 - you can change it yo yo yo yo based on
03:02 - how fast the cars moving as you can see
03:05 - the police car can go real fast and the
03:08 - other truck the whole truck a little
03:11 - slow try this one this may be here I
03:16 - guess it's not easier okay so once you
03:21 - hit all your life is over then he lost I
03:29 - got it so I got the one score which is
03:32 - the cake so once you touch that
03:36 - so as you can see this is turn of the
03:40 - game how it looks like alright so let's
03:46 - get into it what to start a new project
03:52 - okay before we start I would really
03:54 - appreciate you guys could like share and
03:57 - subscribe to our channel so that will
04:00 - help us a lot and we could and also
04:02 - suggest what video we should make is it
04:06 - more intermediate or big beginner video
04:10 - type or more advanced video type so
04:13 - alright let's begin so what we need to
04:17 - do is so first thing we'll create some
04:21 - variable so when we know that we need
04:24 - the life right we have we seen that
04:26 - right
04:27 - lives so we have number lives the crap F
04:35 - and then the score okay so so far these
04:40 - are the two variable we need we might
04:42 - need later on that are not a not a
04:44 - variable so what we can do is we are
04:48 - going to work on something in the
04:50 - background first so the background list
04:53 - you can see is a track right we would a
04:56 - track so you have to actually draw that
04:58 - so you don't want to have a track here
05:00 - right so he hadn't known how to draw
05:02 - that if you don't know how to do that
05:04 - just try to follow along and see how I'm
05:07 - doing it and also it will require you to
05:09 - do some kind of a editing with the
05:11 - sprite so you can also look at our other
05:14 - video that actually helps you okay
05:17 - alright so we're here
05:19 - so in this backdrop go to past - oh
05:24 - sorry backdrop so back job you see this
05:27 - white white so here the draw this so
05:30 - what we going to do is we go to draw
05:33 - make gray box around us first so let's
05:39 - not use any power line here for this one
05:44 - it's a watch or the gray box as you can
05:47 - see scratch updated that stuff a little
05:49 - bit you can see that this this white box
05:52 - is what is shown on the stage so as long
05:55 - as you cover that white box you're good
05:58 - right so so we're gonna make the roll
06:04 - first
06:05 - so what you need to do you need to feel
06:08 - the color right gonna change this color
06:13 - down but we're gonna make it look like
06:15 - gray so crazed around where to find the
06:21 - color okay
06:26 - just like draw an arrow like
06:41 - so this looks somewhat okay maybe like
06:48 - this right okay so we're gonna fill this
06:52 - so this looks like the rule then we have
06:57 - to you see remember the role has two
07:00 - white lines and go through it and then
07:02 - some yellow line so we will be drawing
07:04 - that okay so let me draw the lines what
07:11 - we can do is what is like I like a white
07:15 - color so we gotta bring this down to
07:18 - zero saturation get a push this
07:22 - brightness so hundred so this will give
07:25 - you two no white color looking only this
07:28 - five you can use this line this is to
07:32 - where to draw the line and when you do
07:34 - draw a line you can hold the shift key
07:38 - that will help you when you call it down
07:42 - begin like a straight line so wall go
07:45 - one straight line here and then what we
07:50 - can do is click on this select toy and
07:54 - you can use the arrow key to move or you
07:58 - can use the mouse also so we can work on
08:01 - the copy and paste it again and we are
08:06 - moving it to this next one so we are
08:09 - going to make two lines just kind of
08:11 - eyeball it out what it kind of look like
08:17 - so next we will draw these little yellow
08:22 - rectangular shape on the on the roll so
08:29 - you have to use the box so we'll have to
08:32 - go back here and then take out this
08:35 - outline we will have to get the color
08:39 - working so let's choose the yellow color
08:48 - maybe something like this
08:53 - okay so 13 90 100 I mean could be 14 or
08:58 - whatever but something like yellow
09:00 - alright so now you draw this little
09:04 - square so what we're going to do enjoy I
09:07 - can't hit the edge here so that it shows
09:09 - a little bit better so what what to do
09:12 - is go this you are like this okay so we
09:18 - have our first I can't right go to the
09:21 - select all copy and then we are going to
09:25 - paste them I pull it out so making a
09:33 - custom sprite and and things like that
09:38 - on scratch so a little bit harder so but
09:42 - if you have a little good artistic skill
09:44 - then you know shouldn't be a problem but
09:47 - for me I'm not that good with it so we
09:52 - got for now so what I did was I kind of
09:56 - made one then I copy to and then and
10:00 - then I put two to two together make four
10:05 - so now we have a foot solid like eight
10:11 - so you can hold the shift key right hold
10:15 - the shift key and then click on these so
10:17 - we'll select them all cuz ctrl-c ctrl-v
10:21 - that will copy everything so as you can
10:29 - see we had done all the the roll the
10:36 - first set of roll so maybe if you wanna
10:41 - make it this one it depends okay let's
10:45 - move this oops the one select the square
10:52 - I'm charged justice a little bit that's
11:01 - unfortunately there's no they don't
11:04 - actually have a total to the lineup or
11:06 - the sprite in one role that will be good
11:09 - if they do so anyway we have our first
11:12 - strike stripe yellow strip will put the
11:16 - next one here somewhere down this way I
11:24 - think that looks ok we'll do one more
11:28 - copy and paste and we put it over here
11:36 - ok so we have the roll I mean you can
11:39 - adjust them later on when you actually
11:42 - put in your cars in what we need to do
11:46 - is we could work on the draw the Queen
11:48 - the patch here let's use a different
11:53 - color for now we don't do green actually
11:56 - but um I
11:58 - oops oh I accidentally changed it that
12:07 - thing
12:16 - okay alright let's join me one naturally
12:21 - so we are going to draw one here that's
12:25 - the grass but we're gonna change the
12:26 - color I'm on yellow right now but we're
12:31 - going to make it screen okay we can
12:37 - change the color to fill cut on the
12:39 - filters and then change its color hmm so
12:47 - I'm going 2545
12:56 - and then go down till 75
13:01 - so our kind of like a Turkish green so
13:05 - so now I have cover everything right so
13:09 - you can see at the green at the mark on
13:11 - the ground and then I have the grass so
13:22 - what we can do is put like a patch of
13:25 - grass and then another patch of grass we
13:28 - can do that downloading like PNG online
13:30 - I will be showing - how you do that next
13:36 - alright so thank you for watching for
13:40 - now we will create a lessons for this -
13:44 - how to do this image editing okay
13:48 - alright thank you
13:52 - [Music]
