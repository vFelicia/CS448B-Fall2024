00:02 - [Music]
00:10 - welcome back guys to kids coding
00:12 - playground
00:12 - um today i think we will be able to
00:15 - finish up the uh
00:17 - memory game uh halloween memory game
00:20 - um so um if you guys have not watched uh
00:24 - one two and three uh be sure to watch
00:26 - that before you get to this one
00:28 - i think we might be able to finish
00:30 - everything today for this uh game
00:33 - okay so what we left off last time was
00:35 - we created the uh
00:36 - two uh cover cards where we click on it
00:39 - you know
00:40 - review the the icon below i in this uh
00:43 - despite below
00:44 - like let me run it over with you one
00:46 - time for you guys to see
00:48 - so you click on it it will show up if
00:50 - you click on the other card
00:51 - or so we've played one choice one
00:54 - you click on this you have player choice
00:56 - two if it doesn't match it will close
00:58 - the card again
00:59 - so pretty much we get the basic of the
01:01 - game how it actually works
01:03 - so all we need to do is the easy part
01:06 - just creating duplicating the sprite
01:08 - and make sure we get the correct
01:10 - broadcast message
01:12 - okay so before i begin please like share
01:15 - and subscribe to our channel
01:17 - and ring the notification bell so that
01:19 - you get all the latest update from our
01:21 - channel
01:22 - all right let me just go over the code a
01:24 - little bit
01:25 - in case you guys miss anything just kind
01:28 - of copy it down
01:29 - so this is where we do the match of the
01:31 - number we'll break the input
01:34 - and then we assign what is the correct
01:36 - match
01:37 - for the sprite and then we'll broadcast
01:39 - a message to
01:40 - switch the costume for this price here
01:43 - okay
01:43 - so this is the game when it's setting up
01:46 - just uh some variable that we set up to
01:49 - initialize and delete the list
01:52 - and these are the 12 numbers for the
01:54 - number list because we have 12
01:55 - uh 12 boxes and six pair and this is
01:59 - more set up
02:00 - this is related to the each of the uh
02:02 - sprite so how many
02:04 - however many sprite costumes you had in
02:07 - here so let's say you have 50
02:09 - so 1 to 50 then you take all all these
02:13 - name and you put it into your
02:17 - uh your your list here okay all right so
02:20 - pretty
02:20 - easy there and then this is the prepared
02:24 - game basically we picked out
02:25 - six different sets of um
02:30 - six different sets of pair uh and then
02:32 - we assign each of the pair with the
02:34 - number list to combine they have you
02:37 - know like this
02:38 - one number pipe and another cat number
02:42 - so we use that to break the pair okay
02:44 - and then in the bottom here is the just
02:46 - set up
02:48 - the the sprite the game you know uh
02:51 - we're calling this set up the sprite way
02:53 - to go break up the number
02:55 - and then this is the game instruction
02:57 - okay
02:59 - and over here this is the checking the
03:01 - end set is correct or not
03:03 - okay if it's not correct or broadcast
03:05 - the cover card
03:07 - so cover card will go back over here is
03:09 - not the same
03:10 - if it's not in the name list basically
03:13 - if it match we'll put it into this
03:14 - player selected match list if it's not
03:17 - matching
03:18 - then you know we'll we'll cover the card
03:20 - again and this is just
03:21 - checking you know if the player click on
03:23 - the first choice or set it to the first
03:25 - choice it's not there else to send it to
03:27 - the second choice
03:28 - okay i hope you guys understand that and
03:30 - then this is the cover
03:32 - where we're showing you know if the
03:33 - broadcast show cover one will have to
03:35 - show it and cover the card again
03:38 - and then this uh checking if it's the
03:40 - the game has started or not before you
03:42 - allow them to click on the sprite so
03:44 - just making sure that you know while the
03:46 - game is setting up we should not allow
03:48 - the player to click on the sprite
03:49 - uh the box to reveal the card underneath
03:52 - because it's not ready yet
03:54 - okay so i think we have everything that
03:57 - we need i don't think background of cool
03:59 - yeah no code there
04:01 - okay all right so what we need to do is
04:03 - just
04:04 - going to duplicate some of these um
04:06 - sprite
04:07 - so what i'm going to do is i have two so
04:10 - i'm going to have to get 10 more of
04:12 - these so
04:12 - right click duplicate one
04:17 - two three
04:21 - four five
04:26 - six seven
04:30 - eight nine
04:34 - and ten so total we have twelve right
04:36 - one twelve
04:37 - twelve of these right one two three four
04:39 - five five ten
04:40 - twelve right so we have 12 boxes okay
04:44 - uh what we need to do is i'm going to
04:46 - hide these two lists i think you guys
04:48 - are really familiar with this and the
04:49 - choice
04:50 - we don't need to see them anymore so
04:52 - that way we have more space to work on
04:54 - it
04:54 - okay i'm gonna hide this and hide these
04:57 - okay
04:57 - so we have all our sprites here um
05:01 - so what i'm going to do i have all the
05:04 - coordinates down for each of the sprite
05:06 - where they're supposed to show up
05:08 - uh you know if you uh you can copy my
05:10 - coordinates uh you know so that you have
05:12 - nicely layout if not you can just move
05:14 - them and try to
05:16 - align it correctly okay
05:19 - okay so what we're going to do this is
05:21 - number three
05:22 - we are going to change it to 60 ends up
05:25 - negative 60
05:27 - okay and then this is number four
05:32 - [Music]
05:35 - for number four we are going at
05:38 - 180
05:41 - so that will fill up the first row
05:44 - okay let's go to number five
05:50 - so for number five this is number five
05:52 - we're going to negative 180
05:55 - which is going to be somewhere here
06:00 - then number six
06:04 - number six will keep that uh
06:07 - uh 60 okay i think i messed up number
06:10 - five got to change the y
06:11 - so change the y to five
06:15 - so number six will change negative 60
06:17 - and then
06:18 - y to five
06:22 - and then number seven
06:26 - so this will be sixty
06:29 - and y should be five so just kinda
06:32 - put them together and number eight
06:35 - we'll do 180
06:39 - positive 180 and then five
06:43 - number nine so number nine we'll do
06:48 - at one negative 180
06:51 - and negative 110 somewhere in the bottom
06:54 - okay somewhere here and then this one
06:59 - negative 60 we'll do negative 110
07:03 - this is equal to positive 60
07:07 - negative 110
07:10 - and the last one is i then 180
07:14 - and negative 110. i think this is
07:17 - correct
07:19 - okay so now we have all the sprite
07:22 - what we have to do is we're going to go
07:24 - right back change this
07:27 - to all the broadcast messages is set up
07:29 - sprite 2 and it should be set up sprite
07:31 - uh you know whatever 12 or whatever but
07:33 - before we do that we're going to go back
07:35 - to the cat first
07:37 - okay scroll over to the side here where
07:40 - we're setting up the uh
07:42 - each of the uh broadcast message right
07:45 - okay
07:46 - and what we're going to do is we're
07:47 - going to break this up a little bit
07:49 - over here because this is podcast number
07:52 - two
07:53 - we don't want to mess with that yet we
07:55 - want to all the broadcast one first so
07:58 - just
07:58 - duplicate right click on this duplicate
08:00 - this stack it over here
08:02 - so this is one two and this is only
08:04 - three
08:06 - and then we'll call it setup i'll call
08:08 - it setup sprite number three
08:12 - set up sprite three i'm going to copy
08:16 - this
08:17 - so i'll remember where i am so this is
08:20 - one two three right now number four
08:24 - and then we'll say new message
08:28 - sprite number four okay
08:31 - let me stop this let me show okay
08:34 - now we have four of them i think we'll
08:36 - be faster this time
08:40 - okay so this is number five
08:43 - six seven
08:48 - eight so we have four i5 so
08:51 - now let's new message set up sprite
08:54 - number five
08:55 - [Music]
08:59 - this is six sorry forgot to change that
09:02 - make sure i didn't miss anything one two
09:05 - three four
09:06 - five six seven eight yeah okay number
09:09 - five is number five number six
09:10 - so this is a little bit tedious but
09:14 - you kind of have to get it set it up
09:17 - uh make sure you don't mess up anything
09:19 - in between if you do then you might mess
09:21 - it up
09:22 - seven
09:25 - and this is number eight
09:29 - okay so so far we have eight i think we
09:31 - need four more
09:35 - okay so let's do four more eight
09:38 - nine ten eleven twelve right so we'll
09:40 - duplicate from here
09:42 - we'll do it over here first so we know
09:44 - nine
09:46 - ten eleven
09:50 - and twelve and then what we're going to
09:54 - do is this is number nine
09:56 - so new message number nine
10:00 - [Music]
10:03 - now message number 10
10:07 - okay your message
10:10 - number 11
10:14 - no message number
10:18 - so we're done with all the uh broadcast
10:22 - message for uh
10:23 - broadcast one which we have to repeat
10:25 - the same thing
10:27 - for broadcast two so similarly we have
10:30 - broadcast two one right so let's
10:32 - do that so i'm gonna right click on this
10:34 - top
10:35 - i am going to just change it here so
10:37 - it's a broadcast one
10:39 - with a right click say broadcast two
10:43 - so leave these the same so this and this
10:46 - should be the same just change the
10:47 - variable here
10:49 - so just keep going down change it
10:53 - change it so make sure you don't miss
10:56 - anything
10:56 - so if you miss it you you know you
10:58 - you'll be incorrect
11:00 - okay podcast two broadcast two
11:05 - broadcast two broadcast two
11:08 - so we have okay we have two two two two
11:11 - two
11:12 - so far so good two two two two
11:15 - so number ten
11:18 - broadcast two podcast two
11:24 - eleven broadcast two so we have
11:26 - everything so let's see
11:29 - yep looks like we do have everything
11:31 - okay all right so we don't need this
11:33 - anymore
11:34 - we'll trash this and we'll take this one
11:37 - let's zoom out a little bit
11:40 - we are going to join it to the end
11:43 - here okay all right
11:47 - so i think we have all of it
11:49 - [Music]
11:51 - so now let's go back to our sprite
11:53 - number three right we have set up
11:55 - so it says setup sprite number two let's
11:58 - say set up sprite number three
12:01 - okay we have to change this also later
12:03 - okay don't worry about that that's for
12:04 - the select
12:06 - and then we have to change that also
12:08 - change all this broadcasted three
12:10 - so let's just finish this piece here so
12:12 - let's go through
12:14 - this is number four so you can see right
12:17 - how to win four so wall to number four
12:19 - this is how in five number five so we
12:22 - kind of
12:23 - let's just do all this now number six
12:27 - oops
12:30 - [Music]
12:31 - number six this is number seven
12:38 - this one is number eight
12:42 - this is number nine
12:44 - [Music]
12:48 - ten eleven
12:53 - and twelve okay
12:56 - [Music]
12:58 - so i'm gonna run it once if it actually
13:00 - works to set up okay it might not work
13:02 - it might work i don't know let's just
13:05 - move these
13:06 - guys to the end here
13:09 - and this one to the end okay so we have
13:13 - all this one
13:13 - let's run it let me save it let's run
13:17 - wow so they're all set up correctly
13:19 - right and then
13:20 - once it's changed see we have all the
13:22 - match
13:23 - okay so we have the girl this one this
13:26 - match right the two frog this guy match
13:30 - this guy match so i think it's correct
13:32 - let's run it again
13:34 - let's run again
13:37 - and we should all the match so match
13:39 - match match match match
13:41 - yep yep good so i think our
13:45 - matching one is good so what we need to
13:48 - do now
13:48 - is um we'll have to do the cover
13:51 - and then we have to uh make sure that we
13:54 - have
13:55 - we have gotten all the correct uh setup
13:57 - you know like here i
13:59 - select sprite 2 it should be number 12
14:01 - and all that so
14:02 - i'm going to make sure that we do all
14:03 - that correctly so let's
14:05 - duplicate this cover cards okay
14:08 - [Music]
14:09 - whether do we 10 more so uh so that will
14:12 - cover everything
14:13 - okay duplicate one two
14:17 - three four five
14:21 - six seven
14:25 - eight nine and
14:29 - 10. so we have 10 of these now let's
14:32 - make sure that we have to set them all
14:33 - up to correct location
14:35 - let's do this first so we are going to
14:38 - set them to go to sprite
14:40 - halloween sprite number three so this is
14:43 - our
14:44 - card number three right cover three
14:45 - we'll go to three
14:47 - okay four we'll go to four let's just do
14:50 - these like this first
14:52 - and then we'll go back to finished out
14:53 - of one five
14:56 - because i don't want you guys to mess up
14:58 - six
15:01 - seven
15:01 - [Music]
15:04 - eight
15:07 - [Music]
15:09 - nine ten
15:14 - eleven and
15:18 - last one
15:21 - okay so make sure that these cover card
15:23 - goes to the right location
15:26 - okay so let's run it again
15:29 - so you can see all the cover cards are
15:31 - going to the right location covering all
15:33 - the sprites behind
15:35 - okay all right so now we are going to
15:37 - have to fix all these cover cards
15:40 - so we are going to start with number
15:42 - three
15:44 - so here you see all these two with the
15:47 - changes to three
15:48 - so instead of select sprite two
15:51 - and wait okay we have to we're going to
15:54 - have to say
15:55 - select sprite three okay
15:59 - okay so this you don't want to mess with
16:01 - the condition here this should be
16:03 - good right only thing you need to change
16:06 - is this okay
16:08 - okay so we say select sprite three
16:11 - new message selected
16:16 - sprite number three okay i'm gonna copy
16:19 - this
16:20 - so okay so select sprite three for
16:23 - number three
16:25 - let's go through and do all these first
16:27 - okay
16:28 - here we'll do a new message this is
16:30 - number four
16:32 - [Music]
16:33 - okay this one is number five
16:38 - [Music]
16:40 - this is number six
16:48 - this is number seven
16:54 - okay
16:57 - new message number eight
17:03 - this one is number nine
17:07 - [Music]
17:09 - message number ten so as you can see
17:12 - we're using a lot of broadcast message
17:14 - to
17:14 - interact between the sprites so
17:18 - this will give you a good practice i
17:20 - guess
17:21 - with the broadcast messages and this is
17:24 - number 12.
17:25 - so we have all the uh select sprite this
17:29 - looks correct only thing is not correct
17:31 - is this cover so
17:32 - this comes from the other sprite to
17:34 - broadcast back so what we need to do is
17:36 - we have all the cover done
17:37 - let's go back to our custom number three
17:40 - sprite
17:41 - here so instead of
17:45 - you see where we where we have right
17:47 - this broadcast right select sprite three
17:49 - right so
17:50 - we're going to number three so we have
17:52 - to say select
17:53 - sprite number three so this is number
17:55 - three you can see right three
17:57 - so three three right this is correct
18:00 - this is good
18:01 - what is not good is this one so we have
18:03 - to change this so instead of cover two
18:06 - we are going to do the message say
18:09 - show cover three
18:16 - although i'm gonna copy this so i can
18:18 - reuse that later
18:19 - so make sure you change this and this
18:22 - okay
18:23 - and then you get you will see it where
18:25 - we're gonna do more practice on this
18:28 - okay so now let's go to number four
18:32 - so be sure to select this to number four
18:35 - okay and then here hold the new message
18:40 - cover number four okay got it so four
18:44 - four
18:44 - four you see that looks good let's go to
18:47 - number five with sprite number five
18:50 - so this one you say select number five
18:55 - and here we'll create a new message
19:00 - cover number five okay
19:04 - five we're good now let's go six
19:07 - this one we have to select number six
19:11 - okay and we need a new message
19:15 - number six okay you have six six and
19:19 - six okay looks good now let's go to
19:23 - this one you select number seven
19:27 - and new message again cover
19:30 - seven okay now let's go
19:33 - number eight
19:37 - i think this is a little boring to set
19:38 - it up but once you finish
19:40 - all of it and you really like the game
19:43 - and this is number eight right i think
19:46 - yep it's okay okay now
19:49 - number nine
19:54 - and then say new message again
19:58 - and number nine oops
20:03 - i almost got 39 there sorry about that
20:07 - okay now we're on to number 10 almost
20:10 - done
20:12 - and this is show cover
20:16 - number 10 then
20:20 - 11 oops
20:25 - 11 and then say
20:29 - show cover 11
20:33 - and then we're on number 12
20:38 - and then new message
20:41 - cover number 12. okay
20:44 - so this is done for the sprite here
20:47 - we'll
20:47 - go back to the box again so you remember
20:50 - the box here right this
20:52 - where the select three okay so instead
20:55 - of cover
20:56 - two with the select cover three there's
20:58 - a bit of this number three box
21:00 - this one where the select cover four
21:03 - okay just
21:04 - keep going we're almost done i think
21:06 - this is the last part
21:09 - this is a cover number five so just make
21:12 - sure that
21:13 - all these are matching five five five
21:15 - five and this is number five now well
21:17 - number six
21:19 - so this is number six
21:22 - seven okay
21:25 - [Music]
21:28 - eight
21:32 - nine
21:36 - ten i hope i didn't mess up anything
21:40 - eleven if it messed up we'll see it
21:44 - 12. okay all right let me save my game
21:48 - as always remember to save your code you
21:51 - never know scratch will crash and you'll
21:52 - lose all your thing
21:54 - okay all right so we are good let's try
21:56 - it again let's run the game and see if
21:58 - it works
22:00 - okay all right so the cat's gonna say
22:03 - something
22:03 - and they're gonna sell all the sprite so
22:05 - we have see you see all the match here
22:08 - right so let's let me just pick
22:10 - something
22:11 - it did not match it closed it so this
22:13 - should be number one
22:14 - two three four five six seven eight so
22:17 - number one and eight so i'm gonna open
22:18 - one and eight so you see a match it
22:21 - stays on
22:21 - [Music]
22:23 - and this is i don't know one two three
22:26 - four five six i'm kind of cheating here
22:29 - six so kendall
22:33 - kendall good pat and i don't know that's
22:36 - here oh good
22:38 - wizard hat uh here okay
22:42 - okay so you see you have all the match
22:45 - right
22:46 - good so far looks correct
22:49 - so we have incorrect match let's see
22:54 - incorrect match a close match
22:57 - it open right i'm just i'm i'm not
23:01 - looking over here i'm just
23:02 - testing it right so you see this so
23:05 - faint
23:05 - see i think it's working fine so far so
23:09 - good
23:09 - right okay all right so what we're
23:12 - missing is just adding some uh
23:15 - touch up to the game maybe some music in
23:18 - the background
23:19 - and then at the end we have to say you
23:20 - know win or lose or something like that
23:24 - okay okay now let's go back to the cat
23:29 - oh we gotta move over here a bit
23:33 - on the cat okay so we do have something
23:35 - called broadcast you win
23:38 - right so what we can do is we can like
23:40 - maybe say happy halloween or something
23:42 - at the end
23:43 - right okay so let's paint a new sprite
23:47 - paint and let's use some text here
23:50 - uh you can choose whatever font you want
23:53 - marker or whatever
23:55 - and then we'll type it up
23:59 - happy halloween
24:04 - okay and then you can change the purple
24:07 - or green or whatever you like
24:08 - whatever color i think purple looks okay
24:13 - i think in the original game i have
24:15 - actually have a green
24:19 - [Music]
24:20 - maybe green looks better i don't know
24:22 - green like kind of like a slimy
24:26 - green you can choose any color yes
24:30 - okay let's try this color so yeah yeah
24:32 - this looks pretty good
24:34 - okay all right so what we're going to do
24:37 - is we are going to
24:39 - code this up real quick so when the
24:41 - green flap is clicked
24:43 - [Music]
24:45 - uh what we're going to do is say we have
24:48 - only one costume but in case you have
24:50 - more you can say switch different custom
24:52 - we'll say hi
24:55 - and then event let's go event
24:58 - okay when i receive you win
25:04 - ah then let's go to
25:07 - certain position i think here's okay
25:10 - maybe do it zero
25:12 - and then 30 is fine doesn't matter 30 50
25:16 - whatever
25:17 - uh what we want to do is we're going to
25:18 - go to front left so that'll cover
25:20 - everything
25:22 - and we can put a little weight
25:26 - so maybe like
25:29 - my 5 second
25:31 - [Music]
25:33 - or whatever whatever you want and then
25:35 - what we can do is uh broadcast
25:42 - i'll maybe three seconds and then five
25:44 - might be long
25:48 - uh let's see i think we might we can do
25:51 - it you win maybe
25:52 - maybe i think i have more than one
25:54 - costume in the beginning
25:59 - okay so i do have another costume so
26:03 - okay so let me make a new one let's
26:06 - do this open another sprite
26:10 - [Music]
26:12 - so we're going to copy this
26:16 - okay maybe we can change this to another
26:18 - color
26:20 - kind of purple let's see
26:23 - good job
26:28 - okay good job you did it or whatever
26:30 - good job
26:32 - you won
26:37 - so this is for the uh
26:41 - so for the when you actually beat the
26:44 - game first time
26:45 - and then we'll say happy hour when at
26:47 - the end i think that looks a little bit
26:48 - better
26:49 - let's try this so we'll move this
26:52 - we'll change this to let's make this
26:55 - i'll
26:55 - change it to three for now we'll put
26:57 - this as one
27:00 - and we'll put this two okay so we'll
27:03 - first we'll draw
27:04 - good job you won okay
27:08 - and then and then here saying happy
27:11 - halloween okay
27:12 - all right so when you win the first time
27:15 - we are going to
27:16 - so that's why i had the switching
27:18 - costume okay let's switch to costume
27:20 - number one
27:22 - and hi and then we will
27:26 - say
27:29 - go the front layer uh show what this is
27:32 - show
27:34 - uh wait for three seconds or five
27:37 - seconds whatever you like
27:39 - and then you can say broadcast we're
27:42 - gonna use a broadcast and wait
27:43 - on so what we want to do is make sure
27:48 - everything whatever we want to do is
27:49 - we're going to hide everything at the
27:51 - end and then say happy hour it looks
27:52 - good
27:53 - so what has a new message say hi all
27:58 - okay i owe on weight
28:02 - and then after finish hiding everything
28:04 - will come back here
28:06 - what we can do is we are going to say
28:08 - switch to costume number two which is
28:10 - happy halloween
28:12 - and then we are going to use something
28:15 - called
28:16 - stop all yeah okay so what we need to do
28:20 - is we're going to hide everything
28:22 - at the end so let's go back
28:26 - to the cat
28:30 - okay i think the cat is fine we'll leave
28:32 - the cat here so that he can stay happy
28:34 - how wins i will leave from here
28:35 - let's go back to this guy now what we're
28:39 - saying is uh we are going to
28:42 - say hi or
28:45 - what we're going to do is do height
28:50 - okay since we have show in here should
28:53 - be
28:53 - good so what we're going to do is we're
28:55 - going to drag this
28:57 - high or to all the sprite one
29:03 - two
29:07 - i think this is a little bit messed up
29:09 - when you have too many sprites so what
29:11 - you can
29:12 - do is make this smaller so that all
29:15 - comes in one
29:16 - so it's a little easier so you see this
29:18 - one high always there
29:20 - this one is also there
29:22 - [Music]
29:24 - this is good so i think the we're gonna
29:27 - drag it like this i think this one
29:29 - doesn't have it yet right okay let's go
29:32 - so we're gonna track this over here hi
29:34 - oh
29:36 - we're gonna move this over here a little
29:38 - bit so easier okay
29:40 - so i'm gonna go to the teeth one
29:44 - two three
29:49 - four five
29:52 - okay we are this guy almost done
29:56 - six seven
30:00 - eight okay so we're gonna have the cover
30:03 - box
30:04 - so let's see if it works i think if it
30:07 - hides everything
30:08 - then that we know it's work at the very
30:10 - end
30:11 - so we want to kind of hide it and then
30:13 - show the little background the end that
30:15 - looks good
30:16 - so we are number five here
30:20 - so let's move over here a little bit
30:23 - let's do number six
30:27 - seven eight
30:31 - nine oops nine i don't know if i got 10
30:35 - or not no
30:36 - i did not number 9
30:39 - okay
30:43 - 10 11 make sure you drag from the front
30:47 - here
30:48 - 2 and 12. okay all right so i think we
30:52 - have
30:52 - all of it let's try it again
30:56 - okay let's try the game in the beginning
30:59 - let's
31:00 - let's run re-run the game so this sets
31:02 - up everything right
31:04 - okay so let's see
31:08 - these two okay i'm trying to look over
31:10 - here
31:12 - the frog i don't know right here i don't
31:14 - know oh wow
31:16 - okay this and i don't know this
31:19 - okay this isn't this no
31:23 - this an orient no
31:26 - isn't this this isn't this
31:31 - eyeball and then last match
31:34 - okay so it's a good job you won
31:38 - okay and then see i missed two of them
31:41 - so which one is that one two three four
31:44 - five six seven so six and seven i don't
31:47 - have
31:48 - so i'm gonna have to put high on six and
31:50 - seven one two three four
31:52 - five six seven
31:56 - so six is here doesn't have a high or
31:59 - let's drag that to number six
32:03 - so this thing is really annoying let's
32:06 - make it smaller
32:10 - is it number six yeah this is number six
32:13 - number five is here number six
32:16 - and number seven so now number six has
32:20 - it
32:21 - number seven also have it so i think
32:24 - we're good
32:26 - okay i think we had some music also in
32:29 - the beginning of my game
32:30 - let's add that okay so we're gonna go to
32:33 - the
32:34 - here and then sound
32:36 - [Music]
32:38 - i think you guys have you know how to do
32:39 - this it's pretty easy
32:42 - i think i will use k earlier
32:45 - and then go back and then
32:49 - when again flag is clicked it's always
32:52 - good to add sound to your game
32:54 - it makes your game a lot better okay
32:57 - all right so let's see sound play until
33:00 - done so continue playing this forever
33:04 - okay all right let's run the game again
33:08 - so we have the music going it's a little
33:10 - bit loud let me kind of turn it down a
33:12 - little bit
33:14 - [Music]
33:17 - okay all right let's see let me try to
33:19 - play the game
33:20 - as is i'll make it full screen
33:24 - okay so i cannot cheat
33:27 - okay okay
33:32 - good i have a match no
33:36 - this guy
33:39 - oh how

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys to kids coding playground um today i think we will be able to finish up the uh memory game uh halloween memory game um so um if you guys have not watched uh one two and three uh be sure to watch that before you get to this one i think we might be able to finish everything today for this uh game okay so what we left off last time was we created the uh two uh cover cards where we click on it you know review the the icon below i in this uh despite below like let me run it over with you one time for you guys to see so you click on it it will show up if you click on the other card or so we've played one choice one you click on this you have player choice two if it doesn't match it will close the card again so pretty much we get the basic of the game how it actually works so all we need to do is the easy part just creating duplicating the sprite and make sure we get the correct broadcast message okay so before i begin please like share and subscribe to our channel and ring the notification bell so that you get all the latest update from our channel all right let me just go over the code a little bit in case you guys miss anything just kind of copy it down so this is where we do the match of the number we'll break the input and then we assign what is the correct match for the sprite and then we'll broadcast a message to switch the costume for this price here okay so this is the game when it's setting up just uh some variable that we set up to initialize and delete the list and these are the 12 numbers for the number list because we have 12 uh 12 boxes and six pair and this is more set up this is related to the each of the uh sprite so how many however many sprite costumes you had in here so let's say you have 50 so 1 to 50 then you take all all these name and you put it into your uh your your list here okay all right so pretty easy there and then this is the prepared game basically we picked out six different sets of um six different sets of pair uh and then we assign each of the pair with the number list to combine they have you know like this one number pipe and another cat number so we use that to break the pair okay and then in the bottom here is the just set up the the sprite the game you know uh we're calling this set up the sprite way to go break up the number and then this is the game instruction okay and over here this is the checking the end set is correct or not okay if it's not correct or broadcast the cover card so cover card will go back over here is not the same if it's not in the name list basically if it match we'll put it into this player selected match list if it's not matching then you know we'll we'll cover the card again and this is just checking you know if the player click on the first choice or set it to the first choice it's not there else to send it to the second choice okay i hope you guys understand that and then this is the cover where we're showing you know if the broadcast show cover one will have to show it and cover the card again and then this uh checking if it's the the game has started or not before you allow them to click on the sprite so just making sure that you know while the game is setting up we should not allow the player to click on the sprite uh the box to reveal the card underneath because it's not ready yet okay so i think we have everything that we need i don't think background of cool yeah no code there okay all right so what we need to do is just going to duplicate some of these um sprite so what i'm going to do is i have two so i'm going to have to get 10 more of these so right click duplicate one two three four five six seven eight nine and ten so total we have twelve right one twelve twelve of these right one two three four five five ten twelve right so we have 12 boxes okay uh what we need to do is i'm going to hide these two lists i think you guys are really familiar with this and the choice we don't need to see them anymore so that way we have more space to work on it okay i'm gonna hide this and hide these okay so we have all our sprites here um so what i'm going to do i have all the coordinates down for each of the sprite where they're supposed to show up uh you know if you uh you can copy my coordinates uh you know so that you have nicely layout if not you can just move them and try to align it correctly okay okay so what we're going to do this is number three we are going to change it to 60 ends up negative 60 okay and then this is number four for number four we are going at 180 so that will fill up the first row okay let's go to number five so for number five this is number five we're going to negative 180 which is going to be somewhere here then number six number six will keep that uh uh 60 okay i think i messed up number five got to change the y so change the y to five so number six will change negative 60 and then y to five and then number seven so this will be sixty and y should be five so just kinda put them together and number eight we'll do 180 positive 180 and then five number nine so number nine we'll do at one negative 180 and negative 110 somewhere in the bottom okay somewhere here and then this one negative 60 we'll do negative 110 this is equal to positive 60 negative 110 and the last one is i then 180 and negative 110. i think this is correct okay so now we have all the sprite what we have to do is we're going to go right back change this to all the broadcast messages is set up sprite 2 and it should be set up sprite uh you know whatever 12 or whatever but before we do that we're going to go back to the cat first okay scroll over to the side here where we're setting up the uh each of the uh broadcast message right okay and what we're going to do is we're going to break this up a little bit over here because this is podcast number two we don't want to mess with that yet we want to all the broadcast one first so just duplicate right click on this duplicate this stack it over here so this is one two and this is only three and then we'll call it setup i'll call it setup sprite number three set up sprite three i'm going to copy this so i'll remember where i am so this is one two three right now number four and then we'll say new message sprite number four okay let me stop this let me show okay now we have four of them i think we'll be faster this time okay so this is number five six seven eight so we have four i5 so now let's new message set up sprite number five this is six sorry forgot to change that make sure i didn't miss anything one two three four five six seven eight yeah okay number five is number five number six so this is a little bit tedious but you kind of have to get it set it up uh make sure you don't mess up anything in between if you do then you might mess it up seven and this is number eight okay so so far we have eight i think we need four more okay so let's do four more eight nine ten eleven twelve right so we'll duplicate from here we'll do it over here first so we know nine ten eleven and twelve and then what we're going to do is this is number nine so new message number nine now message number 10 okay your message number 11 no message number so we're done with all the uh broadcast message for uh broadcast one which we have to repeat the same thing for broadcast two so similarly we have broadcast two one right so let's do that so i'm gonna right click on this top i am going to just change it here so it's a broadcast one with a right click say broadcast two so leave these the same so this and this should be the same just change the variable here so just keep going down change it change it so make sure you don't miss anything so if you miss it you you know you you'll be incorrect okay podcast two broadcast two broadcast two broadcast two so we have okay we have two two two two two so far so good two two two two so number ten broadcast two podcast two eleven broadcast two so we have everything so let's see yep looks like we do have everything okay all right so we don't need this anymore we'll trash this and we'll take this one let's zoom out a little bit we are going to join it to the end here okay all right so i think we have all of it so now let's go back to our sprite number three right we have set up so it says setup sprite number two let's say set up sprite number three okay we have to change this also later okay don't worry about that that's for the select and then we have to change that also change all this broadcasted three so let's just finish this piece here so let's go through this is number four so you can see right how to win four so wall to number four this is how in five number five so we kind of let's just do all this now number six oops number six this is number seven this one is number eight this is number nine ten eleven and twelve okay so i'm gonna run it once if it actually works to set up okay it might not work it might work i don't know let's just move these guys to the end here and this one to the end okay so we have all this one let's run it let me save it let's run wow so they're all set up correctly right and then once it's changed see we have all the match okay so we have the girl this one this match right the two frog this guy match this guy match so i think it's correct let's run it again let's run again and we should all the match so match match match match match yep yep good so i think our matching one is good so what we need to do now is um we'll have to do the cover and then we have to uh make sure that we have we have gotten all the correct uh setup you know like here i select sprite 2 it should be number 12 and all that so i'm going to make sure that we do all that correctly so let's duplicate this cover cards okay whether do we 10 more so uh so that will cover everything okay duplicate one two three four five six seven eight nine and 10. so we have 10 of these now let's make sure that we have to set them all up to correct location let's do this first so we are going to set them to go to sprite halloween sprite number three so this is our card number three right cover three we'll go to three okay four we'll go to four let's just do these like this first and then we'll go back to finished out of one five because i don't want you guys to mess up six seven eight nine ten eleven and last one okay so make sure that these cover card goes to the right location okay so let's run it again so you can see all the cover cards are going to the right location covering all the sprites behind okay all right so now we are going to have to fix all these cover cards so we are going to start with number three so here you see all these two with the changes to three so instead of select sprite two and wait okay we have to we're going to have to say select sprite three okay okay so this you don't want to mess with the condition here this should be good right only thing you need to change is this okay okay so we say select sprite three new message selected sprite number three okay i'm gonna copy this so okay so select sprite three for number three let's go through and do all these first okay here we'll do a new message this is number four okay this one is number five this is number six this is number seven okay new message number eight this one is number nine message number ten so as you can see we're using a lot of broadcast message to interact between the sprites so this will give you a good practice i guess with the broadcast messages and this is number 12. so we have all the uh select sprite this looks correct only thing is not correct is this cover so this comes from the other sprite to broadcast back so what we need to do is we have all the cover done let's go back to our custom number three sprite here so instead of you see where we where we have right this broadcast right select sprite three right so we're going to number three so we have to say select sprite number three so this is number three you can see right three so three three right this is correct this is good what is not good is this one so we have to change this so instead of cover two we are going to do the message say show cover three although i'm gonna copy this so i can reuse that later so make sure you change this and this okay and then you get you will see it where we're gonna do more practice on this okay so now let's go to number four so be sure to select this to number four okay and then here hold the new message cover number four okay got it so four four four you see that looks good let's go to number five with sprite number five so this one you say select number five and here we'll create a new message cover number five okay five we're good now let's go six this one we have to select number six okay and we need a new message number six okay you have six six and six okay looks good now let's go to this one you select number seven and new message again cover seven okay now let's go number eight i think this is a little boring to set it up but once you finish all of it and you really like the game and this is number eight right i think yep it's okay okay now number nine and then say new message again and number nine oops i almost got 39 there sorry about that okay now we're on to number 10 almost done and this is show cover number 10 then 11 oops 11 and then say show cover 11 and then we're on number 12 and then new message cover number 12. okay so this is done for the sprite here we'll go back to the box again so you remember the box here right this where the select three okay so instead of cover two with the select cover three there's a bit of this number three box this one where the select cover four okay just keep going we're almost done i think this is the last part this is a cover number five so just make sure that all these are matching five five five five and this is number five now well number six so this is number six seven okay eight nine ten i hope i didn't mess up anything eleven if it messed up we'll see it 12. okay all right let me save my game as always remember to save your code you never know scratch will crash and you'll lose all your thing okay all right so we are good let's try it again let's run the game and see if it works okay all right so the cat's gonna say something and they're gonna sell all the sprite so we have see you see all the match here right so let's let me just pick something it did not match it closed it so this should be number one two three four five six seven eight so number one and eight so i'm gonna open one and eight so you see a match it stays on and this is i don't know one two three four five six i'm kind of cheating here six so kendall kendall good pat and i don't know that's here oh good wizard hat uh here okay okay so you see you have all the match right good so far looks correct so we have incorrect match let's see incorrect match a close match it open right i'm just i'm i'm not looking over here i'm just testing it right so you see this so faint see i think it's working fine so far so good right okay all right so what we're missing is just adding some uh touch up to the game maybe some music in the background and then at the end we have to say you know win or lose or something like that okay okay now let's go back to the cat oh we gotta move over here a bit on the cat okay so we do have something called broadcast you win right so what we can do is we can like maybe say happy halloween or something at the end right okay so let's paint a new sprite paint and let's use some text here uh you can choose whatever font you want marker or whatever and then we'll type it up happy halloween okay and then you can change the purple or green or whatever you like whatever color i think purple looks okay i think in the original game i have actually have a green maybe green looks better i don't know green like kind of like a slimy green you can choose any color yes okay let's try this color so yeah yeah this looks pretty good okay all right so what we're going to do is we are going to code this up real quick so when the green flap is clicked uh what we're going to do is say we have only one costume but in case you have more you can say switch different custom we'll say hi and then event let's go event okay when i receive you win ah then let's go to certain position i think here's okay maybe do it zero and then 30 is fine doesn't matter 30 50 whatever uh what we want to do is we're going to go to front left so that'll cover everything and we can put a little weight so maybe like my 5 second or whatever whatever you want and then what we can do is uh broadcast i'll maybe three seconds and then five might be long uh let's see i think we might we can do it you win maybe maybe i think i have more than one costume in the beginning okay so i do have another costume so okay so let me make a new one let's do this open another sprite so we're going to copy this okay maybe we can change this to another color kind of purple let's see good job okay good job you did it or whatever good job you won so this is for the uh so for the when you actually beat the game first time and then we'll say happy hour when at the end i think that looks a little bit better let's try this so we'll move this we'll change this to let's make this i'll change it to three for now we'll put this as one and we'll put this two okay so we'll first we'll draw good job you won okay and then and then here saying happy halloween okay all right so when you win the first time we are going to so that's why i had the switching costume okay let's switch to costume number one and hi and then we will say go the front layer uh show what this is show uh wait for three seconds or five seconds whatever you like and then you can say broadcast we're gonna use a broadcast and wait on so what we want to do is make sure everything whatever we want to do is we're going to hide everything at the end and then say happy hour it looks good so what has a new message say hi all okay i owe on weight and then after finish hiding everything will come back here what we can do is we are going to say switch to costume number two which is happy halloween and then we are going to use something called stop all yeah okay so what we need to do is we're going to hide everything at the end so let's go back to the cat okay i think the cat is fine we'll leave the cat here so that he can stay happy how wins i will leave from here let's go back to this guy now what we're saying is uh we are going to say hi or what we're going to do is do height okay since we have show in here should be good so what we're going to do is we're going to drag this high or to all the sprite one two i think this is a little bit messed up when you have too many sprites so what you can do is make this smaller so that all comes in one so it's a little easier so you see this one high always there this one is also there this is good so i think the we're gonna drag it like this i think this one doesn't have it yet right okay let's go so we're gonna track this over here hi oh we're gonna move this over here a little bit so easier okay so i'm gonna go to the teeth one two three four five okay we are this guy almost done six seven eight okay so we're gonna have the cover box so let's see if it works i think if it hides everything then that we know it's work at the very end so we want to kind of hide it and then show the little background the end that looks good so we are number five here so let's move over here a little bit let's do number six seven eight nine oops nine i don't know if i got 10 or not no i did not number 9 okay 10 11 make sure you drag from the front here 2 and 12. okay all right so i think we have all of it let's try it again okay let's try the game in the beginning let's let's run rerun the game so this sets up everything right okay so let's see these two okay i'm trying to look over here the frog i don't know right here i don't know oh wow okay this and i don't know this okay this isn't this no this an orient no isn't this this isn't this eyeball and then last match okay so it's a good job you won okay and then see i missed two of them so which one is that one two three four five six seven so six and seven i don't have so i'm gonna have to put high on six and seven one two three four five six seven so six is here doesn't have a high or let's drag that to number six so this thing is really annoying let's make it smaller is it number six yeah this is number six number five is here number six and number seven so now number six has it number seven also have it so i think we're good okay i think we had some music also in the beginning of my game let's add that okay so we're gonna go to the here and then sound i think you guys have you know how to do this it's pretty easy i think i will use k earlier and then go back and then when again flag is clicked it's always good to add sound to your game it makes your game a lot better okay all right so let's see sound play until done so continue playing this forever okay all right let's run the game again so we have the music going it's a little bit loud let me kind of turn it down a little bit okay all right let's see let me try to play the game as is i'll make it full screen okay so i cannot cheat okay okay good i have a match no this guy oh how oh man i'm not good with this okay this and this okay all right so you see good job you won and then stop all happy halloween you can see the background so
