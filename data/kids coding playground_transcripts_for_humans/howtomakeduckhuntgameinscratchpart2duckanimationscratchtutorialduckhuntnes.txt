00:00 - [Music]
00:08 - hello guys welcome back to kids going
00:10 - playground so today we'll continue with
00:12 - the duck hunt game
00:14 - last week i mean a previous video we
00:16 - were just showing you how to do the
00:18 - target
00:19 - and then when you fire the shot you know
00:21 - it subtract one bullet from here if you
00:23 - have no more bullet you cannot shoot
00:25 - so that's what we have left off last
00:27 - time
00:28 - so uh today we'll work on the ducks and
00:31 - uh you know for the code to make the
00:32 - duck fly and all that stuff
00:35 - all right so without further ado let's
00:37 - jump right in
00:39 - so let's create some variable
00:41 - so
00:42 - okay so i do have the previous i do have
00:45 - the variable because uh what happened is
00:48 - i dragged this in so that's why i had it
00:50 - so anyway let me just delete it real
00:52 - quick
00:53 - okay i'm going to delete this delete
00:55 - this and then delete this so for the
00:57 - bullet it's for all sprite okay for duck
01:01 - getting shot uh like the duck got hit
01:04 - that will be all sprite as well uh okay
01:07 - and then right now we are going to
01:09 - create some sprite for the duck only
01:11 - okay for this sprite so we're gonna have
01:13 - to select for this sprite only
01:16 - okay so we're gonna have
01:19 - uh
01:20 - okay so here we're gonna create called
01:23 - dot
01:24 - speed so basically how fast the
01:27 - uh speed is you can create for all
01:30 - variables we have only one ducks i
01:32 - created for this priority just in case
01:34 - later we could create like multiple
01:36 - ducks then we can use that so let's just
01:39 - do with
01:40 - for this sprite only okay so let's
01:42 - create another one
01:45 - so this is dot
01:46 - up
01:47 - down speed
01:49 - so this is for up and down when the duct
01:51 - go up and down
01:53 - we want to set the speed as well
01:56 - and then
01:58 - okay so next we're going to put
02:00 - something called index
02:02 - this is for like a loop position we need
02:04 - that
02:06 - to loop those things in the for the
02:07 - ducks so for this bright only as well
02:10 - and then last one we're gonna create one
02:12 - more called duck count so how many ducks
02:14 - are there so this one's for allspray
02:17 - okay so let's let's uh we can we can
02:20 - either
02:21 - take this out but you can also keep it
02:23 - on doesn't matter so for now we're gonna
02:25 - set i'm gonna go with the new new flag
02:28 - uh green flag is clicked
02:30 - so what we're going to do is we are
02:32 - going to set the duck council since
02:35 - we're going to have 10 ducks to shoot
02:37 - so
02:38 - i will say set
02:41 - okay the count to 10
02:44 - okay after this i am going to set the
02:47 - duck rotation
02:50 - okay to left and right so that the dot
02:52 - doesn't flip upside down
02:55 - uh since okay and then i'm gonna say hi
02:57 - so in the beginning we'll hide it
03:02 - all right so we will create some custom
03:04 - block for this dock
03:06 - called
03:07 - animate
03:09 - dot so basically make the duct kind of
03:11 - like move
03:13 - okay so we're going to do this so we'll
03:16 - say switch to costume
03:19 - we're gonna switch to costume number
03:20 - four
03:22 - okay so number four is the duck
03:25 - that is flying around this one okay
03:27 - we're gonna use one two three four fly
03:29 - away when the duck fly away we'll use
03:31 - one two three four five
03:33 - six we're gonna use it to fly around and
03:35 - then seven is when it gets shot and then
03:38 - a is when it's falling down okay
03:40 - all right so we'll start with number
03:41 - four
03:43 - and then we'll say go to front layer
03:46 - okay
03:47 - and then we are going to say show since
03:49 - we have high here we have to have show
03:51 - okay
03:53 - and then we have uh forever
03:57 - okay we'll have to put in a condition
03:59 - check here because we want to check only
04:02 - make the duct flying if it's not get
04:04 - shot yet
04:05 - so we are going to use the operator here
04:08 - so what we what i'm doing is zero so
04:11 - zeros meaning the duck have not get shot
04:13 - so one is when the duck got shot okay
04:16 - all right so we're gonna say
04:18 - shot is equal to zero that means they
04:20 - have not got shot yet so what we want to
04:23 - do is we're gonna switch to um
04:26 - number four again so we're gonna switch
04:29 - this costume
04:30 - we're gonna do a little weight here
04:34 - uh 0.1 second
04:37 - since we have a three costume for the
04:39 - flying we're just going to kind of do
04:42 - one more duplicate here
04:44 - okay so we'll duck four
04:46 - duck five and then duck
04:49 - six okay
04:50 - so this is how you make the duck
04:52 - animated ducks
04:54 - so unless
04:57 - okay all right so we you remember when
05:00 - the dog i think uh
05:02 - here has something broadcast stock game
05:04 - when the dog uh jumped into the uh the
05:06 - grass here so we're gonna use that so
05:11 - here what we're going to do is when i
05:13 - receive
05:15 - slot game i'm going to call my block
05:17 - anime ducks so this will animate the
05:20 - ducks
05:21 - okay so let's let's try real quick
05:24 - let's see
05:26 - so the dog will come in
05:29 - we might be able to just take this out
05:31 - for now so a little bit faster so you
05:33 - can see the duck is flying you see that
05:35 - it's flying right here right so this is
05:37 - animated block this is for duck fly so
05:39 - we haven't make it move up and down yet
05:41 - we'll do that in a bit
05:44 - okay
05:46 - okay so we're gonna make a new list
05:48 - variable
05:50 - so what this is going to help us is keep
05:52 - track of uh which duck got shot
05:54 - or died and which dog you missed so that
05:57 - we could uh display either red or white
05:59 - right on the bottom
06:00 - so we'll go up
06:02 - shot
06:03 - list okay for all sprite
06:06 - okay so this list is empty
06:08 - so what we want to do is when the game
06:10 - start
06:11 - okay
06:12 - so
06:15 - we are going to uh reset it so first
06:18 - we're gonna delete all the things in
06:20 - here first
06:23 - okay delete
06:26 - and then i'm going to do a repeat loop
06:29 - 10 times we're going to have 10 ducks
06:31 - and then i am going to use the uh there
06:33 - uh this one we're gonna add this
06:35 - variable in here we're gonna add
06:38 - everything with negative one so negative
06:40 - one meaning you know we haven't started
06:42 - yet or you missed it okay
06:44 - zero we're gonna say is uh starting the
06:46 - the ducks and then one is when you
06:48 - actually get hit the ducks i'll show you
06:50 - a little bit later so let's say if i
06:52 - click on this it'll run it and what it
06:54 - does it's gonna fill up ten of them and
06:56 - it's gonna be negative one so you can
06:58 - see one two ten right or negative one
07:01 - right
07:02 - so
07:03 - that's how much that's how we had so far
07:06 - so what we're going to do is we're going
07:07 - to use it on this one so we're going to
07:08 - put like the uh the uh
07:11 - the hit the hit count it's going to be
07:13 - in the front
07:14 - so we can see it okay and then we can
07:16 - add arrange those little ducks on it
07:20 - okay so while we're here let's just
07:22 - finish this part here so what we're
07:24 - going to do is when green flap is
07:26 - clicked
07:27 - uh we are just going to put in this
07:29 - position
07:30 - since i had it last time so that's why
07:33 - it had that position basically somewhere
07:35 - in the bottoms if you see it
07:37 - you can see it right now because like
07:39 - the grass is here but if i click on it
07:41 - you see the little flash so that's kind
07:42 - of where it is and then i say when green
07:45 - flags click it's going to hide this
07:49 - when uh start game
07:51 - okay this is when the
07:53 - dog jump to the back
07:55 - start game what we want to do is we're
07:56 - going to go to the front layer
07:58 - okay
08:00 - and then we'll say show
08:01 - okay let's let's try it let's
08:04 - uh so what i'm going to do is going to
08:05 - take out the code for the
08:07 - dock for now okay so that way we don't
08:09 - need to do do with the dog so let's just
08:12 - duplicate this over here
08:14 - and we are going to use the broadcast so
08:17 - we don't have to see the dog kind of
08:19 - moving so faster for us
08:22 - for testing okay
08:24 - okay all right so you can see the hitbox
08:28 - comes in the front you have the ducts
08:29 - kind of flying over here and then you
08:31 - have the list populated okay all right
08:36 - okay so we're gonna go back to the ducts
08:37 - right now
08:39 - so so far we have this code for the
08:41 - ducks
08:42 - uh
08:43 - i will actually have to create another
08:45 - custom block called ducks flying so what
08:47 - we're going to do is make the
08:49 - kind of fly up and down so let's make a
08:51 - new custom block
08:53 - called
08:55 - flying
08:56 - okay
08:58 - say okay so this is another custom block
09:01 - over here
09:03 - uh what we're going to do is since we
09:05 - have 10 ducks so the first time the
09:06 - ducks fly we're gonna subtract one so
09:09 - making
09:10 - making uh one less so you have one less
09:12 - so account five minus one so we have
09:15 - nine ducks right so what happened is i
09:17 - gonna subtract one from the ten dots and
09:19 - then i can set the index so we're gonna
09:22 - use this index to set the uh you know
09:24 - set the uh
09:25 - this point uh this little position here
09:28 - so let's do that
09:29 - so you say set
09:32 - uh indexes for the loop right so we can
09:35 - say it's 10 i'm going to use operator
09:39 - okay operator minus
09:43 - what we're going to say is 10
09:46 - minus the dot count
09:48 - okay
09:49 - so i i'll show you why we need that so
09:51 - let's just take this out a little bit so
09:53 - let's say the duck count
09:55 - for instance let's set the so when when
09:57 - you when you have 10 ducks right when
09:59 - you send the first duck out
10:02 - we do a subtract one right so it'll be
10:04 - nine right so if this has become nine
10:06 - you do ten minus nine is what one right
10:09 - so that way that means you know you're
10:11 - in position one of this so what we're
10:13 - going to do is we're gonna change this
10:14 - variable here from um you know uh so
10:17 - that we can know okay if the ducks get
10:19 - hit or not so we have using this list we
10:21 - can keep track of which duck got hit
10:24 - okay so that's why we need that so we do
10:27 - 10 minus that so let's say next time
10:29 - your duck is at number eight so let's
10:31 - say the second dot right you can
10:33 - subtract one again so it's gonna be
10:35 - eight so if it's eight then ten minus
10:37 - eight will be two so you're in position
10:39 - two for the second duck so this is kind
10:42 - of going backward using this going
10:44 - forward that way you can point out which
10:46 - position you are in okay so i hope you
10:49 - guys understand that so let's continue
10:52 - okay
10:53 - all right so what we're going to do is
10:54 - we're going to use something called
10:55 - replace
10:57 - okay so we're going to replace the item
10:59 - at the index so this index i just told
11:02 - you right so right now let's say not 10
11:04 - minus 9 is 1 so index is position 1
11:07 - right so we're going to say hey replace
11:09 - the index
11:10 - uh
11:11 - the
11:12 - position okay the index here
11:16 - uh in this duck shot list with zero so
11:19 - basically zeros meaning the ducks is the
11:21 - one that is flying this one is the one
11:23 - that's
11:25 - flying or in process of flying okay and
11:28 - then we're gonna broadcast something
11:29 - called
11:31 - uh new message here
11:34 - we're gonna call this uh next duck so
11:36 - this one is going to help us to
11:39 - uh
11:40 - set up the ducks to to show and blink
11:43 - okay so we're gonna use that we will do
11:45 - that some we will use that later just
11:47 - have this broadcast for now
11:49 - then we are going to use the go to
11:51 - position
11:53 - go to
11:54 - and then we are going to use the pick
11:56 - random
11:58 - so i'm going to use a negative 180 to
12:01 - 180 so somewhere on the
12:04 - top left and right let me just hide this
12:06 - i'll put this over here for now so
12:08 - basically the duct says somewhere like
12:10 - here you see this 188 right so we'll
12:13 - keep it around 180 somewhere around here
12:15 - and then somewhere around here okay
12:18 - all right
12:19 - okay and then the y position we're gonna
12:22 - make him
12:23 - like the ducks trying to kind of fly
12:25 - around this area so i i put uh
12:27 - so
12:28 - if you go down here you can see the y
12:30 - changing right uh what i did was i did
12:32 - like around 35 so so 35 maybe a little
12:36 - bit down so from this part you know c34
12:39 - to kind of like this part so one 150 ish
12:42 - okay so uh oh i i did 135 okay 135 is
12:47 - good enough so this is when it first
12:49 - start so we're gonna put it as 35 to 135
12:53 - okay
12:54 - all right so they'll keep the ducks
12:56 - around this area
12:58 - and then next we're going to use a
13:00 - little weight
13:02 - weight 0.1
13:04 - so with this we're gonna have to set up
13:07 - the other into stuff so we're gonna do a
13:09 - little wait here before it's done
13:11 - okay now we're gonna change the duct
13:13 - speed
13:14 - okay we're gonna set
13:17 - the duct speed
13:19 - so this is how fast that fly
13:22 - uh what i'm going to do
13:24 - i mean if you want a little slower then
13:26 - make a smaller number so what i'm going
13:28 - to do is from two to
13:30 - four so
13:32 - so some ducks will fly a little bit
13:34 - slower some is faster okay
13:36 - then we're gonna get this forever loop
13:39 - here let's look sorry
13:42 - here
13:44 - so this will make it uh fly around and
13:46 - we're going to use the operator also
13:48 - want to check make sure the duct is not
13:50 - dead before we allow it to fly so
13:53 - remember we're using this variable check
13:56 - so we'll use the same one basically the
13:58 - duct shot is zero meaning the duct has
14:00 - not died yet so we are allowed to fly
14:03 - and then we are going to
14:05 - use another thing so this is a variable
14:09 - called uh
14:10 - up and down speed what i'm going to do
14:12 - is just increase by four so what we're
14:15 - going to do is kind of keep this going
14:17 - it doesn't really matter and then we're
14:18 - going to use a cosine to make it a small
14:21 - number and then like a small variation
14:23 - so the duck is going to go up and down
14:25 - okay
14:27 - all right so
14:28 - next okay so we're gonna use the if
14:32 - condition here
14:33 - so we will put that into here
14:37 - inside here okay
14:40 - okay so if
14:42 - either it is touching the ground which
14:44 - is this ground sprite here this guy or
14:46 - the edges on the edges we're gonna have
14:48 - to bounce him around
14:50 - so we'll say or
14:54 - and then we are using the sensing
14:57 - so this is touching the edge
15:01 - or
15:03 - touching the ground sprite okay stop
15:06 - this
15:07 - the ground sprite
15:09 - then
15:11 - we're gonna change the direction so if
15:13 - it's uh touching the ground or the this
15:16 - one we're gonna change the direction
15:17 - we're gonna say
15:19 - direction
15:20 - point in direction
15:24 - okay and then we will use the operator
15:26 - multiplication operator multiply
15:31 - uh negative one
15:32 - times the direction so basically it's
15:35 - going to go opposite okay opposite way
15:37 - is going if it touch that let's say it's
15:39 - and uh if it's on the left then it goes
15:42 - to the right if it's an up to go down
15:44 - okay
15:46 - all right and then we're gonna move the
15:48 - ducts
15:50 - and then uh you remember we use the
15:52 - speed right duct speed here we're going
15:54 - to use that
15:55 - so
15:56 - we'll say duck speed
15:58 - okay so some duck says fast and that's
16:02 - uh slower okay
16:04 - then we're gonna have this two more r
16:07 - check inside
16:09 - so inside this uh edge
16:12 - okay
16:13 - we're gonna put this thing
16:15 - and we are going to say
16:18 - if the y position basically if the ducts
16:21 - y position
16:25 - is greater than
16:27 - 165
16:29 - we're gonna make it go down okay so
16:31 - we'll say change y
16:35 - y minus 10
16:39 - and then we're going to duplicate this
16:41 - we're actually going to have to use the
16:43 - other sign
16:45 - we're going to say use a less than sign
16:47 - if the y position
16:49 - is less than negative 18 somewhere in
16:52 - the bottom here where the ground is
16:54 - we are going to push it back up so we're
16:56 - going to change the y by 10.
16:59 - okay
17:01 - so far so good okay so now
17:05 - what we're going to do is
17:08 - and then if it doesn't touch the edge or
17:10 - the ground we also need to move the duct
17:12 - right so we're going to have another one
17:15 - say move
17:17 - and you have to put this under here
17:21 - okay
17:21 - so not the edge one so you see that it's
17:24 - outside the edge okay
17:26 - outside that that okay
17:28 - so you put it here and then you say move
17:30 - the duct speed as well
17:34 - and then you're going to say change y so
17:36 - what what we want to do is we want to
17:38 - make the dot kind of go up and down
17:40 - so we'll say change y
17:44 - and then we are going to use some
17:45 - operator to help us with this
17:48 - we're going to use that multiply
17:50 - okay
17:51 - and then we are going to use a cosine
17:56 - so cosine
17:58 - of
17:59 - the up and down speed
18:01 - with this up and down speed we're gonna
18:03 - use a divide operator also
18:06 - so put this up and down speed over here
18:08 - we're gonna say divide this by two
18:11 - and then we're gonna use that put it on
18:13 - the cosine
18:14 - and then put this into the
18:16 - multiplication
18:18 - so and then we're going to pick at
18:19 - random
18:22 - between
18:23 - two
18:24 - two six okay so making the kind of the
18:27 - the
18:28 - the ducks move up and down because this
18:30 - cosine could be a negative number a
18:32 - positive number and multiplying by two
18:34 - or six either go down or go up okay
18:37 - so take this whole block
18:40 - oopsie take this oh okay sorry
18:45 - take this whole thing drag it in here
18:47 - okay so let's take a look at the code
18:49 - again
18:50 - so this is the whole thing where the
18:52 - duct is flying
18:54 - and we have to call this custom block
18:57 - okay so we have the code here for the
18:59 - start game
19:01 - here we're going to call this custom
19:02 - block that's flying so you don't want to
19:05 - put these two together while in one
19:07 - block because let's say you have a
19:09 - forever loop here it will kind of wait
19:11 - over here and this one not activated so
19:14 - you have to separate into two different
19:16 - call
19:17 - okay so let's save it and let's test it
19:20 - out
19:21 - okay so let's test this out real quick
19:23 - and move this over here let's see so you
19:25 - can see the duct is flying you see
19:28 - it fly it goes up and it goes down so
19:31 - let me hide this box here i guess you'll
19:34 - see a little bit better so you can see
19:36 - it goes up
19:37 - so you see the duck is kind of flying
19:39 - around it hits the bottom it goes back
19:41 - up
19:42 - and then when it it hits down and go up
19:45 - and down so it's kind of like randomly
19:47 - flying so that's what we had so far okay
19:50 - all right
19:52 - okay so we have kind of the ducks flying
19:56 - around
19:57 - and uh we are able to see it kind of
19:59 - move up and down and it's animated so
20:01 - we'll probably stop right here for now
20:03 - and then in the next episode will show
20:05 - how you know you should the ducks and
20:08 - the ducks fall down and stuff like that
20:09 - and if you miss the dog will laugh at
20:11 - you so we will do that next time
20:14 - all right thank you guys and i'll see
20:15 - you guys next time be sure to like and
20:18 - share this video with your friends okay
20:20 - have a good day bye
20:27 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome back to kids going playground so today we'll continue with the duck hunt game last week i mean a previous video we were just showing you how to do the target and then when you fire the shot you know it subtract one bullet from here if you have no more bullet you cannot shoot so that's what we have left off last time so uh today we'll work on the ducks and uh you know for the code to make the duck fly and all that stuff all right so without further ado let's jump right in so let's create some variable so okay so i do have the previous i do have the variable because uh what happened is i dragged this in so that's why i had it so anyway let me just delete it real quick okay i'm going to delete this delete this and then delete this so for the bullet it's for all sprite okay for duck getting shot uh like the duck got hit that will be all sprite as well uh okay and then right now we are going to create some sprite for the duck only okay for this sprite so we're gonna have to select for this sprite only okay so we're gonna have uh okay so here we're gonna create called dot speed so basically how fast the uh speed is you can create for all variables we have only one ducks i created for this priority just in case later we could create like multiple ducks then we can use that so let's just do with for this sprite only okay so let's create another one so this is dot up down speed so this is for up and down when the duct go up and down we want to set the speed as well and then okay so next we're going to put something called index this is for like a loop position we need that to loop those things in the for the ducks so for this bright only as well and then last one we're gonna create one more called duck count so how many ducks are there so this one's for allspray okay so let's let's uh we can we can either take this out but you can also keep it on doesn't matter so for now we're gonna set i'm gonna go with the new new flag uh green flag is clicked so what we're going to do is we are going to set the duck council since we're going to have 10 ducks to shoot so i will say set okay the count to 10 okay after this i am going to set the duck rotation okay to left and right so that the dot doesn't flip upside down uh since okay and then i'm gonna say hi so in the beginning we'll hide it all right so we will create some custom block for this dock called animate dot so basically make the duct kind of like move okay so we're going to do this so we'll say switch to costume we're gonna switch to costume number four okay so number four is the duck that is flying around this one okay we're gonna use one two three four fly away when the duck fly away we'll use one two three four five six we're gonna use it to fly around and then seven is when it gets shot and then a is when it's falling down okay all right so we'll start with number four and then we'll say go to front layer okay and then we are going to say show since we have high here we have to have show okay and then we have uh forever okay we'll have to put in a condition check here because we want to check only make the duct flying if it's not get shot yet so we are going to use the operator here so what we what i'm doing is zero so zeros meaning the duck have not get shot so one is when the duck got shot okay all right so we're gonna say shot is equal to zero that means they have not got shot yet so what we want to do is we're gonna switch to um number four again so we're gonna switch this costume we're gonna do a little weight here uh 0.1 second since we have a three costume for the flying we're just going to kind of do one more duplicate here okay so we'll duck four duck five and then duck six okay so this is how you make the duck animated ducks so unless okay all right so we you remember when the dog i think uh here has something broadcast stock game when the dog uh jumped into the uh the grass here so we're gonna use that so here what we're going to do is when i receive slot game i'm going to call my block anime ducks so this will animate the ducks okay so let's let's try real quick let's see so the dog will come in we might be able to just take this out for now so a little bit faster so you can see the duck is flying you see that it's flying right here right so this is animated block this is for duck fly so we haven't make it move up and down yet we'll do that in a bit okay okay so we're gonna make a new list variable so what this is going to help us is keep track of uh which duck got shot or died and which dog you missed so that we could uh display either red or white right on the bottom so we'll go up shot list okay for all sprite okay so this list is empty so what we want to do is when the game start okay so we are going to uh reset it so first we're gonna delete all the things in here first okay delete and then i'm going to do a repeat loop 10 times we're going to have 10 ducks and then i am going to use the uh there uh this one we're gonna add this variable in here we're gonna add everything with negative one so negative one meaning you know we haven't started yet or you missed it okay zero we're gonna say is uh starting the the ducks and then one is when you actually get hit the ducks i'll show you a little bit later so let's say if i click on this it'll run it and what it does it's gonna fill up ten of them and it's gonna be negative one so you can see one two ten right or negative one right so that's how much that's how we had so far so what we're going to do is we're going to use it on this one so we're going to put like the uh the uh the hit the hit count it's going to be in the front so we can see it okay and then we can add arrange those little ducks on it okay so while we're here let's just finish this part here so what we're going to do is when green flap is clicked uh we are just going to put in this position since i had it last time so that's why it had that position basically somewhere in the bottoms if you see it you can see it right now because like the grass is here but if i click on it you see the little flash so that's kind of where it is and then i say when green flags click it's going to hide this when uh start game okay this is when the dog jump to the back start game what we want to do is we're going to go to the front layer okay and then we'll say show okay let's let's try it let's uh so what i'm going to do is going to take out the code for the dock for now okay so that way we don't need to do do with the dog so let's just duplicate this over here and we are going to use the broadcast so we don't have to see the dog kind of moving so faster for us for testing okay okay all right so you can see the hitbox comes in the front you have the ducts kind of flying over here and then you have the list populated okay all right okay so we're gonna go back to the ducts right now so so far we have this code for the ducks uh i will actually have to create another custom block called ducks flying so what we're going to do is make the kind of fly up and down so let's make a new custom block called flying okay say okay so this is another custom block over here uh what we're going to do is since we have 10 ducks so the first time the ducks fly we're gonna subtract one so making making uh one less so you have one less so account five minus one so we have nine ducks right so what happened is i gonna subtract one from the ten dots and then i can set the index so we're gonna use this index to set the uh you know set the uh this point uh this little position here so let's do that so you say set uh indexes for the loop right so we can say it's 10 i'm going to use operator okay operator minus what we're going to say is 10 minus the dot count okay so i i'll show you why we need that so let's just take this out a little bit so let's say the duck count for instance let's set the so when when you when you have 10 ducks right when you send the first duck out we do a subtract one right so it'll be nine right so if this has become nine you do ten minus nine is what one right so that way that means you know you're in position one of this so what we're going to do is we're gonna change this variable here from um you know uh so that we can know okay if the ducks get hit or not so we have using this list we can keep track of which duck got hit okay so that's why we need that so we do 10 minus that so let's say next time your duck is at number eight so let's say the second dot right you can subtract one again so it's gonna be eight so if it's eight then ten minus eight will be two so you're in position two for the second duck so this is kind of going backward using this going forward that way you can point out which position you are in okay so i hope you guys understand that so let's continue okay all right so what we're going to do is we're going to use something called replace okay so we're going to replace the item at the index so this index i just told you right so right now let's say not 10 minus 9 is 1 so index is position 1 right so we're going to say hey replace the index uh the position okay the index here uh in this duck shot list with zero so basically zeros meaning the ducks is the one that is flying this one is the one that's flying or in process of flying okay and then we're gonna broadcast something called uh new message here we're gonna call this uh next duck so this one is going to help us to uh set up the ducks to to show and blink okay so we're gonna use that we will do that some we will use that later just have this broadcast for now then we are going to use the go to position go to and then we are going to use the pick random so i'm going to use a negative 180 to 180 so somewhere on the top left and right let me just hide this i'll put this over here for now so basically the duct says somewhere like here you see this 188 right so we'll keep it around 180 somewhere around here and then somewhere around here okay all right okay and then the y position we're gonna make him like the ducks trying to kind of fly around this area so i i put uh so if you go down here you can see the y changing right uh what i did was i did like around 35 so so 35 maybe a little bit down so from this part you know c34 to kind of like this part so one 150 ish okay so uh oh i i did 135 okay 135 is good enough so this is when it first start so we're gonna put it as 35 to 135 okay all right so they'll keep the ducks around this area and then next we're going to use a little weight weight 0.1 so with this we're gonna have to set up the other into stuff so we're gonna do a little wait here before it's done okay now we're gonna change the duct speed okay we're gonna set the duct speed so this is how fast that fly uh what i'm going to do i mean if you want a little slower then make a smaller number so what i'm going to do is from two to four so so some ducks will fly a little bit slower some is faster okay then we're gonna get this forever loop here let's look sorry here so this will make it uh fly around and we're going to use the operator also want to check make sure the duct is not dead before we allow it to fly so remember we're using this variable check so we'll use the same one basically the duct shot is zero meaning the duct has not died yet so we are allowed to fly and then we are going to use another thing so this is a variable called uh up and down speed what i'm going to do is just increase by four so what we're going to do is kind of keep this going it doesn't really matter and then we're going to use a cosine to make it a small number and then like a small variation so the duck is going to go up and down okay all right so next okay so we're gonna use the if condition here so we will put that into here inside here okay okay so if either it is touching the ground which is this ground sprite here this guy or the edges on the edges we're gonna have to bounce him around so we'll say or and then we are using the sensing so this is touching the edge or touching the ground sprite okay stop this the ground sprite then we're gonna change the direction so if it's uh touching the ground or the this one we're gonna change the direction we're gonna say direction point in direction okay and then we will use the operator multiplication operator multiply uh negative one times the direction so basically it's going to go opposite okay opposite way is going if it touch that let's say it's and uh if it's on the left then it goes to the right if it's an up to go down okay all right and then we're gonna move the ducts and then uh you remember we use the speed right duct speed here we're going to use that so we'll say duck speed okay so some duck says fast and that's uh slower okay then we're gonna have this two more r check inside so inside this uh edge okay we're gonna put this thing and we are going to say if the y position basically if the ducts y position is greater than 165 we're gonna make it go down okay so we'll say change y y minus 10 and then we're going to duplicate this we're actually going to have to use the other sign we're going to say use a less than sign if the y position is less than negative 18 somewhere in the bottom here where the ground is we are going to push it back up so we're going to change the y by 10. okay so far so good okay so now what we're going to do is and then if it doesn't touch the edge or the ground we also need to move the duct right so we're going to have another one say move and you have to put this under here okay so not the edge one so you see that it's outside the edge okay outside that that okay so you put it here and then you say move the duct speed as well and then you're going to say change y so what what we want to do is we want to make the dot kind of go up and down so we'll say change y and then we are going to use some operator to help us with this we're going to use that multiply okay and then we are going to use a cosine so cosine of the up and down speed with this up and down speed we're gonna use a divide operator also so put this up and down speed over here we're gonna say divide this by two and then we're gonna use that put it on the cosine and then put this into the multiplication so and then we're going to pick at random between two two six okay so making the kind of the the the ducks move up and down because this cosine could be a negative number a positive number and multiplying by two or six either go down or go up okay so take this whole block oopsie take this oh okay sorry take this whole thing drag it in here okay so let's take a look at the code again so this is the whole thing where the duct is flying and we have to call this custom block okay so we have the code here for the start game here we're going to call this custom block that's flying so you don't want to put these two together while in one block because let's say you have a forever loop here it will kind of wait over here and this one not activated so you have to separate into two different call okay so let's save it and let's test it out okay so let's test this out real quick and move this over here let's see so you can see the duct is flying you see it fly it goes up and it goes down so let me hide this box here i guess you'll see a little bit better so you can see it goes up so you see the duck is kind of flying around it hits the bottom it goes back up and then when it it hits down and go up and down so it's kind of like randomly flying so that's what we had so far okay all right okay so we have kind of the ducks flying around and uh we are able to see it kind of move up and down and it's animated so we'll probably stop right here for now and then in the next episode will show how you know you should the ducks and the ducks fall down and stuff like that and if you miss the dog will laugh at you so we will do that next time all right thank you guys and i'll see you guys next time be sure to like and share this video with your friends okay have a good day bye
