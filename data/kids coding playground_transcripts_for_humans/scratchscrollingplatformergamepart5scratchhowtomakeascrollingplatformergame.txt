00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:09 - kids coding playground
00:10 - today we'll be doing the fifth part for
00:12 - the scrolling platformer
00:14 - so today we'll be adding the traps in
00:17 - danger
00:18 - and uh we might possibly get onto wall
00:22 - jumping
00:23 - so before i begin i would like to scroll
00:26 - through the code
00:28 - just in case you guys missed anything
00:39 - so this is what we had from the last
00:42 - video
00:44 - so yeah um and then we have the
00:47 - platforms
00:51 - and yeah so let's
00:55 - get on to the code so first for the
00:58 - player
00:59 - let's add a new custom block maybe
01:02 - called
01:02 - trap guy
01:07 - click ok trap die
01:11 - um so if this is just a activate if the
01:14 - player touches a trap then he'll die
01:16 - so if touching
01:21 - so i have my traps already right here my
01:24 - danger
01:25 - so what you want to do basically is to
01:28 - duplicate
01:29 - your platforms
01:32 - and then you uh put whatever danger like
01:34 - a lava or something
01:36 - so i in this case i can like duplicate
01:38 - these spikes
01:41 - so what you want to do is go to vector
01:44 - duplicate whatever you want
01:46 - go into your platforms to the one i just
01:48 - duplicated
01:50 - and then you can uh drag it to where you
01:53 - want it
01:54 - and then delete every delete all the
01:57 - land
01:58 - so now you don't have the danger keep
02:00 - that only the danger
02:03 - and for the ones that for the levels
02:05 - that don't have any danger
02:07 - you delete everything on the whole level
02:12 - for the levels that don't have any
02:14 - danger you delete everything
02:16 - otherwise you will get like lava or
02:18 - something
02:19 - you duplicate your platforms put it
02:21 - wherever you want the lava
02:23 - and then you can um delete everything
02:25 - around it
02:26 - so i'm going to demonstrate one more
02:28 - time
02:29 - so like that
02:34 - ctrl c i'm gonna go to here
02:37 - duplicate it so it's already scaled for
02:39 - me i just put it right there
02:41 - and i delete everything else
02:44 - just keeping the spikes
02:49 - so now you guys know how to do the oops
02:52 - i actually did this in the platforms
02:55 - sorry you're supposed to do this in the
02:57 - um
02:59 - you're actually supposed to do this in
03:01 - the
03:03 - platforms too like i said right here so
03:05 - do you want to duplicate it
03:07 - oops so let me get that again
03:10 - so duplicate it into here
03:15 - then delete everything around it
03:20 - there you go so now you guys know how to
03:23 - do that
03:24 - let's move on so for the danger
03:28 - uh we'll need pretty much same code for
03:31 - the platforms
03:33 - so for the player i mean for the danger
03:36 - remember to delete your delete every
03:39 - everything for the levels that don't
03:41 - have any danger
03:43 - and to just get all the code just drag
03:45 - and drop your code
03:47 - into the danger sprite
03:50 - like that
03:55 - [Music]
03:57 - we'll have to add a little bit more code
04:03 - so now that i have all the code in
04:07 - let me just drag this last bit of code
04:10 - okay
04:12 - there you go so let me separate it
04:19 - okay so uh the
04:22 - amount of corresponding times you um
04:25 - do make clones for the platform you have
04:28 - to do it for the
04:29 - dangers as well so
04:33 - let's continue for the defining this
04:35 - trap die
04:36 - custom block if touching
04:41 - danger then we want to set the exit to
04:45 - dead
04:47 - to let the um this custom block
04:51 - know that the player is dead right here
04:53 - so if exit is equal to dead
04:54 - then activate the player die set the
04:57 - exit
04:59 - to dead
05:04 - and then next you want to add the trap
05:07 - die
05:07 - custom block you want to activate it
05:11 - right here so now when you play it
05:16 - we oh yeah i forgot we have to add some
05:18 - more code for the platform
05:20 - like i said we have to um
05:27 - so so now um
05:32 - let's play it
05:35 - so the spikes are showing right now we
05:38 - have not done the wall jumping yet
05:40 - so now when you touch the spikes you can
05:42 - actually die
05:45 - and i added an extra bit of level right
05:48 - here
05:48 - so you can just duplicate that right
05:50 - there and duplicate another one
05:53 - so i have an extra bit of level right
05:55 - here
05:56 - i added that so
06:00 - i figured out my bug i added something
06:04 - different so i forgot to
06:08 - do make another clone for this for the
06:10 - danger
06:11 - so it wouldn't show up to spikes so make
06:13 - sure to make the same amount of clones
06:15 - as your platforms
06:18 - so now you can get killed by the spikes
06:23 - and you can also die from falling
06:29 - okay so um i will scroll around one more
06:33 - time
06:35 - just to show you guys the code
06:41 - so just stop this
06:50 - and platforms
06:54 - danger
06:58 - so remember to you should duplicate this
07:01 - platform
07:02 - and then add the danger you have to make
07:05 - it the same corresponding size or
07:07 - sometimes it will not show
07:11 - like what happened to me so now
07:14 - maybe we can work on the uh
07:18 - wall jumping now so let's get
07:22 - take this out get an if else statement
07:25 - get two actually you need to put it
07:28 - under this one
07:32 - and get another if else statement put it
07:34 - right here
07:37 - and now you want to get if
07:41 - the actually i can just duplicate this
07:44 - if the up arrow or the key w
07:47 - is pressed then also
07:51 - if the s x is great
07:54 - is greater than zero then we can set
07:58 - the speed x
08:01 - to speed x negative 16.
08:08 - else we set it to 16. so what this does
08:12 - is um if uh walk jumping so if the
08:15 - player is
08:16 - on the left then it will um
08:19 - push it to the right by 16 so it'll
08:23 - make it another extra jump so you can
08:25 - wall jump
08:26 - and same for the right if it's a wall on
08:28 - the right side and you jump it will push
08:30 - it to the left
08:31 - so you can make that one extra jump to
08:33 - make the wall shut
08:35 - and we want to set the in air right here
08:39 - set the in air to zero
08:43 - and then next finally you want to go
08:46 - here set the speed x
08:49 - to zero add the repeat until loop
08:54 - under here right here now you have
08:57 - all the wall jumping mechanics and now
09:01 - you can die from spikes so
09:03 - so now you can as you can see you can
09:05 - wall jump on the boxes
09:08 - perfectly fine you can die from the
09:10 - spikes
09:12 - you can die from fall damage
09:17 - um and i will also and that now
09:20 - you can get past this part and i also
09:22 - added an extra bit of level like i said
09:26 - so remember to just duplicate it for
09:29 - this one
09:30 - like that and do it for the same for the
09:34 - danger
09:36 - and right now there's no exit yet and
09:38 - i'm gonna
09:39 - like make a line just to show you how
09:42 - the wall jumping is working
09:46 - just to show you guys get red
09:50 - maybe make it like 10. actually black
09:54 - might be fine as well
09:57 - just do this hold down shift
10:01 - so as you can see now you can wall jump
10:09 - so yeah that pretty much concludes our
10:13 - video for today
10:14 - please like share and subscribe if
10:16 - you're new to our channel
10:18 - and i'll see you guys in part 6 of our
10:20 - scrolling platformer

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today we'll be doing the fifth part for the scrolling platformer so today we'll be adding the traps in danger and uh we might possibly get onto wall jumping so before i begin i would like to scroll through the code just in case you guys missed anything so this is what we had from the last video so yeah um and then we have the platforms and yeah so let's get on to the code so first for the player let's add a new custom block maybe called trap guy click ok trap die um so if this is just a activate if the player touches a trap then he'll die so if touching so i have my traps already right here my danger so what you want to do basically is to duplicate your platforms and then you uh put whatever danger like a lava or something so i in this case i can like duplicate these spikes so what you want to do is go to vector duplicate whatever you want go into your platforms to the one i just duplicated and then you can uh drag it to where you want it and then delete every delete all the land so now you don't have the danger keep that only the danger and for the ones that for the levels that don't have any danger you delete everything on the whole level for the levels that don't have any danger you delete everything otherwise you will get like lava or something you duplicate your platforms put it wherever you want the lava and then you can um delete everything around it so i'm going to demonstrate one more time so like that ctrl c i'm gonna go to here duplicate it so it's already scaled for me i just put it right there and i delete everything else just keeping the spikes so now you guys know how to do the oops i actually did this in the platforms sorry you're supposed to do this in the um you're actually supposed to do this in the platforms too like i said right here so do you want to duplicate it oops so let me get that again so duplicate it into here then delete everything around it there you go so now you guys know how to do that let's move on so for the danger uh we'll need pretty much same code for the platforms so for the player i mean for the danger remember to delete your delete every everything for the levels that don't have any danger and to just get all the code just drag and drop your code into the danger sprite like that we'll have to add a little bit more code so now that i have all the code in let me just drag this last bit of code okay there you go so let me separate it okay so uh the amount of corresponding times you um do make clones for the platform you have to do it for the dangers as well so let's continue for the defining this trap die custom block if touching danger then we want to set the exit to dead to let the um this custom block know that the player is dead right here so if exit is equal to dead then activate the player die set the exit to dead and then next you want to add the trap die custom block you want to activate it right here so now when you play it we oh yeah i forgot we have to add some more code for the platform like i said we have to um so so now um let's play it so the spikes are showing right now we have not done the wall jumping yet so now when you touch the spikes you can actually die and i added an extra bit of level right here so you can just duplicate that right there and duplicate another one so i have an extra bit of level right here i added that so i figured out my bug i added something different so i forgot to do make another clone for this for the danger so it wouldn't show up to spikes so make sure to make the same amount of clones as your platforms so now you can get killed by the spikes and you can also die from falling okay so um i will scroll around one more time just to show you guys the code so just stop this and platforms danger so remember to you should duplicate this platform and then add the danger you have to make it the same corresponding size or sometimes it will not show like what happened to me so now maybe we can work on the uh wall jumping now so let's get take this out get an if else statement get two actually you need to put it under this one and get another if else statement put it right here and now you want to get if the actually i can just duplicate this if the up arrow or the key w is pressed then also if the s x is great is greater than zero then we can set the speed x to speed x negative 16. else we set it to 16. so what this does is um if uh walk jumping so if the player is on the left then it will um push it to the right by 16 so it'll make it another

to set the in air right here set the in air to zero and then next finally you want to go here set the speed x to zero add the repeat until loop under here right here now you have all the wall jumping mechanics and now you can die from spikes so so now you can as you can see you can wall jump on the boxes perfectly fine you can die from the spikes you can die from fall damage um and i will also and that now you can get past this part and i also added an extra bit of level like i said so remember to just duplicate it for this one like that and do it for the same for the danger and right now there's no exit yet and i'm gonna like make a line just to show you how the wall jumping is working just to show you guys get red maybe make it like 10. actually black might be fine as well just do this hold down shift so as you can see now you can wall jump so yeah that pretty much concludes our video for today please like share and subscribe if you're new to our channel and i'll see you guys in part 6 of our scrolling platformer
