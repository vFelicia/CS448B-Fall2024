00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so hello everyone we're
00:08 - it's kids coding playground and we're
00:09 - back with another python tutorial on
00:11 - scratch
00:12 - today i'll be making a space adventure
00:14 - game on python so the player uses the
00:17 - arrow keys to move the spaceship
00:19 - and uses the spacebar to stamp the
00:21 - planets onto the screen
00:23 - so we're going to be learning these
00:24 - following concepts in python today so
00:27 - we'll be learning variables using the
00:29 - arrow keys
00:30 - custom functions using the turtle
00:32 - library and
00:33 - using the random library so we're going
00:36 - to show you some gameplay now so
00:38 - here we have some gameplay so as you can
00:41 - see
00:42 - the spaceship is moving around so i use
00:44 - the arrow keys to move the spaceship
00:45 - around
00:46 - and every time i press the spacebar it
00:49 - will stamp a different
00:50 - type of random planet onto the screen
00:53 - so yeah so we're gonna get into
00:56 - trinket.io
00:57 - so um we're in the main screen right now
01:00 - so let's click on new trinket
01:01 - and click python okay so now let's
01:05 - rename our project so we're gonna rename
01:07 - it to
01:08 - a space adventure
01:12 - so at space adventure and i'm going to
01:15 - zoom into the code so you guys can see
01:16 - it a little bit better
01:18 - so first we're going to import the
01:20 - random and
01:21 - turtle so we're going to import random
01:25 - and we're going to import the turtle
01:29 - uh turtle so after importing those two
01:32 - things
01:33 - we need to get a defined screen which is
01:35 - like the backdrop so
01:37 - screen equals
01:40 - uh turtle dot screen
01:44 - and then we're going to do a parenthesis
01:47 - and semicolon so
01:48 - next we want to do uh the screen setup
01:50 - so we want to make it a little bit
01:51 - bigger
01:52 - so the spaceship can move a little bit
01:55 - more so we're gonna
01:56 - make the screen 640 500 okay so screen
02:00 - dot setup um and then we're going to do
02:03 - 640 comma oh sorry
02:07 - and then we're gonna do this 640 comma
02:10 - 500
02:11 - like that okay so after setting that up
02:15 - we want to upload our images into this
02:18 - project so we're going to go here
02:20 - image library so we're gonna upload a
02:23 - new image
02:24 - and we're gonna select it um from here
02:27 - i have wait
02:32 - okay so i found it so now i'm gonna
02:34 - upload all these images i got
02:36 - the link will be in the description
02:37 - below in the google drive so if you want
02:39 - to download it go in the description
02:41 - so this is all of our stuff so we're
02:43 - going to start downloading it so
02:46 - so we're going to download all of them
02:49 - uh so this is the backdrop oh and
02:52 - i can and if you want to select all of
02:53 - them just hold down the
02:55 - um shift key and you can just click open
02:59 - and select all of them so hold down the
03:02 - shift key so you can get all of them
03:04 - so as you can see we have all of them
03:05 - and now click done
03:07 - okay so now we have all our sprites
03:08 - uploaded into the project
03:10 - let's go back to the main pi and now
03:13 - we're gonna
03:13 - um set this uh backdrop to something so
03:16 - we're gonna do screen
03:18 - dot uh bg pic which is the background
03:22 - we're gonna do the galaxy jpg dot jpg
03:26 - which is what the
03:27 - um backdrop is called galaxy dot
03:30 - jpg so you can see right here
03:34 - it's called galaxy dot jpg you can just
03:36 - copy paste it if you want
03:38 - and you need to put um quotation marks
03:41 - in here so we're gonna
03:42 - do that and we're gonna run it so as you
03:44 - can see you can see
03:45 - the little galaxy so yeah okay
03:49 - next we want to um define my turtle
03:53 - and we're gonna get um all we're gonna
03:55 - add all the
03:56 - different planets so we're gonna do my
03:59 - turtle
04:00 - equals turtle
04:04 - dot turtle and then we're going to do
04:10 - that thing and then we're going to do a
04:12 - semicolon
04:13 - and then after that we're going to get
04:14 - all the planets so screen
04:18 - screen dot add shape
04:22 - shape and then we're going to do this
04:24 - one mercury
04:26 - mercury.png i'm listing all the planets
04:28 - in order
04:29 - you guys can do any order you'd like and
04:31 - then i'm gonna have to put
04:33 - um quotation marks so um
04:37 - i'm gonna like uh finish this part
04:41 - uh and then screen
04:44 - dot add shape and then we're gonna do
04:48 - venus so just cop down here
04:51 - venus down here
04:55 - so copy paste that uh and then we're
04:57 - gonna go here
04:59 - and do that
05:04 - okay so i'm i'm we're gonna do this to
05:06 - speed up the process so
05:08 - we're gonna copy paste this
05:12 - and we can just do that
05:15 - and do that so there's eight planets so
05:17 - right now we have six
05:18 - okay eight so now we can just do list
05:21 - them all in order so earth.png
05:29 - so as you can see all of them are just
05:32 - the planet.png so i'm just going to do
05:34 - that
05:35 - after it's going to be mars
05:38 - dot png and then this is going to be
05:42 - jupiter
05:48 - and then saturn
05:54 - dot png
05:58 - and then we're going to uranus dot png
06:03 - uh dot png and then neptune
06:07 - neptune dot png okay so we have all the
06:10 - planets
06:11 - listed in order now so mercury venus
06:13 - earth mars jupiter saturn
06:14 - uranus and neptune so now we have all
06:17 - the planets
06:19 - um now we're going to define planets so
06:22 - pl uh planets equals
06:25 - and then we're going to have to do um
06:27 - all the pngs again
06:29 - so we're going to put a bracket and then
06:32 - we're going gonna copy paste this
06:36 - uh mercury.png and
06:39 - we just have to list them all right here
06:42 - and just have to put a comma
06:47 - so right now we're trying to define a
06:48 - list of variables so
06:50 - let's just copy paste this again uh
06:53 - venus
06:54 - and then earth
06:59 - and add a comma so
07:03 - i'm going to scroll down a little bit
07:04 - and move to the right a little bit uh
07:06 - mars oops
07:09 - messed it up a little you have to get
07:11 - that as well
07:13 - put a comma mars
07:17 - let's get jupiter
07:21 - dot png
07:24 - saturn
07:28 - uh copy paste that so it's a quite long
07:31 - list
07:32 - and then uranus
07:35 - comma and do that and then neptune last
07:39 - one
07:40 - okay so now we have all the planets
07:45 - uh okay so now we are done with that
07:48 - we also have to um add shape for the um
07:51 - uh spaceship so we're gonna we're gonna
07:53 - go import it from here we already have
07:55 - it
07:55 - as you can see so we're doing the
07:57 - spaceship.png so let's copy and paste
07:59 - that
08:00 - so we are going to um also
08:03 - um add the shape of that so we're going
08:05 - to do a screen
08:07 - scroll down a little bit dot shape
08:11 - and then we're going to do that
08:14 - and then that so copy paste that and put
08:16 - the quotation marks
08:18 - so now we have all of them and
08:21 - a semicolon okay
08:25 - so uh uh
08:29 - so let's add a semicolon at the end of
08:30 - here as well you don't have to but
08:33 - um i i i like to so i'm just gonna do it
08:37 - okay now let's enter okay so now let's
08:40 - work on two variables so we're gonna
08:43 - define two variables right now so
08:45 - first we're gonna define the move speed
08:48 - move
08:49 - underscore speed so this is how fast
08:52 - we want the spaceship to move so we're
08:54 - going to make it 10
08:56 - and then that's basically 10 steps i
08:58 - guess and then we're also going to do a
08:59 - turn speed this is how fast
09:01 - um we want the the angle how uh
09:04 - the spaceship turns so we're going to
09:06 - make that 10 as well
09:08 - and then we're going to define some
09:10 - custom functions
09:12 - so we're going to define forward def
09:15 - forward
09:17 - and then we're going to do this and
09:20 - add a semicolon
09:23 - and then after that you want to tab
09:27 - uh oh sorry not semicolon you need a
09:29 - colon right here
09:30 - it's not a semicolon you have to define
09:33 - it so after this
09:34 - you have a tab so you have to tab and
09:36 - then um
09:37 - tab means it's part of this function
09:40 - so we're going to do my turtle
09:45 - dot forward
09:48 - and then we're also going to do the move
09:51 - speed
09:52 - so this is how fast the turtle will move
09:55 - it will move
09:56 - 10 10 steps forward and then after that
10:00 - we're gonna do
10:01 - define another one so def uh backwards
10:05 - so this is
10:06 - allowing the um player to move backwards
10:10 - colon don't use a semicolon and then
10:14 - enter it should already tab
10:16 - automatically for you
10:17 - but if it doesn't you have to put a tab
10:19 - and then we're just going to copy paste
10:20 - this
10:23 - ctrl c ctrl v so
10:26 - instead of my turtle 4 we're going to do
10:28 - my turtle backwards
10:32 - and move speed and then
10:35 - now we're gonna do the turning so we're
10:37 - gonna
10:38 - enter def uh sorry um
10:41 - no tab def uh left
10:45 - and then we're gonna do a colon
10:49 - and then we're gonna copy paste this
10:51 - instead of backwards or anything we're
10:52 - gonna do
10:53 - left so we're gonna make this turtle
10:56 - turn left and instead of move speed
10:57 - we're gonna have to use
10:58 - turn speed i'm going to copy paste this
11:03 - turn speed instead of move speed
11:06 - and then finally we have to define one
11:08 - more so
11:09 - def right so we want to make it the
11:11 - turtle turn right as well
11:13 - so def right and then
11:16 - colon and then we're just gonna copy
11:19 - paste this
11:21 - script right here and then my turtle dot
11:26 - right
11:29 - and accidentally added extra space right
11:32 - there so
11:32 - let's backspace that okay so now we have
11:35 - all the
11:36 - turning and moving now we're gonna have
11:39 - to um
11:40 - define the creep planet to find one more
11:43 - so def
11:45 - sorry define create planets so this is
11:48 - another one
11:49 - another custom function create planet
11:54 - planet and then do that and colon
11:57 - and after that we want to do index
12:01 - equals random dot random in which in
12:04 - zero to seven
12:05 - okay and then we're going to define
12:07 - index as a list variable so
12:09 - index i'm sorry index
12:13 - and then we're going to do equals random
12:18 - dot random in
12:21 - and then we're going to do um a
12:27 - rant in sorry not random ins uh so rand
12:30 - in
12:30 - and after that we're gonna get a
12:32 - parenthesis and put zero to seven
12:35 - so in python they start from zero so
12:38 - this is a variable i mean
12:39 - that list so um there's eight planets
12:43 - and zero to seven is eight but um
12:46 - in scratch they start from one but in
12:48 - other programming languages it starts
12:49 - from zero
12:51 - and then we're gonna do we're gonna do
12:52 - my planet
12:55 - planet um equals planets
12:58 - index so it will just pick the index is
13:01 - gonna pick a random from zero to seven
13:04 - so we're gonna do plan knit index
13:07 - and then do this index okay
13:12 - and then uh after doing that we're going
13:14 - to do
13:15 - prints the planet so it'll show down
13:18 - show up
13:18 - right here and my
13:22 - planet so after doing that
13:26 - my planets are not my planets and after
13:29 - doing that we're gonna do the stamping
13:32 - so we're gonna do my turtle
13:33 - stamp dot stamp uh dot stamp
13:37 - and then do that and then do that
13:41 - um so next
13:44 - oh yeah and before we stamp i forgot to
13:46 - do one thing we have to
13:48 - um set the um turtle to the planet shape
13:52 - so we're going to have to do my turtle
13:57 - dot um shape as to my planet
14:04 - so after that we can stamp so you have
14:07 - to add this line of code
14:08 - before you stamp it
14:12 - and then after that uh we want to get
14:15 - the my turtle.shape to the spaceship.png
14:17 - so
14:18 - my turtle.shape
14:23 - and we're going to do the spaceship.png
14:25 - just copy paste it from here and
14:30 - paste it here spaceship.png so it resets
14:34 - the turtle to the spaceship.png
14:37 - and then now we're gonna do um oh yeah
14:40 - and forgot the second colon
14:42 - now we're gonna do uh the shape for the
14:45 - spaceship.png so we're gonna do my
14:47 - turtle dot shape and then we're gonna
14:50 - copy paste this
14:52 - and then so this is just this is for the
14:54 - um
14:56 - name function so this is for the
14:57 - movement and all that stuff
14:59 - so we're gonna um my turtle dot pen
15:03 - up my turtle dot pen up
15:07 - and we're gonna put that and then after
15:10 - that pending up we're going to
15:11 - set the my total speed uh
15:14 - stop speed to zero
15:18 - zero and then we're gonna make the my
15:20 - turtle home
15:24 - dot home and
15:27 - add parentheses
15:30 - oh and i forgot seven kilometer here so
15:32 - i'm gonna add that real quick
15:34 - and then after that we're gonna make the
15:36 - movement for the spaceship so we're
15:38 - gonna
15:40 - do screen dot on key
15:45 - and we're gonna forward
15:48 - up uh and then we're gonna do this
15:51 - and up like that so this is moving up
15:55 - with the spaceship so they're calling
15:58 - the function right here
15:59 - so remember we uh defined the forward
16:02 - function right here
16:03 - so what they're doing is calling the
16:04 - forward and they're listening for the up
16:07 - arrow key and next we're going to do
16:10 - screen
16:11 - dot on you actually just copy paste it
16:14 - um and then we're going to do backwards
16:15 - so we're calling the backwards
16:17 - uh function this time backward comma
16:20 - and then we're gonna do down so this so
16:23 - doing uh backwards will make you go down
16:27 - and then i'm just gonna copy paste both
16:29 - of these we still have two more
16:33 - and then right here instead of forward
16:35 - we're going to do left
16:36 - and then it's going to listen for the
16:39 - left key
16:41 - so you're going to do left right there
16:42 - and then finally right here we're going
16:44 - to do right
16:45 - and then right here we're going to do
16:46 - right as well so these are the movement
16:48 - arrow keys and after that we're gonna
16:52 - get the on key so when you press the
16:54 - space button it will create a planet
16:57 - so we're gonna screen
17:01 - dot on key and then we're going to do
17:04 - create planet
17:08 - oops sorry dot planet uh no no no
17:11 - dot all right planet just one word and
17:14 - then comma
17:15 - and then space
17:20 - and then after that one more line of
17:21 - code we're gonna do
17:23 - screen dot listen which is listening to
17:25 - what keys are being pressed
17:27 - so remember um your uh
17:30 - name right here has to be the exact same
17:33 - as this one
17:34 - the function or else it will not work so
17:36 - you have to make sure it's all the same
17:38 - and add a semicolon if you want and then
17:42 - now we're gonna do screen dot listen
17:46 - so this is the list in which keys are
17:47 - being pressed and boom
17:50 - we've we're done with all the code for
17:52 - the game
17:53 - so let's try out the game so let's play
17:56 - the game
17:58 - so let's click on here so then it'll
18:01 - play the game so
18:02 - as you can see use the arrow keys to
18:04 - turn up arrow key to move forward
18:07 - back down arrow key to move backwards
18:09 - and whenever you click the space bar
18:11 - it will generate a new different type of
18:14 - planet
18:15 - and as you can see they're printing all
18:18 - the different
18:19 - planets that are being stamped right
18:21 - here
18:22 - so as you can see you can just basically
18:25 - um stamp a bunch of planets onto the
18:28 - screen
18:30 - so yeah so this is a pretty simple um
18:34 - simple uh project you can make and right
18:37 - here
18:38 - the reason why we have random planets is
18:40 - because of this code right here
18:42 - it chooses the random planet that is
18:44 - being stopped as
18:45 - um stamped so yeah that's pretty much
18:48 - this tutorial
18:49 - thank you guys for watching don't forget
18:51 - to like share and subscribe
18:53 - i'll see you guys in the next video
18:56 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

so hello everyone we're it's kids coding playground and we're back with another python tutorial on scratch today i'll be making a space adventure game on python so the player uses the arrow keys to move the spaceship and uses the spacebar to stamp the planets onto the screen so we're going to be learning these following concepts in python today so we'll be learning variables using the arrow keys custom functions using the turtle library and using the random library so we're going to show you some gameplay now so here we have some gameplay so as you can see the spaceship is moving around so i use the arrow keys to move the spaceship around and every time i press the spacebar it will stamp a different type of random planet onto the screen so yeah so we're gonna get into trinket.io so um we're in the main screen right now so let's click on new trinket and click python okay so now let's rename our project so we're gonna rename it to a space adventure so at space adventure and i'm going to zoom into the code so you guys can see it a little bit better so first we're going to import the random and turtle so we're going to import random and we're going to import the turtle uh turtle so after importing those two things we need to get a defined screen which is like the backdrop so screen equals uh turtle dot screen and then we're going to do a parenthesis and semicolon so next we want to do uh the screen setup so we want to make it a little bit bigger so the spaceship can move a little bit more so we're gonna make the screen 640 500 okay so screen dot setup um and then we're going to do 640 comma oh sorry and then we're gonna do this 640 comma 500 like that okay so after setting that up we want to upload our images into this project so we're going to go here image library so we're gonna upload a new image and we're gonna select it um from here i have wait okay so i found it so now i'm gonna upload all these images i got the link will be in the description below in the google drive so if you want to download it go in the description so this is all of our stuff so we're going to start downloading it so so we're going to download all of them uh so this is the backdrop oh and i can and if you want to select all of them just hold down the um shift key and you can just click open and select all of them so hold down the shift key so you can get all of them so as you can see we have all of them and now click done okay so now we have all our sprites uploaded into the project let's go back to the main pi and now we're gonna um set this uh backdrop to something so we're gonna do screen dot uh bg pic which is the background we're gonna do the galaxy jpg dot jpg which is what the um backdrop is called galaxy dot jpg so you can see right here it's called galaxy dot jpg you can just copy paste it if you want and you need to put um quotation marks in here so we're gonna do that and we're gonna run it so as you can see you can see the little galaxy so yeah okay next we want to um define my turtle and we're gonna get um all we're gonna add all the different planets so we're gonna do my turtle equals turtle dot turtle and then we're going to do that thing and then we're going to do a semicolon and then after that we're going to get all the planets so screen screen dot add shape shape and then we're going to do this one mercury mercury.png i'm listing all the planets in order you guys can do any order you'd like and then i'm gonna have to put um quotation marks so um i'm gonna like uh finish this part uh and then screen dot add shape and then we're gonna do venus so just cop down here venus down here so copy paste that uh and then we're gonna go here and do that okay so i'm i'm we're gonna do this to speed up the process so we're gonna copy paste this and we can just do that and do that so there's eight planets so right now we have six okay eight so now we can just do list them all in order so earth.png so as you can see all of them are just the planet.png so i'm just going to do that after it's going to be mars dot png and then this is going to be jupiter and then saturn dot png and then we're going to uranus dot png uh dot png and then neptune neptune dot png okay so we have all the planets listed in order now so mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus and neptune so now we have all the planets um now we're going to define planets so pl uh planets equals and then we're going to have to do um all the pngs again so we're going to put a bracket and then we're going gonna copy paste this uh mercury.png and we just have to list them all right here and just have to put a comma so right now we're trying to define a list of variables so let's just copy paste this again uh venus and then earth and add a comma so i'm going to scroll down a little bit and move to the right a little bit uh mars oops messed it up a little you have to get that as well put a comma mars let's get jupiter dot png saturn uh copy paste that so it's a quite long list and then uranus comma and do that and then neptune last one okay so now we have all the planets uh okay so now we are done with that we also have to um add shape for the um uh spaceship so we're gonna we're gonna go import it from here we already have it as you can see so we're doing the spaceship.png so let's copy and paste that so we are going to um also um add the shape of that so we're going to do a screen scroll down a little bit dot shape and then we're going to do that and then that so copy paste that and put the quotation marks so now we have all of them and a semicolon okay so uh uh so let's add a semicolon at the end of here as well you don't have to but um i i i like to so i'm just gonna do it okay now let's enter okay so now let's work on two variables so we're gonna define two variables right now so first we're gonna define the move speed move underscore speed so this is how fast we want the spaceship to move so we're going to make it 10 and then that's basically 10 steps i guess and then we're also going to do a turn speed this is how fast um we want the the angle how uh the spaceship turns so we're going to make that 10 as well and then we're going to define some custom functions so we're going to define forward def forward and then we're going to do this and add a semicolon and then after that you want to tab uh oh sorry not semicolon you need a colon right here it's not a semicolon you have to define it so after this you have a tab so you have to tab and then um tab means it's part of this function so we're going to do my turtle dot forward and then we're also going to do the move speed so this is how fast the turtle will move it will move 10 10 steps forward and then after that we're gonna do define another one so def uh backwards so this is allowing the um player to move backwards colon don't use a semicolon and then enter it should already tab automatically for you but if it doesn't you have to put a tab and then we're just going to copy paste this ctrl c ctrl v so instead of my turtle 4 we're going to do my turtle backwards and move speed and then now we're gonna do the turning so we're gonna enter def uh sorry um no tab def uh left and then we're gonna do a colon and then we're gonna copy paste this instead of backwards or anything we're gonna do left so we're gonna make this turtle turn left and instead of move speed we're gonna have to use turn speed i'm going to copy paste this turn speed instead of move speed and then finally we have to define one more so def right so we want to make it the turtle turn right as well so def right and then colon and then we're just gonna copy paste this script right here and then my turtle dot right and accidentally added extra space right there so let's backspace that okay so now we have all the turning and moving now we're gonna have to um define the creep planet to find one more so def sorry define create planets so this is another one another custom function create planet planet and then do that and colon and after that we want to do index equals random dot random in which in zero to seven okay and then we're going to define index as a list variable so index i'm sorry index and then we're going to do equals random dot random in and then we're going to do um a rant in sorry not random ins uh so rand in and after that we're gonna get a parenthesis and put zero to seven so in python they start from zero so this is a variable i mean that list so um there's eight planets and zero to seven is eight but um in scratch they start from one but in other programming languages it starts from zero and then we're gonna do we're gonna do my planet planet um equals planets index so it will just pick the index is gonna pick a random from zero to seven so we're gonna do plan knit index and then do this index okay and then uh after doing that we're going to do prints the planet so it'll show down show up right here and my planet so after doing that my planets are not my planets and after doing that we're gonna do the stamping so we're gonna do my turtle stamp dot stamp uh dot stamp and then do that and then do that um so next oh yeah and before we stamp i forgot to do one thing we have to um set the um turtle to the planet shape so we're going to have to do my turtle dot um shape as to my planet so after that we can stamp so you have to add this line of code before you stamp it and then after that uh we want to get the my turtle.shape to the spaceship.png so my turtle.shape and we're going to do the spaceship.png just copy paste it from here and paste it here spaceship.png so it resets the turtle to the spaceship.png and then now we're gonna do um oh yeah and forgot the second colon now we're gonna do uh the shape for the spaceship.png so we're gonna do my turtle dot shape and then we're gonna copy paste this and then so this is just this is for the um name function so this is for the movement and all that stuff so we're gonna um my turtle dot pen up my turtle dot pen up and we're gonna put that and then after that pending up we're going to set the my total speed uh stop speed to zero zero and then we're gonna make the my turtle home dot home and add parentheses oh and i forgot seven kilometer here so i'm gonna add that real quick and then after that we're gonna make the movement for the spaceship so we're gonna do screen dot on key and we're gonna forward up uh and then we're gonna do this and up like that so this is moving up with the spaceship so they're calling the function right here so remember we uh defined the forward function right here so what they're doing is calling the forward and they're listening for the up arrow key and next we're going to do screen dot on you actually just copy paste it um and then we're going to do backwards so we're calling the backwards uh function this time backward comma and then we're gonna do down so this so doing uh backwards will make you go down and then i'm just gonna copy paste both of these we still have two more and then right here instead of forward we're going to do left and then it's going to listen for the left key so you're going to do left right there and then finally right here we're going to do right and then right here we're going to do right as well so these are the movement arrow keys and after that we're gonna get the on key so when you press the space button it will create a planet so we're gonna screen dot on key and then we're going to do create planet oops sorry dot planet uh no no no dot all right planet just one word and then comma and then space and then after that one more line of code we're gonna do screen dot listen which is listening to what keys are being pressed so remember um your uh name right here has to be the exact same as this one the function or else it will not work so you have to make sure it's all the same and add a semicolon if you want and then now we're gonna do screen dot listen so this is the list in which keys are being pressed and boom we've we're done with all the code for the game so let's try out the game so let's play the game so let's click on here so then it'll play the game so as you can see use the arrow keys to turn up arrow key to move forward back down arrow key to move backwards and whenever you click the space bar it will generate a new different type of planet and as you can see they're printing all the different planets that are being stamped right here so as you can see you can just basically um stamp a bunch of planets onto the screen so yeah so this is a pretty simple um simple uh project you can make and right here the reason why we have random planets is because of this code right here it chooses the random planet that is being stopped as um stamped so yeah that's pretty much this tutorial thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe i'll see you guys in the next video
