01:35 - might have seen my project already
01:38 - you click on the scissors and then you
01:40 - can move it all around if you do not
01:41 - click on it it cannot move
01:43 - and you can cut the flowers
01:46 - [Music]
01:47 - it'll go in the base these flowers on
01:51 - the left and the right
01:52 - go to the sides but this one goes in the
01:56 - front
01:56 - which makes it in front this is happy
01:58 - mother's day 231 to kcp
02:00 - the flower and these photos as you can
02:03 - see it's randomized flowers
02:04 - let me let me do this real quick done
02:08 - as you see it's randomized like last
02:10 - time i don't know what i got but
02:12 - i know it's randomized so we are at our
02:15 - old project i just renamed it right now
02:18 - mother's day card version 2 teaching
02:22 - so i just renamed that like right now so
02:24 - um yeah um
02:26 - we're gonna be working on this xylo
02:27 - one's playing
02:31 - this is the original one
02:36 - that's it this one was pretty plain so
02:39 - we decided to add
02:40 - the new version too so it's option
02:44 - i mean like i'd advise you to do version
02:46 - two because it'll be better
02:48 - and oh enhance your game so first we
02:51 - need one
02:52 - three place it around here
02:56 - um and we also need
02:59 - to rename it
03:03 - not rename but we need to add text on it
03:06 - so
03:07 - white text
03:11 - and we're going to name it done oopsies
03:14 - i put on caps lock
03:16 - done in handwriting
03:25 - done done done yeah done yeah
03:28 - so yeah and now we're gonna position
03:31 - this
03:32 - button real quick
03:36 - position this place position this button
03:41 - in the middle i don't even know why the
03:43 - buttons are never in the middle
03:45 - well i think that's for all sprites you
03:47 - put the done in the middle
03:48 - so there we got the done button
03:52 - and i just finished my gummy so i don't
03:54 - you won't hear
03:55 - any chewing noises so anyways we're
03:58 - gonna keep on going
03:59 - so the done button is what we need to
04:01 - make all the scissors and
04:03 - everything that can make the world
04:05 - better
04:06 - so we need the show
04:10 - and when this sprite is clicked
04:14 - broadcast new message
04:18 - go to garden
04:24 - and now we're gonna hide
04:28 - so there we go we have a button
04:31 - called done and now we gotta work on the
04:34 - scissors the garden flower the garden
04:36 - flower and the garden flower which are
04:38 - the three flowers that you cut
04:40 - so and the base
04:43 - so after we have to put all this in i'm
04:46 - pretty sure i have this in my backpack
04:50 - no wait hold on a second okay so
04:53 - but if you do not have it you can
04:55 - download this from this project
04:56 - i mean my last project the one i already
04:58 - shared or the
04:59 - um uh google drive so yeah
05:03 - we'll do that just some technical
05:07 - difficulties we got the scissors and
05:08 - everything in
05:10 - right here so we just got to click the
05:11 - upload sprite i have all this stuff so
05:13 - i'll be blurring this later so
05:15 - we have scissors one base
05:19 - sprite and yeah we have them two
05:22 - so yeah we have the vase and the
05:24 - scissors so now we're going to be
05:25 - working on the vase
05:27 - so the oh we have to make the backdrop
05:29 - so the backdrop
05:31 - is the um where it switches to
05:34 - the garden when you go to garden so it
05:37 - will be
05:38 - when i receive
05:42 - it'll switch costume to the first
05:45 - backdrop which is this
05:48 - clear blue backdrop and you gotta select
05:50 - the backdrop called
05:52 - garden rock
05:59 - after when you selected that you have to
06:01 - go to when i receive
06:04 - garden
06:09 - then it will switch costume to
06:13 - garden rock e
06:16 - so as you can see right now all these
06:18 - bases and stuff are
06:20 - shielding me but click done look
06:23 - we still have this on board let's change
06:25 - that later
06:27 - so we have um to work on the base and
06:30 - the scissors next
06:32 - so the vase should be fairly simple but
06:34 - we also have to put the
06:35 - sprites the flowers all the different
06:39 - costumes are the flowers
06:40 - inside all three of them so we just have
06:43 - to duplicate the flower three times
06:47 - i'm gonna work on hiding all these
06:48 - sprites when done is clicked
06:50 - so i'm just because it has a very small
06:53 - amounts of code so
06:54 - that's better if i do that first so when
06:57 - i receive
06:58 - go to garden it will hide
07:05 - already put that uh
07:09 - when the spray is clicked
07:12 - no wait oh this is the done button never
07:15 - mind
07:16 - uh the done button we have to go to the
07:18 - card and then we will start working up
07:20 - from there so
07:21 - card
07:26 - it will go to the back layer so show
07:32 - and then since if you're in the garden
07:36 - we added the show so it will show
07:38 - and then when i receive go to garden
07:43 - it will hide yes
07:46 - hide and after that it will go
07:49 - when i receive the back to card oh yeah
07:52 - back to carter's gone
07:54 - for now because we don't have that yet
07:56 - so
07:57 - we have to do show on this one
08:02 - there's already this on here so let's
08:05 - just put the
08:06 - sprite and put
08:09 - this so when the green flag is clicked
08:14 - i hate how it zooms out when you just
08:17 - i'll put the block in it'll show and
08:19 - then go to garden
08:25 - and it will hide
08:29 - and then now we're gonna work on the
08:32 - flower
08:33 - this flower yes the flower and then
08:36 - we're gonna do
08:37 - the when i when the green flag is
08:40 - clicked
08:42 - it will show
08:51 - so we have the flower and
08:55 - when i receive go to garden it will hide
09:04 - and then you just have to do this to
09:07 - basically
09:08 - all of the buttons so
09:12 - i'm just going to drag this over there
09:16 - yeah i'll just do that
09:19 - and i'm just going to drag this over
09:20 - there
09:22 - yeah and then we got everything we need
09:24 - here
09:25 - and then i just drag this over here
09:31 - oh yeah right there and then that's what
09:33 - we need over there
09:35 - so yeah go to garden let's right click
09:37 - yeah
09:38 - oh yeah and we also need to
09:42 - make this thing go to the front layer
09:50 - to show
09:54 - that when i receive go to garden yeah
10:00 - yeah this thing also needs that we don't
10:02 - we didn't need that never mind never
10:03 - mind
10:04 - let's look at the wrong thing and then
10:05 - the card color yep we have
10:07 - that and this thing
10:11 - go to garden let's just drag this right
10:13 - on
10:16 - we also already dragged two in okay so
10:19 - go to front layer and i'll show
10:25 - and it'll go to the guard backpack card
10:28 - we're not doing that yet
10:29 - so what i receive go to garden
10:36 - and we have everything
10:41 - yes and yeah
10:44 - you have to hide the variable so then
10:48 - when i receive because there's two
10:50 - variables there's the
10:51 - button and the variable and then you
10:53 - have to hide the variable so you can't
10:54 - see it anymore
10:55 - so hide bearable message
10:58 - and it will hide
11:02 - so we have that done and then
11:06 - that's all we need right now and yeah
11:09 - oh yeah and also this we also have to
11:12 - set message to mom
11:14 - let me show the variable because we were
11:16 - hiding it earlier
11:17 - so show and then it will
11:22 - show
11:26 - and now uh that's all we need
11:30 - okay so let's just work on the flowers
11:32 - and all the stuff next but let's look at
11:33 - this
11:34 - as you can see done all of it's gone
11:36 - except the vase and the scissors because
11:38 - i didn't do that
11:39 - and now we gotta put we're gonna put the
11:41 - duplicates of the flowers
11:43 - these flowers yes these flowers so we're
11:46 - gonna make three of these
11:47 - three of these and each of them can be
11:50 - named a different thing
11:55 - like in my original i think the name was
12:02 - uh garden flower
12:06 - one the first one garden
12:10 - flower one
12:13 - for the second one you guessed it garden
12:16 - flower two and the third one
12:21 - garden flower
12:27 - so yeah uh sort of reduced spaces
12:33 - uh because i'm so used to typing those
12:36 - things so anyways we're gonna put all of
12:38 - that together
12:39 - and yeah
12:42 - so yeah we have the garden flowers and
12:45 - now we're gonna work
12:46 - on garden flower one so
12:49 - when the green flag is clicked oh yeah
12:51 - we don't need any of this code
12:53 - not a single bit of these code
12:57 - or this one i'll delete all six blocks
13:02 - delete all six blocks
13:05 - now we can go back to garden flower one
13:08 - and as you can see
13:10 - when i drag this in and you need it to
13:13 - hide
13:16 - so you gotta go
13:19 - when i receive go to garden
13:23 - i'll point in direction 90
13:29 - oh and i'll go to a position i have it
13:33 - at
13:34 - some coordinate negative 21 positive 10
13:39 - negative 10 and then not positive 10 and
13:42 - um go to the front layer so that's what
13:45 - i have for this one
13:51 - go backwards one layer two
13:58 - one layer so it will be in front of the
14:01 - back
14:02 - it will be in front but not almost in
14:05 - front if you get what i mean
14:06 - like it will be behind the vase but
14:10 - in front and behind the scissors as well
14:12 - but like it's still in the front layer
14:14 - so then it'll switch costume to any of
14:17 - the pick randoms
14:21 - one to ten and then it will show
14:30 - it will go forever
14:36 - and you need it if then if then the
14:40 - scissors and mouse down
14:45 - touching scissors and mouse down so that
14:49 - means if the scissors is on it
14:51 - and when the mouse is down
14:54 - during it when you click this you hear
14:57 - this
14:57 - this this this that means it will
15:02 - that means it will cut so yeah we have
15:05 - mouse down and yeah
15:06 - we do that you know a change
15:11 - flower cut
15:15 - by minus one so let's just do this
15:19 - flower cut
15:23 - by minus one because you need three
15:25 - flowers and we're gonna
15:26 - delete um take that out for now and
15:29 - it'll start sound low loose
15:30 - so we have a sound low loose
15:45 - and now we're gonna glide to the tricky
15:48 - block of the tricky block plus
15:50 - 150. so the tricky block is this one we
15:52 - need two of those but first we need to
15:54 - go
15:55 - glide one second
15:59 - to x x position of the vase so they'll
16:02 - be on the base in the vase
16:06 - in the vase so we got to change the back
16:09 - you probably you guys probably get the
16:10 - deal by now
16:11 - base x position and duplicate
16:15 - and instead change this to y position oh
16:18 - yeah we also need the plus 150 like what
16:20 - i said
16:22 - yeah to make it go up
16:25 - a little bit because it will be directly
16:28 - in the center
16:29 - but if you do the plus 150 it'll be
16:31 - hanging out of the vase
16:33 - so that's what we have right here
16:36 - and we're going to stop this script so i
16:39 - forgot to get the code the scissors so
16:40 - i'll be doing that next
16:45 - so the scissors and we have the scissors
16:47 - so we're going to
16:48 - coat them with has some code so when the
16:52 - green flag is clicked it will set flower
16:54 - cut to three
16:59 - because there's three flowers and that's
17:01 - when you when you make the variable but
17:02 - i made
17:03 - the other flower first and then i'm
17:05 - going to go hide and then let's go to
17:07 - the garden
17:11 - and that's when he starts showing so go
17:13 - to
17:14 - negative 106 negative 100
17:18 - and it'll wait 0.1 seconds
17:28 - so this weight is for if the scissors
17:31 - will go in the front layer
17:33 - because if you go to the back layer
17:34 - you'll be snipping the flowers from the
17:36 - back
17:37 - so you need the 0.1 second weight
17:42 - to so it will be in front of the flower
17:45 - and everything else so
17:47 - we have this and wait 0.1 seconds it
17:50 - will go to the front layer
17:55 - and it will show
18:00 - now we gotta wait until so
18:03 - just wait until uh let me click this
18:05 - real quick
18:06 - wait until we need to end
18:10 - so it's touching the mouse pointer
18:13 - and mouse is down
18:16 - which is if you click on it you can
18:18 - start dragging the scissors all around
18:21 - and we have that so
18:24 - it'll go forever so this has to be there
18:27 - to make this script work not the script
18:30 - but like this
18:32 - forever loop and now go to the mouse
18:40 - pointer
18:44 - you know if then
18:48 - if then the flower equals cut equals
18:50 - zero that means it will stop and go back
18:53 - to the back to the card so
18:58 - let's do this zero
19:02 - flower cut hide
19:12 - wait two seconds
19:18 - right test back to card
19:30 - and it'll stop this script
19:36 - so we have that done now we gotta work
19:38 - on the rest of the flowers
19:41 - so we're gonna test this so
19:45 - we have this
19:48 - so we have actually didn't put the show
19:51 - on the
19:52 - button so you need the show to the show
20:00 - on these two buttons i already did it
20:01 - for the message actually didn't put that
20:03 - in
20:04 - so show and make sure you guys do it too
20:07 - so
20:08 - i make sure you guys i'll put the show
20:10 - in
20:11 - and now you can change the flower color
20:16 - and now you're going to click the done
20:18 - and then you've got the scissors
20:20 - you can cut the flower and you'll go to
20:22 - the base on the top
20:23 - and now we got to go the base and then
20:24 - the rest of the flowers so let's go to
20:26 - the vase
20:27 - the vase um we have to code this and
20:31 - the vase is when the green flag is
20:33 - clicked
20:34 - it will go to this position
20:38 - it will hide
20:43 - when i receive go to garden oh show
20:46 - so we have to put a little bit more code
20:48 - than that
20:53 - and we'll go to front layer and then
20:55 - show
20:58 - so it'll go to in front of the flowers
21:01 - not the scissors because the scissors
21:03 - has the delay which means he'll go in
21:04 - front of the vase as well
21:06 - so it will go to front layer
21:09 - and show
21:13 - and there we got it and now we gotta
21:15 - work on the
21:17 - other flap the other garden flowers
21:19 - which i'm gonna
21:20 - look at right now
21:25 - so we're gonna do the left one first
21:26 - which is
21:28 - this one yeah it doesn't matter which
21:30 - one it is but let's just do this
21:32 - so the left one which basically has the
21:34 - same code as this
21:38 - so we're gonna drag all this code to the
21:41 - left flower we just need a little bit
21:44 - change and then that's all we
21:46 - need for this one so we're going to find
21:48 - the new position for this flower
21:51 - so we're going to drag it around here
21:57 - and then put this on and then we need to
22:00 - instead of going to the front layer
22:02 - we got to go to the back layer because
22:04 - it's behind the middle flower
22:06 - and switch costume yeah yeah we all got
22:09 - that
22:09 - but then now we need this
22:13 - x position of vase minus 20 because it's
22:16 - on the left side
22:28 - base minus 20 and the y is the same and
22:31 - stop
22:32 - we got to make this turn to the left
22:36 - by 15 degrees yeah right there
22:40 - and there we got it now we gotta work on
22:42 - the right flower
22:43 - so that was really quick
22:47 - and there we go we got this in this and
22:50 - now we gotta work on the right flower
22:51 - which is
22:53 - this one and then
22:56 - we have to first make the show
23:00 - and drag it somewhere in the right maybe
23:01 - here
23:03 - so and put this put this find my new
23:06 - position
23:08 - go to the back layer just
23:11 - go you don't need to make it go
23:13 - backwards any layers
23:15 - so let's put this back on and then
23:19 - this one we don't need to make it go
23:21 - back any layers too the left flower and
23:23 - the right layer
23:24 - flower and then so we have that and then
23:28 - we need to make um
23:32 - this turn the other way
23:37 - in degrees this way instead and instead
23:40 - of minus 20
23:41 - we got a plus 20 because it's getting
23:48 - larger
23:53 - and we got this so we have this so i'm
23:56 - gonna try to
23:58 - do this so flower color
24:02 - message
24:11 - and look we have the scissors and i just
24:14 - cut that one
24:20 - so and then we can start this all over
24:22 - again we have to do back to the card
24:25 - so we need to do that so as you can see
24:28 - i made that but we don't see our car
24:30 - so we gotta make it go back to the car
24:34 - so we gotta put the original things like
24:37 - the card
24:38 - when i receive back to card
24:43 - then it will show
24:49 - and now i'm just going to put this for
24:50 - basically everything
24:52 - except the buttons this
24:58 - this and that's it so let's just check
25:01 - if i have that back to card
25:04 - back to card back to card so there we
25:07 - have it
25:08 - oh i did i don't think i checked the
25:09 - hearts no i did back to cart
25:11 - and look so let's look at this project
25:16 - okay so as you can see i'm going to go
25:18 - snip snip

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's kids fighting around here and today we're back for another video of scratch so in this video we'll be working on the mother's day card so as you know that this is version two and that i will be doing the mother's day card because uh you know i haven't finished it completely i mean i i added some new things new concepts into the game so yeah that's why i made a version 2 of the mother's day game so mother's day is tomorrow as you know and also thank you for our one year anniversary we have made this a channel for one year now and has been one year and yeah today on may 8th so yeah thank you for all your support on the other videos so anyways i'm gonna show you the demo so first click on the green flag of course and then and play xylo one like the one i used in um in the um other one so i'm eating gummies right now so okay so i'm gonna change the flower color so you can change the flower color that's in the last video i also made the flower color that's my favorite flower message you can write to kcp um yeah and it'll show up there that was the last one and you can click done now some people might have seen my project already you click on the scissors and then you can move it all around if you do not click on it it cannot move and you can cut the flowers it'll go in the base these flowers on the left and the right go to the sides but this one goes in the front which makes it in front this is happy mother's day 231 to kcp the flower and these photos as you can see it's randomized flowers let me let me do this real quick done as you see it's randomized like last time i don't know what i got but i know it's randomized so we are at our old project i just renamed it right now mother's day card version 2 teaching so i just renamed that like right now so um yeah um we're gonna be working on this xylo one's playing this is the original one that's it this one was pretty plain so we decided to add the new version too so it's option i mean like i'd advise you to do version two because it'll be better and oh enhance your game so first we need one three place it around here um and we also need to rename it not rename but we need to add text on it so white text and we're going to name it done oopsies i put on caps lock done in handwriting done done done yeah done yeah so yeah and now we're gonna position this button real quick position this place position this button in the middle i don't even know why the buttons are never in the middle well i think that's for all sprites you put the done in the middle so there we got the done button and i just finished my gummy so i don't you won't hear any chewing noises so anyways we're gonna keep on going so the done button is what we need to make all the scissors and everything that can make the world better so we need the show and when this sprite is clicked broadcast new message go to garden and now we're gonna hide so there we go we have a button called done and now we gotta work on the scissors the garden flower the garden flower and the garden flower which are the three flowers that you cut so and the base so after we have to put all this in i'm pretty sure i have this in my backpack no wait hold on a second okay so but if you do not have it you can download this from this project i mean my last project the one i already shared or the um uh google drive so yeah we'll do that just some technical difficulties we got the scissors and everything in right here so we just got to click the upload sprite i have all this stuff so i'll be blurring this later so we have scissors one base sprite and yeah we have them two so yeah we have the vase and the scissors so now we're going to be working on the vase so the oh we have to make the backdrop so the backdrop is the um where it switches to the garden when you go to garden so it will be when i receive it'll switch costume to the first backdrop which is this clear blue backdrop and you gotta select the backdrop called garden rock after when you selected that you have to go to when i receive garden then it will switch costume to garden rock e so as you can see right now all these bases and stuff are shielding me but click done look we still have this on board let's change that later so we have um to work on the base and the scissors next so the vase should be fairly simple but we also have to put the sprites the flowers all the different costumes are the flowers inside all three of them so we just have to duplicate the flower three times i'm gonna work on hiding all these sprites when done is clicked so i'm just because it has a very small amounts of code so that's better if i do that first so when i receive go to garden it will hide already put that uh when the spray is clicked no wait oh this is the done button never mind uh the done button we have to go to the card and then we will start working up from there so card it will go to the back layer so show and then since if you're in the garden we added the show so it will show and then when i receive go to garden it will hide yes hide and after that it will go when i receive the back to card oh yeah back to carter's gone for now because we don't have that yet so we have to do show on this one there's already this on here so let's just put the sprite and put this so when the green flag is clicked i hate how it zooms out when you just i'll put the block in it'll show and then go to garden and it will hide and then now we're gonna work on the flower this flower yes the flower and then we're gonna do the when i when the green flag is clicked it will show so we have the flower and when i receive go to garden it will hide and then you just have to do this to basically all of the buttons so i'm just going to drag this over there yeah i'll just do that and i'm just going to drag this over there yeah and then we got everything we need here and then i just drag this over here oh yeah right there and then that's what we need over there so yeah go to garden let's right click yeah oh yeah and we also need to make this thing go to the front layer to show that when i receive go to garden yeah yeah this thing also needs that we don't we didn't need that never mind never mind let's look at the wrong thing and then the card color yep we have that and this thing go to garden let's just drag this right on we also already dragged two in okay so go to front layer and i'll show and it'll go to the guard backpack card we're not doing that yet so what i receive go to garden and we have everything yes and yeah you have to hide the variable so then when i receive because there's two variables there's the button and the variable and then you have to hide the variable so you can't see it anymore so hide bearable message and it will hide so we have that done and then that's all we need right now and yeah oh yeah and also this we also have to set message to mom let me show the variable because we were hiding it earlier so show and then it will show and now uh that's all we need okay so let's just work on the flowers and all the stuff next but let's look at this as you can see done all of it's gone except the vase and the scissors because i didn't do that and now we gotta put we're gonna put the duplicates of the flowers these flowers yes these flowers so we're gonna make three of these three of these and each of them can be named a different thing like in my original i think the name was uh garden flower one the first one garden flower one for the second one you guessed it garden flower two and the third one garden flower so yeah uh sort of reduced spaces uh because i'm so used to typing those things so anyways we're gonna put all of that together and yeah so yeah we have the garden flowers and now we're gonna work on garden flower one so when the green flag is clicked oh yeah we don't need any of this code not a single bit of these code or this one i'll delete all six blocks delete all six blocks now we can go back to garden flower one and as you can see when i drag this in and you need it to hide so you gotta go when i receive go to garden i'll point in direction 90 oh and i'll go to a position i have it at some coordinate negative 21 positive 10 negative 10 and then not positive 10 and um go to the front layer so that's what i have for this one go backwards one layer two one layer so it will be in front of the back it will be in front but not almost in front if you get what i mean like it will be behind the vase but in front and behind the scissors as well but like it's still in the front layer so then it'll switch costume to any of the pick randoms one to ten and then it will show it will go forever and you need it if then if then the scissors and mouse down touching scissors and mouse down so that means if the scissors is on it and when the mouse is down during it when you click this you hear this this this this that means it will that means it will cut so yeah we have mouse down and yeah we do that you know a change flower cut by minus one so let's just do this flower cut by minus one because you need three flowers and we're gonna delete um take that out for now and it'll start sound low loose so we have a sound low loose and now we're gonna glide to the tricky block of the tricky block plus 150. so the tricky block is this one we need two of those but first we need to go glide one second to x x position of the vase so they'll be on the base in the vase in the vase so we got to change the back you probably you guys probably get the deal by now base x position and duplicate and instead change this to y position oh yeah we also need the plus 150 like what i said yeah to make it go up a little bit because it will be directly in the center but if you do the plus 150 it'll be hanging out of the vase so that's what we have right here and we're going to stop this script so i forgot to get the code the scissors so i'll be doing that next so the scissors and we have the scissors so we're going to coat them with has some code so when the green flag is clicked it will set flower cut to three because there's three flowers and that's when you when you make the variable but i made the other flower first and then i'm going to go hide and then let's go to the garden and that's when he starts showing so go to negative 106 negative 100 and it'll wait 0.1 seconds so this weight is for if the scissors will go in the front layer because if you go to the back layer you'll be snipping the flowers from the back so you need the 0.1 second weight to so it will be in front of the flower and everything else so we have this and wait 0.1 seconds it will go to the front layer and it will show now we gotta wait until so just wait until uh let me click this real quick wait until we need to end so it's touching the mouse pointer and mouse is down which is if you click on it you can start dragging the scissors all around and we have that so it'll go forever so this has to be there to make this script work not the script but like this forever loop and now go to the mouse pointer you know if then if then the flower equals cut equals zero that means it will stop and go back to the back to the card so let's do this zero flower cut hide wait two seconds right test back to card and it'll stop this script so we have that done now we gotta work on the rest of the flowers so we're gonna test this so we have this so we have actually didn't put the show on the button so you need the show to the show on these two buttons i already did it for the message actually didn't put that in so show and make sure you guys do it too so i make sure you guys i'll put the show in and now you can change the flower color and now you're going to click the done and then you've got the scissors you can cut the flower and you'll go to the base on the top and now we got to go the base and then the rest of the flowers so let's go to the vase the vase um we have to code this and the vase is when the green flag is clicked it will go to this position it will hide when i receive go to garden oh show so we have to put a little bit more code than that and we'll go to front layer and then show so it'll go to in front of the flowers not the scissors because the scissors has the delay which means he'll go in front of the vase as well so it will go to front layer and show and there we got it and now we gotta work on the other flap the other garden flowers which i'm gonna look at right now so we're gonna do the left one first which is this one yeah it doesn't matter which one it is but let's just do this so the left one which basically has the same code as this so we're gonna drag all this code to the left flower we just need a little bit change and then that's all we need for this one so we're going to find the new position for this flower so we're going to drag it around here and then put this on and then we need to instead of going to the front layer we got to go to the back layer because it's behind the middle flower and switch costume yeah yeah we all got that but then now we need this x position of vase minus 20 because it's on the left side base minus 20 and the y is the same and stop we got to make this turn to the left by 15 degrees yeah right there and there we got it now we gotta work on the right flower so that was really quick and there we go we got this in this and now we gotta work on the right flower which is this one and then we have to first make the show and drag it somewhere in the right maybe here so and put this put this find my new position go to the back layer just go you don't need to make it go backwards any layers so let's put this back on and then this one we don't need to make it go back any layers too the left flower and the right layer flower and then so we have that and then we need to make um this turn the other way in degrees this way instead and instead of minus 20 we got a plus 20 because it's getting larger and we got this so we have this so i'm gonna try to do this so flower color message and look we have the scissors and i just cut that one so and then we can start this all over again we have to do back to the card so we need to do that so as you can see i made that but we don't see our car so we gotta make it go back to the car so we gotta put the original things like the card when i receive back to card then it will show and now i'm just going to put this for basically everything except the buttons this this and that's it so let's just check if i have that back to card back to card back to card so there we have it oh i did i don't think i checked the hearts no i did back to cart and look so let's look at this project okay so as you can see i'm going to go snip snip snip so in this card will show up we're going to do back to card for the message like what who you want to send it to so we have this and when i receive back to car then it will show variable we didn't need that a show variable uh message so you have that and there we have it our project so let's do this i'm going to move the left flower out because it looks too close to the scissors as you can see it's not too close but if you have a different variant of a flower it will be a little bit too close to the flower so i'm gonna move it around up there around the garden rock so yeah let's change the position to 190 take that out put that in drag it back down and there we have it the thing the mother's day card so i'm gonna try to design my card so flower color i really like this one i made and yeah and then card color i really my favorite color is blue but of these i think red is my second so i'm going to take red and then message to kcp one year so kcp one year yeah that's where i'm sending the car and then done now to cut the flowers click on the scissors and there we have it we have the vase and it says to kcp one year happy mother's day 21 we have the hearts and we have the flowers so that's basically all we had all we had to do in 27 minutes so anyways us a like share subscribe and comment and who you're gonna send this to i mean like it could it could be uh father's day and you could change this mother's day to father's day or something but just comment in the comment section below uh who you're gonna send this card to oh yeah we also have a father's day card video on our channel so if you guys you guys can check that out uh on our channel and we have a mother's day now so anyways see you guys next time
