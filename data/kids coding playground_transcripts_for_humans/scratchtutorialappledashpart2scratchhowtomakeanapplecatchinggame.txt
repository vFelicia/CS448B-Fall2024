00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids coding
00:08 - playground here
00:09 - today we'll be working on our second
00:11 - part for apple dash game
00:13 - so for apple dash game i will go over
00:15 - the code we had
00:16 - last video so this is the movement of
00:19 - the player right here
00:22 - and this is setting up the player and
00:24 - then for the basket
00:26 - right here we have the setting of the
00:28 - basket switch the costume
00:30 - and right here we have it to go to the
00:32 - player at all times
00:34 - and then for the fruit this is what we
00:35 - have from the last time when
00:37 - we fly click we want to hide it um we're
00:39 - going to set this fruit speed to
00:41 - negative six
00:42 - and this is the code for the fruit going
00:45 - down
00:47 - and if it touches the basket or hitbox
00:49 - it'll go back up
00:50 - and go to a random position again and
00:53 - then we got the begin
00:54 - button okay and it's just spinning the
00:58 - button
00:59 - and this is starting it up and then
01:01 - we've got the hit box which is the
01:03 - bottom when the fruit hits the bottom
01:04 - they don't go back up
01:06 - okay all right so today we'll be working
01:08 - on the bomb and lives
01:10 - and we'll also probably get into the
01:12 - coins so
01:14 - right now for our bomb we have the bomb
01:17 - so we'll probably put this into the
01:19 - description below um
01:21 - [Music]
01:24 - okay sorry um this is a bomb
01:28 - we'll probably put this in the
01:29 - description below into the google drive
01:31 - or you can download one if you want
01:33 - yourself or you can draw your own it's
01:35 - pretty simple just draw a black circle
01:37 - and you can draw some flare on the top
01:40 - so that's how you draw a bomb i guess
01:42 - we're also going to bring our um lives
01:46 - health so all we did is just draw three
01:49 - crosses one it's like a fruit ninja how
01:51 - you have three of these
01:53 - so if they have three hp
01:56 - left then they'll have this two hp
01:58 - they'll have this
02:00 - one hp they'll have this and zero hp
02:02 - it'll be like that
02:04 - so we used some shade a different shade
02:06 - of color so to make it look better
02:08 - um and every time you hit a bomb you
02:10 - will lose one light so that's what it
02:12 - does
02:13 - so let's get coating inside the bomb so
02:16 - [Music]
02:17 - okay so for the bomb boy green fly
02:20 - clicked
02:22 - okay so yes let's do this big all right
02:25 - so
02:25 - for the bomb and when we clicked we want
02:28 - to hide
02:30 - and then when i receive start game when
02:33 - i receive start game
02:36 - start game we want to set the bomb speed
02:39 - to negative 8 which is a new variable i
02:41 - believe bomb
02:44 - bomb speed bomb speed
02:48 - to negative 8 so that's gonna be like
02:50 - that fruits falling
02:52 - it's gonna be bomb speed it's gonna be
02:55 - for the
02:56 - bombs instead so negative eight and then
02:59 - we're gonna go to a random position
03:03 - and we're going to set the y to 180
03:06 - which is the top
03:08 - and we're going to get a forever loop so
03:10 - let's go control
03:11 - forever if
03:16 - um hit bomb is equal to no so that means
03:19 - if
03:19 - a player has not touched the bomb so
03:24 - you know so if hit bomb the variable
03:28 - is equal to no then we are going to
03:30 - change the y
03:31 - by the bomb speed so if it's not being
03:34 - hit
03:34 - then it will keep on going down so the
03:38 - bomb speed no not like that change the y
03:41 - by bombsie change y
03:44 - by the bomb speed inside the variables
03:46 - so just put that in here
03:48 - and after that we're going to go to
03:49 - control if
03:53 - um touching
03:57 - the hitbox the bottom hit box
04:02 - then we are going to hide
04:05 - hide the bomb and we're going to go to a
04:08 - random position again
04:10 - and set the y to 180
04:15 - set y to 180
04:21 - and then we're gonna wait pick random
04:24 - one to three seconds
04:25 - so we have two different costumes one is
04:27 - the explosion
04:29 - and one is just the bomb so we're gonna
04:32 - pick random one to three seconds
04:35 - we're gonna wait so it's gonna wait a
04:37 - little bit time before
04:38 - switching um putting another bomb so
04:41 - we're gonna
04:42 - wait and pick random one to three and
04:43 - then we're gonna obviously switch to the
04:45 - first costume
04:46 - first because it has not contacted with
04:49 - the player
04:50 - and will not explode and then we're
04:52 - gonna show after that
04:55 - all right and after that we're going to
04:56 - get another if that statement go to
04:58 - control
04:59 - if put that in here if touching the
05:02 - basket
05:04 - so if the bomb is touching the basket
05:07 - we're gonna
05:08 - set the hit bomb to yes
05:15 - yes and we're gonna broadcast another
05:18 - message
05:19 - and let's name it um
05:22 - bomb hit player bomb hit
05:26 - hit uh player bomb hit players so that's
05:30 - what i'm gonna do
05:32 - and then right here when i receive
05:35 - bomb hit player then we are going to
05:39 - let's find the sound oh yeah boom cloud
05:41 - this is the one i had
05:43 - boom clown just sounds like this
05:46 - um so that's the one we're going to use
05:48 - and then we're going to switch the
05:49 - costume costume 2
05:50 - which is the exploding bomb over here
05:54 - and then we are going to wait 0.5
05:56 - seconds
05:57 - and then hide so it's gonna explode and
06:00 - then wait a little bit before hiding so
06:02 - and then we're gonna hide it and we're
06:04 - gonna switch the costume back to the
06:06 - first costume which is bomb
06:08 - and after that we're going to make it go
06:09 - back to a random position go to random
06:11 - position
06:12 - and set the y to 180.
06:16 - okay now let's go to the fruit catcher
06:20 - i mean not for cash let's go to the
06:22 - basket actually i think we should go to
06:23 - the
06:24 - health first let's work on the health
06:25 - first so for the health
06:27 - we're going to if a bomb comes in
06:30 - contact
06:31 - with the player then it'll lose a life
06:33 - oh yeah and i forgot
06:35 - let me go through this code real quick
06:37 - so
06:38 - yeah so this is the code make sure you
06:40 - didn't miss anything
06:42 - let's go to health so the hp
06:45 - we're going to do one green flight
06:46 - clicked hide
06:48 - and hide the hp and we're gonna set
06:51 - the variable hit bomb
06:55 - to node and then after that we're going
06:58 - to when i receive start game
07:01 - when i receive start game we're gonna
07:02 - switch costume to three health
07:04 - which is the first costume switch
07:07 - costume
07:08 - to three health so it still has max hp
07:11 - we're gonna show
07:14 - and after that we're going to when i
07:17 - receive
07:18 - bomb hit player and we're going to next
07:21 - costume
07:22 - we're going to do next costume because
07:24 - the next costume is
07:26 - the second one so basically every single
07:29 - time it gets hit
07:30 - it will switch to the next costume
07:32 - that's what it's for
07:34 - and then we're going to get an if ben
07:36 - state so if
07:39 - uh costume number is equal to four that
07:41 - means the player has no more lies
07:42 - because the fourth one is
07:44 - zero lives so costume number let's go
07:46 - here
07:48 - you can also use costume name but we're
07:51 - gonna be using custom number
07:53 - if that's equal to four then we're going
07:55 - to get an if then statement
07:58 - if okay so this is for later so
08:02 - this is if the score is greater than
08:03 - high score then we're going to set the
08:04 - high score to score
08:06 - um i'm just going to put this in any way
08:07 - so for later you can
08:09 - sense for the high score so we're going
08:11 - to get a greater than symbol so on the
08:12 - score
08:14 - is greater than high score then we're
08:16 - going to set the
08:17 - variable high score to score all right
08:20 - so after this we're going to broadcast
08:22 - the message
08:23 - so once the player loses we're going to
08:24 - broadcast a message called end
08:27 - and again so that's gonna end the game
08:30 - and then we're gonna wait two seconds
08:32 - and we're gonna set the hit bomb back to
08:35 - note
08:36 - after this we're gonna set back to no
08:39 - hit
08:40 - bomb to no
08:43 - all right so this is the lives
08:47 - so i'm gonna play
08:51 - so let's click begin so
08:54 - i'm gonna catch some fruit
08:58 - and hopefully a bomb will fall i think i
09:01 - have to show the bomb
09:03 - yeah i show it i think i did
09:09 - so as you can see when you play it
09:12 - bombs will start falling if you hit one
09:15 - then you'll lose a life as you can see
09:17 - in the top right corner
09:22 - so bombs will drop randomly and as you
09:24 - can see
09:25 - the fruit will always give you more i
09:28 - give you points
09:29 - so run at the end so
09:32 - bomb you dodge it you'll disappear
09:36 - as you can see it's working the bombs
09:39 - are falling
09:40 - if you hit one then you'll lose a life
09:43 - and
09:44 - in the future we're going to add more
09:45 - bombs so we're going to duplicate this
09:47 - bomb so that you get more bombs in your
09:49 - game
09:50 - so that's what we're going to do as well
09:52 - to make it
09:53 - like more bombs because right now there
09:55 - isn't that much so
09:57 - it's only going one at a time so we want
09:59 - multiple at once so that's why we're
10:00 - going to
10:01 - duplicate it later so as you can see
10:04 - this is the code for the bomb
10:07 - and this is the code for the health
10:11 - and when you get hit by a bomb and
10:14 - you'll lose one health as you can see
10:16 - let's find a bomb see
10:19 - as you can see you'll lose a life
10:23 - so yeah that's basically the health and
10:26 - bomb code
10:28 - and now we can go work on coins
10:32 - so coins will give you uh
10:36 - what's it called money so with the money
10:38 - you can buy stuff in the shop
10:41 - i'm gonna hide these variables okay so
10:46 - for the coin you can either draw your
10:48 - own like just a yellow circle
10:50 - with like a money symbol in the middle
10:53 - so we actually have our own so
10:55 - um i'm gonna import that in real quick
10:57 - okay as you can see i have imported my
10:59 - coin
11:00 - so we downloaded this from online i
11:02 - think so it's just a coin with the star
11:04 - in the center
11:05 - you can draw your own if you wanted to
11:06 - make more simple
11:08 - so for the coin let's get coding on here
11:10 - so i'm just gonna
11:13 - um work on the coin so um we might put
11:15 - this in the comment section below as
11:16 - well so you guys can download it
11:19 - so for the coin when green flag clicked
11:21 - we want to hide
11:23 - the coin and one thing we want to do
11:27 - with all the sprites
11:28 - is want to receive end game as you can
11:30 - see when you lose all your lives
11:32 - a broadcast end game right here
11:35 - so one thing we need to do for all like
11:38 - the player and all the stuff
11:39 - when it's end game we want to hide them
11:41 - i think so
11:42 - why didn't i see if end game we're going
11:44 - to hide and stuff like that so i'm going
11:45 - to do that real quick so
11:46 - i'm going to see end game we want to
11:50 - hide and stop
11:51 - other scripts in the sprite
11:55 - stop by the description spray and we can
11:58 - just drag and drop that
11:59 - to every single sprite we have right
12:01 - here
12:04 - so drag and drop it to duplicate it
12:08 - drag
12:12 - all right i don't think we need it for
12:13 - the hitbox because the hitbox has
12:15 - nothing it's just hiding pretty much
12:17 - most of the time
12:19 - okay so for the coin let's go back to
12:22 - the coin
12:23 - okay so in the coin we are going to
12:27 - oh when i receive start game
12:30 - we can make a variable new variable
12:34 - i'm going to name it wait time so it's
12:37 - basically
12:38 - the time you wait until a new coin falls
12:41 - so we're going to set the wait time
12:45 - to 3 wait time
12:48 - i already have another one i'm gonna
12:50 - delete this one
12:52 - i don't know why i have it um i think
12:53 - it's because i import the coin
12:55 - so wait time to three
12:58 - and we're going to set the coin speed a
13:00 - new variable we're going to make
13:02 - pulling the reason we're doing um
13:06 - all these variables to control their
13:07 - falling speed and stuff like that is
13:09 - because
13:10 - um when armageddons come we want to
13:12 - increase the speeds that's why
13:14 - so when the coin speed we're gonna set
13:16 - the coin speed
13:18 - to negative nine so we're going to make
13:19 - it fall a little bit faster than the
13:21 - normal
13:22 - apples fruits and bomb so queen's b's a
13:25 - bit faster
13:26 - and then we're gonna make a new variable
13:28 - so we're gonna
13:29 - call it coin falling
13:33 - so in the beginning we're going to set
13:35 - coin falling
13:36 - to no because the coin has not dropped
13:39 - yet
13:40 - so coin falling to node and then we're
13:43 - going to make it go to a random position
13:45 - and set the y to 180 and then
13:48 - next we're going to get a forever loop
13:51 - forever
13:53 - if we're going to get an if that
13:54 - statement so if
13:56 - uh the coin falling is equal to no
14:01 - equal to no so coin falling
14:06 - coin falling is equal to no then we're
14:07 - going to show
14:11 - and we're going to turn 5 degrees left
14:15 - so that's we're going to make the coin
14:17 - turn
14:18 - rotate and we're going to change the y
14:20 - by the coin speed
14:22 - change the y by coin speed
14:27 - all right and then next we're going to
14:28 - get an if that statement so if it's
14:30 - touching
14:32 - right here in the coin falling inside
14:35 - this
14:36 - statement we're going to put another if
14:37 - then so if
14:39 - it's touching the coin is touching the
14:44 - hit box then we're going to
14:48 - go to a random position we just
14:50 - basically duplicate this part of the
14:52 - code and put this in
14:54 - and then for that we're going to get an
14:55 - if that seaman so if it's touching
14:58 - so if touching basket let me take this
15:01 - out
15:03 - if touching basket uh where's that
15:06 - over here so the coin's touching the
15:08 - basket then we're gonna
15:09 - start with sound called kuching i got
15:12 - this
15:13 - sounds like this uh i got this from
15:16 - online i think
15:17 - or they have it in here i don't remember
15:19 - i made this a very long time ago
15:22 - so do they have it in here let's see
15:26 - uh looks like they don't have it so i
15:27 - think we got that from online
15:29 - so you can just play any sound you want
15:32 - maybe a pop
15:33 - coaching we have we will um you can
15:35 - probably download your own from online
15:37 - so after this we're gonna make it give a
15:39 - pick random money so we're gonna change
15:41 - the money
15:43 - money by pick random one to ten
15:47 - and after that we're going to duplicate
15:49 - this go to random position
15:51 - set wide 180 and then we're going to set
15:53 - the coin falling to yes because the coin
15:55 - is now falling
15:57 - set coin falling
16:02 - to yes so i have another coin following
16:05 - variable probably because i
16:08 - imported it so let me delete this other
16:11 - coin speed so sorry about that
16:14 - uh so yeah coin falling to yes and then
16:17 - we're gonna
16:19 - broadcast a message and we're gonna call
16:21 - it coin
16:22 - hit basket
16:26 - coin
16:31 - hit basket and then up here when i
16:33 - receive coin hit basket
16:37 - coin basket we're going to hide
16:40 - and hide the coin and then we're going
16:42 - to use the go to random position set
16:44 - y to 180 and then we're gonna wait wait
16:47 - time
16:49 - before spotting another coin
16:52 - wait time and after that we're gonna set
16:54 - the coin
16:56 - falling back to no coin falling to note
17:01 - okay so this is the code for it now save
17:04 - it
17:05 - run it in full screen so we're going to
17:07 - click begin
17:10 - the coins are falling
17:14 - when you catch a coin as you can see you
17:16 - get a random amount of money
17:19 - as you can see
17:22 - apparently um the touching hit box for
17:25 - the bomb doesn't work apparently
17:27 - i think it's because the bomb does not
17:29 - touch the hitbox um
17:32 - at first so we're gonna have to use the
17:35 - chain
17:36 - uh this script right here so instead of
17:38 - this hitbox thing touching hitbox for
17:40 - the bomb
17:41 - we're going to put this into there so i
17:43 - made a small mistake right there
17:45 - so it should be changed uh if y position
17:47 - is less than negative 170.
17:49 - so i think that's how it works so now
17:52 - we can go full screen and i can show you
17:54 - guys
17:55 - so now the bombs will start spawning
17:57 - periodically as
17:58 - before it did not so
18:02 - you'll lose one life another
18:06 - spot as you can see so you're gonna have
18:08 - to change that out remember
18:11 - and once i'll try to find another bomb
18:13 - okay
18:14 - as you can see when you hit three bombs
18:17 - then you lose so yes that's basically
18:20 - this tutorial
18:21 - remember to change this sorry about that
18:25 - um i didn't realize that wouldn't work
18:27 - so you have to use
18:29 - y positions less than negative 170 so
18:32 - yeah
18:32 - that's what you want to do so thank you
18:35 - guys for watching
18:36 - don't forget to like share and subscribe
18:38 - for part three
18:40 - and i'll see you guys in the next video
18:43 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here today we'll be working on our second part for apple dash game so for apple dash game i will go over the code we had last video so this is the movement of the player right here and this is setting up the player and then for the basket right here we have the setting of the basket switch the costume and right here we have it to go to the player at all times and then for the fruit this is what we have from the last time when we fly click we want to hide it um we're going to set this fruit speed to negative six and this is the code for the fruit going down and if it touches the basket or hitbox it'll go back up and go to a random position again and then we got the begin button okay and it's just spinning the button and this is starting it up and then we've got the hit box which is the bottom when the fruit hits the bottom they don't go back up okay all right so today we'll be working on the bomb and lives and we'll also probably get into the coins so right now for our bomb we have the bomb so we'll probably put this into the description below um okay sorry um this is a bomb we'll probably put this in the description below into the google drive or you can download one if you want yourself or you can draw your own it's pretty simple just draw a black circle and you can draw some flare on the top so that's how you draw a bomb i guess we're also going to bring our um lives health so all we did is just draw three crosses one it's like a fruit ninja how you have three of these so if they have three hp left then they'll have this two hp they'll have this one hp they'll have this and zero hp it'll be like that so we used some shade a different shade of color so to make it look better um and every time you hit a bomb you will lose one light so that's what it does so let's get coating inside the bomb so okay so for the bomb boy green fly clicked okay so yes let's do this big all right so for the bomb and when we clicked we want to hide and then when i receive start game when i receive start game start game we want to set the bomb speed to negative 8 which is a new variable i believe bomb bomb speed bomb speed to negative 8 so that's gonna be like that fruits falling it's gonna be bomb speed it's gonna be for the bombs instead so negative eight and then we're gonna go to a random position and we're going to set the y to 180 which is the top and we're going to get a forever loop so let's go control forever if um hit bomb is equal to no so that means if a player has not touched the bomb so you know so if hit bomb the variable is equal to no then we are going to change the y by the bomb speed so if it's not being hit then it will keep on going down so the bomb speed no not like that change the y by bombsie change y by the bomb speed inside the variables so just put that in here and after that we're going to go to control if um touching the hitbox the bottom hit box then we are going to hide hide the bomb and we're going to go to a random position again and set the y to 180 set y to 180 and then we're gonna wait pick random one to three seconds so we have two different costumes one is the explosion and one is just the bomb so we're gonna pick random one to three seconds we're gonna wait so it's gonna wait a little bit time before switching um putting another bomb so we're gonna wait and pick random one to three and then we're gonna obviously switch to the first costume first because it has not contacted with the player and will not explode and then we're gonna show after that all right and after that we're going to get another if that statement go to control if put that in here if touching the basket so if the bomb is touching the basket we're gonna set the hit bomb to yes yes and we're gonna broadcast another message and let's name it um bomb hit player bomb hit hit uh player bomb hit players so that's what i'm gonna do and then right here when i receive bomb hit player then we are going to let's find the sound oh yeah boom cloud this is the one i had boom clown just sounds like this um so that's the one we're going to use and then we're going to switch the costume costume 2 which is the exploding bomb over here and then we are going to wait 0.5 seconds and then hide so it's gonna explode and then wait a little bit before hiding so and then we're gonna hide it and we're gonna switch the costume back to the first costume which is bomb and after that we're going to make it go back to a random position go to random position and set the y to 180. okay now let's go to the fruit catcher i mean not for cash let's go to the basket actually i think we should go to the health first let's work on the health first so for the health we're going to if a bomb comes in contact with the player then it'll lose a life oh yeah and i forgot let me go through this code real quick so yeah so this is the code make sure you didn't miss anything let's go to health so the hp we're going to do one green flight clicked hide and hide the hp and we're gonna set the variable hit bomb to node and then after that we're going to when i receive start game when i receive start game we're gonna switch costume to three health which is the first costume switch costume to three health so it still has max hp we're gonna show and after that we're going to when i receive bomb hit player and we're going to next costume we're going to do next costume because the next costume is the second one so basically every single time it gets hit it will switch to the next costume that's what it's for and then we're going to get an if ben state so if uh costume number is equal to four that means the player has no more lies because the fourth one is zero lives so costume number let's go here you can also use costume name but we're gonna be using custom number if that's equal to four then we're going to get an if then statement if okay so this is for later so this is if the score is greater than high score then we're going to set the high score to score um i'm just going to put this in any way so for later you can sense for the high score so we're going to get a greater than symbol so on the score is greater than high score then we're going to set the variable high score to score all right so after this we're going to broadcast the message so once the player loses we're going to broadcast a message called end and again so that's gonna end the game and then we're gonna wait two seconds and we're gonna set the hit bomb back to note after this we're gonna set back to no hit bomb to no all right so this is the lives so i'm gonna play so let's click begin so i'm gonna catch some fruit and hopefully a bomb will fall i think i have to show the bomb yeah i show it i think i did so as you can see when you play it bombs will start falling if you hit one then you'll lose a life as you can see in the top right corner so bombs will drop randomly and as you can see the fruit will always give you more i give you points so run at the end so bomb you dodge it you'll disappear as you can see it's working the bombs are falling if you hit one then you'll lose a life and in the future we're going to add more bombs so we're going to duplicate this bomb so that you get more bombs in your game so that's what we're going to do as well to make it like more bombs because right now there isn't that much so it's only going one at a time so we want multiple at once so that's why we're going to duplicate it later so as you can see this is the code for the bomb and this is the code for the health and when you get hit by a bomb and you'll lose one health as you can see let's find a bomb see as you can see you'll lose a life so yeah that's basically the health and bomb code and now we can go work on coins so coins will give you uh what's it called money so with the money you can buy stuff in the shop i'm gonna hide these variables okay so for the coin you can either draw your own like just a yellow circle with like a money symbol in the middle so we actually have our own so um i'm gonna import that in real quick okay as you can see i have imported my coin so we downloaded this from online i think so it's just a coin with the star in the center you can draw your own if you wanted to make more simple so for the coin let's get coding on here so i'm just gonna um work on the coin so um we might put this in the comment section below as well so you guys can download it so for the coin when green flag clicked we want to hide the coin and one thing we want to do with all the sprites is want to receive end game as you can see when you lose all your lives a broadcast end game right here so one thing we need to do for all like the player and all the stuff when it's end game we want to hide them i think so why didn't i see if end game we're going to hide and stuff like that so i'm going to do that real quick so i'm going to see end game we want to hide and stop other scripts in the sprite stop by the description spray and we can just drag and drop that to every single sprite we have right here so drag and drop it to duplicate it drag all right i don't think we need it for the hitbox because the hitbox has nothing it's just hiding pretty much most of the time okay so for the coin let's go back to the coin okay so in the coin we are going to oh when i receive start game we can make a variable new variable i'm going to name it wait time so it's basically the time you wait until a new coin falls so we're going to set the wait time to 3 wait time i already have another one i'm gonna delete this one i don't know why i have it um i think it's because i import the coin so wait time to three and we're going to set the coin speed a new variable we're going to make pulling the reason we're doing um all these variables to control their falling speed and stuff like that is because um when armageddons come we want to increase the speeds that's why so when the coin speed we're gonna set the coin speed to negative nine so we're going to make it fall a little bit faster than the normal apples fruits and bomb so queen's b's a bit faster and then we're gonna make a new variable so we're gonna call it coin falling so in the beginning we're going to set coin falling to no because the coin has not dropped yet so coin falling to node and then we're going to make it go to a random position and set the y to 180 and then next we're going to get a forever loop forever if we're going to get an if that statement so if uh the coin falling is equal to no equal to no so coin falling coin falling is equal to no then we're going to show and we're going to turn 5 degrees left so that's we're going to make the coin turn rotate and we're going to change the y by the coin speed change the y by coin speed all right and then next we're going to get an if that statement so if it's touching right here in the coin falling inside this statement we're going to put another if then so if it's touching the coin is touching the hit box then we're going to go to a random position we just basically duplicate this part of the code and put this in and then for that we're going to get an if that seaman so if it's touching so if touching basket let me take this out if touching basket uh where's that over here so the coin's touching the basket then we're gonna start with sound called kuching i got this sounds like this uh i got this from online i think or they have it in here i don't remember i made this a very long time ago so do they have it in here let's see uh looks like they don't have it so i think we got that from online so you can just play any sound you want maybe a pop coaching we have we will um you can probably download your own from online so after this we're gonna make it give a pick random money so we're gonna change the money money by pick random one to ten and after that we're going to duplicate this go to random position set wide 180 and then we're going to set the coin falling to yes because the coin is now falling set coin falling to yes so i have another coin following variable probably because i imported it so let me delete this other coin speed so sorry about that uh so yeah coin falling to yes and then we're gonna broadcast a message and we're gonna call it coin hit basket coin hit basket and then up here when i receive coin hit basket coin basket we're going to hide and hide the coin and then we're going to use the go to random position set y to 180 and then we're gonna wait wait time before spotting another coin wait time and after that we're gonna set the coin falling back to no coin falling to note okay so this is the code for it now save it run it in full screen so we're going to click begin the coins are falling when you catch a coin as you can see you get a random amount of money as you can see apparently um the touching hit box for the bomb doesn't work apparently i think it's because the bomb does not touch the hitbox um at first so we're gonna have to use the chain uh this script right here so instead of this hitbox thing touching hitbox for the bomb we're going to put this into there so i made a small mistake right there so it should be changed uh if y position is less than negative 170. so i think that's how it works so now we can go full screen and i can show you guys so now the bombs will start spawning periodically as before it did not so you'll lose one life another spot as you can see so you're gonna have to change that out remember and once i'll try to find another bomb okay as you can see when you hit three bombs then you lose so yes that's basically this tutorial remember to change this sorry about that um i didn't realize that wouldn't work so you have to use y positions less than negative 170 so yeah that's what you want to do so thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe for part three and i'll see you guys in the next video
