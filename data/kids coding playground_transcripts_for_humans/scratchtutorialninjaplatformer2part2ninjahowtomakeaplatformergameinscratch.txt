00:00 - [Music]
00:22 - hello guys welcome back to the channel
00:24 - so today we'll continue our ninja
00:27 - platformer uh tutorial so yesterday we
00:30 - worked on the uh hitbox the main
00:33 - character
00:34 - the hitbox so today we'll work on the
00:36 - ninja itself
00:38 - so we're gonna make this ninja follow
00:40 - the hitbox and then we'll be able to
00:42 - move according to it you can either use
00:45 - the ninja here or you can use the ninja
00:47 - girl
00:48 - both for the same
00:49 - i kept i created all the uh
00:53 - costume for it so if you look in the
00:55 - costume
00:56 - you have all the costume for the ninja
00:59 - as well as the
01:01 - same amount number of customers ninja
01:03 - boy so
01:04 - over equally the same so you can choose
01:07 - either one of them to use for your game
01:10 - okay all right so i'm gonna hide the
01:12 - ninja girl for now
01:14 - so i think in the tutorial i have the
01:16 - ninja oy so but uh you can use either
01:18 - one okay so let's begin so where we left
01:22 - off last time was uh to create the uh
01:25 - the main character to move so you we
01:28 - play our game right now we can still
01:30 - move right jump
01:32 - and then move left and move right
01:34 - so that is pretty much uh good with the
01:37 - main character that's the hardest one so
01:39 - now let's make the ninja move itself so
01:42 - the name just gonna follow the uh
01:44 - the hitbox
01:47 - okay so in the ninja uh let's go so go
01:50 - to uh when green flag is click sorry i
01:52 - was a ninja girl
01:54 - and go back to the ninja boy i have here
01:57 - so when green black is clicked
02:00 - let me zoom in
02:02 - so um we're gonna set the uh so i think
02:05 - we have the depth variable that we had
02:07 - earlier so we can set that to uh zero
02:12 - then set the size
02:14 - to
02:15 - 35 percent i think that's what i had in
02:17 - the game earlier
02:19 - and then we can set the rotation style
02:22 - left to right
02:24 - or you can do it over here as well
02:26 - selecting this button in the middle
02:28 - okay and then i'm going to say go to the
02:32 - front layer
02:33 - and then
02:34 - show
02:36 - okay so this is for the ninja setup in
02:39 - the beginning so once i make the ninja
02:41 - follow the hit box i'm gonna make the
02:43 - hit box to ghost effect 100 so we will
02:46 - not be able to see it
02:47 - okay all right
02:49 - so um well we broadcast a couple message
02:52 - right in the uh
02:53 - in the game from the main sprite which
02:56 - is the hitbox so we have one is um stock
02:59 - game right so let's select that
03:02 - and then let's throw in a forever loop
03:04 - here
03:06 - here i will make it go to
03:11 - and then select the uh
03:13 - main character
03:15 - okay
03:17 - all right so next we have the
03:22 - if
03:26 - okay so we're going to use the operator
03:29 - n
03:31 - okay
03:32 - here we're going to use the knot
03:37 - and then we're going to get the sensing
03:41 - uh key press we're going to select any
03:45 - so there's no not any key press
03:48 - and
03:50 - we're going to have an equal sign here
03:53 - and then we're going to use the variable
03:55 - uh
03:56 - on the ground so basically if the
03:58 - there's no key press and the player is
04:01 - on the ground
04:03 - then we're going to set it to the
04:06 - standing costume so gonna change the
04:08 - costume
04:12 - to
04:13 - i five which is idle number five and
04:16 - then they have a lot of different
04:18 - custom for the idle sprite so i only
04:20 - took one of them when i created this
04:22 - that's right
04:23 - okay uh next
04:26 - we're gonna create some variable for
04:28 - this uh uh
04:30 - player i mean this is this sprite so
04:32 - let's make some variable
04:34 - so select for this sprite only we're
04:37 - gonna say run
04:39 - uh costume
04:42 - index
04:43 - okay
04:44 - so this will help us to switch the
04:46 - costume for the ninja when they run
04:49 - around
04:51 - okay
04:53 - next we are going to create
04:55 - called
04:57 - jump
05:00 - costume
05:01 - index okay for the sprite only
05:05 - okay so next
05:07 - comment another
05:08 - variable for the sprite only
05:12 - so what we have here is a costume
05:16 - index
05:17 - so this is uh
05:19 - what i'm going to reuse this one so this
05:22 - for the action like throwing a knife
05:25 - um
05:26 - you know using a sword or lighting so
05:28 - we're gonna reuse this so because
05:30 - basically we will not be
05:32 - uh doing those things at the same time
05:34 - anyway so we don't need to create
05:36 - different um
05:38 - different indexes we can just reuse the
05:40 - custom index but for the run and jump
05:42 - they could have
05:44 - in the same time so that's why we give
05:46 - it a different different variable
05:49 - okay
05:50 - all right so with the start games on
05:53 - next we're gonna have another one
05:55 - so we're gonna do the start game as well
05:59 - so when i receive start game
06:03 - i'm gonna go set
06:06 - set the running
06:09 - custom index to one
06:12 - i think i have zero i think let me just
06:14 - check
06:16 - yeah i think one begins with zero you
06:17 - see die zero zero 0 1 yes or 0 so let's
06:21 - start with 0 okay
06:23 - and then we are going to use the
06:26 - forever loop
06:28 - okay and we're going to have the if
06:30 - condition here
06:33 - and what we're going to do is going to
06:34 - check
06:35 - if it's actually over nine because uh
06:38 - the index is from zero to nine i'll show
06:41 - you in a bit so let's go back to the
06:43 - custom so we go up go look at the run
06:46 - so you can see the run start is zero see
06:49 - run zero you see run zero
06:52 - all the way to
06:53 - run
06:54 - number nine easy
06:56 - and then after that is jump so only from
06:59 - zero to nine so we're going to say
07:03 - when the custom run custom index is
07:06 - greater than 9
07:08 - we're going to set it back to zero
07:11 - okay
07:12 - set the run
07:14 - custom index make sure you have all the
07:16 - same variable here if you miss
07:19 - having different index
07:21 - your ninja will look funny when it runs
07:24 - okay so next we will go down we're gonna
07:27 - add
07:29 - if condition here so here what we're
07:32 - going to do is going to check the key
07:35 - so i'm going to say if
07:38 - a right arrow key
07:40 - is pressed
07:41 - so for this one we are going to point
07:43 - the ninja to
07:45 - 90 which is uh onto the right side
07:49 - and then we are going to switch costume
07:52 - now what we're going to do is we're
07:54 - going to use the operator join condition
07:56 - here
07:57 - so use this join
08:00 - and what we're going to put is we're
08:01 - going to put r
08:02 - and then we're going to put the
08:04 - custom run custom index so it'll be like
08:08 - r0 or 1 or 2 which match the custom
08:11 - names of you look over here
08:14 - it has r 0 or 1 or 2 right so right
08:18 - there so we're going to try and match
08:20 - this name to get the get the custom for
08:23 - that
08:24 - and then are going to say change
08:28 - the running costume index by one okay
08:32 - so similarly we're going to do the same
08:34 - thing for the left key
08:36 - let me zoom back a little bit
08:39 - so we're going to say left
08:40 - arrow key
08:42 - so here we're going to do a negative 90
08:45 - okay
08:46 - and then we're going to put this under
08:47 - here
08:49 - so we have that
08:50 - up key right here left key
08:52 - and then we're going to need the
08:55 - down key so this is for the sliding
08:58 - so let's say
09:01 - it is
09:02 - the down arrow key
09:05 - now
09:06 - the slider only had one costume because
09:08 - all the costume was the slide for the
09:10 - ninja actually the same
09:12 - so i gotta call it i took the slide
09:14 - number five from there
09:17 - okay all right
09:19 - and then if i have the
09:24 - if i have the up arrow key
09:26 - so for the up arrow key
09:29 - stop this one
09:30 - i am going to broadcast a message called
09:33 - jump
09:37 - okay
09:38 - a message called jump
09:42 - all right
09:42 - all right
09:43 - so that will broadcast the message for
09:46 - the ninja to jump
09:48 - and then we'll continue here we'll
09:50 - finish this part and then we'll work on
09:52 - the other part so we're gonna continue
09:54 - i'm gonna say
09:56 - let's use number one so we're gonna use
09:58 - one two three for the different attack
10:00 - so the first one
10:02 - we are going to call it attack
10:04 - so this is for the sword and then just
10:06 - use we're going to duplicate this
10:09 - oh by the way we're going to use a
10:10 - broadcast and wait here actually because
10:12 - we don't want to perform two action at
10:14 - the same time we want to finish one
10:16 - action so we're going to use broadcast
10:18 - and weight and we're going to select
10:20 - attack sorry about that so because i
10:22 - duplicate on top so i got that so anyway
10:25 - so attack number two
10:28 - so the number two is throw
10:32 - so let's put a new message through
10:36 - and then number three
10:39 - is
10:41 - oops
10:43 - number three is glide
10:45 - so the new message called glide
10:48 - so for the glide we're going to do a
10:50 - little bit different we're going to put
10:52 - in a weight until not so what happened
10:54 - is you don't want to play the whole the
10:56 - holder number three and the player the
10:59 - ninja will just go all the way up to the
11:01 - top
11:02 - right while coming down so we don't want
11:04 - to do that so what we're going to do is
11:05 - we're going to use the weight until put
11:08 - that in front of it
11:09 - and then we're going to put a
11:12 - knot here
11:14 - and then we'll copy this duplicate that
11:16 - put that in here so not number three so
11:19 - if you're pressing number three and wait
11:21 - until not number three then it'll
11:22 - broadcast the guide
11:24 - okay so we're gonna put all of them
11:25 - together one two three put that under
11:28 - here
11:29 - okay so let's take a look at the code
11:32 - again
11:32 - so from the top you have to start the
11:35 - game
11:36 - and then you have the costume changing
11:38 - right and then you have the left then
11:40 - you're the right either down get the
11:43 - jump
11:43 - the up uh one two three which is the
11:46 - different attacks and stuff like that
11:48 - okay so next let's
11:50 - go back up
11:52 - okay so this time we are going to use
11:55 - the broadcast we're going to use start
11:57 - game again
11:59 - so this one we're going to throw in
12:00 - another forever loop here
12:03 - so what we want to do is we don't want
12:04 - to block anything so that's why we're
12:06 - going to use now forever with the
12:08 - broadcast okay
12:11 - okay for here we're gonna say
12:14 - um
12:15 - i'm gonna put in the if condition here
12:18 - and then we're gonna go to sensing
12:23 - it is um
12:24 - up arrow key
12:28 - okay
12:28 - so the up arrow key and then i'm gonna
12:30 - say wait
12:34 - until
12:37 - uh not
12:41 - up arrow key
12:43 - and then we're gonna switch we're gonna
12:45 - play the sound
12:47 - play the sound jump i think i have the
12:48 - sound jump here
12:50 - jump
12:53 - so like that that's a sound for it so
12:56 - you can
12:57 - just say play
12:59 - sound
13:02 - until done
13:06 - okay so it will play complete the sound
13:08 - jump before it plays the second sound so
13:11 - which really doesn't matter because what
13:13 - happened is we have the jump also here
13:16 - right that broadcast jump so this is
13:18 - only for the sound so
13:20 - okay
13:22 - all right
13:23 - so next
13:25 - uh what we're going to do is
13:28 - okay so we're going to finish the jump
13:30 - part so we broadcast jump right earlier
13:33 - so we're going to say when i receive
13:35 - jump
13:37 - here what we're going to do is we're
13:38 - going to set the jump index
13:43 - to zero
13:44 - and then we're going to switch the
13:46 - costume
13:49 - to the first uh jumping costume
13:53 - so so scroll down select j0
13:56 - and then what we're going to do is we're
13:58 - going to repeat 9 times
14:02 - and then we're going to say switch
14:06 - so we can take it over here
14:08 - we're going to say switch
14:11 - costume inside
14:12 - r we're going to say j
14:14 - and then we gotta make sure we change
14:16 - that to the jumping index
14:19 - also here let's change the jumping index
14:22 - and put that inside
14:24 - okay all right so you have to jump
14:27 - okay you have to run and let's see how
14:31 - it goes first so let's let's save this
14:33 - let's start
14:35 - so you can see the ninja is moving left
14:37 - and right right that looks like correct
14:39 - is jump and then making the sound jump
14:44 - okay
14:47 - all right so that seems to be working so
14:50 - now what we can do is we can hide this
14:51 - uh this guy now so we can say stop this
14:55 - and say set ghost effect to 100 this is
14:58 - back on the main uh main character well
15:01 - you have to start game here so save it
15:03 - let's run it again now you don't have
15:06 - the black box okay the hitbox behind it
15:09 - in general
15:10 - okay so ninja is okay to
15:12 - uh run and jump so next we can work on
15:15 - his uh different attacks for the ninja
15:19 - okay
15:20 - so uh let's go with the
15:23 - attack so
15:24 - so same thing so when we broadcast the
15:27 - attack
15:29 - when i receive a tag
15:31 - okay
15:33 - so similarly that we did jump right
15:36 - same thing what we can do is
15:39 - do a copy here
15:41 - and put this in so for the attack uh
15:43 - what we're going to use we're going to
15:44 - use the custom index so we don't really
15:47 - need to uh we can reuse this because we
15:50 - won't be doing multiple things at the
15:51 - same time
15:52 - so here we're going to use the attack
15:54 - which is a i think it's all the way in
15:56 - the bottom select a0 okay
16:00 - and then we'll do 9 times and then we're
16:02 - going to put letter a capital a and then
16:04 - we change to
16:06 - the um
16:08 - the custom index and then change this
16:10 - right click and then change the custom
16:12 - in there so you can just throw it away
16:14 - and then
16:15 - grab a new one from here as well you
16:17 - know you can do that
16:19 - okay
16:20 - or you can just right click and select
16:21 - something else okay so the attack we
16:24 - have a zero will start at zero and then
16:26 - we'll switch nine costume every time
16:28 - we'll increase the costume that's the
16:31 - attack
16:32 - now
16:33 - we have a throw so the throw is a little
16:35 - bit almost same as attack so we can just
16:38 - duplicate this
16:39 - put in the bottom
16:41 - select throw here
16:43 - so for throw what we're going to do is
16:45 - we're going to use the custom index so
16:48 - we won't be doing attack and throw at
16:49 - the same time but what we have to do is
16:52 - something extra here is that we're gonna
16:54 - broadcast
16:57 - a message called
16:59 - a new message called throw
17:03 - and then say couldn't i
17:05 - okay
17:06 - so that way we're gonna broadcast that
17:08 - we'll send the message to the kunai and
17:09 - then make that flight
17:11 - okay so we're gonna use that and then
17:13 - we're gonna select t as in throw tv
17:17 - one t zero the t zero is through okay
17:20 - we're gonna change that to t
17:22 - okay custom index that is also fine
17:25 - so next one we have glide
17:28 - so let's duplicate the one with attack
17:33 - and select glide
17:36 - so for glide we're gonna do the same
17:38 - thing we're gonna select the glide
17:40 - costume
17:42 - apply
17:44 - okay
17:45 - and then we're gonna select put g here
17:48 - okay so for the gly we're gonna have to
17:50 - do something else we're gonna say
17:52 - set
17:54 - the
17:55 - g graph velocity to 15 so that means he
18:00 - can jump a little they're moving the
18:02 - character jump a little and then moving
18:04 - the costume
18:05 - okay
18:07 - all right so let's try it out
18:10 - so we have this and push one
18:12 - yeah you see that how you attack with
18:14 - the sword
18:15 - uh this is a throwing action we don't
18:18 - have to knife flying out yet
18:20 - and number three you can kind of flow in
18:22 - the air right
18:25 - okay so that is all working fine
18:28 - so next we need to make the kunai fly
18:30 - right so we broadcast a message throw
18:33 - tonight so what we have to do with the
18:35 - go to the night okay so let's go there
18:40 - and now we're going to say when green
18:42 - black is clicked
18:44 - go to the kunai i think i set the size
18:46 - to 25
18:48 - so if it's not there you can do it over
18:51 - here as well or you can do it with the
18:52 - code okay
18:55 - and then after that i'm gonna say hi
18:58 - also we can take out these uh variable
19:00 - if you like uh from the ninja so you can
19:03 - go back to ninja go to variable
19:05 - and you can unhide them okay hide this
19:08 - guy we don't need it
19:10 - okay so let's go back to goodnight okay
19:13 - all right so uh when we
19:16 - when we when we receive
19:19 - draw
19:22 - goodnight
19:23 - what we're going to do is we're going to
19:24 - say clone
19:26 - so let's say clone
19:29 - voice clone
19:34 - now it will find clone
19:36 - okay i thought it was in control
19:39 - okay
19:41 - there you go
19:42 - okay
19:44 - all right so when i start as a clone
19:47 - so here we're gonna i think we're gonna
19:49 - finish the video soon i'll say go to
19:51 - ninja
19:53 - okay
19:54 - and then we're gonna get the uh
19:57 - position so we can say point in
20:00 - direction
20:02 - and then we're gonna go sensing block
20:04 - get this tricky block select ninja in
20:07 - the back
20:08 - and then select direction so whatever
20:10 - the ninja is facing that is facing to
20:12 - the right
20:13 - the the the
20:15 - eyes also facing to the right if it's
20:17 - left or face to the left
20:18 - and then we're going to say move
20:23 - uh 25 steps
20:25 - and then we're going to say go to front
20:27 - layer
20:30 - and then we're going to show
20:33 - after that we're gonna repeat until
20:38 - so say repeat until
20:44 - okay
20:45 - so repeat until we're gonna say uh so
20:48 - what right now we're gonna put only two
20:50 - or
20:51 - uh to our joint later we're gonna add
20:53 - more
20:54 - so we're gonna say repeat until
20:56 - uh touching
20:59 - edge
21:01 - or
21:02 - touching
21:04 - and say touching ground
21:07 - right because if let's say we touch the
21:10 - ground
21:12 - of the sprite uh the virtual ground
21:14 - let's do the virtual brand then virtual
21:16 - rounds better because that is
21:17 - you can
21:19 - you can go past these things but not go
21:21 - past the virtual world so let's select
21:23 - virtual ground and edge for now later we
21:25 - can add the medusa and the crate and
21:27 - stuff like that
21:29 - okay so this move 25 step just move a
21:31 - little bit in the front of the ninja
21:33 - okay
21:34 - and then we are going to say move uh 15
21:38 - steps here so this is this is going to
21:40 - travel 15 step every
21:42 - every time the loop goes through so you
21:44 - want to go faster you can make it 20 or
21:46 - something
21:47 - okay
21:48 - and then we're going to
21:50 - make a little bit of weight so this
21:51 - looks really cool so you add a little
21:53 - weight so it can get stuck on something
21:57 - and then it disappeared so that's why it
21:59 - looks a little bit better without wait
22:02 - and then we can say delete the clone
22:05 - okay so i think we're done with the
22:06 - kunai so let's just try it out
22:09 - so let's see we're number two so you can
22:12 - see it can't wait you see that how it it
22:14 - goes to the edge over here and then it
22:17 - kind of stops for like a point zero one
22:19 - second and then it goes away so
22:22 - it looks a little bit better looks like
22:23 - you're getting stuck on something so you
22:26 - can stuck on the crate
22:27 - as well right so if you add crepes here
22:30 - you can add another oil condition here
22:33 - so let's say you have the crate
22:35 - you can add the oil condition
22:38 - so touching
22:39 - virtual ground or
22:41 - oops sorry
22:42 - or touching cream
22:46 - so now the clay if i shoot this thing it
22:49 - will stop the uh
22:50 - it will stop the
22:53 - the kunai as well so you can see see
22:56 - let's put my crate over here a little
22:58 - bit
22:59 - so you can see
23:00 - it got stuck to it right
23:02 - okay
23:03 - all right
23:05 - so
23:06 - that is pretty much for the code so
23:09 - let's just take a minute if you guys
23:11 - missed anything you can go
23:13 - and take a look at the code make sure
23:14 - you got everything down
23:16 - so we have the uh the code here for the
23:19 - uh kanai
23:21 - and then we have the code for the ninja
23:23 - let's go back
23:24 - up over here stop this
23:26 - so on the top
23:30 - we have the code for the ninja in the
23:31 - beginning what we're doing some setup if
23:33 - it's not moving we'll make it idle and
23:36 - then we have the running so this part is
23:38 - for running so you have the running
23:40 - costume and then this is the main part
23:42 - where it broadcasts everything like
23:44 - jumping
23:45 - the attacks
23:46 - the throw and then the glide
23:49 - then here this is the jumping
23:52 - then we have the uh the sound looking
23:55 - jumping sound
23:56 - the attack
23:58 - the throw
23:59 - and the glide
24:02 - okay i think that is everything
24:05 - okay for today so now you should walk so
24:08 - your ninja at least can move around
24:10 - jump
24:12 - attack
24:13 - so you can jump up and also attack
24:16 - so
24:17 - you can attack with a knife as well
24:20 - so next time we'll walk on the ground we
24:22 - can go to the next car next stage and
24:24 - then the crate and then the medusa and
24:26 - all that all right okay that is it for
24:29 - this video thanks for watching and be
24:31 - sure to give us a thumbs up
24:33 - and like the video alright
24:36 - [Music]
24:42 - [Music]
24:46 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome back to the channel so today we'll continue our ninja platformer uh tutorial so yesterday we worked on the uh hitbox the main character the hitbox so today we'll work on the ninja itself so we're gonna make this ninja follow the hitbox and then we'll be able to move according to it you can either use the ninja here or you can use the ninja girl both for the same i kept i created all the uh costume for it so if you look in the costume you have all the costume for the ninja as well as the same amount number of customers ninja boy so over equally the same so you can choose either one of them to use for your game okay all right so i'm gonna hide the ninja girl for now so i think in the tutorial i have the ninja oy so but uh you can use either one okay so let's begin so where we left off last time was uh to create the uh the main character to move so you we play our game right now we can still move right jump and then move left and move right so that is pretty much uh good with the main character that's the hardest one so now let's make the ninja move itself so the name just gonna follow the uh the hitbox okay so in the ninja uh let's go so go to uh when green flag is click sorry i was a ninja girl and go back to the ninja boy i have here so when green black is clicked let me zoom in so um we're gonna set the uh so i think we have the depth variable that we had earlier so we can set that to uh zero then set the size to 35 percent i think that's what i had in the game earlier and then we can set the rotation style left to right or you can do it over here as well selecting this button in the middle okay and then i'm going to say go to the front layer and then show okay so this is for the ninja setup in the beginning so once i make the ninja follow the hit box i'm gonna make the hit box to ghost effect 100 so we will not be able to see it okay all right so um well we broadcast a couple message right in the uh in the game from the main sprite which is the hitbox so we have one is um stock game right so let's select that and then let's throw in a forever loop here here i will make it go to and then select the uh main character okay all right so next we have the if okay so we're going to use the operator n okay here we're going to use the knot and then we're going to get the sensing uh key press we're going to select any so there's no not any key press and we're going to have an equal sign here and then we're going to use the variable uh on the ground so basically if the there's no key press and the player is on the ground then we're going to set it to the standing costume so gonna change the costume to i five which is idle number five and then they have a lot of different custom for the idle sprite so i only took one of them when i created this that's right okay uh next we're gonna create some variable for this uh uh player i mean this is this sprite so let's make some variable so select for this sprite only we're gonna say run uh costume index okay so this will help us to switch the costume for the ninja when they run around okay next we are going to create called jump costume index okay for the sprite only okay so next comment another variable for the sprite only so what we have here is a costume index so this is uh what i'm going to reuse this one so this for the action like throwing a knife um you know using a sword or lighting so we're gonna reuse this so because basically we will not be uh doing those things at the same time anyway so we don't need to create different um different indexes we can just reuse the custom index but for the run and jump they could have in the same time so that's why we give it a different different variable okay all right so with the start games on next we're gonna have another one so we're gonna do the start game as well so when i receive start game i'm gonna go set set the running custom index to one i think i have zero i think let me just check yeah i think one begins with zero you see die zero zero 0 1 yes or 0 so let's start with 0 okay and then we are going to use the forever loop okay and we're going to have the if condition here and what we're going to do is going to check if it's actually over nine because uh the index is from zero to nine i'll show you in a bit so let's go back to the custom so we go up go look at the run so you can see the run start is zero see run zero you see run zero all the way to run number nine easy and then after that is jump so only from zero to nine so we're going to say when the custom run custom index is greater than 9 we're going to set it back to zero okay set the run custom index make sure you have all the same variable here if you miss having different index your ninja will look funny when it runs okay so next we will go down we're gonna add if condition here so here what we're going to do is going to check the key so i'm going to say if a right arrow key is pressed so for this one we are going to point the ninja to 90 which is uh onto the right side and then we are going to switch costume now what we're going to do is we're going to use the operator join condition here so use this join and what we're going to put is we're going to put r and then we're going to put the custom run custom index so it'll be like r0 or 1 or 2 which match the custom names of you look over here it has r 0 or 1 or 2 right so right there so we're going to try and match this name to get the get the custom for that and then are going to say change the running costume index by one okay so similarly we're going to do the same thing for the left key let me zoom back a little bit so we're going to say left arrow key so here we're going to do a negative 90 okay and then we're going to put this under here so we have that up key right here left key and then we're going to need the down key so this is for the sliding so let's say it is the down arrow key now the slider only had one costume because all the costume was the slide for the ninja actually the same so i gotta call it i took the slide number five from there okay all right and then if i have the if i have the up arrow key so for the up arrow key stop this one i am going to broadcast a message called jump okay a message called jump all right all right so that will broadcast the message for the ninja to jump and then we'll continue here we'll finish this part and then we'll work on the other part so we're gonna continue i'm gonna say let's use number one so we're gonna use one two three for the different attack so the first one we are going to call it attack so this is for the sword and then just use we're going to duplicate this oh by the way we're going to use a broadcast and wait here actually because we don't want to perform two action at the same time we want to finish one action so we're going to use broadcast and weight and we're going to select attack sorry about that so because i duplicate on top so i got that so anyway so attack number two so the number two is throw so let's put a new message through and then number three is oops number three is glide so the new message called glide so for the glide we're going to do a little bit different we're going to put in a weight until not so what happened is you don't want to play the whole the holder number three and the player the ninja will just go all the way up to the top right while coming down so we don't want to do that so what we're going to do is we're going to use the weight until put that in front of it and then we're going to put a knot here and then we'll copy this duplicate that put that in here so not number three so if you're pressing number three and wait until not number three then it'll broadcast the guide okay so we're gonna put all of them together one two three put that under here okay so let's take a look at the code again so from the top you have to start the game and then you have the costume changing right and then you have the left then you're the right either down get the jump the up uh one two three which is the different attacks and stuff like that okay so next let's go back up okay so this time we are going to use the broadcast we're going to use start game again so this one we're going to throw in another forever loop here so what we want to do is we don't want to block anything so that's why we're going to use now forever with the broadcast okay okay for here we're gonna say um i'm gonna put in the if condition here and then we're gonna go to sensing it is um up arrow key okay so the up arrow key and then i'm gonna say wait until uh not up arrow key and then we're gonna switch we're gonna play the sound play the sound jump i think i have the sound jump here jump so like that that's a sound for it so you can just say play sound until done okay so it will play complete the sound jump before it plays the second sound so which really doesn't matter because what happened is we have the jump also here right that broadcast jump so this is only for the sound so okay all right so next uh what we're going to do is okay so we're going to finish the jump part so we broadcast jump right earlier so we're going to say when i receive jump here what we're going to do is we're going to set the jump index to zero and then we're going to switch the costume to the first uh jumping costume so so scroll down select j0 and then what we're going to do is we're going to repeat 9 times and then we're going to say switch so we can take it over here we're going to say switch costume inside r we're going to say j and then we gotta make sure we change that to the jumping index also here let's change the jumping index and put that inside okay all right so you have to jump okay you have to run and let's see how it goes first so let's let's save this let's start so you can see the ninja is moving left and right right that looks like correct is jump and then making the sound jump okay all right so that seems to be working so now what we can do is we can hide this uh this guy now so we can say stop this and say set ghost effect to 100 this is back on the main uh main character well you have to start game here so save it let's run it again now you don't have the black box okay the hitbox behind it in general okay so ninja is okay to uh run and jump so next we can work on his uh different attacks for the ninja okay so uh let's go with the attack so so same thing so when we broadcast the attack when i receive a tag okay so similarly that we did jump right same thing what we can do is do a copy here and put this in so for the attack uh what we're going to use we're going to use the custom index so we don't really need to uh we can reuse this because we won't be doing multiple things at the same time so here we're going to use the attack which is a i think it's all the way in the bottom select a0 okay and then we'll do 9 times and then we're going to put letter a capital a and then we change to the um the custom index and then change this right click and then change the custom in there so you can just throw it away and then grab a new one from here as well you know you can do that okay or you can just right click and select something else okay so the attack we have a zero will start at zero and then we'll switch nine costume every time we'll increase the costume that's the attack now we have a throw so the throw is a little bit almost same as attack so we can just duplicate this put in the bottom select throw here so for throw what we're going to do is we're going to use the custom index so we won't be doing attack and throw at the same time but what we have to do is something extra here is that we're gonna broadcast a message called a new message called throw and then say couldn't i okay so that way we're gonna broadcast that we'll send the message to the kunai and then make that flight okay so we're gonna use that and then we're gonna select t as in throw tv one t zero the t zero is through okay we're gonna change that to t okay custom index that is also fine so next one we have glide so let's duplicate the one with attack and select glide so for glide we're gonna do the same thing we're gonna select the glide costume apply okay and then we're gonna select put g here okay so for the gly we're gonna have to do something else we're gonna say set the g graph velocity to 15 so that means he can jump a little they're moving the character jump a little and then moving the costume okay all right so let's try it out so we have this and push one yeah you see that how you attack with the sword uh this is a throwing action we don't have to knife flying out yet and number three you can kind of flow in the air right okay so that is all working fine so next we need to make the kunai fly right so we broadcast a message throw tonight so what we have to do with the go to the night okay so let's go there and now we're going to say when green black is clicked go to the kunai i think i set the size to 25 so if it's not there you can do it over here as well or you can do it with the code okay and then after that i'm gonna say hi also we can take out these uh variable if you like uh from the ninja so you can go back to ninja go to variable and you can unhide them okay hide this guy we don't need it okay so let's go back to goodnight okay all right so uh when we when we when we receive draw goodnight what we're going to do is we're going to say clone so let's say clone voice clone now it will find clone okay i thought it was in control okay there you go okay all right so when i start as a clone so here we're gonna i think we're gonna finish the video soon i'll say go to ninja okay and then we're gonna get the uh position so we can say point in direction and then we're gonna go sensing block get this tricky block select ninja in the back and then select direction so whatever the ninja is facing that is facing to the right the the the eyes also facing to the right if it's left or face to the left and then we're going to say move uh 25 steps and then we're going to say go to front layer and then we're going to show after that we're gonna repeat until so say repeat until okay so repeat until we're gonna say uh so what right now we're gonna put only two or uh to our joint later we're gonna add more so we're gonna say repeat until uh touching edge or touching and say touching ground right because if let's say we touch the ground of the sprite uh the virtual ground let's do the virtual brand then virtual rounds better because that is you can you can go past these things but not go past the virtual world so let's select virtual ground and edge for now later we can add the medusa and the crate and stuff like that okay so this move 25 step just move a little bit in the front of the ninja okay and then we are going to say move uh 15 steps here so this is this is going to travel 15 step every every time the loop goes through so you want to go faster you can make it 20 or something okay and then we're going to make a little bit of weight so this looks really cool so you add a little weight so it can get stuck on something and then it disappeared so that's why it looks a little bit better without wait and then we can say delete the clone okay so i think we're done with the kunai so let's just try it out so let's see we're number two so you can see it can't wait you see that how it it goes to the edge over here and then it kind of stops for like a point zero one second and then it goes away so it looks a little bit better looks like you're getting stuck on something so you can stuck on the crate as well right so if you add crepes here you can add another oil condition here so let's say you have the crate you can add the oil condition so touching virtual ground or oops sorry or touching cream so now the clay if i shoot this thing it will stop the uh it will stop the the kunai as well so you can see see let's put my crate over here a little bit so you can see it got stuck to it right okay all right so that is pretty much for the code so let's just take a minute if you guys missed anything you can go and take a look at the code make sure you got everything down so we have the uh the code here for the uh kanai and then we have the code for the ninja let's go back up over here stop this so on the top we have the code for the ninja in the beginning what we're doing some setup if it's not moving we'll make it idle and then we have the running so this part is for running so you have the running costume and then this is the main part where it broadcasts everything like jumping the attacks the throw and then the glide then here this is the jumping then we have the uh the sound looking jumping sound the attack the throw and the glide okay i think that is everything okay for today so now you should walk so your ninja at least can move around jump attack so you can jump up and also attack so you can attack with a knife as well so next time we'll walk on the ground we can go to the next car next stage and then the crate and then the medusa and all that all right okay that is it for this video thanks for watching and be sure to give us a thumbs up and like the video alright you
