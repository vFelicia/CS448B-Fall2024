00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:09 - kids coding playground today we'll be
00:11 - doing the sixth part for the
00:13 - two player fighting game so today we'll
00:15 - be working on the
00:16 - throwing for the throwing projectiles
00:19 - and shooting projectiles
00:20 - we'll add a new backdrop maybe if we
00:23 - have time
00:24 - and if the player either player's dead
00:27 - we can do something about that
00:29 - so let's start out with dragging through
00:33 - the code
00:34 - so you guys can copy anything down you
00:36 - guys
00:37 - didn't copy before so if you guys missed
00:40 - anything you can just
00:42 - pause the video and copy it down i'll
00:45 - just drag through
00:52 - so this is the player one
00:58 - 2 is pretty much the same thing i'll
01:00 - still drag through it
01:17 - so this is player two then you got the
01:20 - magic gem
01:21 - same as always the begin button
01:26 - character 1 character 1 button character
01:29 - 2 button
01:31 - character 3 button character 4 button
01:35 - the p1 health box the player 1 health
01:38 - box
01:39 - the player 1 hp the
01:42 - player 2 health box player 2 hp
01:46 - and we will work on the bullet and the
01:48 - kunai today
01:51 - so today we'll be working on the
01:53 - throwing so let's start off with the
01:55 - kuna
01:56 - so when flat clips let me zoom in
02:00 - i'm going to go to the front layer go to
02:03 - front layer
02:05 - set size to 30 percent
02:09 - and high in the beginning
02:13 - and when i receive start game
02:17 - when i receive start game we can get an
02:20 - if else statement so if
02:22 - the player one character is equal to the
02:24 - ninja girl
02:27 - so player one character is equal to mg
02:31 - then we can switch the costume to kunai
02:37 - else we can switch the costume to the
02:40 - fire
02:40 - attack so what this means if the player
02:43 - selected is the ninja girl
02:44 - then we will switch the costume to the
02:47 - knife also switch to the fire
02:51 - so next we won't want to go get another
02:55 - uh message so when i receive p1 attack 2
02:59 - then we can create a clone of myself
03:03 - when i start as a clone
03:07 - um go to player one always go to the
03:10 - player one player one
03:14 - point in direction point in direction
03:19 - um and then you get the this block
03:22 - and to select the player you have to
03:24 - select this one first
03:26 - player one and direction
03:29 - you have to always select the last one
03:31 - first then you can select this one
03:33 - or it won't work so we can do move 10
03:35 - steps
03:37 - to make it go out a little bit show
03:42 - get a repeat until repeat until
03:48 - touching you need two or
03:51 - fours so either touching the edge
03:57 - so it oops that back in
04:01 - so repeat until touching edge
04:07 - edge or touching
04:10 - player 2 or touching
04:13 - the bullet
04:16 - so if it's touching either one of these
04:21 - then we can move 10 steps and delete the
04:26 - clone
04:28 - this clone the bullet is pretty much the
04:31 - same thing
04:32 - you can just drag and drop the code into
04:34 - the bullet
04:37 - [Music]
04:39 - except we'll have to change some code
04:45 - and drag this
04:49 - in
04:52 - okay so now we have all the code dragged
04:54 - in
04:56 - we have to change some broadcasting and
04:58 - size
04:59 - so for this one for the bullet we want
05:01 - to make it size 15
05:04 - instead of size 30 and when i receive
05:08 - p2 attack two so player two attack two
05:12 - then we can
05:13 - create a clone of ourself then and then
05:16 - we can also
05:18 - get instead of player one we do player
05:20 - two
05:21 - instead of player one right here we do
05:22 - player 2 and direction
05:27 - move 10 steps show all the same repeat
05:30 - edge
05:31 - and instead of player 2 is player 1 and
05:33 - this should be
05:34 - kunai because
05:38 - it's this is the bullet and instead of
05:41 - um
05:41 - ng if player character one is equal to
05:44 - aj the adventure girl
05:46 - then we switch the costume to the bullet
05:50 - else so switch the magic which is for
05:52 - the genie
05:54 - so these two bullet and magic we don't
05:55 - actually need this so i can just delete
05:57 - it
05:59 - so yeah that's all the code for the
06:03 - uh projectiles so now we can work on if
06:07 - the player 1 or player 2 is dead so
06:10 - let's do it right here so when i receive
06:16 - p1 is dead
06:19 - p one dead player one dead then we can
06:22 - set the
06:23 - is p one dead to y which is yes
06:27 - set p one
06:31 - uh is player one dead
06:34 - to why as in yes
06:38 - stop other scripts in the sprite because
06:40 - it is dead
06:43 - get the stop all click the triangle stop
06:46 - other scripts in sprite
06:48 - clear graphic effects so it won't change
06:50 - color anymore once it is dead
06:53 - set the player attack costume to zero so
06:56 - it will go back to the first attack
06:57 - costume
06:59 - set player attack costume
07:02 - back to zero get a repeat loop
07:07 - we're doing repeat ten times because
07:09 - this is um
07:11 - has ten costumes
07:14 - so for the dead we have ten costumes on
07:17 - i believes
07:18 - uh one two three four five
07:21 - six seven eight nine
07:24 - ten so we do have ten and then we have
07:26 - the tombstone
07:28 - so we repeat 10 times which costume
07:32 - switch costume you need the two joins
07:37 - join and join switch costume to join
07:41 - player one character
07:44 - so this can be ng so
07:48 - join ninja girl dead underscore
07:54 - if your co if your costume is not dead
07:57 - underscore
07:58 - like ours then you have to um
08:01 - do it to the corresponding name
08:05 - so ours is dead underscore and then we
08:07 - get the player attack costume
08:11 - so when you click on this i'm going to
08:12 - try this out to demonstrate it'll say ng
08:15 - dead 10
08:17 - so i'll change the 10th attack that's in
08:20 - the costume
08:22 - so wait 0.1 seconds just to give it some
08:25 - pause
08:26 - so they'll lay down for a little bit and
08:29 - we can change the player attack costume
08:31 - by one
08:35 - change the player attack costume
08:38 - by wait one second give a little pause
08:42 - look like it's dead hide
08:48 - um hide switch costume to tombstone
08:57 - tombstone
09:01 - we find it tombstone right here
09:05 - and then we can get a show
09:08 - so yeah that's the code for the dead
09:12 - so all you have to do is just drag and
09:14 - drop it to player two
09:18 - get the player two let me drag this to
09:21 - the blank area so you guys can see it
09:24 - okay let me zoom in so
09:28 - instead of player one dead it should be
09:30 - p2 dead
09:32 - and then instead is player one dead it
09:34 - should be is player 2 dead
09:38 - and then this is all the same player
09:40 - attack costume
09:41 - instead of player 1 we do player 2
09:44 - character
09:47 - and this should all be the same player
09:49 - attack costume
09:51 - all right so now we have all the uh dead
09:54 - thing
09:55 - now we can actually add backdrops we can
09:58 - add like a
09:58 - backdrop selection screen
10:02 - so we get backdrops i have
10:06 - um a backdrop of my
10:09 - library um backpack i can just drag it
10:12 - in here so what i did in here
10:14 - was actually get uh three of them
10:17 - three of the same thing
10:20 - three of the same backdrop and then i
10:22 - duplicated them i
10:24 - resized it because this is this
10:25 - backdrop's actually a bit smaller than
10:27 - this one
10:28 - so what i did was get three of these
10:31 - and then i resized it
10:35 - for each one and then made two of them
10:38 - go to the back layer so you only see one
10:41 - one of the costumes but um you can still
10:43 - see the bottom so i'll show you how i
10:46 - did it
10:47 - i'm gonna paint a new so
10:50 - i just copy paste it
10:53 - copy paste the second one
10:58 - and it's like it's like you have to size
11:00 - it and then i make this one go to the
11:02 - back layer
11:04 - and then finally get the third one
11:07 - copy paste it and see how it's two moons
11:11 - you'll only want one
11:12 - make it go to the back so boom now it
11:14 - looks perfect
11:16 - so that's how you do it if you don't
11:20 - know how to do it then
11:22 - just do what we did
11:25 - and now i'm gonna work on the um
11:29 - the background select
11:32 - so i'm just gonna drag these in here
11:38 - so this one is so i actually
11:42 - exported the wrong wrong um
11:46 - button so i have to
11:49 - import it back
11:53 - um downloads
12:04 - so i have it right here so i'm just
12:06 - going to delete all this code
12:09 - real quick so
12:12 - now i have the desert i can rename this
12:14 - to
12:15 - maybe oh what is it called graveyard
12:20 - as you can see i named it skull creek to
12:21 - make it a little more creative
12:24 - so name it graveyard bg i guess
12:31 - graveyard bg so let's work on this
12:34 - button first
12:37 - so okay let's go
12:40 - to the code so for the desert background
12:44 - button we're going to get a one flag
12:46 - clicked
12:47 - go to this x and y position negative 135
12:50 - y negative 75
12:53 - go to front layer
12:57 - switch costume to
13:00 - costume one costume one which is the
13:02 - regular one
13:04 - and there's also the wild west so
13:06 - costume one
13:07 - and show in the beginning
13:10 - when the sprite is clicked
13:15 - when the sprite is clicked switch
13:17 - costume to costume 2
13:23 - switch costume to costume 2
13:26 - and broadcast a message called
13:30 - desert bg set
13:39 - set desert background set and then
13:43 - when i receive start game
13:48 - then we can hide in the beginning once
13:50 - the game starts
13:52 - and for the um graveyard
13:55 - we can just drag and drop this code
13:59 - into the graveyard apparently it's not
14:02 - letting me so i'm just gonna
14:05 - do it again one flat clicked
14:08 - instead we'll go to this 140 negative 75
14:11 - x and y position go to the front layer
14:17 - switch costs into costume 1 in the
14:18 - beginning
14:20 - show when the sprite is clicked
14:26 - we can broadcast we can switch costume
14:29 - to costume
14:30 - too just a selected one and broadcast a
14:33 - message
14:34 - called graveyard bg set
14:40 - grade yard bg set
14:48 - now when i receive desert bg set then we
14:51 - can switch costume costume one
14:53 - so it's not unselected
14:57 - and when i receive start game hide
15:05 - hide hide right here
15:08 - and when this one receives
15:12 - when i receive graveyard
15:17 - graveyard dg set then we can
15:21 - switch costume to costume one
15:25 - so this is it for this video
15:30 - oops the background is a bit
15:33 - shifted sorry about that let me
15:38 - shift it back to normal
15:42 - i don't know why it got resized but
15:47 - okay i resized it so i'm gonna play the
15:50 - game for you guys
15:52 - save the pro don't forget to save the
15:54 - project
15:58 - so you can either select this
16:02 - [Music]
16:05 - as you can see when i was doing it i
16:07 - forgot to add one last piece of code
16:09 - that's why
16:10 - it didn't switch the backdrop i forgot
16:12 - about that so
16:14 - let's add it real quick right now so
16:15 - when i receive desert beachy set
16:17 - then we switch the backdrop to backdrop
16:20 - one
16:22 - you can duplicate this and when i
16:24 - receive greater bg set
16:26 - switch the backdrop to backdrop two so
16:29 - now
16:30 - when you play it it should work
16:33 - as you can see when you click on it it
16:35 - changes to that backdrop
16:39 - and we also have to change the tile sets
16:42 - so when the tile sets
16:43 - receive the um when i receive
16:46 - the um desert bg set and switch
16:49 - costume to one
16:54 - switch costume to one and you can
16:57 - duplicate this
16:59 - so and when i receive graveyard bg set
17:02 - we can switch costume to two
17:05 - which is the graveyard tile set
17:08 - so let's play it it should work so when
17:12 - you switch it
17:13 - it works like that so i'm gonna play it
17:19 - as you can see they all fall down
17:21 - because we have not added the code
17:23 - which we'll add in the next video so
17:27 - for the i'll just try the graveyard i'll
17:29 - just do it in the graveyard
17:32 - let's play it it works fine see when you
17:34 - press nine
17:35 - [Music]
17:39 - and i forgot also this which is really
17:42 - bad
17:43 - so to change the player to character
17:47 - so now i hope this will work
17:52 - so now it's actually shooting out
17:54 - bullets and it's hitting it
17:56 - the dragon shoots outside
18:05 - let me kill the um adventure girl real
18:08 - quick
18:09 - so it dies and now i'll show you guys
18:15 - um these two
18:17 - [Music]
18:19 - let's shoot out the fireball just the
18:20 - mealy
18:22 - and then they're here for the eye
18:28 - so this is what we made so i'm just
18:31 - gonna
18:31 - kill the genie real quick and have a
18:34 - different death position
18:37 - well that's it for the video thank you

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today we'll be doing the sixth part for the two player fighting game so today we'll be working on the throwing for the throwing projectiles and shooting projectiles we'll add a new backdrop maybe if we have time and if the player either player's dead we can do something about that so let's start out with dragging through the code so you guys can copy anything down you guys didn't copy before so if you guys missed anything you can just pause the video and copy it down i'll just drag through so this is the player one 2 is pretty much the same thing i'll still drag through it so this is player two then you got the magic gem same as always the begin button character 1 character 1 button character 2 button character 3 button character 4 button the p1 health box the player 1 health box the player 1 hp the player 2 health box player 2 hp and we will work on the bullet and the kunai today so today we'll be working on the throwing so let's start off with the kuna so when flat clips let me zoom in i'm going to go to the front layer go to front layer set size to 30 percent and high in the beginning and when i receive start game when i receive start game we can get an if else statement so if the player one character is equal to the ninja girl so player one character is equal to mg then we can switch the costume to kunai else we can switch the costume to the fire attack so what this means if the player selected is the ninja girl then we will switch the costume to the knife also switch to the fire so next we won't want to go get another uh message so when i receive p1 attack 2 then we can create a clone of myself when i start as a clone um go to player one always go to the player one player one point in direction point in direction um and then you get the this block and to select the player you have to select this one first player one and direction you have to always select the last one first then you can select this one or it won't work so we can do move 10 steps to make it go out a little bit show get a repeat until repeat until touching you need two or fours so either touching the edge so it oops that back in so repeat until touching edge edge or touching player 2 or touching the bullet so if it's touching either one of these then we can move 10 steps and delete the clone this clone the bullet is pretty much the same thing you can just drag and drop the code into the bullet except we'll have to change some code and drag this in okay so now we have all the code dragged in we have to change some broadcasting and size so for this one for the bullet we want to make it size 15 instead of size 30 and when i receive p2 attack two so player two attack two then we can create a clone of ourself then and then we can also get instead of player one we do player two instead of player one right here we do player 2 and direction move 10 steps show all the same repeat edge and instead of player 2 is player 1 and this should be kunai because it's this is the bullet and instead of um ng if player character one is equal to aj the adventure girl then we switch the costume to the bullet else so switch the magic which is for the genie so these two bullet and magic we don't actually need this so i can just delete it so yeah that's all the code for the uh projectiles so now we can work on if the player 1 or player 2 is dead so let's do it right here so when i receive p1 is dead p one dead player one dead then we can set the is p one dead to y which is yes set p one uh is player one dead to why as in yes stop other scripts in the sprite because it is dead get the stop all click the triangle stop other scripts in sprite clear graphic effects so it won't change color anymore once it is dead set the player attack costume to zero so it will go back to the first attack costume set player attack costume back to zero get a repeat loop we're doing repeat ten times because this is um has ten costumes so for the dead we have ten costumes on i believes uh one two three four five six seven eight nine ten so we do have ten and then we have the tombstone so we repeat 10 times which costume switch costume you need the two joins join and join switch costume to join player one character so this can be ng so join ninja girl dead underscore if your co if your costume is not dead underscore like ours then you have to um do it to the corresponding name so ours is dead underscore and then we get the player attack costume so when you click on this i'm going to try this out to demonstrate it'll say ng dead 10 so i'll change the 10th attack that's in the costume so wait 0.1 seconds just to give it some pause so they'll lay down for a little bit and we can change the player attack costume by one change the player attack costume by wait one second give a little pause look like it's dead hide um hide switch costume to tombstone tombstone we find it tombstone right here and then we can get a show so yeah that's the code for the dead so all you have to do is just drag and drop it to player two get the player two let me drag this to the blank area so you guys can see it okay let me zoom in so instead of player one dead it should be p2 dead and then instead is player one dead it should be is player 2 dead and then this is all the same player attack costume instead of player 1 we do player 2 character and this should all be the same player attack costume all right so now we have all the uh dead thing now we can actually add backdrops we can add like a backdrop selection screen so we get backdrops i have um a backdrop of my library um backpack i can just drag it in here so what i did in here was actually get uh three of them three of the same thing three of the same backdrop and then i duplicated them i resized it because this is this backdrop's actually a bit smaller than this one so what i did was get three of these and then i resized it for each one and then made two of them go to the back layer so you only see one one of the costumes but um you can still see the bottom so i'll show you how i did it i'm gonna paint a new so i just copy paste it copy paste the second one and it's like it's like you have to size it and then i make this one go to the back layer and then finally get the third one copy paste it and see how it's two moons you'll only want one make it go to the back so boom now it looks perfect so that's how you do it if you don't know how to do it then just do what we did and now i'm gonna work on the um the background select so i'm just gonna drag these in here so this one is so i actually exported the wrong wrong um button so i have to import it back um downloads so i have it right here so i'm just going to delete all this code real quick so now i have the desert i can rename this to maybe oh what is it called graveyard as you can see i named it skull creek to make it a little more creative so name it graveyard bg i guess graveyard bg so let's work on this button first so okay let's go to the code so for the desert background button we're going to get a one flag clicked go to this x and y position negative 135 y negative 75 go to front layer switch costume to costume one costume one which is the regular one and there's also the wild west so costume one and show in the beginning when the sprite is clicked when the sprite is clicked switch costume to costume 2 switch costume to costume 2 and broadcast a message called desert bg set set desert background set and then when i receive start game then we can hide in the beginning once the game starts and for the um graveyard we can just drag and drop this code into the graveyard apparently it's not letting me so i'm just gonna do it again one flat clicked instead we'll go to this 140 negative 75 x and y position go to the front layer switch costs into costume 1 in the beginning show when the sprite is clicked we can broadcast we can switch costume to costume too just a selected one and broadcast a message called graveyard bg set grade yard bg set now when i receive desert bg set then we can switch costume costume one so it's not unselected and when i receive start game hide hide hide right here and when this one receives when i receive graveyard graveyard dg set then we can switch costume to costume one so this is it for this video oops the background is a bit shifted sorry about that let me shift it back to normal i don't know why it got resized but okay i resized it so i'm gonna play the game for you guys save the pro don't forget to save the project so you can either select this as you can see when i was doing it i forgot to add one last piece of code that's why it didn't switch the backdrop i forgot about that so let's add it real quick right now so when i receive desert beachy set then we switch the backdrop to backdrop one you can duplicate this and when i receive greater bg set switch the backdrop to backdrop two so now when you play it it should work as you can see when you click on it it changes to that backdrop and we also have to change the tile sets so when the tile sets receive the um when i receive the um desert bg set and switch costume to one switch costume to one and you can duplicate this so and when i receive graveyard bg set we can switch costume to two which is the graveyard tile set so let's play it it should work so when you switch it it works like that so i'm gonna play it as you can see they all fall down because we have not added the code which we'll add in the next video so for the i'll just try the graveyard i'll just do it in the graveyard let's play it it works fine see when you press nine and i forgot also this which is really bad so to change the player to character so now i hope this will work so now it's actually shooting out bullets and it's hitting it the dragon shoots outside let me kill the um adventure girl real quick so it dies and now i'll show you guys um these two let's shoot out the fireball just the mealy and then they're here for the eye so this is what we made so i'm just gonna kill the genie real quick and have a different death position well that's it for the video thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe and join us in the next two player fighting game episode tomorrow you
