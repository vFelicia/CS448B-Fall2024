00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to kids coding
00:10 - playground today we'll be continuing
00:11 - with part two
00:12 - of the 3d maze so here is what we have
00:16 - so far we have our distances list that
00:19 - we'll be using
00:20 - for our raycaster and we can navigate
00:24 - our player
00:25 - hold on let me show it
00:28 - we can navigate our player using the
00:31 - arrow keys
00:36 - and today we'll be working on our
00:38 - raycaster so
00:39 - it'll make it 3d
00:42 - okay let's get into it so uh
00:46 - right now go to the distance sprite
00:50 - and we're going to make a new block
00:53 - and name it draw
00:57 - and have the run without screen refresh
01:00 - uh on and then press ok
01:04 - okay so uh let's
01:08 - import the pen extension
01:12 - so now we have our pen blocks and let's
01:15 - have our
01:16 - uh distance dot go to
01:21 - x negative
01:28 - 237.5
01:30 - and 180 we're going to go
01:33 - right here because our pen size is going
01:36 - to be slightly
01:38 - larger so it'll cover up the whole
01:39 - screen
01:41 - uh so let's put this under the define
01:44 - draw
01:45 - and then go down to pen and then
01:48 - let's set the pen size to five
01:52 - okay and
01:56 - then we need to set our pen color to
01:58 - something so
01:59 - um we're going to use this brightness
02:03 - effect uh to uh simulate that
02:07 - the distance so it'll look like
02:11 - uh parts of the wall are further than
02:14 - others
02:15 - so um right now all that matters is the
02:18 - saturation
02:20 - and the color so i'll just make this a
02:22 - light bluish
02:23 - color like that
02:27 - and then let's erase everything
02:32 - and set the pen up
02:37 - okay now let's make a new variable
02:41 - and name it column
02:47 - and right here let's set the column to
02:50 - one
02:56 - okay now
03:00 - let's get a repeat blank
03:03 - so right here and then go down to your
03:07 - variables
03:07 - and get length of distances
03:11 - and put that in there all right
03:15 - so instead inside of our repeat loop
03:19 - let's get set pen brightness
03:23 - so go down to pen and
03:27 - set pen
03:30 - brightness um
03:35 - and then let's get a plus block
03:38 - and put five right here
03:42 - and then item
03:47 - and get this and put this in here item
03:50 - column of distances
03:55 - so this will have uh us draw
03:58 - the um distance
04:03 - so it looks like parts of the wall
04:06 - are further than others so now let's set
04:12 - y
04:14 - to
04:19 - negative 1200
04:23 - divided by item column of distances
04:34 - okay now let's put this below
04:37 - set pin brightness and then let's get a
04:40 - pen down block
04:42 - pen down
04:48 - and then um let's get set
04:51 - change this duplicate this to
04:55 - two hundred
05:00 - then we'll change the x by five since
05:02 - our pen size is five
05:05 - x by five
05:08 - okay so i zoomed in a little bit so you
05:11 - guys can see it
05:12 - better okay so now let's get a change
05:16 - x by five uh change the x
05:19 - by five
05:24 - oh and also put a pen up block between
05:27 - these
05:28 - so that it doesn't drag the pen over
05:32 - and then let's change the column by one
05:40 - and then now we can use our draw block
05:43 - and let's put it under cents
05:48 - and now we have a
05:51 - 3d maze so
05:54 - now you can see that um
05:57 - we can in fact move around this maze
06:01 - but it's not quite finished yet because
06:04 - um
06:05 - our map isn't hidden
06:08 - and we still kind of have our uh
06:11 - variables showing
06:13 - so i'll hide those and
06:16 - um i'd like to make a function
06:20 - where if you hold down space then you'll
06:23 - be able to see
06:24 - the player in the map so
06:29 - in the player sprite
06:36 - okay so let's get a one green flag
06:37 - clicked
06:39 - and get a forever loop
06:43 - and get an if else block
06:48 - and go down to sensing and get a key
06:51 - space
06:52 - pressed um now go back up to looks
06:56 - and in this spot we're gonna put um
06:58 - clear
06:59 - graphic effects sit right
07:02 - here and then in this spot
07:06 - we'll set the ghost effect to a hundred
07:16 - okay so now if we hold down
07:20 - our space button we can see where the
07:22 - player is on the map
07:24 - but then we also want to uh hide the map
07:28 - so i'll also go to the map and put that
07:31 - same code
07:37 - when green flag is clicked forever
07:43 - um if else
07:49 - key space is pressed then we'll clear
07:53 - our graphic
07:56 - effects
07:58 - and then set the ghost effect to 100
08:02 - uh
08:08 - all right and let's have our maze go to
08:11 - the center
08:12 - so go to x zero
08:16 - y zero all right
08:20 - okay so we also need to adjust where our
08:23 - person spawns
08:27 - okay and it'll be around
08:31 - right there okay
08:38 - all right so it should work now and
08:41 - we have our uh maze
08:44 - so we can move around
08:48 - and interact with it so if we try
08:51 - and move against the wall it won't let
08:52 - us go through
08:54 - and if i hold space it shows us where
08:57 - our player
08:58 - is okay
09:01 - so now uh we want to make it so that
09:05 - when we clear the maze
09:07 - when we get out of the maze right here
09:10 - we have to make sure that there's like a
09:12 - you win
09:15 - message so that the player knows that
09:17 - they won
09:19 - and then we'll stop the gang so
09:22 - right now there's no you win
09:26 - as you can see if i walk out there's no
09:29 - you
09:30 - no you in message so let's make that
09:33 - right now
09:34 - and i'll draw that so let's make a news
09:38 - right
09:38 - and paint one and i'll just name this
09:42 - win and let's select the text tool
09:46 - and i'll make this green
09:51 - you win
09:55 - make this a little bit larger and put
09:58 - this in the center
10:02 - so um
10:09 - okay so now we have our you win message
10:13 - and i'll just have it go to the center
10:17 - okay
10:19 - so now we can code it
10:22 - okay so uh what we're going to do
10:25 - for making this work is that we're going
10:28 - to check
10:28 - that if the player's x position is past
10:31 - this
10:32 - wall because that the um only way that
10:35 - you can get out
10:36 - on this side is more
10:39 - than 172 then we'll show this
10:43 - and then we'll stop the game all right
10:47 - so in the player sprite let's go down
10:51 - and get get into the control and get an
10:54 - if
10:58 - um then go get an x position
11:02 - go to operators and get a more than
11:09 - and right now uh my player is outside
11:11 - the maze at
11:12 - x 172 that's about
11:15 - where the exit is so
11:18 - 1 172.
11:22 - and then if it's this then we will
11:25 - broadcast win
11:35 - and then in the wind sprite
11:39 - when the green flag is clicked we want
11:41 - to hide it
11:43 - so that it doesn't show
11:46 - and then when i receive win
11:52 - then we'll make it show
11:57 - and we'll stop all
12:03 - okay so now i think we should try it
12:06 - and let me just go full screen i'll just
12:10 - go through this maze
12:15 - all right so our player
12:18 - does is able to move
12:22 - around and just to speed things
12:25 - up a little bit i'm gonna drag our
12:27 - player down here
12:29 - okay so now we're near
12:33 - our exit and
12:37 - as you can see it says you win after
12:40 - we've
12:40 - exited our maze so that works
12:45 - please like share and subscribe and ring
12:48 - the notification bill
12:50 - and i will see you guys in the next
12:51 - video bye

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys to kids coding playground today we'll be continuing with part two of the 3d maze so here is what we have so far we have our distances list that we'll be using for our raycaster and we can navigate our player hold on let me show it we can navigate our player using the arrow keys and today we'll be working on our raycaster so it'll make it 3d okay let's get into it so uh right now go to the distance sprite and we're going to make a new block and name it draw and have the run without screen refresh uh on and then press ok okay so uh let's import the pen extension so now we have our pen blocks and let's have our uh distance dot go to x negative 237.5 and 180 we're going to go right here because our pen size is going to be slightly larger so it'll cover up the whole screen uh so let's put this under the define draw and then go down to pen and then let's set the pen size to five okay and then we need to set our pen color to something so um we're going to use this brightness effect uh to uh simulate that the distance so it'll look like uh parts of the wall are further than others so um right now all that matters is the saturation and the color so i'll just make this a light bluish color like that and then let's erase everything and set the pen up okay now let's make a new variable and name it column and right here let's set the column to one okay now let's get a repeat blank so right here and then go down to your variables and get length of distances and put that in there all right so instead inside of our repeat loop let's get set pen brightness so go down to pen and set pen brightness um and then let's get a plus block and put five right here and then item and get this and put this in here item column of distances so this will have uh us draw the um distance so it looks like parts of the wall are further than others so now let's set y to negative 1200 divided by item column of distances okay now let's put this below set pin brightness and then let's get a pen down block pen down and then um let's get set change this duplicate this to two hundred then we'll change the x by five since our pen size is five x by five okay so i zoomed in a little bit so you guys can see it better okay so now let's get a change x by five uh change the x by five oh and also put a pen up block between these so that it doesn't drag the pen over and then let's change the column by one and then now we can use our draw block and let's put it under cents and now we have a 3d maze so now you can see that um we can in fact move around this maze but it's not quite finished yet because um our map isn't hidden and we still kind of have our uh variables showing so i'll hide those and um i'd like to make a function where if you hold down space then you'll be able to see the player in the map so in the player sprite okay so let's get a one green flag clicked and get a forever loop and get an if else block and go down to sensing and get a key space pressed um now go back up to looks and in this spot we're gonna put um clear graphic effects sit right here and then in this spot we'll set the ghost effect to a hundred okay so now if we hold down our space button we can see where the player is on the map but then we also want to uh hide the map so i'll also go to the map and put that same code when green flag is clicked forever um if else key space is pressed then we'll clear our graphic effects and then set the ghost effect to 100 uh all right and let's have our maze go to the center so go to x zero y zero all right okay so we also need to adjust where our person spawns okay and it'll be around right there okay all right so it should work now and we have our uh maze so we can move around and interact with it so if we try and move against the wall it won't let us go through and if i hold space it shows us where our player is okay so now uh we want to make it so that when we clear the maze when we get out of the maze right here we have to make sure that there's like a you win message so that the player knows that they won and then we'll stop the gang so right now there's no you win as you can see if i walk out there's no you no you in message so let's make that right now and i'll draw that so let's make a news right and paint one and i'll just name this win and let's select the text tool and i'll make this green you win make this a little bit larger and put this in the center so um okay so now we have our you win message and i'll just have it go to the center okay so now we can code it okay so uh what we're going to do for making this work is that we're going to check that if the player's x position is past this wall because that the um only way that you can get out on this side is more than 172 then we'll show this and then we'll stop the game all right so in the player sprite let's go down and get get into the control and get an if um then go get an x position go to operators and get a more than and right now uh my player is outside the maze at x 172 that's about where the exit is so 1 172. and then if it's this then we will broadcast win and then in the wind sprite when the green flag is clicked we want to hide it so that it doesn't show and then when i receive win then we'll make it show and we'll stop all okay so now i think we should try it and let me just go full screen i'll just go through this maze all right so our player does is able to move around and just to speed things up a little bit i'm gonna drag our player down here okay so now we're near our exit and as you can see it says you win after we've exited our maze so that works please like share and subscribe and ring the notification bill and i will see you guys in the next video bye
