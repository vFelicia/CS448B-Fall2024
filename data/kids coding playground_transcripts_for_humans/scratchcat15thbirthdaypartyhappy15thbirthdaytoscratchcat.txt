01:14 - so yeah
01:15 - this is what we have here today
01:18 - so
01:21 - so um
01:22 - this is the official scratch cat

01:35 - is on may 16th
01:37 - which is on monday so
01:39 - yeah
01:40 - so let's just remix this project
01:43 - and most of the stuff we do not need
01:45 - here
01:46 - so like you we do not need this we don't
01:49 - need this we don't need this we don't
01:50 - need this we don't need this and we
01:52 - don't need this so now we're just left
01:53 - with these two
01:56 - so
01:57 - and we don't broadcast any ready so
01:59 - let's just delete that
02:01 - we're gonna put this on the bottom here
02:05 - and we're gonna shrink the size to 60.
02:10 - we're also going to change the go to
02:11 - because now it's a different go to
02:17 - make it
02:18 - let's do a little bit higher because we
02:20 - need to put the buttons down there
02:24 - so let's go to that and point direction
02:27 - there
02:29 - i'm just going to pull out the hide here
02:34 - so now we're going to change out the
02:35 - music so we don't need this we don't
02:37 - need this
02:39 - and we're gonna do this
02:42 - we need that actually
02:44 - we don't need this
02:47 - i don't need this so we put this over
02:49 - here and this is switching part to end
02:52 - we switch it back up to end which is
02:54 - this one
02:56 - and we play sound this until done
02:59 - and we'll delete the shadow
03:02 - so now let's get the candles and the
03:04 - table out of the backdrop so let's
03:07 - actually keep the shadow on the cat
03:09 - so we can actually do that
03:12 - so we have our shadow here we just align
03:14 - it perfectly to where his feet are or we
03:18 - can just do this yes
03:20 - just put it
03:21 - under his feet
03:23 - make it go back
03:25 - and same with the other dance movement
03:30 - so down here and we go back
03:34 - so we have a shadow for our
03:36 - scratch cat
03:38 - so now let's get the table out of the
03:40 - backdrop and into different sprites so
03:43 - we go to the backdrop
03:45 - so let's get the sprite so first we
03:48 - control x
03:50 - so we cut it and then we paint a new
03:52 - sprite you ctrl v
03:55 - and it's over here
03:57 - and now we just drag it and we have to
04:00 - do that ungroup
04:02 - and then click out
04:03 - pull this out and now we have our table
04:05 - here
04:07 - and we put it over there
04:09 - so we have our cake
04:11 - and we have to control x so we cut it
04:14 - and then we paint a new sprite
04:16 - ctrl v and we have our cake over here
04:19 - so
04:21 - we don't need the cake here so we're
04:22 - just gonna do that and we're gonna
04:24 - ungroup it
04:26 - and we're gonna
04:29 - delete that and we have the 15 which is
04:32 - which are the candles
04:33 - so we're going to move to 15 center it
04:36 - and then we're going to get the candles
04:38 - the candle fire because the fire doesn't
04:39 - look big enough so we're gonna
04:42 - get a cake
04:44 - and then we're gonna go to costumes
04:47 - and we're gonna get this fire
04:50 - we're gonna control c
04:52 - and then we're gonna go control
04:55 - v
04:56 - so there's a bigger fire on the candles
05:04 - and then
05:08 - there's a little uh inside the fire type
05:10 - of thing inside the fire thing we kind
05:12 - of missed it
05:13 - this little white thing
05:17 - so we have to copy that
05:20 - we paste it we bring it out we delete
05:23 - the candlestick
05:25 - and we get the candle fire
05:28 - ctrl c
05:29 - drag it back into here delete that
05:32 - control v
05:33 - put it on the make it larger and then
05:35 - put it on the candle and then we control
05:39 - v
05:41 - and control c this one because we
05:42 - enlarged it and then we put it on the
05:44 - 15.
05:45 - so now we got our 15 candles
05:50 - so
05:53 - so now we're just gonna adjust it a
05:55 - little bit and now it looks good
05:58 - so
05:59 - what we need to do next
06:01 - is group it all together and drag it in
06:03 - the middle
06:05 - so we have our cake here
06:07 - we're gonna delete the fire
06:10 - and we have to delete all these candles
06:11 - because we're not gonna use them
06:13 - and we're gonna delete these one by one
06:15 - over here
06:17 - these little
06:18 - extra texture for the candles
06:20 - and now we're going to get the frosting
06:24 - so we're going to ungroup all of this
06:27 - we're actually going to get the cake
06:28 - first because it's easier then we get
06:29 - ctrl c
06:31 - ctrl x and then we'll get the frosting
06:33 - from there
06:35 - and then since we used control x we
06:38 - paint a new sprite and we control v and
06:40 - then our cake appears here
06:44 - and we name this cake
06:46 - we can name the frosting frosting
06:53 - we name this frosting
06:56 - and we're going to delete cake b
06:58 - so now we have our frosting and cake
07:01 - we're good to go
07:03 - so now i have a button so let's drag
07:05 - that in
07:06 - we're going to get a button here
07:08 - if it's going to load
07:10 - so there we have the button so you see
07:13 - each of them we have a cake frosting and
07:15 - our candles so a background is just a
07:17 - white uh circle with the outline of
07:19 - black
07:20 - and
07:21 - our frosting we just duplicate it in but
07:24 - it gets very thick so we have actually
07:26 - have to change the thickness of
07:29 - the sprinkles and the frosting
07:32 - so you see over here ctrl c
07:35 - we go over here
07:37 - ctrl v
07:38 - and you see it's very big compared to
07:40 - the circle
07:41 - you shrink it
07:43 - the more we shrink it the more thicker
07:45 - it looks
07:46 - so we're actually going to change the
07:48 - thickness
07:50 - to
07:51 - a maybe
07:53 - two
07:55 - so now we have two thickness and we can
07:57 - just drag it easily in but we just
07:59 - decided to delete the dish because it
08:00 - looked
08:01 - a little bit better without the dish
08:04 - so you see here we have that done
08:06 - so the frosting is a little bit more
08:08 - complicated so we're gonna go to the
08:10 - frosting
08:11 - we're going to ctrl c ctrl v
08:14 - into our sprite
08:16 - and you see this is very big compared to
08:19 - the thing like just like the cake and
08:21 - now we have to shrink it all the way
08:23 - down to this size and the sprinkles look
08:25 - really thick
08:27 - so this is not good
08:29 - so we actually have to change the
08:30 - thickness
08:32 - so let's
08:34 - so let's change the thickness of the
08:36 - outline
08:42 - so we're gonna change that
08:44 - to two
08:49 - and now we have that two and we just
08:51 - change every sprinkle so we
08:54 - hold shift and then we can select
08:57 - multiple at a time and making this oh i
09:00 - actually messed it up
09:02 - doing this makes it a little bit more
09:04 - easier
09:05 - for us to change the thickness i'm just
09:07 - showing you examples so you and now we
09:09 - can change all of them at once and now
09:12 - they're a little bit less thick that's
09:14 - how we did it for the frosting
09:18 - yeah just like that
09:20 - yeah and some of them are still pretty
09:21 - thick because we haven't changed that
09:22 - yet so yeah
09:24 - that's what we have for that
09:27 - and now we have the candle
09:31 - so we decided to use the scratch one
09:33 - they had for 15 so we just go click on
09:35 - this 15
09:37 - control c this
09:40 - we control v this
09:42 - and it's just a little bit big so we
09:43 - just shrink it
09:46 - and
09:47 - yeah
09:50 - so
09:52 - you can always decrease the thickness of
09:55 - these
09:56 - little fire pieces
10:00 - in the one
10:05 - so yeah
10:08 - now from three we can maybe do two or
10:10 - one
10:11 - so we have that
10:13 - and this
10:15 - well i think we can keep that we just
10:18 - click that
10:21 - and click it again
10:23 - and we switch to
10:25 - and now we can take out the other now we
10:27 - can just group all of these or we can
10:29 - change these
10:30 - but let's just group that
10:33 - and shrink it
10:38 - so that'll be our substitute 15 instead
10:40 - of this one so
10:42 - let's delete that
10:43 - and let's let's make it a little bit
10:44 - larger and let's put it in there yep
10:47 - and now we have our 15 for our candles
10:52 - so let's get coding
10:54 - so
10:55 - let's do the code for the buttons
10:58 - so when the green flag is clicked let's
11:00 - zoom in a little bit the green flag is
11:02 - clicked it'll go to the front layer
11:06 - it'll switch costume
11:08 - to costume one which is the
11:10 - first costume
11:12 - and we'll go to
11:14 - this position
11:16 - it'll create clone of myself so you'll
11:19 - make three clones of
11:22 - the sprite so when i start as the clone
11:25 - it'll go to the front layer
11:27 - because what if it goes in the back
11:29 - doesn't look good go to the front layer
11:31 - and i'll switch costume
11:34 - to
11:35 - costume number plus one so it gets
11:38 - it just goes up by one costume each time
11:41 - we need the operator
11:43 - costume number
11:45 - plus
11:47 - one
11:48 - now change x by 75 each time so each
11:52 - costume will be separated
11:54 - by each other 75
11:57 - and you need if then
12:00 - so if then
12:02 - not
12:05 - so we need not
12:08 - if then not
12:11 - equals
12:13 - any costume number
12:17 - equals three
12:20 - then it will create clone of myself
12:25 - and when the sprite is clicked
12:30 - if
12:31 - then oh yes what's this
12:35 - if then the costume number is equal to
12:37 - one which is the cake
12:40 - costume number is equal to one costume
12:43 - number
12:45 - then it will broadcast cake color and
12:48 - that will change the cake color so first
12:51 - broadcast
12:54 - make a new
12:56 - broadcast message cake color
12:59 - and now all we have to do is just do
13:02 - we can duplicate this thing
13:04 - and then if costume number equals two
13:07 - it's frosting color this time so just
13:10 - make a new message
13:12 - frosting
13:17 - and we duplicate that and if the costume
13:20 - number is three
13:22 - then we can do
13:26 - candle color
13:30 - so now we have that
13:34 - so
13:37 - so
13:38 - uh now let's get more let's just
13:41 - go to the
13:43 - table
13:46 - so now let's just run the game so you
13:48 - can see
13:49 - and you see i'm dancing you see the
13:51 - buttons so let's work on the table so
13:54 - let's see let's drag the table down here
14:00 - so and let's increase the size of the
14:03 - table
14:05 - to maybe 125.
14:10 - let's actually move here
14:13 - and now we have that we just drag the
14:15 - cake on the table
14:19 - so it's the cake
14:21 - when the green flag is clicked it'll go
14:22 - to this position
14:24 - and then when i receive cake color
14:29 - then it will change
14:32 - color effect
14:34 - by
14:36 - pick random one to 300 so there's a lot
14:38 - of different colors you can choose from
14:41 - and now let's
14:43 - see if it works
14:45 - so you see
14:46 - the cake color is changing so now let's
14:49 - just do the frosting color
14:52 - so when the green flag is clicked
14:55 - we have to make it go to the cake
14:58 - so it's right on top of the cake so
15:00 - we're
15:01 - going to
15:02 - go to the cake
15:06 - and then when i receive
15:10 - frosting color then it will change color
15:16 - effect
15:18 - by pick random one to 300 so let's see
15:21 - if this works
15:24 - so you see oh yeah we also have to make
15:26 - it go to the front layer so let's do
15:28 - that right now
15:33 - yeah so now it's in front
15:35 - and we can change both colors
15:38 - so now let's do the candles so we might
15:41 - have to actually make it go backward one
15:43 - layer
15:44 - because we want the candles to go in
15:46 - front so we just put go backward from
15:48 - there
15:49 - we have our candles here
15:51 - so when the green flag is clicked
15:54 - it will
15:58 - go to about here
16:01 - just make it go here
16:03 - go to here
16:05 - now when i receive
16:09 - candle color
16:11 - it will change
16:13 - color effect
16:15 - like the other ones
16:22 - i'm also going to add go different
16:23 - layers because we always want the
16:24 - candles to be in front
16:28 - let's run the game
16:30 - so it looks like the flame is actually
16:32 - changing colors and we do not want that
16:34 - to happen
16:35 - because who wants blue flames
16:38 - or purple flames so all we have to do is
16:40 - duplicate this 15
16:44 - and then we just throw this away
16:46 - and then we just delete
16:49 - both of these
16:50 - and now we have our flames
16:55 - and we can delete the flames over here
17:04 - so yeah we have that
17:08 - so if the 15 appears to be behind your
17:11 - frosting
17:12 - to just click on it and drag it a little
17:15 - bit and then restart it and it will be
17:17 - fine so right now let's look at our game
17:20 - here
17:22 - scratch guy is dancing it says birthday
17:24 - uh and we have our cake and our table
17:26 - here
17:27 - we can change the color and we made the
17:29 - flame thing so now the flame doesn't
17:31 - change color
17:32 - and now we can make our dream cake
17:35 - so
17:41 - so please like share subscribe and
17:43 - comment in the comment section below uh
17:46 - if you're going to celebrate scratch's
17:47 - birthday because
17:49 - i i definitely am so yeah anyway see you
17:52 - guys next time
17:56 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's turning playground here and today we're back for another video in scratch and today we'll be talking about scratch's 15th birthday and we made a game all about it so if you don't know scratch's birthday is uh on monday so in a few days so we made this game all about that and this game is just about decorating a cake and thanks for the official scratch cat for the original project so they made a whole entire project because of his 15th birthday so let's just look at our game so there's a little bit music i'm not sure if you can hear it but there's a little bit music you see right here there's a uh 15 candles and and there's a cake and you're supposed to customize the cake so you can click on this button right here and it'll change the color of the cake same with the frosting and you can do that with the candles too and we have a little scratch chat right here dancing and there's the birthday so we actually got this one from this uh official scratch cat game so yeah this is what we have here today so so um this is the official scratch cat animation that they made for the 15th birthday so if you don't if you haven't checked it out go check it out uh so it so the birthday of scratch cat is on may 16th which is on monday so yeah so let's just remix this project and most of the stuff we do not need here so like you we do not need this we don't need this we don't need this we don't need this we don't need this and we don't need this so now we're just left with these two so and we don't broadcast any ready so let's just delete that we're gonna put this on the bottom here and we're gonna shrink the size to 60. we're also going to change the go to because now it's a different go to make it let's do a little bit higher because we need to put the buttons down there so let's go to that and point direction there i'm just going to pull out the hide here so now we're going to change out the music so we don't need this we don't need this and we're gonna do this we need that actually we don't need this i don't need this so we put this over here and this is switching part to end we switch it back up to end which is this one and we play sound this until done and we'll delete the shadow so now let's get the candles and the table out of the backdrop so let's actually keep the shadow on the cat so we can actually do that so we have our shadow here we just align it perfectly to where his feet are or we can just do this yes just put it under his feet make it go back and same with the other dance movement so down here and we go back so we have a shadow for our scratch cat so now let's get the table out of the backdrop and into different sprites so we go to the backdrop so let's get the sprite so first we control x so we cut it and then we paint a new sprite you ctrl v and it's over here and now we just drag it and we have to do that ungroup and then click out pull this out and now we have our table here and we put it over there so we have our cake and we have to control x so we cut it and then we paint a new sprite ctrl v and we have our cake over here so we don't need the cake here so we're just gonna do that and we're gonna ungroup it and we're gonna delete that and we have the 15 which is which are the candles so we're going to move to 15 center it and then we're going to get the candles the candle fire because the fire doesn't look big enough so we're gonna get a cake and then we're gonna go to costumes and we're gonna get this fire we're gonna control c and then we're gonna go control v so there's a bigger fire on the candles and then there's a little uh inside the fire type of thing inside the fire thing we kind of missed it this little white thing so we have to copy that we paste it we bring it out we delete the candlestick and we get the candle fire ctrl c drag it back into here delete that control v put it on the make it larger and then put it on the candle and then we control v and control c this one because we enlarged it and then we put it on the 15. so now we got our 15 candles so so now we're just gonna adjust it a little bit and now it looks good so what we need to do next is group it all together and drag it in the middle so we have our cake here we're gonna delete the fire and we have to delete all these candles because we're not gonna use them and we're gonna delete these one by one over here these little extra texture for the candles and now we're going to get the frosting so we're going to ungroup all of this we're actually going to get the cake first because it's easier then we get ctrl c ctrl x and then we'll get the frosting from there and then since we used control x we paint a new sprite and we control v and then our cake appears here and we name this cake we can name the frosting frosting we name this frosting and we're going to delete cake b so now we have our frosting and cake we're good to go so now i have a button so let's drag that in we're going to get a button here if it's going to load so there we have the button so you see each of them we have a cake frosting and our candles so a background is just a white uh circle with the outline of black and our frosting we just duplicate it in but it gets very thick so we have actually have to change the thickness of the sprinkles and the frosting so you see over here ctrl c we go over here ctrl v and you see it's very big compared to the circle you shrink it the more we shrink it the more thicker it looks so we're actually going to change the thickness to a maybe two so now we have two thickness and we can just drag it easily in but we just decided to delete the dish because it looked a little bit better without the dish so you see here we have that done so the frosting is a little bit more complicated so we're gonna go to the frosting we're going to ctrl c ctrl v into our sprite and you see this is very big compared to the thing like just like the cake and now we have to shrink it all the way down to this size and the sprinkles look really thick so this is not good so we actually have to change the thickness so let's so let's change the thickness of the outline so we're gonna change that to two and now we have that two and we just change every sprinkle so we hold shift and then we can select multiple at a time and making this oh i actually messed it up doing this makes it a little bit more easier for us to change the thickness i'm just showing you examples so you and now we can change all of them at once and now they're a little bit less thick that's how we did it for the frosting yeah just like that yeah and some of them are still pretty thick because we haven't changed that yet so yeah that's what we have for that and now we have the candle so we decided to use the scratch one they had for 15 so we just go click on this 15 control c this we control v this and it's just a little bit big so we just shrink it and yeah so you can always decrease the thickness of these little fire pieces in the one so yeah now from three we can maybe do two or one so we have that and this well i think we can keep that we just click that and click it again and we switch to and now we can take out the other now we can just group all of these or we can change these but let's just group that and shrink it so that'll be our substitute 15 instead of this one so let's delete that and let's let's make it a little bit larger and let's put it in there yep and now we have our 15 for our candles so let's get coding so let's do the code for the buttons so when the green flag is clicked let's zoom in a little bit the green flag is clicked it'll go to the front layer it'll switch costume to costume one which is the first costume and we'll go to this position it'll create clone of myself so you'll make three clones of the sprite so when i start as the clone it'll go to the front layer because what if it goes in the back doesn't look good go to the front layer and i'll switch costume to costume number plus one so it gets it just goes up by one costume each time we need the operator costume number plus one now change x by 75 each time so each costume will be separated by each other 75 and you need if then so if then not so we need not if then not equals any costume number equals three then it will create clone of myself and when the sprite is clicked if then oh yes what's this if then the costume number is equal to one which is the cake costume number is equal to one costume number then it will broadcast cake color and that will change the cake color so first broadcast make a new broadcast message cake color and now all we have to do is just do we can duplicate this thing and then if costume number equals two it's frosting color this time so just make a new message frosting and we duplicate that and if the costume number is three then we can do candle color so now we have that so so uh now let's get more let's just go to the table so now let's just run the game so you can see and you see i'm dancing you see the buttons so let's work on the table so let's see let's drag the table down here so and let's increase the size of the table to maybe 125. let's actually move here and now we have that we just drag the cake on the table so it's the cake when the green flag is clicked it'll go to this position and then when i receive cake color then it will change color effect by pick random one to 300 so there's a lot of different colors you can choose from and now let's see if it works so you see the cake color is changing so now let's just do the frosting color so when the green flag is clicked we have to make it go to the cake so it's right on top of the cake so we're going to go to the cake and then when i receive frosting color then it will change color effect by pick random one to 300 so let's see if this works so you see oh yeah we also have to make it go to the front layer so let's do that right now yeah so now it's in front and we can change both colors so now let's do the candles so we might have to actually make it go backward one layer because we want the candles to go in front so we just put go backward from there we have our candles here so when the green flag is clicked it will go to about here just make it go here go to here now when i receive candle color it will change color effect like the other ones i'm also going to add go different layers because we always want the candles to be in front let's run the game so it looks like the flame is actually changing colors and we do not want that to happen because who wants blue flames or purple flames so all we have to do is duplicate this 15 and then we just throw this away and then we just delete both of these and now we have our flames and we can delete the flames over here so yeah we have that so if the 15 appears to be behind your frosting to just click on it and drag it a little bit and then restart it and it will be fine so right now let's look at our game here scratch guy is dancing it says birthday uh and we have our cake and our table here we can change the color and we made the flame thing so now the flame doesn't change color and now we can make our dream cake so so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below uh if you're going to celebrate scratch's birthday because i i definitely am so yeah anyway see you guys next time you
