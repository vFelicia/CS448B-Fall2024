00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - it's kids counting playground here again
00:09 - today we'll be doing another tutorial
00:11 - on our channel uh it's a maze game
00:14 - so you're the mouse and you move around
00:16 - using the arrow keys or
00:18 - wasd if you prefer and you collect
00:21 - the cheeses right here to gain pick
00:23 - random one to ten points
00:25 - and this is plus five right here when
00:28 - you grab it you get more
00:30 - time so i'll give it a little demo of
00:32 - the game
00:33 - so you use the mouse to move around i'm
00:36 - using the arrow keys
00:38 - and when you grab a piece of jesus it's
00:40 - a good job
00:41 - and brings you back to the beginning
00:44 - um so then i'll try to grab the plus
00:47 - five as you can see my timer went up by
00:49 - five
00:51 - getting the cheese pick random one to
00:53 - five points
00:54 - and then um i removed the tail of this
00:57 - mouse because it often got stuck between
01:00 - walls like maybe right here
01:02 - so that's why i took it out so yeah
01:04 - that's basically the game you guys can
01:05 - try it out
01:06 - yourself i'll share this project soon
01:08 - you guys can try it out
01:11 - okay so let's get a new project file new
01:15 - i'm gonna rename this
01:19 - project let's rename it to maze game
01:23 - so maze game we're gonna take out this
01:25 - cat let me import some stuff
01:28 - into here first so i have the cheese
01:31 - and this thing the timer thing so i'm
01:34 - also going to get the
01:35 - backdrop which is the i'm not backed up
01:38 - the maze i forgot to get that i'll get
01:39 - that
01:40 - in a few seconds okay so i got my maze
01:43 - sprite
01:44 - so what this means is i had three
01:45 - costumes so every time you get the
01:47 - cheese it'll
01:48 - switch the costume so you have a
01:50 - different level to play
01:51 - so uh this is just a little maze we drew
01:54 - so we just used some boxes we drew some
01:57 - boxes around
01:58 - um so yeah it's basically how you draw
02:00 - it so we have we'll have this in our
02:02 - google drive
02:03 - so you can download it if you want so
02:06 - i'll ungroup it so i can show you that
02:09 - we
02:10 - drew some individual boxes as you can
02:12 - see just drag them around you guys can
02:14 - make any level you'd want
02:15 - or you can download it if you'd like so
02:18 - yeah that's basically what we have right
02:19 - here
02:20 - some random like
02:24 - lines and we'll um
02:28 - okay so now let's go into the code so
02:30 - we're gonna set up
02:31 - um the mouse right also let's go
02:35 - the mouse this is the mouse thing i'm
02:37 - going to edit this so we're going to
02:38 - have to delete
02:39 - this tail because it messes up the game
02:42 - sometimes
02:43 - so if you want to see how you can but
02:45 - then your game might
02:48 - uh feel different it might be different
02:51 - like
02:52 - it might get stuck there might be some
02:54 - problems so i'm gonna keep it like that
02:56 - for now
02:57 - okay so then we're gonna set up the
02:59 - mouse by putting a little green flag
03:01 - clicks
03:02 - when green flag just clicked let's show
03:06 - show the mouse in the beginning and then
03:07 - we're going to do
03:09 - um point direction of 180 so it points
03:11 - to the bottom
03:12 - of the screen when we just start the
03:14 - game and then
03:16 - we're gonna go to this position so this
03:18 - is the position i set it to back
03:20 - then negative 90 165 so you'll have to
03:24 - like set this to according
03:25 - how your maze looks like if you're going
03:27 - to draw your own but for this maze right
03:29 - here
03:30 - it's negative 90 165
03:33 - so it'll spawn right here okay
03:37 - let's go back to the mouse move this up
03:38 - here and then for the mouse we're going
03:40 - to
03:41 - set the size to 50 it's going to make it
03:43 - a little bit smaller
03:45 - so it's nice to fifty percent let me see
03:47 - if that's look it looks good
03:49 - looks a little too small let's do it 75
03:53 - 75 yeah that looks a little better
03:58 - let me see for a sec i need to see what
04:01 - my
04:01 - old one how big that was okay so it
04:04 - looks like i said it's a 35
04:06 - so i'll show you how that looks like
04:08 - yeah so that's 35 percent
04:10 - that's how big i set it to so you guys
04:13 - can set it to how
04:14 - big your map is okay
04:17 - and then next we're gonna um
04:21 - for the backdrops we have like a
04:23 - backdrop let's make a backdrop actually
04:25 - so i'm gonna make just like i don't know
04:27 - maybe a
04:28 - red backdrop let's just draw
04:32 - a box as the red backdrop
04:36 - so you guys can do whatever you want you
04:38 - can upload your own backdrops as well
04:40 - do whatever you want with this okay
04:44 - and remember you guys can fuse two
04:46 - colors together like this
04:48 - as you can see it looks pretty cool as
04:50 - you can see maybe we should do
04:52 - white and maybe like that color i guess
04:55 - purple
04:57 - i don't know maybe let's just do this
04:59 - okay i add a little
05:01 - color into nothing so like okay so
05:04 - that's going to be the backdrop
05:06 - so in the beginning we're going to make
05:07 - it switch backdrop to backdrop one
05:11 - that's because we're gonna have a losing
05:12 - screen i mean the game over screen and
05:14 - then we're gonna do switch costume to
05:16 - mouse
05:16 - a okay
05:21 - now we can work on the cheese so this
05:22 - cheese we just downloaded from online so
05:24 - we're going to
05:25 - broadcast a message from here and into
05:28 - the mouse to make it move
05:29 - so we're going to start here and then
05:32 - we're going to get into what green flag
05:33 - clicked inside the cheese
05:35 - let's get some reply clicks gonna set
05:37 - the size to 75 percent
05:42 - 75 we're going to show the cheese
05:45 - and we're going to make a variable let's
05:47 - name it score
05:49 - score okay so we're going to set the
05:51 - score
05:52 - to zero okay and after that we're going
05:56 - to go to a random position
05:58 - so this is us uh making the cheese go to
06:01 - a random position
06:03 - but we don't want the cheese to be
06:04 - inside the wall so we're going to do
06:06 - something about that
06:07 - and also remember to make your maze the
06:08 - size of this thing
06:10 - the backdrop like that so we're going to
06:14 - have to show this
06:15 - so we can get the color so repeat until
06:20 - not touching this color so then the
06:21 - cheese won't be in the middle of the
06:23 - wall so you can't get it
06:24 - so that's what we're going to do repeat
06:26 - until
06:28 - not not
06:31 - touching this color so we're going to
06:33 - use this eye dropper
06:35 - thing and get this color okay
06:38 - and then we're going to go to our in
06:39 - position again so
06:42 - go to random position and hide we're
06:43 - going to hide it because we don't want
06:46 - so if you don't hide it it will like see
06:48 - you'll see the
06:49 - cheese teleporting all around so we just
06:51 - want to make the game a little bit more
06:53 - cooler a little bit more better makes it
06:55 - looks better
06:56 - so we're going to put the hide so then
06:58 - you can't see any of this happening
07:00 - and then down here we're going to show
07:01 - after this is done and they're going to
07:03 - broadcast a message called run
07:05 - so what this does is we don't want the
07:07 - cat um and the mouse to be moving around
07:09 - while the cheese is getting uh placed
07:13 - so that's why we want to do this
07:16 - run let's name it run
07:19 - so up here we're going to uh
07:24 - we're going to get actually no let's go
07:27 - into the mouse and finish the mouse and
07:29 - then we'll go back to the cheese so
07:31 - let's go back to the mouse real quick
07:33 - and we're gonna code the movement so
07:35 - when i receive run
07:38 - we can forever forever
07:41 - if then statement if
07:46 - key up or w
07:51 - touching a key
07:54 - up or w so w
07:59 - up up arrow key or w
08:02 - then we're gonna change the y by four so
08:04 - i just found that four is the perfect
08:06 - amount of change so we're gonna change y
08:09 - by four
08:11 - and then we're going to put a direction
08:12 - of zero
08:15 - point in direction of zero which is
08:17 - facing up
08:19 - and then if on edge bounce so when
08:21 - you're look when you're moving up it
08:23 - will point
08:24 - up and if it's touching the edge then
08:26 - we're gonna make it bounce
08:27 - we actually don't need this anymore
08:29 - actually we can do it because like
08:30 - there's some empty spaces right here
08:32 - but like back then when i had this this
08:34 - was a little bit smaller so you could
08:35 - actually touch the edge
08:36 - but yeah let's add this anyway so like
08:39 - you can't go
08:40 - in off the screen a little bit so we're
08:41 - gonna make it bounce
08:43 - on edge bounce and control if
08:47 - if the touching is color
08:51 - if you're touching the color of the wall
08:53 - of the maze
08:54 - let's get the color then we're going to
08:57 - change the y
08:58 - by negative 4 so then they can't go
09:00 - through it so we're going to change y by
09:01 - negative 4.
09:04 - let's duplicate this entire chunk of
09:06 - code and we're going to put it
09:08 - right here in the forever loop but not
09:11 - in the other if that statement
09:12 - so we're going to get if down arrow key
09:15 - down or key s is being pressed
09:20 - s then we're going to change y by
09:23 - negative 4
09:25 - and we're going to point the direction
09:26 - of 180 which is facing down
09:29 - and if on edge bounce and if touching
09:32 - color
09:33 - this blue color then we're going to
09:34 - change the y by four so when you're
09:36 - looking down and you're
09:37 - going down then we're going to push it
09:38 - back up so we're going to change y
09:40 - before
09:41 - let's duplicate this again
09:44 - put it into the forever loop okay if
09:47 - right arrow is being pressed or
09:50 - the key d is being pressed d then i'm
09:54 - going to change the
09:55 - x instead of the y so we can take this
09:56 - out change
09:58 - x by 4 x by 4
10:02 - and let's put this back in and point
10:04 - direction of 90 which is facing the
10:06 - right side
10:07 - and if touching this color we're going
10:09 - to make it change x by negative 4
10:12 - so that is facing the other side when
10:13 - it's touching this side when it's
10:15 - bumping into the ball this side we're
10:16 - going to push it back out
10:19 - duplicate this oops
10:22 - duplicate this put it in the forever
10:25 - loop
10:26 - and if the left arrow is pressed
10:30 - or a or wasd
10:33 - i'm going to change the x by negative 4
10:35 - and point direction negative 90 which is
10:37 - facing the left side
10:38 - and financial bounds and instead we can
10:40 - do 4 right here
10:42 - okay and right here if it's touching the
10:46 - cheese
10:46 - if the mouse is touching the cheese
10:48 - we're gonna make it like say good job or
10:51 - something like that so
10:52 - if touching cheese
10:56 - we're going to say good job for like
11:00 - one second
11:03 - good job
11:06 - one second and then after that we're
11:08 - going to change the score
11:10 - the cheese will give you a random score
11:11 - from pick random
11:14 - let's do score pick random uh one to ten
11:17 - let's do that
11:19 - okay and then we're going to broadcast a
11:20 - new message from next me so we'll use
11:22 - this later
11:23 - next maze is just to switch the level
11:25 - maze
11:26 - so we can broadcast message next maze
11:34 - next maze
11:37 - okay and then next
11:40 - okay so everyone i'm gonna demo the game
11:43 - so when you play it you can move the
11:45 - mouse around the cheese goes to a random
11:47 - position and when you grab the cheese it
11:48 - says good job as you can see
11:50 - the mouse is not going back to the front
11:51 - and as you can see you're getting
11:52 - basically infinite score
11:54 - so we're gonna work on that later so i
11:56 - think you just move around
11:57 - right now okay let's continue working on
12:01 - the code
12:02 - so we're going to go back to the cheese
12:06 - let's go back to the cheese okay
12:10 - and then when i receive next mace inside
12:12 - the cheese we're going to
12:14 - wait one second go to a random position
12:20 - and so when you switch the maze we're
12:22 - going to have to
12:24 - do this again let's duplicate this i
12:26 - have to duplicate this part again
12:29 - so repeat i'm not touching so once it's
12:30 - touching the maze we're going to find a
12:32 - new position for the cheese
12:35 - and then we're going to do the same
12:37 - thing
12:38 - okay all right
12:41 - so let's play it and we also need to
12:44 - move the mouse back to normal place
12:47 - i think yeah so as you can see
12:50 - when you touch the cheese it finds a new
12:52 - position
12:55 - as you can see it moves right there but
12:58 - your mouse is not moving back to the
12:59 - beginning when you're touching it so
13:01 - we're going to have to change that
13:03 - so when i receive
13:06 - okay so actually
13:10 - we are going to go to the mouse actually
13:13 - so we can make it go back to the
13:16 - beginning so let's
13:17 - when i receive next maze
13:20 - we're going to stop other scripts in the
13:22 - sprite so then it can't
13:23 - move while that is happening
13:26 - while that is in play let's stop other
13:29 - scripts in the sprite
13:31 - and then right here we're going to do
13:34 - when i receive next maze we're going to
13:36 - move it back to the beginning
13:38 - so when i receive next maze
13:41 - let's move it go to negative 90.
13:45 - so we're going to go to negative 90 165
13:50 - up to the beginning and then we're going
13:52 - to point direction at zero
13:54 - i mean 180 which is the bottom so we're
13:57 - gonna make a point bottom
13:58 - and then wait one second and then we'll
13:59 - start so okay
14:02 - let's move this up and play so save the
14:04 - project
14:06 - going to get the cheese so it says good
14:09 - job
14:10 - three points
14:13 - so we also want to switch the costume
14:15 - for the maze so
14:17 - when i receive next maze we want a next
14:19 - costume
14:20 - so then it could switch the costumes so
14:25 - next we're going to get we're going to
14:27 - set the position of the maze so we're
14:29 - gonna get one green flag clicked
14:32 - go to zero zero and we're gonna show
14:38 - okay and let's uh
14:41 - start let's make a timer so tyler for
14:44 - the the scheme so we're going to make a
14:45 - variable statement timer
14:56 - wait um
15:00 - i don't know why you can only do cloud
15:02 - variables right there but okay we're
15:04 - gonna use
15:05 - this for all sprites timer
15:09 - okay so for here we're gonna get a one
15:11 - green flag click we're going to set the
15:12 - timer to 60
15:15 - timer to 60
15:18 - and then forever
15:22 - wait one second change the time by
15:26 - negative once and then the timer has
15:27 - been going down
15:32 - i get one and if the timer is equal zero
15:36 - if timer is equal
15:40 - to zero so if
15:43 - timer equals zero then we're gonna
15:46 - broadcast
15:47 - endgame to end the game
15:53 - okay and then when i receive end game
15:58 - when the game ends i'm going to switch
16:01 - the
16:01 - backdrop to a game over backdrop so
16:05 - we're gonna make one
16:07 - let's paint it um i'm just gonna
16:11 - do this or something like this make like
16:14 - some green backdrop
16:18 - i don't want any outline so i'm just
16:22 - gonna do this
16:25 - so yeah i'm gonna take this out okay and
16:28 - then we're gonna
16:29 - get the text make some red text
16:32 - and i'll use this one i guess
16:36 - game over so we could write that
16:39 - make this bigger more visible
16:43 - okay okay so now we have the game over
16:46 - so when
16:47 - i receive end game we're going to
16:48 - broadcast so i'll switch
16:50 - back drop to the backdrop point which is
16:52 - the game over i mean backdrop two
16:57 - let me center this i'm not sure if i
16:59 - have centered this yet
17:01 - uh yeah i think i have okay so now
17:04 - switch back drop to two
17:06 - and we're going to stop other scripts
17:08 - into sprite
17:11 - stop other scripts in the sprites it's
17:13 - right here
17:14 - so after ending game we're gonna stop
17:16 - the timer
17:18 - okay and then the maze we're going to
17:20 - get when i receive end game
17:23 - hide we can hide the maze
17:27 - okay and then in the mouse we are going
17:30 - to when i receive
17:31 - endgame when i receive
17:35 - endgame stop
17:38 - other scripts in the sprite let's
17:40 - duplicate that
17:42 - and hide
17:45 - okay
17:48 - so this should work i think
17:53 - i'll save it
17:56 - okay so we're gonna get the cheese
18:03 - okay i think we still have to make this
18:04 - go back to the beginning so
18:06 - when green flag clicked pretty sure i
18:08 - already said it right there right
18:12 - okay so to fix this we're gonna move
18:14 - this over here
18:18 - so to make it go back to the beginning
18:20 - so see
18:22 - so i did a mistake right here put this
18:25 - over here
18:26 - making it stop everything so you put it
18:28 - into one script
18:31 - see so as you can see the mouse goes
18:34 - back
18:39 - i'll show you guys one more time
18:43 - as you can see it goes back to the
18:44 - beginning and it switches the map
18:48 - so now we have to work on the timer
18:50 - which is like
18:51 - you get plus five time so
18:55 - just duplicate the code from the cheese
18:57 - some of it is similar
19:00 - just duplicate this
19:06 - oops duplicate this
19:10 - and this
19:15 - and let's zoom in a little bit okay
19:18 - so when i receive end game we're going
19:19 - to hide this
19:24 - okay then one backdrop switches to
19:28 - backdrop one
19:30 - backdrop two i mean which is the game
19:32 - over
19:34 - and we can hide as well i don't think
19:36 - this is actually necessary
19:38 - that this is my old code i guess you can
19:39 - just delete it doesn't really matter
19:41 - i have this already
19:44 - okay and then next we are going to
19:48 - uh what else can we do oh yeah so for
19:52 - right here
19:53 - in the next maze this is all the same
19:56 - except we can take out this run we'll
19:58 - take out the broadcast run
20:00 - so this thing is all the same for this
20:03 - one
20:04 - uh we can okay so
20:07 - let me see how big this is yeah okay
20:09 - that's a fine size i don't think we need
20:11 - this this is going to make it even
20:12 - smaller so we're going to make it pick
20:15 - random 10 to 15 seconds
20:18 - for it to start spawning it so that's
20:19 - what i did
20:21 - i'm just gonna do five to ten so for
20:23 - testing purposes
20:25 - and then we're gonna so this is supposed
20:28 - to be down here and then we're gonna
20:29 - hide in the beginning
20:32 - so i don't wanna make it spawn every
20:33 - time it's a little bit rare
20:37 - and okay so after this
20:41 - we don't need the score thing so go to
20:44 - random position repeat until and all
20:47 - this is correct okay now we have this
20:48 - all done
20:50 - okay
20:54 - next we can go into our mouse
20:58 - our mouse has the
21:02 - we add a little script right here so in
21:04 - our mouse we have to add an if-then
21:06 - statement
21:08 - if
21:11 - touching the time so if it's touching
21:13 - the timer
21:14 - the plus five time
21:19 - time then we'll change the timer by five
21:21 - so you get five extra seconds
21:24 - change timer by five
21:27 - and we're gonna broadcast a message
21:29 - called bonus time
21:32 - bonus time
21:35 - bonus time let's go back to the timer
21:37 - the time
21:38 - sprite wait when i receive bonus time
21:41 - so let's go to the time and in bonus
21:45 - time we're just going to copy paste
21:47 - duplicate this code into here so
21:51 - yes i think that's it and i'll save it
21:54 - and i'll demo it so let's play
21:59 - so as you can see the timer is still
22:00 - constantly going down so let's see if i
22:02 - get the plus five as you can see the
22:04 - timer went up
22:06 - plus five like i got five more seconds
22:11 - pick random five to ten seconds it'll
22:12 - spawn one
22:14 - as you can see one spawn and they will
22:17 - move around
22:18 - um time to time because every single
22:21 - maze
22:22 - will switch
22:25 - i'm just going to play this one time so
22:27 - she's actually spawned in my spawn if
22:29 - you don't want that you can like
22:31 - maybe make a hit box or you can like
22:33 - make it max
22:34 - spawn height as this or something like
22:38 - that
22:40 - let's get cheese cheese remember the
22:42 - cheese will give you
22:43 - pick random one to ten points for the
22:46 - time
22:46 - plus five time
22:50 - you can also add a high score like in my
22:51 - other game you can add it if you want
22:55 - so i'm just gonna let the timer run out
22:58 - and i will show you guys
22:59 - the game over once the timer runs out
23:02 - okay the timer is about to run out so as
23:04 - you can see when the timer runs out it's
23:06 - game over
23:07 - oh yes and we can hide the cheese as
23:09 - well when it's game over
23:10 - we just broadcast so i forgot to do that
23:13 - when i receive
23:16 - um end game we just hide
23:20 - i'll just do that for everything okay
23:24 - so yes that's basically the project
23:27 - if you enjoyed please like share and
23:29 - subscribe
23:30 - and bring the notification bell if you
23:34 - like our channel and we'll see you guys
23:36 - in the next tutorial

Cleaned transcript:

it's kids counting playground here again today we'll be doing another tutorial on our channel uh it's a maze game so you're the mouse and you move around using the arrow keys or wasd if you prefer and you collect the cheeses right here to gain pick random one to ten points and this is plus five right here when you grab it you get more time so i'll give it a little demo of the game so you use the mouse to move around i'm using the arrow keys and when you grab a piece of jesus it's a good job and brings you back to the beginning um so then i'll try to grab the plus five as you can see my timer went up by five getting the cheese pick random one to five points and then um i removed the tail of this mouse because it often got stuck between walls like maybe right here so that's why i took it out so yeah that's basically the game you guys can try it out yourself i'll share this project soon you guys can try it out okay so let's get a new project file new i'm gonna rename this project let's rename it to maze game so maze game we're gonna take out this cat let me import some stuff into here first so i have the cheese and this thing the timer thing so i'm also going to get the backdrop which is the i'm not backed up the maze i forgot to get that i'll get that in a few seconds okay so i got my maze sprite so what this means is i had three costumes so every time you get the cheese it'll switch the costume so you have a different level to play so uh this is just a little maze we drew so we just used some boxes we drew some boxes around um so yeah it's basically how you draw it so we have we'll have this in our google drive so you can download it if you want so i'll ungroup it so i can show you that we drew some individual boxes as you can see just drag them around you guys can make any level you'd want or you can download it if you'd like so yeah that's basically what we have right here some random like lines and we'll um okay so now let's go into the code so we're gonna set up um the mouse right also let's go the mouse this is the mouse thing i'm going to edit this so we're going to have to delete this tail because it messes up the game sometimes so if you want to see how you can but then your game might uh feel different it might be different like it might get stuck there might be some problems so i'm gonna keep it like that for now okay so then we're gonna set up the mouse by putting a little green flag clicks when green flag just clicked let's show show the mouse in the beginning and then we're going to do um point direction of 180 so it points to the bottom of the screen when we just start the game and then we're gonna go to this position so this is the position i set it to back then negative 90 165 so you'll have to like set this to according how your maze looks like if you're going to draw your own but for this maze right here it's negative 90 165 so it'll spawn right here okay let's go back to the mouse move this up here and then for the mouse we're going to set the size to 50 it's going to make it a little bit smaller so it's nice to fifty percent let me see if that's look it looks good looks a little too small let's do it 75 75 yeah that looks a little better let me see for a sec i need to see what my old one how big that was okay so it looks like i said it's a 35 so i'll show you how that looks like yeah so that's 35 percent that's how big i set it to so you guys can set it to how big your map is okay and then next we're gonna um for the backdrops we have like a backdrop let's make a backdrop actually so i'm gonna make just like i don't know maybe a red backdrop let's just draw a box as the red backdrop so you guys can do whatever you want you can upload your own backdrops as well do whatever you want with this okay and remember you guys can fuse two colors together like this as you can see it looks pretty cool as you can see maybe we should do white and maybe like that color i guess purple i don't know maybe let's just do this okay i add a little color into nothing so like okay so that's going to be the backdrop so in the beginning we're going to make it switch backdrop to backdrop one that's because we're gonna have a losing screen i mean the game over screen and then we're gonna do switch costume to mouse a okay now we can work on the cheese so this cheese we just downloaded from online so we're going to broadcast a message from here and into the mouse to make it move so we're going to start here and then we're going to get into what green flag clicked inside the cheese let's get some reply clicks gonna set the size to 75 percent 75 we're going to show the cheese and we're going to make a variable let's name it score score okay so we're going to set the score to zero okay and after that we're going to go to a random position so this is us uh making the cheese go to a random position but we don't want the cheese to be inside the wall so we're going to do something about that and also remember to make your maze the size of this thing the backdrop like that so we're going to have to show this so we can get the color so repeat until not touching this color so then the cheese won't be in the middle of the wall so you can't get it so that's what we're going to do repeat until not not touching this color so we're going to use this eye dropper thing and get this color okay and then we're going to go to our in position again so go to random position and hide we're going to hide it because we don't want so if you don't hide it it will like see you'll see the cheese teleporting all around so we just want to make the game a little bit more cooler a little bit more better makes it looks better so we're going to put the hide so then you can't see any of this happening and then down here we're going to show after this is done and they're going to broadcast a message called run so what this does is we don't want the cat um and the mouse to be moving around while the cheese is getting uh placed so that's why we want to do this run let's name it run so up here we're going to uh we're going to get actually no let's go into the mouse and finish the mouse and then we'll go back to the cheese so let's go back to the mouse real quick and we're gonna code the movement so when i receive run we can forever forever if then statement if key up or w touching a key up or w so w up up arrow key or w then we're gonna change the y by four so i just found that four is the perfect amount of change so we're gonna change y by four and then we're going to put a direction of zero point in direction of zero which is facing up and then if on edge bounce so when you're look when you're moving up it will point up and if it's touching the edge then we're gonna make it bounce we actually don't need this anymore actually we can do it because like there's some empty spaces right here but like back then when i had this this was a little bit smaller so you could actually touch the edge but yeah let's add this anyway so like you can't go in off the screen a little bit so we're gonna make it bounce on edge bounce and control if if the touching is color if you're touching the color of the wall of the maze let's get the color then we're going to change the y by negative 4 so then they can't go through it so we're going to change y by negative 4. let's duplicate this entire chunk of code and we're going to put it right here in the forever loop but not in the other if that statement so we're going to get if down arrow key down or key s is being pressed s then we're going to change y by negative 4 and we're going to point the direction of 180 which is facing down and if on edge bounce and if touching color this blue color then we're going to change the y by four so when you're looking down and you're going down then we're going to push it back up so we're going to change y before let's duplicate this again put it into the forever loop okay if right arrow is being pressed or the key d is being pressed d then i'm going to change the x instead of the y so we can take this out change x by 4 x by 4 and let's put this back in and point direction of 90 which is facing the right side and if touching this color we're going to make it change x by negative 4 so that is facing the other side when it's touching this side when it's bumping into the ball this side we're going to push it back out duplicate this oops duplicate this put it in the forever loop and if the left arrow is pressed or a or wasd i'm going to change the x by negative 4 and point direction negative 90 which is facing the left side and financial bounds and instead we can do 4 right here okay and right here if it's touching the cheese if the mouse is touching the cheese we're gonna make it like say good job or something like that so if touching cheese we're going to say good job for like one second good job one second and then after that we're going to change the score the cheese will give you a random score from pick random let's do score pick random uh one to ten let's do that okay and then we're going to broadcast a new message from next me so we'll use this later next maze is just to switch the level maze so we can broadcast message next maze next maze okay and then next okay so everyone i'm gonna demo the game so when you play it you can move the mouse around the cheese goes to a random position and when you grab the cheese it says good job as you can see the mouse is not going back to the front and as you can see you're getting basically infinite score so we're gonna work on that later so i think you just move around right now okay let's continue working on the code so we're going to go back to the cheese let's go back to the cheese okay and then when i receive next mace inside the cheese we're going to wait one second go to a random position and so when you switch the maze we're going to have to do this again let's duplicate this i have to duplicate this part again so repeat i'm not touching so once it's touching the maze we're going to find a new position for the cheese and then we're going to do the same thing okay all right so let's play it and we also need to move the mouse back to normal place i think yeah so as you can see when you touch the cheese it finds a new position as you can see it moves right there but your mouse is not moving back to the beginning when you're touching it so we're going to have to change that so when i receive okay so actually we are going to go to the mouse actually so we can make it go back to the beginning so let's when i receive next maze we're going to stop other scripts in the sprite so then it can't move while that is happening while that is in play let's stop other scripts in the sprite and then right here we're going to do when i receive next maze we're going to move it back to the beginning so when i receive next maze let's move it go to negative 90. so we're going to go to negative 90 165 up to the beginning and then we're going to point direction at zero i mean 180 which is the bottom so we're gonna make a point bottom and then wait one second and then we'll start so okay let's move this up and play so save the project going to get the cheese so it says good job three points so we also want to switch the costume for the maze so when i receive next maze we want a next costume so then it could switch the costumes so next we're going to get we're going to set the position of the maze so we're gonna get one green flag clicked go to zero zero and we're gonna show okay and let's uh start let's make a timer so tyler for the the scheme so we're going to make a variable statement timer wait um i don't know why you can only do cloud variables right there but okay we're gonna use this for all sprites timer okay so for here we're gonna get a one green flag click we're going to set the timer to 60 timer to 60 and then forever wait one second change the time by negative once and then the timer has been going down i get one and if the timer is equal zero if timer is equal to zero so if timer equals zero then we're gonna broadcast endgame to end the game okay and then when i receive end game when the game ends i'm going to switch the backdrop to a game over backdrop so we're gonna make one let's paint it um i'm just gonna do this or something like this make like some green backdrop i don't want any outline so i'm just gonna do this so yeah i'm gonna take this out okay and then we're gonna get the text make some red text and i'll use this one i guess game over so we could write that make this bigger more visible okay okay so now we have the game over so when i receive end game we're going to broadcast so i'll switch back drop to the backdrop point which is the game over i mean backdrop two let me center this i'm not sure if i have centered this yet uh yeah i think i have okay so now switch back drop to two and we're going to stop other scripts into sprite stop other scripts in the sprites it's right here so after ending game we're gonna stop the timer okay and then the maze we're going to get when i receive end game hide we can hide the maze okay and then in the mouse we are going to when i receive endgame when i receive endgame stop other scripts in the sprite let's duplicate that and hide okay so this should work i think i'll save it okay so we're gonna get the cheese okay i think we still have to make this go back to the beginning so when green flag clicked pretty sure i already said it right there right okay so to fix this we're gonna move this over here so to make it go back to the beginning so see so i did a mistake right here put this over here making it stop everything so you put it into one script see so as you can see the mouse goes back i'll show you guys one more time as you can see it goes back to the beginning and it switches the map so now we have to work on the timer which is like you get plus five time so just duplicate the code from the cheese some of it is similar just duplicate this oops duplicate this and this and let's zoom in a little bit okay so when i receive end game we're going to hide this okay then one backdrop switches to backdrop one backdrop two i mean which is the game over and we can hide as well i don't think this is actually necessary that this is my old code i guess you can just delete it doesn't really matter i have this already okay and then next we are going to uh what else can we do oh yeah so for right here in the next maze this is all the same except we can take out this run we'll take out the broadcast run so this thing is all the same for this one uh we can okay so let me see how big this is yeah okay that's a fine size i don't think we need this this is going to make it even smaller so we're going to make it pick random 10 to 15 seconds for it to start spawning it so that's what i did i'm just gonna do five to ten so for testing purposes and then we're gonna so this is supposed to be down here and then we're gonna hide in the beginning so i don't wanna make it spawn every time it's a little bit rare and okay so after this we don't need the score thing so go to random position repeat until and all this is correct okay now we have this all done okay next we can go into our mouse our mouse has the we add a little script right here so in our mouse we have to add an ifthen statement if touching the time so if it's touching the timer the plus five time time then we'll change the timer by five so you get five extra seconds change timer by five and we're gonna broadcast a message called bonus time bonus time bonus time let's go back to the timer the time sprite wait when i receive bonus time so let's go to the time and in bonus time we're just going to copy paste duplicate this code into here so yes i think that's it and i'll save it and i'll demo it so let's play so as you can see the timer is still constantly going down so let's see if i get the plus five as you can see the timer went up plus five like i got five more seconds pick random five to ten seconds it'll spawn one as you can see one spawn and they will move around um time to time because every single maze will switch i'm just going to play this one time so she's actually spawned in my spawn if you don't want that you can like maybe make a hit box or you can like make it max spawn height as this or something like that let's get cheese cheese remember the cheese will give you pick random one to ten points for the time plus five time you can also add a high score like in my other game you can add it if you want so i'm just gonna let the timer run out and i will show you guys the game over once the timer runs out okay the timer is about to run out so as you can see when the timer runs out it's game over oh yes and we can hide the cheese as well when it's game over we just broadcast so i forgot to do that when i receive um end game we just hide i'll just do that for everything okay so yes that's basically the project if you enjoyed please like share and subscribe and bring the notification bell if you like our channel and we'll see you guys in the next tutorial
