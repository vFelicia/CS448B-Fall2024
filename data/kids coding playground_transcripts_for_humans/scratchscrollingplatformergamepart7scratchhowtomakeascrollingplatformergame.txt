00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:09 - kids coding playground
00:10 - today we'll be doing the next episode of
00:14 - the scrolling platformer
00:16 - and i'm just going to scroll through the
00:18 - code for a little bit
00:19 - so i can show you guys just
00:24 - if you have missed anything then you can
00:29 - i'll copy it down right now
00:36 - i'll scroll a little bit slower this
00:37 - time so you guys can actually
00:40 - look at it better so
00:44 - so the tick custom block
00:49 - and all this
00:53 - and then we have the platforms
00:58 - the platforms
01:02 - danger so we have this
01:05 - and let me just delete that i don't know
01:07 - why that was there
01:09 - um so that's the danger
01:13 - collectibles
01:19 - and the exit the portal
01:25 - okay so today we'll be working on the
01:28 - vertical scrolling so let's go to our
01:30 - player
01:31 - let's go to the tick custom block so you
01:34 - want to get an
01:34 - if then statement if
01:38 - scroll y is less than zero so this is
01:42 - if it's the scroll wise less than zero
01:44 - it will not scroll
01:46 - so if the scroll y is less than zero
01:49 - then set the scroll y
01:53 - to zero like the scroll x we also did
01:56 - that
01:56 - if it passed zero then it'll not scroll
01:59 - anymore
02:00 - next we want to add the vertical
02:03 - scrolling so add this right here
02:06 - so you want to change the scroll y
02:09 - by the round so this is just uh
02:12 - this is just to uh make it smooth
02:15 - scrolling
02:16 - so for here we just set the scroll x to
02:19 - x
02:20 - but if you want to make it uh smooth
02:22 - then you can do
02:23 - change scroll y by round of the
02:27 - just put a division symbol and then a
02:29 - subtraction
02:32 - so y minus
02:35 - the scroll y then you divide it by 10.
02:41 - and then next you always want to
02:43 - position it again so it will
02:45 - go to the correct position and
02:48 - if
02:51 - the y position is less than 180
02:55 - negative 180
02:58 - if the y then we want to set
03:02 - exit to dead set the exit
03:06 - to dead
03:12 - now you want to go to the platform
03:15 - script
03:15 - we will add some more levels to the
03:17 - platform
03:19 - so remember you have to you can use the
03:22 - m
03:23 - to find out where you want to put the
03:24 - platforms we are adding more platforms
03:27 - so then we can see more levels when
03:29 - we're scrolling
03:30 - so i already have some coordinates i
03:33 - i'm using so i would just use those
03:36 - coordinates
03:36 - it may not be the same for yours because
03:39 - your platformer may be different from
03:41 - mine
03:42 - so let me just quickly enter this
03:45 - duplicate this
03:50 - uh let's go to
03:53 - level three one set this up three sixty
03:58 - three sixty 0 0
04:03 - 360.
04:06 - and finally level 4. duplicate this
04:12 - and don't forget to change the level i
04:14 - almost forgot to do that
04:16 - level three level four set this to level
04:19 - four
04:20 - one delete this okay so now i have all
04:23 - the coordinates
04:24 - to place all the clones for the
04:28 - platforms now we gonna work at the
04:30 - collectibles
04:31 - so i already have some hornets for the
04:34 - collectibles as well
04:38 - so i'm gonna take this out for now so
04:40 - because i have to add
04:41 - a lot of script so i'm going to
04:43 - duplicate this
04:44 - put the code so level 2
04:48 - negative 79
04:52 - negative 76.
04:56 - one six six
04:59 - two three two
05:03 - two six two three two
05:07 - so remember you can place collectibles
05:10 - wherever you want
05:12 - i just did it at these exact places
05:16 - you still have the mouse thing to find
05:19 - out where you want to place your
05:22 - collectibles
05:39 - and finally for a one so i am done with
05:42 - the level two
05:44 - let me duplicate all of this so then i
05:47 - can just put this down here
05:48 - and instead of level one we'll do level
05:50 - three we remember to rename your levels
05:55 - negative 75
05:58 - zero 56
06:04 - negative 65
06:08 - 50
06:11 - 10
06:17 - 50. and
06:20 - we have three more to go 910
06:24 - oh yeah and not five it's fifty
06:27 - fifty nine ten negative sixty
06:33 - um 988
06:38 - 60
06:41 - and finally last but not least 1020
06:46 - and 168. so we have to change this to
06:49 - level three right here
06:52 - uh it's already level three this is
06:53 - level four sorry about that
06:55 - so i just created one fruit at the end
06:58 - of level
06:59 - at the end just for fun so i just put it
07:02 - at 170
07:03 - negative 175 and 5. okay so now we have
07:07 - all of our collectibles positioned
07:10 - and don't forget to add this set x
07:12 - negative 99999
07:14 - so we can move the actual collectible
07:17 - off the screen
07:19 - again so now let's work on the saw so i
07:23 - just got this
07:24 - saw from online um so the saw
07:28 - actually has like a costume where you
07:30 - can um
07:32 - uh you can like make it rotate look like
07:34 - it's rotating
07:36 - like a rotating blade so
07:40 - let's get uh the code from the
07:42 - collectibles you can just
07:44 - drag and drop this into the saw we will
07:46 - not need some of the code however
07:49 - so um
07:52 - in the beginning in setup you just take
07:54 - out this
07:55 - it's already set so you want to set the
07:58 - x to zero
07:59 - y to zero i'm gonna hide right here
08:02 - set the player dying to no player dying
08:05 - to end
08:06 - so remember all the uh all the
08:11 - variables with the capital letters are
08:14 - for global so if you have not made this
08:16 - variable
08:17 - make it it's called player dying make
08:19 - this variable
08:21 - so you want to set the player dying to
08:22 - no
08:25 - and i only put a saws in two of the
08:28 - levels so
08:29 - if it's equal to level two i
08:32 - remember you can use the mouse thing i
08:34 - just made it at
08:36 - 65 130 that's where i put
08:40 - my saw and i'm going to duplicate this
08:45 - if it's level three in the beginning you
08:47 - want to switch the costume to
08:49 - back to the first saw so it won't be
08:53 - on the rotating saw already so
08:56 - negative 63 and negative 85
09:00 - that's where i put those and then i will
09:03 - duplicate this i guess and then i did
09:07 - 1 1 2 8 and 85
09:14 - and then don't forget to set the x
09:17 - back to negative 99 since we're dealing
09:19 - with clones again
09:20 - and then we can just delete the rest of
09:22 - the code
09:24 - all right now you want to also get the
09:30 - the clone thing right here
09:33 - and the positioner to position it
09:36 - the green flag and also the reset
09:42 - and of course the tick
09:48 - all right so let me just spread this out
09:52 - a little bit
09:58 - okay so for here we will not need the
10:00 - switch costume to pick
10:01 - random one to eight we will not need the
10:03 - collected max for here we just want to
10:05 - switch the costume
10:07 - back to the stall one so so in the
10:10 - beginning it'll
10:11 - always win a clone it'll always be the
10:13 - first costume for the saw
10:16 - and then for the um tip uh
10:20 - when i receive tick we can keep this if
10:22 - it's touching the player
10:24 - and and
10:28 - player dying is equal to n so let's set
10:30 - this to n
10:33 - so if touching player and
10:36 - the player is dying is equal to n
10:41 - player dying is equal to n then we will
10:44 - not need
10:45 - this right here we don't need this right
10:47 - here
10:49 - so once this is happening we want to set
10:52 - the player dying to yes
10:54 - because we when the player is already
10:55 - dead we don't want to keep installing it
10:57 - so
10:58 - let's go player dying to y if touching
11:01 - player and
11:02 - so we want to set it to y when it's
11:04 - touching it
11:07 - so it's dead once it's touching it and
11:09 - then we can broadcast
11:10 - a new message called player die
11:15 - the player will receive this and it will
11:18 - die
11:20 - then after that after it's done sawing
11:23 - we set it back to no so it won't keep on
11:25 - sawing it
11:26 - and it won't keep on dying set it back
11:29 - to n
11:31 - and one last bit of code for here
11:34 - when i start as a clone
11:38 - you wanna forever
11:42 - next costume this is just for like this
11:45 - rotating saw animation
11:47 - and i put a weight 0.05 seconds
11:51 - so a very very little pause
11:54 - a very little pause and then next
11:57 - finally
11:58 - not not finally but we
12:01 - need to add one last bit of code for the
12:05 - player when when i receive player die
12:08 - then we want to set the exit to dead
12:11 - to let the player know it's dead exit
12:15 - to dead so up here we have
12:19 - the thing where if
12:23 - where is it again oh yeah
12:26 - if set the exit to uh if touching danger
12:30 - and set the exit to dead so if the
12:32 - player is
12:34 - when it receives the player die when the
12:36 - chainsaw touches the player they'll set
12:38 - the exit
12:38 - dead and finally let's work on the
12:42 - portal
12:43 - positioning so
12:47 - now we have four levels we can't do this
12:51 - level is less than two so we have to
12:52 - change this four same with the danger
12:55 - this has to be all right not the danger
12:59 - uh what was it again
13:03 - oh yeah we have to set that for the
13:06 - sauce i mean not the sauce the
13:09 - collectibles
13:10 - so for the uh portal we want to set the
13:14 - level if it's less than four
13:17 - so if the level is equal to one
13:21 - we will i put this position it may not
13:24 - be the same for yours
13:26 - so i will duplicate a new cost
13:30 - i mean not a new costume a uh new if
13:34 - then statement so this thing
13:35 - duplicate this if
13:39 - it's equal to level two if
13:42 - levels equals level two switch costing
13:45 - close portal
13:46 - so i put it at 709
13:49 - 541
13:52 - and i will duplicate that again oops
13:55 - wrong one
13:58 - duplicate that again
14:02 - and if it's equal to level three
14:05 - then i set it at one two three five
14:09 - and one fifty so i just found these
14:12 - positions by using the mouse thing
14:14 - so now let's test out the game so guys i
14:17 - forgot to add the danger for level two
14:19 - and level three
14:21 - so we will add that right now really
14:22 - quick so i just set it for these
14:25 - positions 150
14:28 - 200.
14:30 - 360 and 100
14:34 - and then um
14:37 - next i should duplicate this
14:40 - so let's change it to level three so i
14:43 - have these costumes
14:46 - right here so instead of
14:49 - level one three two one we have to do
14:51 - three one
14:53 - and instead of level two we do level
14:54 - three like i said
14:56 - and 360 100 i'm not doing a 360
15:03 - 0 0 360. so it'll just keep on going
15:07 - across
15:08 - no y position has changed duplicate this
15:12 - and finally the last bit of it
15:16 - so four delete these two
15:19 - and we just need to do level four one
15:21 - that's it so
15:22 - let's try it out
15:25 - so i have no music yet i can add that
15:28 - later remember you can still wall jump
15:32 - collect all the fruits
15:38 - and go to the portal and the y scrolling
15:42 - is working
15:43 - fine because as you can see you can
15:44 - scroll up
15:46 - and the saw is spinning around and you
15:48 - can get killed by it
15:51 - as you can so your platformer should be
15:55 - looking like this
15:58 - and we have the whole line of spikes
15:59 - here
16:02 - and finally level three the last level
16:05 - we have another saw right there
16:08 - oops i just uh it's a little bit laggy
16:13 - right now
16:17 - it's a little bit laggy okay it's back
16:18 - to normal
16:20 - okay let me collect all these fruits
16:25 - and boom we're done and
16:28 - on level four tomorrow in the next video
16:31 - we'll do the winning screen
16:33 - but anyways thank you guys for watching
16:36 - don't forget to share this with your
16:37 - friends
16:39 - like this video smash the like button
16:41 - and subscribe if you're new
16:43 - to our channel thank you guys for
16:44 - watching and i'll see you guys in the
16:46 - next video
16:50 - [Music]
16:57 - you

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today we'll be doing the next episode of the scrolling platformer and i'm just going to scroll through the code for a little bit so i can show you guys just if you have missed anything then you can i'll copy it down right now i'll scroll a little bit slower this time so you guys can actually look at it better so so the tick custom block and all this and then we have the platforms the platforms danger so we have this and let me just delete that i don't know why that was there um so that's the danger collectibles and the exit the portal okay so today we'll be working on the vertical scrolling so let's go to our player let's go to the tick custom block so you want to get an if then statement if scroll y is less than zero so this is if it's the scroll wise less than zero it will not scroll so if the scroll y is less than zero then set the scroll y to zero like the scroll x we also did that if it passed zero then it'll not scroll anymore next we want to add the vertical scrolling so add this right here so you want to change the scroll y by the round so this is just uh this is just to uh make it smooth scrolling so for here we just set the scroll x to x but if you want to make it uh smooth then you can do change scroll y by round of the just put a division symbol and then a subtraction so y minus the scroll y then you divide it by 10. and then next you always want to position it again so it will go to the correct position and if the y position is less than 180 negative 180 if the y then we want to set exit to dead set the exit to dead now you want to go to the platform script we will add some more levels to the platform so remember you have to you can use the m to find out where you want to put the platforms we are adding more platforms so then we can see more levels when we're scrolling so i already have some coordinates i i'm using so i would just use those coordinates it may not be the same for yours because your platformer may be different from mine so let me just quickly enter this duplicate this uh let's go to level three one set this up three sixty three sixty 0 0 360. and finally level 4. duplicate this and don't forget to change the level i almost forgot to do that level three level four set this to level four one delete this okay so now i have all the coordinates to place all the clones for the platforms now we gonna work at the collectibles so i already have some hornets for the collectibles as well so i'm gonna take this out for now so because i have to add a lot of script so i'm going to duplicate this put the code so level 2 negative 79 negative 76. one six six two three two two six two three two so remember you can place collectibles wherever you want i just did it at these exact places you still have the mouse thing to find out where you want to place your collectibles and finally for a one so i am done with the level two let me duplicate all of this so then i can just put this down here and instead of level one we'll do level three we remember to rename your levels negative 75 zero 56 negative 65 50 10 50. and we have three more to go 910 oh yeah and not five it's fifty fifty nine ten negative sixty um 988 60 and finally last but not least 1020 and 168. so we have to change this to level three right here uh it's already level three this is level four sorry about that so i just created one fruit at the end of level at the end just for fun so i just put it at 170 negative 175 and 5. okay so now we have all of our collectibles positioned and don't forget to add this set x negative 99999 so we can move the actual collectible off the screen again so now let's work on the saw so i just got this saw from online um so the saw actually has like a costume where you can um uh you can like make it rotate look like it's rotating like a rotating blade so let's get uh the code from the collectibles you can just drag and drop this into the saw we will not need some of the code however so um in the beginning in setup you just take out this it's already set so you want to set the x to zero y to zero i'm gonna hide right here set the player dying to no player dying to end so remember all the uh all the variables with the capital letters are for global so if you have not made this variable make it it's called player dying make this variable so you want to set the player dying to no and i only put a saws in two of the levels so if it's equal to level two i remember you can use the mouse thing i just made it at 65 130 that's where i put my saw and i'm going to duplicate this if it's level three in the beginning you want to switch the costume to back to the first saw so it won't be on the rotating saw already so negative 63 and negative 85 that's where i put those and then i will duplicate this i guess and then i did 1 1 2 8 and 85 and then don't forget to set the x back to negative 99 since we're dealing with clones again and then we can just delete the rest of the code all right now you want to also get the the clone thing right here and the positioner to position it the green flag and also the reset and of course the tick all right so let me just spread this out a little bit okay so for here we will not need the switch costume to pick random one to eight we will not need the collected max for here we just want to switch the costume back to the stall one so so in the beginning it'll always win a clone it'll always be the first costume for the saw and then for the um tip uh when i receive tick we can keep this if it's touching the player and and player dying is equal to n so let's set this to n so if touching player and the player is dying is equal to n player dying is equal to n then we will not need this right here we don't need this right here so once this is happening we want to set the player dying to yes because we when the player is already dead we don't want to keep installing it so let's go player dying to y if touching player and so we want to set it to y when it's touching it so it's dead once it's touching it and then we can broadcast a new message called player die the player will receive this and it will die then after that after it's done sawing we set it back to no so it won't keep on sawing it and it won't keep on dying set it back to n and one last bit of code for here when i start as a clone you wanna forever next costume this is just for like this rotating saw animation and i put a weight 0.05 seconds so a very very little pause a very little pause and then next finally not not finally but we need to add one last bit of code for the player when when i receive player die then we want to set the exit to dead to let the player know it's dead exit to dead so up here we have the thing where if where is it again oh yeah if set the exit to uh if touching danger and set the exit to dead so if the player is when it receives the player die when the chainsaw touches the player they'll set the exit dead and finally let's work on the portal positioning so now we have four levels we can't do this level is less than two so we have to change this four same with the danger this has to be all right not the danger uh what was it again oh yeah we have to set that for the sauce i mean not the sauce the collectibles so for the uh portal we want to set the level if it's less than four so if the level is equal to one we will i put this position it may not be the same for yours so i will duplicate a new cost i mean not a new costume a uh new if then statement so this thing duplicate this if it's equal to level two if levels equals level two switch costing close portal so i put it at 709 541 and i will duplicate that again oops wrong one duplicate that again and if it's equal to level three then i set it at one two three five and one fifty so i just found these positions by using the mouse thing so now let's test out the game so guys i forgot to add the danger for level two and level three so we will add that right now really quick so i just set it for these positions 150 200. 360 and 100 and then um next i should duplicate this so let's change it to level three so i have these costumes right here so instead of level one three two one we have to do three one and instead of level two we do level three like i said and 360 100 i'm not doing a 360 0 0 360. so it'll just keep on going across no y position has changed duplicate this and finally the last bit of it so four delete these two and we just need to do level four one that's it so let's try it out so i have no music yet i can add that later remember you can still wall jump collect all the fruits and go to the portal and the y scrolling is working fine because as you can see you can scroll up and the saw is spinning around and you can get killed by it as you can so your platformer should be looking like this and we have the whole line of spikes here and finally level three the last level we have another saw right there oops i just uh it's a little bit laggy right now it's a little bit laggy okay it's back to normal okay let me collect all these fruits and boom we're done and on level four tomorrow in the next video we'll do the winning screen but anyways thank you guys for watching don't forget to share this with your friends like this video smash the like button and subscribe if you're new to our channel thank you guys for watching and i'll see you guys in the next video you
