01:41 - yeah we did give you a shout out
01:42 - but unfortunately that is incorrect but
01:44 - you were one of the most
01:45 - first ones to comment so great job
01:48 - answers
01:49 - a this dude i think either
01:52 - a 9 1944 jag tiger v
01:56 - and injured kumar where i think they
01:59 - were the first ones to come
02:00 - a so great job and
02:04 - um lastly johann harris wu
02:08 - so he picked d so
02:11 - that i think he's also one of the first
02:13 - ones because he's two days ago
02:15 - two days ago two days ago two days ago
02:18 - so we're all
02:19 - two days ago so i think he's also one of
02:21 - the first ones to do it
02:22 - and and great midas too and cesaro
02:25 - legend and i'm group wow all these are
02:27 - all two days ago and this one's two days
02:28 - ago
02:31 - so this is the original game by kamala
02:34 - so
02:34 - i'm we did we didn't with the octopus
02:37 - because
02:37 - we did it um we re we did it we
02:41 - remixed it last week but this one is the
02:44 - new form
02:47 - she has a bat right here
02:50 - and as you can see it's flying around we
02:52 - did add a wind so
02:53 - um yeah look i can kill myself so when
02:57 - you touch the edge you die
02:59 - [Music]
03:03 - so there is no winning unfortunately i
03:05 - don't think there is
03:06 - [Music]
03:10 - i think we added the winning oh yeah she
03:13 - still didn't have the
03:15 - [Music]
03:16 - wedding
03:20 - so you can see when you touch the stars
03:22 - you can get points
03:23 - and then you can't just stay on the star
03:25 - and get like infinite points
03:27 - it has like a small weight and when you
03:30 - touch the edge
03:31 - you can't just stay on the edge and you
03:32 - kept keep on losing lives
03:34 - you have to like um
03:38 - it has a weight before you die or lose
03:41 - lives or
03:41 - get score so that's also
03:45 - i also have a cool feature in
03:48 - kamala's uh project which is um
03:52 - this this is really cool so we have the
03:55 - octopus but this
03:56 - i like how kamala added um uh
04:00 - the mod so the mod is always
04:03 - going from costumes a to b to a to b to
04:06 - a to b
04:06 - so as you can see when i demoed it it
04:08 - went like bam bam bam bam bam
04:11 - bam and it kept on going up and forth
04:13 - and back and forth and back and forth
04:15 - and they didn't use these two but i got
04:17 - one at
04:18 - piece of advice stream i advise you to
04:20 - delete these two costumes
04:22 - because it will um you can just use next
04:24 - costume and you don't have to use mod
04:26 - so i mean mod is optional but
04:29 - you i in my opinion i think it's easier
04:32 - with
04:33 - just deleting c and d so
04:36 - i just started my new project untitled
04:39 - 31 so we have to change it to
04:41 - the chase game
04:46 - also you change the chase game i'm gonna
04:48 - teach you because i have two
04:50 - and um before i start please like
04:53 - share subscribe and comment in the
04:55 - comment section below
04:56 - for else content you want so i think
04:59 - everything here is in the sprite library
05:02 - so if you want your project shout out
05:05 - shout out
05:06 - like camella then you can comment in the
05:08 - comment section below
05:09 - put your project linked and we might we
05:11 - might shout out
05:13 - and we might maybe make it into a
05:14 - tutorial so you guys can do that
05:17 - and and it has to be nice and simple and
05:20 - easy
05:21 - for the kids yeah you know so and also
05:24 - um you you can also go the comment in
05:26 - the community post you never know when
05:28 - you're gonna get a shout out too
05:29 - you never know so anyways let's get
05:32 - started
05:33 - so i already have in my backpack that
05:35 - you win and use lose sprite so
05:38 - the you win and you lose sprite is
05:41 - simple just paying a sprite saying you
05:44 - win
05:45 - you when you lose so as you can see
05:48 - kamala didn't have
05:49 - you when you lose so i decided to make a
05:53 - few wins
05:53 - to make the game more interesting so you
05:56 - can
05:57 - actually win in the game so i'm gonna go
05:59 - to the octopus
06:03 - so this is the octopus
06:08 - and we also need a backdrop we can put
06:11 - the backdrop as
06:13 - underwater
06:16 - one and canala also had that
06:20 - backdrop in the costumes of octopus
06:23 - we can delete all of these
06:27 - so in the in camala's game a long time
06:30 - ago
06:30 - when she still had she or he had still
06:32 - had the octopus
06:34 - uh um kamala did not use octopus
06:37 - a kamala used octopus b so i guess we
06:41 - will use octopus b
06:42 - as well so it's silly octopus d octopus
06:45 - e
06:46 - i've never seen an octopus play drums
06:48 - before
06:49 - and okay let's start so
06:53 - when the green flag is clicked so we can
06:54 - delete this we also need one more sprite
06:56 - the star
06:57 - and i literally forgot about that one
06:59 - [Music]
07:00 - star he also make it catch a starfish if
07:03 - you want because underwater themed
07:05 - so yeah
07:06 - [Music]
07:10 - so octopus when the green flag is
07:13 - clicked
07:15 - it will show
07:19 - you know switch backdrop to underwater
07:21 - one that's optional but
07:22 - you can do it so and i'm gonna make it
07:25 - go to
07:26 - the middle go to zero
07:31 - and point in direction
07:34 - nine day and then they'll set lives
07:37 - to five so you're gonna make a variable
07:39 - called
07:42 - lies and also we need forever
07:46 - first we have to make the variables
07:50 - lives so then set lives
07:54 - to five make another variable
07:58 - score
07:59 - [Music]
08:03 - set score to zero obvious
08:06 - and then go forever
08:11 - so uh you need to if then statement
08:14 - if then the up arrow
08:22 - then no change y by 10
08:27 - and you just duplicate this to make the
08:29 - down arrow so
08:31 - simple easy down arrow
08:36 - negative 10 and also the left arrow
08:40 - and right here so you can just duplicate
08:41 - this but you have to change it to x
08:43 - instead
08:44 - so right arrow
08:48 - change x by
08:51 - [Music]
08:52 - 10 and you duplicate it
08:56 - and then change left arrow
09:00 - and change x by negative 10.
09:06 - so um i'm going to demo the game
09:10 - so as you can see we can move with the
09:12 - octopus that's all we have right now
09:14 - because we just
09:15 - all we did was code this we didn't code
09:17 - them losing lives because we have a lot
09:18 - to code
09:19 - and when the green flag is clicked
09:22 - [Music]
09:24 - then it'll go forever
09:26 - [Music]
09:27 - and then if then statement if then the
09:29 - edge
09:33 - they'll lose lives uh as you can see in
09:36 - kamala's project
09:37 - when it touches the edge it loses lots
09:39 - which is really creative
09:40 - in my opinion so this is a
09:44 - creative way to lose lives i'm touching
09:46 - the edge
09:47 - then it'll change lives by minus one
09:54 - and then if on edge
09:57 - bounce and then yeah
10:01 - if then statement
10:09 - if then the lives equal to zero that's
10:12 - when it runs out of lives
10:18 - the lives equals zero
10:20 - [Music]
10:25 - lives equals zero or
10:29 - zero or or the lives are less than zero
10:40 - then it will broadcast octopus
10:43 - dying so
10:46 - and wait always get that messed up so
10:50 - losing an octopus dying is different
10:53 - because kamala when whenever you die
10:55 - for the octopus it used to
10:59 - um be
11:02 - it used to be um fading away as a
11:05 - ghost effect so
11:15 - [Music]
11:17 - so yeah so we have to make a different
11:19 - broadcast or else
11:21 - it will not do the fade effect so
11:25 - yeah so we have to move this inside here
11:30 - and we need to wait one second right
11:34 - here so we're done with this script of
11:38 - code
11:38 - [Music]
11:41 - so and then we need when a green flag
11:43 - clicked
11:45 - forever if it's touch
11:48 - if then it's touching the star
11:56 - then it will change score
12:00 - by one
12:04 - now broadcast
12:07 - and weight check score
12:19 - and then when i receive check score
12:25 - i'll play sound
12:27 - [Music]
12:29 - a magic spell so we don't have magic
12:31 - spell here
12:37 - magic spell and i'll play magic spell
12:42 - until done and then also when i receive
12:45 - check score
12:47 - it will if the score equals 10 then you
12:49 - win so if then
12:54 - score equals 10 so 10 10
12:57 - 10 look at the score score equals 10
13:02 - broadcast you win
13:12 - so we decided to put it in two different
13:14 - ones because we didn't want this one to
13:16 - block this one
13:18 - so i'm gonna finish this code
13:21 - so when i receive octopus dying
13:24 - then i'll go to
13:28 - x zero y zero
13:34 - i'll repeat 10 times
13:38 - and we'll change ghost effect
13:43 - change ghost effect
13:47 - but you know hide
13:56 - oh
13:57 - [Music]
13:59 - so and then we need to stop other
14:01 - scripts from the sprite
14:04 - [Music]
14:06 - and broadcast so we have something else
14:09 - to do
14:10 - so we can we can take away the graphic
14:13 - effects in the beginning
14:15 - by adding
14:17 - [Music]
14:18 - change graphic effect clear all graphic
14:21 - effects
14:23 - and let's go to the star so we're going
14:26 - to start next
14:28 - so we have the octopus right here so we
14:30 - gotta make it rotation style
14:31 - left right
14:36 - and then the star when the green flag is
14:39 - clicked
14:40 - it'll go forever
14:44 - [Music]
14:45 - and it'll glide one second
14:48 - to a random position you know when i
14:51 - receive green when the green flag is
14:53 - not when i receive green flag but when
14:56 - the green flag is clicked
14:58 - it'll go forever and then turn
15:02 - 15 degrees so keep on rotating
15:06 - so kamala had that addition so we also
15:09 - add that
15:10 - addition so that's great
15:13 - and so let's also work on that you lose
15:15 - right there's a little bit of code too
15:18 - so when the green flag is clicked it
15:20 - will go to
15:22 - x0y0 and hide
15:27 - in the beginning because you didn't win
15:29 - or lose in the beginning and then when i
15:31 - receive
15:34 - you win the no switch costume
15:40 - to costume one and it will show
15:46 - and stop all i had to duplicate this and
15:50 - just change a little bit more
15:52 - so lose search costume in the costume
15:54 - two
15:55 - and also stumble let's try it out
15:59 - so we didn't add the music yet but we
16:01 - can add that in a second
16:02 - let's just do the music right now right
16:06 - now
16:06 - and when the green flag is clicked it
16:09 - will go forever
16:11 - and play so kamala use the drum
16:14 - sound which is i think is a good sound
16:17 - too
16:20 - so you'll place down drum until done
16:23 - and then when i receive blues
16:28 - then it will stop other scripts in this
16:30 - sprite
16:34 - so meaning that will stop the drum sound
16:36 - because you're lost
16:37 - will stop other scripts in this sprite
16:41 - and then play sound lose until done
16:47 - because you lost you'll stop the drum
16:48 - sound or else it'll be a happy two while
16:50 - you lose
16:52 - which is pretty weird
16:57 - and let's try it out as you can see it's
16:59 - working
17:00 - well i'm losing lives
17:06 - so we will add the point in direction
17:08 - because the octopus was going
17:09 - weirdly so let's go point in direction
17:16 - 90.
17:22 - and then we just have to put this point
17:24 - in direction negative 90
17:26 - [Music]
17:30 - there
17:33 - so this i'm going to put this right on
17:35 - top
17:36 - so i'm going to put this right on top so
17:38 - you can just make it negative 90 for
17:40 - right arrow
17:41 - because it acts still a little bit funky
17:43 - and left arrow it's negative and you see
17:45 - like a
17:46 - point in the other direction or you can
17:48 - do it my way
17:49 - and then go and um and
17:52 - do that and flip it horizontally
18:00 - [Music]
18:06 - so i'm going to show you guys how to win
18:09 - [Music]
18:11 - so i'm going to show you some code up
18:13 - here let's score
18:15 - the score equals two then
18:18 - so one
18:21 - two zero you win it works and make sure
18:24 - you start ten for now
18:26 - and i'm gonna show you the losing
18:30 - one
18:31 - [Music]
18:38 - fade away so yeah that's basically it
18:40 - for this video
18:42 - [Music]
18:43 - um i'm gonna move that right over there
18:47 - you can do that it's optional just to
18:48 - make it look better
18:50 - but that's like basically it for this
18:53 - video
18:54 - so please like share subscribe and
18:56 - comment in the comment section below for
18:57 - us to continue
18:58 - see you guys
19:10 - you

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's kids coding flake around here and today we're back for another video called the chase game today we'll be working on the chase game this is a featuring projects from kids like you series this game is submitted by camalo so thank you for your comment um we will we will do this tutorial because we are doing it right now so yeah thank you for your comment the chase game we'll be learning these following concepts in scratch variables loops broadcast messages control sprite with keys and sensing blocks so we do have a shout out on the next page so you might be one of them on the shout out and it's about our community post on um how on wednesday when we did the election community post type of thing so sorry and uh we will show you shout out here are some viewers would like to give a shout out to i am group nice team there ah great job that's correct joe biden will win yep you predicted correct cesaro legend so yeah he did win today um the great midas 21 hey us 2020 presidential result hope i got it right yeah you got it correct it's a adam smith thank you answers a bro yep good job and this is the community post we did d for me and also please give me a shout out in the video yeah we did give you a shout out but unfortunately that is incorrect but you were one of the most first ones to comment so great job answers a this dude i think either a 9 1944 jag tiger v and injured kumar where i think they were the first ones to come a so great job and um lastly johann harris wu so he picked d so that i think he's also one of the first ones because he's two days ago two days ago two days ago two days ago so we're all two days ago so i think he's also one of the first ones to do it and and great midas too and cesaro legend and i'm group wow all these are all two days ago and this one's two days ago so this is the original game by kamala so i'm we did we didn't with the octopus because we did it um we re we did it we remixed it last week but this one is the new form she has a bat right here and as you can see it's flying around we did add a wind so um yeah look i can kill myself so when you touch the edge you die so there is no winning unfortunately i don't think there is i think we added the winning oh yeah she still didn't have the wedding so you can see when you touch the stars you can get points and then you can't just stay on the star and get like infinite points it has like a small weight and when you touch the edge you can't just stay on the edge and you kept keep on losing lives you have to like um it has a weight before you die or lose lives or get score so that's also i also have a cool feature in kamala's uh project which is um this this is really cool so we have the octopus but this i like how kamala added um uh the mod so the mod is always going from costumes a to b to a to b to a to b so as you can see when i demoed it it went like bam bam bam bam bam bam and it kept on going up and forth and back and forth and back and forth and they didn't use these two but i got one at piece of advice stream i advise you to delete these two costumes because it will um you can just use next costume and you don't have to use mod so i mean mod is optional but you i in my opinion i think it's easier with just deleting c and d so i just started my new project untitled 31 so we have to change it to the chase game also you change the chase game i'm gonna teach you because i have two and um before i start please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below for else content you want so i think everything here is in the sprite library so if you want your project shout out shout out like camella then you can comment in the comment section below put your project linked and we might we might shout out and we might maybe make it into a tutorial so you guys can do that and and it has to be nice and simple and easy for the kids yeah you know so and also um you you can also go the comment in the community post you never know when you're gonna get a shout out too you never know so anyways let's get started so i already have in my backpack that you win and use lose sprite so the you win and you lose sprite is simple just paying a sprite saying you win you when you lose so as you can see kamala didn't have you when you lose so i decided to make a few wins to make the game more interesting so you can actually win in the game so i'm gonna go to the octopus so this is the octopus and we also need a backdrop we can put the backdrop as underwater one and canala also had that backdrop in the costumes of octopus we can delete all of these so in the in camala's game a long time ago when she still had she or he had still had the octopus uh um kamala did not use octopus a kamala used octopus b so i guess we will use octopus b as well so it's silly octopus d octopus e i've never seen an octopus play drums before and okay let's start so when the green flag is clicked so we can delete this we also need one more sprite the star and i literally forgot about that one star he also make it catch a starfish if you want because underwater themed so yeah so octopus when the green flag is clicked it will show you know switch backdrop to underwater one that's optional but you can do it so and i'm gonna make it go to the middle go to zero and point in direction nine day and then they'll set lives to five so you're gonna make a variable called lies and also we need forever first we have to make the variables lives so then set lives to five make another variable score set score to zero obvious and then go forever so uh you need to if then statement if then the up arrow then no change y by 10 and you just duplicate this to make the down arrow so simple easy down arrow negative 10 and also the left arrow and right here so you can just duplicate this but you have to change it to x instead so right arrow change x by 10 and you duplicate it and then change left arrow and change x by negative 10. so um i'm going to demo the game so as you can see we can move with the octopus that's all we have right now because we just all we did was code this we didn't code them losing lives because we have a lot to code and when the green flag is clicked then it'll go forever and then if then statement if then the edge they'll lose lives uh as you can see in kamala's project when it touches the edge it loses lots which is really creative in my opinion so this is a creative way to lose lives i'm touching the edge then it'll change lives by minus one and then if on edge bounce and then yeah if then statement if then the lives equal to zero that's when it runs out of lives the lives equals zero lives equals zero or zero or or the lives are less than zero then it will broadcast octopus dying so and wait always get that messed up so losing an octopus dying is different because kamala when whenever you die for the octopus it used to um be it used to be um fading away as a ghost effect so so yeah so we have to make a different broadcast or else it will not do the fade effect so yeah so we have to move this inside here and we need to wait one second right here so we're done with this script of code so and then we need when a green flag clicked forever if it's touch if then it's touching the star then it will change score by one now broadcast and weight check score and then when i receive check score i'll play sound a magic spell so we don't have magic spell here magic spell and i'll play magic spell until done and then also when i receive check score it will if the score equals 10 then you win so if then score equals 10 so 10 10 10 look at the score score equals 10 broadcast you win so we decided to put it in two different ones because we didn't want this one to block this one so i'm gonna finish this code so when i receive octopus dying then i'll go to x zero y zero i'll repeat 10 times and we'll change ghost effect change ghost effect but you know hide oh so and then we need to stop other scripts from the sprite and broadcast so we have something else to do so we can we can take away the graphic effects in the beginning by adding change graphic effect clear all graphic effects and let's go to the star so we're going to start next so we have the octopus right here so we gotta make it rotation style left right and then the star when the green flag is clicked it'll go forever and it'll glide one second to a random position you know when i receive green when the green flag is not when i receive green flag but when the green flag is clicked it'll go forever and then turn 15 degrees so keep on rotating so kamala had that addition so we also add that addition so that's great and so let's also work on that you lose right there's a little bit of code too so when the green flag is clicked it will go to x0y0 and hide in the beginning because you didn't win or lose in the beginning and then when i receive you win the no switch costume to costume one and it will show and stop all i had to duplicate this and just change a little bit more so lose search costume in the costume two and also stumble let's try it out so we didn't add the music yet but we can add that in a second let's just do the music right now right now and when the green flag is clicked it will go forever and play so kamala use the drum sound which is i think is a good sound too so you'll place down drum until done and then when i receive blues then it will stop other scripts in this sprite so meaning that will stop the drum sound because you're lost will stop other scripts in this sprite and then play sound lose until done because you lost you'll stop the drum sound or else it'll be a happy two while you lose which is pretty weird and let's try it out as you can see it's working well i'm losing lives so we will add the point in direction because the octopus was going weirdly so let's go point in direction 90. and then we just have to put this point in direction negative 90 there so this i'm going to put this right on top so i'm going to put this right on top so you can just make it negative 90 for right arrow because it acts still a little bit funky and left arrow it's negative and you see like a point in the other direction or you can do it my way and then go and um and do that and flip it horizontally so i'm going to show you guys how to win so i'm going to show you some code up here let's score the score equals two then so one two zero you win it works and make sure you start ten for now and i'm gonna show you the losing one fade away so yeah that's basically it for this video um i'm gonna move that right over there you can do that it's optional just to make it look better but that's like basically it for this video so please
