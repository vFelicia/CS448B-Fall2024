00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:09 - kids coding Clara today we'll be doing
00:11 - the seventh part for the two fighter
00:13 - fighting game so we will be working on
00:17 - the force field today and the other
00:21 - platform and the magic gem so today we
00:27 - just got a new monitor but our wireless
00:31 - keyboard is not working so this is a new
00:33 - monitor or get getting used to it so
00:36 - let's make three variables to start with
00:40 - one call it the force field go to go to
00:46 - I think I suppose feels wrong feel okay
00:55 - force field go to we can just uncheck it
00:59 - get force field status take that out and
01:16 - the timer timer so now we have three
01:23 - variables let's get on to the code so
01:28 - for player one for the jump control
01:32 - we're gonna have to get to the color of
01:37 - the platform so let's switch the
01:39 - platform to the costume two real quick
01:43 - so I can actually get the color so for
01:47 - this one you're gonna get or so we can
01:50 - so if it's touching either this cream
01:53 - color or the dark blue color just
01:58 - duplicate this and I will just select it
02:02 - get the middle middle section that part
02:07 - that's the color so color 52 saturation
02:11 - 51 and 34 brightness
02:13 - so I'm gonna put this in here so that
02:18 - now the ground will actually stop the
02:21 - person so this makes it allowed to jump
02:27 - I said it wrong sorry so this allows it
02:29 - to jump when it's touching this color
02:31 - and now we're gonna actually add some
02:35 - more for the jumping if it's touching
02:38 - either of those colors let's get another
02:40 - or so let's put this just right here put
02:47 - the or put that right here and so if
02:53 - it's this is duplicate this duplicate
02:57 - this and if it's touching either the
03:02 - first layer of the blue so that color or
03:07 - which is 52 color 50 saturation 41
03:12 - brightness or the center color like that
03:16 - one which is 34 brightness 51 saturation
03:21 - 52 color then it will run all this so we
03:26 - will need to add this this is for the
03:29 - jumping so now for the next one we're
03:33 - gonna do some more for that so for the
03:36 - simulated gravity this one's going to
03:39 - stop the player so we gotta get an or
03:43 - I'm gonna do it out here so I can
03:45 - duplicate it later so if it's touching
03:47 - either at this color or the middle color
03:54 - this color then you do this put that
04:01 - back in there
04:01 - and we can add this just duplicate it
04:08 - you can or so if it's touching either
04:12 - the brown color we have to add the dark
04:15 - brown color this one is blue so actually
04:19 - you have to change this one to the brown
04:20 - color it's dark brown color
04:25 - so we put that right there and now we
04:29 - just duplicate this and put it instead
04:33 - of this just put this right here
04:36 - duplicate it again take this out you can
04:39 - delete these put this in here and then
04:45 - we duplicate this take out this and put
04:51 - this in so next we're going to work on
04:55 - the Jenna we're gonna add some more code
04:57 - for the gym today so we're gonna get a
05:02 - one flat clicked we're gonna set our
05:06 - variable we're gonna set our variable
05:10 - force field go to so this is a set which
05:12 - character goes to but in the beginning
05:14 - we wanted to set it's a blank because no
05:17 - character is chosen yet so we want to go
05:20 - to front layer go to 85 X 130 why it
05:28 - could be anything but I'm just gonna do
05:31 - this so it'll be somewhere like up here
05:35 - 85 X 130 Y and high and then we're gonna
05:45 - get a nother so when it's start game so
05:51 - just right here instead of one flat
05:53 - clicks we're gonna get a one start game
05:55 - start game we don't need the score
06:00 - variable we remember we had to we did
06:03 - the simple platformer that's why we
06:06 - still have the score variable so and
06:09 - when we start game we want to show show
06:12 - the magic gym for add or change the
06:15 - color effects take this out so if no
06:20 - more treasure hunter so so if it's
06:22 - touching either this we're gonna just
06:28 - change it so if it's touching either
06:30 - player one use player one or player two
06:37 - and in here then we can move this all
06:42 - out I'm gonna if-else statement so if
06:47 - this is touching if this is touching the
06:51 - player 1 if it's stretching Claire 1
06:55 - then you can set the force field go to 2
06:58 - player 1 so the force field will go to
07:01 - player 1 force fields go to 2 player 1
07:07 - player 1 duplicate this else it will
07:11 - force field go to 2 player 2 if it is
07:19 - and you have to match the name of the
07:24 - sprite or what work so - player 2 so if
07:27 - yours isn't name something else then you
07:29 - can make if that name so now we can just
07:33 - pretty much at this down here place our
07:36 - fairy dust then you put the hide and we
07:41 - will save for the rent random position
07:42 - for later so just keep that right there
07:44 - so we can broadcast a message broadcast
07:49 - a message called force field activating
07:58 - force field activated so when I receive
08:03 - force field activated we'll need that
08:06 - later actually we will do that later so
08:10 - next we're gonna work on the force field
08:15 - so I had it in my backpack so I pretty
08:18 - much just drew a oval oval shaped thing
08:23 - with a blue color so you could just put
08:25 - like an outline - for with like a blue
08:28 - color inside just a light blue color so
08:31 - I can just show you that's how it looks
08:34 - like so I made the outline 10 and the
08:41 - fill this color and outline this color
08:46 - so outline is gonna be 58 color 67
08:50 - 100 brightness the fills can be 58 color
08:54 - 15 saturation and hundred brightness of
08:57 - course you make it any color you want
08:58 - but we just made it this color
09:00 - so when flak lights set the force field
09:04 - status force field status to off because
09:12 - in the beginning the force field will be
09:14 - off so in the beginning we can hide this
09:19 - and then when I receive start game hide
09:22 - in the beginning start game you hide
09:26 - hide right here so next you want to get
09:31 - the when I receive force field is
09:33 - activated force field activated then get
09:38 - an if-then statement so if if not force
09:48 - field and status is equal to on so if
09:52 - not force field status is equal to on so
09:59 - if it's not on then set the force field
10:02 - timer to 10 so we may enforce real timer
10:07 - variables so this is just to make the
10:11 - how long the force field lasts for so
10:15 - we're gonna make it last for 10 seconds
10:17 - so then you can broadcast a message
10:19 - under it call start timer start timer
10:27 - start timer so next we want to grab a
10:31 - show
10:37 - we wanted to go to the front layer in
10:39 - front of the character so next we want
10:44 - to set the ghost effect to 50% to make
10:46 - it a little bit more visit visible so it
10:50 - looks a bit better it's like the ghost
10:52 - effect and get a forever loop forever
11:00 - just put it under here forever if the
11:06 - forcefield timer is greater than zero so
11:10 - anywhere greater than zero forcefield
11:14 - timer is greater than zero so you set
11:20 - the forcefield go to to the player so as
11:24 - you can see when you go to the magic gem
11:26 - we set the forcefield go to the player 1
11:29 - and player 2 so that means I'll go to
11:31 - either player 1 or player 2 so next you
11:36 - want to get a start timer so when I
11:41 - receive the start time nerve message
11:44 - when I receive a start timer start timer
11:49 - right then when I receive start timer
11:53 - then you set the forcefield status on
11:55 - because there's forcefield in progress
11:59 - force field status to on and next we can
12:05 - get repeat the forcefield timer so it
12:09 - will repeat 10 times repeat forcefield
12:13 - timer times and then we can get a 1 wait
12:19 - one second change the forcefield timer
12:24 - by negative one so it'll count 10
12:28 - seconds the forcefield
12:30 - timer by negative 1
12:35 - and next we can set the forcefield
12:39 - status to off after it's over fortunate
12:43 - status it's off and next we can set the
12:48 - forcefield go to to blank forcefield go
12:54 - to because no one has the force field
12:56 - anymore
12:58 - so next let's hide hide the force field
13:02 - once it's over and we can stop other
13:05 - scripts in the stripe stop other scripts
13:10 - in the sprite and we can broadcast a
13:13 - message about display Jim again
13:15 - so the Jim will receive this and will
13:17 - come back so just play them again just
13:24 - like Jim again so go back to the gem so
13:31 - when I receive display gem again then we
13:36 - can get an if-then statement if the
13:40 - force field status is equal to off if
13:44 - the force field status is equal to off
13:51 - then we can wait pick random three to
13:55 - five seconds just give it a little pause
13:58 - between three to five seconds and then
14:04 - we can ran a position next we want to
14:08 - get when I receive Start screen start
14:14 - screaming then we can hide make sure you
14:23 - did this when I receive Start screen in
14:25 - the force field because I forgot to add
14:28 - it so make sure to add it here so
14:32 - finally we have one last step we have to
14:34 - do so go to player one so where the
14:38 - player gets attacked
14:40 - so when p1 gets hit when you find it I
14:45 - think it might be on this side
14:51 - let me just find it right here
14:56 - fine fine so now you want to get a knot
14:59 - so this is to detect so you get it and
15:04 - so this is the force field for the force
15:06 - field so I won't take any damage not not
15:13 - equal to force field go to is equal to
15:19 - player one force field go to is equal to
15:23 - player one
15:30 - so basically when the player doesn't
15:33 - have the force field it will do this and
15:37 - we can just duplicate this or the other
15:41 - sprite instead of if to change it to
15:44 - player two just drag and drop it in here
15:54 - so P 2 cup got hit right here
15:57 - let's get them and put that right here
16:03 - track this right here instead of player
16:08 - one we do player two and we forgot the
16:13 - knot so let's put this right here put
16:19 - that in here so let me play it
16:22 - [Music]
16:40 - [Music]
16:46 - so so let's I'll show you guys the other
16:51 - map I think we forgot to add the colors
17:00 - for this one too so we can just add them
17:04 - real quick
17:20 - just add it real quick and that's it for
17:25 - their we're right here you have to do so
17:33 - let's finish it up real quick get the or
17:35 - put this in touching color live to do
17:40 - the this color and then just copy just
17:50 - an another or duplicate this get the
17:59 - brown color the dark brown color put
18:06 - that in here take this out duplicate it
18:12 - get it or I just duplicate the top one
18:16 - I'm sure it is the color gun take the or
18:26 - you can duplicate this whole chunk take
18:31 - out this throw it away and then the
18:34 - bottom here duplicate the color this
18:41 - thing and take that thing out we could
18:44 - delete that okay you just take this out
18:49 - so I can delete it okay so now let's
18:53 - play it and one last thing for the
19:00 - jumping you have to add this can or
19:05 - let's get two of these put them right
19:08 - here and for this one you got to get the
19:13 - balloon color and for this one get like
19:20 - the top color so now you have the two
19:25 - colors I think that's it
19:28 - [Music]
19:42 - [Music]
19:50 - so now now I'm also going to test the
19:55 - player one forcefield if it works pretty
19:59 - sure it'll work that's pretty much it so
20:17 - thank you guys for watching please like
20:19 - share and subscribe and I'll see you
20:23 - guys in the next video
20:25 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding Clara today we'll be doing the seventh part for the two fighter fighting game so we will be working on the force field today and the other platform and the magic gem so today we just got a new monitor but our wireless keyboard is not working so this is a new monitor or get getting used to it so let's make three variables to start with one call it the force field go to go to I think I suppose feels wrong feel okay force field go to we can just uncheck it get force field status take that out and the timer timer so now we have three variables let's get on to the code so for player one for the jump control we're gonna have to get to the color of the platform so let's switch the platform to the costume two real quick so I can actually get the color so for this one you're gonna get or so we can so if it's touching either this cream color or the dark blue color just duplicate this and I will just select it get the middle middle section that part that's the color so color 52 saturation 51 and 34 brightness so I'm gonna put this in here so that now the ground will actually stop the person so this makes it allowed to jump I said it wrong sorry so this allows it to jump when it's touching this color and now we're gonna actually add some more for the jumping if it's touching either of those colors let's get another or so let's put this just right here put the or put that right here and so if it's this is duplicate this duplicate this and if it's touching either the first layer of the blue so that color or which is 52 color 50 saturation 41 brightness or the center color like that one which is 34 brightness 51 saturation 52 color then it will run all this so we will need to add this this is for the jumping so now for the next one we're gonna do some more for that so for the simulated gravity this one's going to stop the player so we gotta get an or I'm gonna do it out here so I can duplicate it later so if it's touching either at this color or the middle color this color then you do this put that back in there and we can add this just duplicate it you can or so if it's touching either the brown color we have to add the dark brown color this one is blue so actually you have to change this one to the brown color it's dark brown color so we put that right there and now we just duplicate this and put it instead of this just put this right here duplicate it again take this out you can delete these put this in here and then we duplicate this take out this and put this in so next we're going to work on the Jenna we're gonna add some more code for the gym today so we're gonna get a one flat clicked we're gonna set our variable we're gonna set our variable force field go to so this is a set which character goes to but in the beginning we wanted to set it's a blank because no character is chosen yet so we want to go to front layer go to 85 X 130 why it could be anything but I'm just gonna do this so it'll be somewhere like up here 85 X 130 Y and high and then we're gonna get a nother so when it's start game so just right here instead of one flat clicks we're gonna get a one start game start game we don't need the score variable we remember we had to we did the simple platformer that's why we still have the score variable so and when we start game we want to show show the magic gym for add or change the color effects take this out so if no more treasure hunter so so if it's touching either this we're gonna just change it so if it's touching either player one use player one or player two and in here then we can move this all out I'm gonna ifelse statement so if this is touching if this is touching the player 1 if it's stretching Claire 1 then you can set the force field go to 2 player 1 so the force field will go to player 1 force fields go to 2 player 1 player 1 duplicate this else it will force field go to 2 player 2 if it is and you have to match the name of the sprite or what work so player 2 so if yours isn't name something else then you can make if that name so now we can just pretty much at this down here place our fairy dust then you put the hide and we will save for the rent random position for later so just keep that right there so we can broadcast a message broadcast a message called force field activating force field activated so when I receive force field activated we'll need that later actually we will do that later so next we're gonna work on the force field so I had it in my backpack so I pretty much just drew a oval oval shaped thing with a blue color so you could just put like an outline for with like a blue color inside just a light blue color so I can just show you that's how it looks like so I made the outline 10 and the fill this color and outline this color so outline is gonna be 58 color 67 100 brightness the fills can be 58 color 15 saturation and hundred brightness of course you make it any color you want but we just made it this color so when flak lights set the force field status force field status to off because in the beginning the force field will be off so in the beginning we can hide this and then when I receive start game hide in the beginning start game you hide hide right here so next you want to get the when I receive force field is activated force field activated then get an ifthen statement so if if not force field and status is equal to on so if not force field status is equal to on so if it's not on then set the force field timer to 10 so we may enforce real timer variables so this is just to make the how long the force field lasts for so we're gonna make it last for 10 seconds so then you can broadcast a message under it call start timer start timer start timer so next we want to grab a show we wanted to go to the front layer in front of the character so next we want to set the ghost effect to 50% to make it a little bit more visit visible so it looks a bit better it's like the ghost effect and get a forever loop forever just put it under here forever if the forcefield timer is greater than zero so anywhere greater than zero forcefield timer is greater than zero so you set the forcefield go to to the player so as you can see when you go to the magic gem we set the forcefield go to the player 1 and player 2 so that means I'll go to either player 1 or player 2 so next you want to get a start timer so when I receive the start time nerve message when I receive a start timer start timer right then when I receive start timer then you set the forcefield status on because there's forcefield in progress force field status to on and next we can get repeat the forcefield timer so it will repeat 10 times repeat forcefield timer times and then we can get a 1 wait one second change the forcefield timer by negative one so it'll count 10 seconds the forcefield timer by negative 1 and next we can set the forcefield status to off after it's over fortunate status it's off and next we can set the forcefield go to to blank forcefield go to because no one has the force field anymore so next let's hide hide the force field once it's over and we can stop other scripts in the stripe stop other scripts in the sprite and we can broadcast a message about display Jim again so the Jim will receive this and will come back so just play them again just like Jim again so go back to the gem so when I receive display gem again then we can get an ifthen statement if the force field status is equal to off if the force field status is equal to off then we can wait pick random three to five seconds just give it a little pause between three to five seconds and then we can ran a position next we want to get when I receive Start screen start screaming then we can hide make sure you did this when I receive Start screen in the force field because I forgot to add it so make sure to add it here so finally we have one last step we have to do so go to player one so where the player gets attacked so when p1 gets hit when you find it I think it might be on this side let me just find it right here fine fine so now you want to get a knot so this is to detect so you get it and so this is the force field for the force field so I won't take any damage not not equal to force field go to is equal to player one force field go to is equal to player one so basically when the player doesn't have the force field it will do this and we can just duplicate this or the other sprite instead of if to change it to player two just drag and drop it in here so P 2 cup got hit right here let's get them and put that right here track this right here instead of player one we do player two and we forgot the knot so let's put this right here put that in here so let me play it so so let's I'll show you guys the other map I think we forgot to add the colors for this one too so we can just add them real quick just add it real quick and that's it for their we're right here you have to do so let's finish it up real quick get the or put this in touching color live to do the this color and then just copy just an another or duplicate this get the brown color the dark brown color put that in here take this out duplicate it get it or I just duplicate the top one I'm sure it is the color gun take the or you can duplicate this whole chunk take out this throw it away and then the bottom here duplicate the color this thing and take that thing out we could delete that okay you just take this out so I can delete it okay so now let's play it and one last thing for the jumping you have to add this can or let's get two of these put them right here and for this one you got to get the balloon color and for this one get like the top color so now you have the two colors I think that's it so now now I'm also going to test the player one forcefield if it works pretty sure it'll work that's pretty much it so thank you guys for watching please like share and subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next video
