00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys it's kids coding
00:08 - playground here today we'll be doing a
00:10 - video on tmc's if you're paying
00:12 - attention on youtube you might know what
00:14 - team c's is because like literally every
00:16 - single youtuber has made a video about
00:18 - team seas it's basically a thing where
00:20 - mr beast
00:22 - every dollar donate you get one pound of
00:24 - trash removed from the ocean
00:26 - so for this video in the next 24 hours
00:28 - the amount of likes we get is the amount
00:31 - of money we donate to team sees so you
00:32 - better like this video if you want to
00:34 - see more money donated every single like
00:37 - on this video in 24 hours equals one
00:41 - dollar
00:42 - for every single like in uh the next 24
00:45 - hours on this video so be sure to smash
00:48 - that like button yeah yeah so and then
00:51 - uh we will be also
00:53 - um showing a game for team seas we made
00:56 - a game for it um so i'll be showing you
00:58 - guys um the demonstration of the game so
01:01 - right now we have the team c's trash
01:03 - collector
01:04 - and then so let's go to full screen
01:08 - and then
01:09 - uh you just move around you press
01:11 - spacebar you grab the trash when you
01:14 - grab it it increases your pounds of
01:16 - trash
01:18 - as you can see grab all that
01:22 - so yeah that's pretty much it
01:23 - it's pretty simple
01:25 - but it's kind of like a
01:27 - tmc's gamer just collect trash
01:29 - yeah so a game on team trees not team c
01:33 - sorry
01:34 - okay so now let's hop into the project
01:38 - okay so let's hop right into this
01:39 - tutorial so i just started a new project
01:42 - and let's rename the project we're going
01:44 - to name it uh
01:46 - tmc's
01:47 - tmc's ah trash collector game
01:52 - collector uh and then we're going to
01:56 - uh delete the scratch cap we're going to
01:58 - get some sprites from what we had before
02:00 - we have the tmc's like the trash
02:02 - collector with the boat
02:04 - and then with the net that shoots
02:06 - out the garbage
02:11 - oh there it is
02:12 - and then we have the ocean
02:14 - is the scrolling background
02:16 - and then we can also put the ocean in
02:18 - here
02:19 - so we're also going to use the same
02:20 - ocean thing for the background so let's
02:22 - sometimes when you're scrolling you see
02:24 - this like white area so we don't want
02:26 - that so we're also going to put the
02:27 - ocean for the background so i'm going to
02:29 - show you how we draw it so i'm going to
02:32 - create a new
02:33 - costume so i'm going to just like this
02:36 - and delete it so what we do is get the
02:39 - um
02:40 - so we're going to get the uh backdrop
02:43 - from it's called city with
02:45 - water yeah this one so basically we're
02:48 - only gonna need this water down here so
02:50 - we're going to convert to bitmap so keep
02:52 - yourself on bitmap
02:53 - and we're just going to cut a small
02:55 - chunk of it out ctrl c
02:57 - ctrl v as you can see
02:59 - you split vertical because the dark area
03:01 - looks really ugly with the light area so
03:04 - if you flip it
03:06 - so
03:07 - let's
03:08 - say if you like click it and then you
03:10 - flip it it will look really ugly because
03:12 - like there's the dark and light together
03:13 - it doesn't look good
03:15 - so what you do is just keep on
03:17 - control c control v copying like the
03:20 - light area
03:21 - and just copy paste and stack them on
03:23 - top of each other
03:25 - as you can see
03:26 - okay
03:27 - so it'll look something like that
03:30 - so what i do is like i only get the
03:31 - light part i'm gonna get all of that and
03:34 - then paste it to the right side where
03:35 - it's a little bit darker
03:38 - so it looks a little bit better
03:42 - yeah so kind of like that so you get the
03:45 - idea of how to do it
03:46 - it's not perfect obviously you can
03:48 - perfect it however you want
03:50 - um just copy this into the other
03:53 - backdrop okay so that's how you do it
03:55 - um but we have this in our
03:58 - google drive if you would like to
03:59 - download it or you can just export it
04:01 - straight from this project in the link
04:03 - in the description
04:05 - we need both the ocean and the backdrop
04:07 - since we're going to be doing the
04:09 - scrolling with the
04:11 - ocean so we're going to have to
04:13 - use both of them and it's just the same
04:15 - thing on both things
04:17 - okay so now let's go to the boats i'll
04:19 - show you how to draw this one as well so
04:21 - here we have the boat
04:23 - my dad drew this boat actually so i'm
04:25 - going to try to draw it but i'm not that
04:27 - good at drawing i'll try to do it as
04:29 - best as i can
04:30 - so first i'm going to show you what's
04:32 - inside the boat so we're going to
04:34 - ungroup everything first we have the
04:36 - white part this is like part of the boat
04:37 - and this blue part is the back
04:39 - just like the tail of the boat oops and
04:42 - then here we have the two like this is
04:45 - like the top of the boat
04:47 - and then right here we have the
04:49 - blue part which is the glass and the
04:51 - black part is basically a smaller
04:52 - version of the white part but it's just
04:54 - all black and then we have the blue part
04:57 - which represents the glass
04:59 - of the boat and the lines are just like
05:01 - i don't know like you know how boats
05:03 - have that little line thing
05:05 - i'll just put in i'll just put an image
05:06 - right here to show you
05:08 - uh
05:09 - so yes basically what it is
05:13 - so for this you have to like be sure
05:16 - what layers your like drawings are on
05:19 - they can be in the back or the front
05:20 - layer you need them in either the back
05:22 - or front layer so i'm going to be
05:24 - drawing it but i'm going to like speed
05:26 - it up a little bit with the time lapse
05:28 - so we can save you guys a little bit of
05:30 - time
05:39 - okay so we're going to draw
05:41 - our uh boat now i'm going to time-lapse
05:43 - it like i said before
05:45 - um save you guys a little bit of time
05:46 - but this is how it looks like i'm going
05:48 - to try to draw as best as i can
06:01 - [Music]
06:13 - [Music]
06:37 - [Music]
06:44 - [Music]
06:56 - [Music]
07:04 - [Music]
07:15 - [Music]
07:28 - [Music]
07:35 - [Music]
07:45 - [Music]
07:49 - okay so now i just finished
07:52 - i don't think it's as good as the
07:53 - original one as you can see right here
07:55 - uh so now we're gonna just rotate the
07:57 - boat to the right side so i'm going to
07:59 - select the whole thing
08:00 - and i'm just going to get the flip uh
08:03 - i'm going to group it and then flip
08:05 - horizontal so then it goes to the other
08:06 - side
08:07 - okay so yeah that's pretty much it
08:09 - that's how you draw it
08:10 - that that's just like a fast time lapse
08:13 - of how you draw it
08:14 - okay so now let's go to the net how to
08:16 - draw the net
08:18 - so basically for the net it's just like
08:20 - a giant circle
08:21 - right here and then we reshape it and
08:23 - drag it out and then we just draw some
08:25 - lines
08:26 - see the lines
08:28 - there's just some lines we reshape the
08:29 - lines as well and then one longer line
08:31 - some thicker line right here and then we
08:33 - just make a bunch of costumes and then
08:35 - we make it further each time so let's
08:37 - zoom out a little bit
08:39 - so as you can see it goes a little bit
08:41 - further each time each costume you go it
08:44 - goes a little further so that's
08:45 - basically how you do it and there's
08:47 - eight costumes we have
08:48 - so that's pretty much how you draw it
08:50 - you can just get it from our google
08:51 - drive or export it just from here and
08:53 - our trash is basically just like some
08:56 - just like different assortment of trash
08:58 - like bags cans bottles
09:01 - we drew this in our like earth game or
09:03 - save the earth game
09:04 - um here we have the plastic rings it's
09:06 - just some clear um some open circles
09:09 - some white open circles and then here
09:11 - just fill it up right here
09:13 - with like a closed circle with a colored
09:15 - one so yeah that's pretty much how you
09:16 - draw it and these bottles cans and bags
09:18 - we just got from online we did not draw
09:20 - it
09:21 - okay so enough with the drawing so now
09:22 - let's get to the coding
09:24 - all right so now let's go delete this
09:27 - and then let's go
09:28 - all right so inside the code we are
09:30 - going to inside the team sees boat we're
09:32 - going to get a one green flag plates
09:34 - let's zoom in all right so when
09:35 - preflight clicked we're going to go to
09:38 - uh negative 125
09:41 - and then for y position negative 50 and
09:43 - then point direction of 90
09:47 - so it's pointing to the right side and
09:48 - then we're going to get a forever loop
09:52 - and then we're going to go to the front
09:53 - layer so we want the boat to be in the
09:55 - front layer so we're going to make it go
09:56 - to the front
09:57 - and then if on edge bounce we don't want
09:59 - it to go off the screen so we're just
10:01 - going to do bounce so it stays on the
10:03 - screen
10:04 - um and then we're going to get a if then
10:07 - statement
10:10 - and then we're going to get if up arrow
10:12 - is pressed so if the key up
10:14 - is pressed
10:16 - then we're going to change the y by 10.
10:19 - we'll come back to the boat after to
10:21 - code some other stuff
10:22 - for some other like
10:24 - casting the net and collecting trash
10:27 - but um we will change it we'll do it
10:29 - afterwards and also with the select this
10:31 - one i forgot to tell you that um because
10:34 - we don't want the boat to rotate upside
10:35 - down
10:37 - so
10:37 - if you just like do this that means you
10:39 - can rotate the boat all around so we
10:41 - just want to select the middle thing so
10:43 - it doesn't rotate upside down when you
10:44 - move left and right okay
10:46 - and then we're going to duplicate this
10:48 - if the
10:50 - down arrows press
10:51 - then we're going to change the y by
10:52 - negative 10
10:54 - and then we can duplicate all this
10:57 - instead we're going to do x position now
10:58 - so the right arrows press we're going to
11:00 - change the x by 10
11:02 - and when the left arrow is oops left
11:04 - arrow is pressed
11:05 - we're going to change the x by negative
11:07 - 10. so
11:09 - there we have the simple movement of the
11:11 - boat
11:12 - and then we also have to change the
11:13 - point in direction of which side the
11:14 - boat is pointing towards so for right
11:17 - arrow we're going to put direction of 90
11:18 - which is facing the right side and left
11:20 - arrow is going to be negative 90.
11:23 - okay
11:25 - okay so now let's save the project
11:28 - run it so it's basically just
11:30 - you can move around the boat now
11:33 - okay so now we can just have the simple
11:34 - movement of the boat
11:36 - now let's go into the net so inside the
11:38 - net
11:40 - we are going to get a when we're going
11:42 - to make two variables inside the nets so
11:45 - one variable is going to be called
11:46 - casting the net
11:49 - all right so casting the net
11:51 - for all sprites
11:54 - casting the nets and the other variable
11:56 - will be called uh trash
11:59 - uh collecting so we can just name it
12:00 - trash collecting
12:03 - trash collecting so this is collecting
12:05 - the trash
12:07 - and we're gonna make another variable
12:09 - those are the two we will use for now
12:11 - but we'll make another one called pounds
12:12 - of trash this is basically a score it's
12:14 - just to calculate how many pounds of
12:16 - trash you have picked up
12:18 - and then finally we have the trash
12:19 - counter
12:21 - counter
12:22 - that's to keep track of how many pieces
12:24 - of trash are on the
12:26 - screen at once
12:27 - all right and then inside this net we
12:30 - are going to
12:31 - first let's just uncheck all these we'll
12:33 - keep the pounds of trash out oops
12:36 - kinds of trash is basically the score
12:37 - we'll keep that on now
12:39 - all right and then so inside here the
12:41 - net we are going to get a one group like
12:43 - plates
12:44 - when graphite is clicked we are going to
12:46 - set casting the net
12:48 - to no which is end casting the net to no
12:51 - so the beginning you're not casting a
12:52 - net
12:53 - and we're gonna hide
12:56 - and then forever
12:58 - we're gonna use the space bar to release
12:59 - the net so if the key space is pressed
13:03 - we're gonna set casting the net to yes
13:05 - which is why
13:09 - and then we're going to point direction
13:11 - point direction so we have to pay
13:12 - attention right here so we use this
13:14 - thing
13:15 - you have to uh check this thing first so
13:17 - we're going to get this team seized boat
13:19 - select the tmc's boat first before we
13:20 - can do anything here we're gonna form
13:22 - direction of the direction of the team
13:24 - sees boat so now in the direction of
13:26 - this boat
13:27 - and we're gonna get if l statement so
13:29 - control
13:32 - if else
13:34 - if uh direction of team c's boat is
13:36 - greater than zero
13:39 - direction
13:41 - of the team sees quote you can just like
13:42 - duplicate this direction the team sees
13:44 - both is greater than zero
13:47 - we're gonna do zero so let's say the
13:49 - direction is pointing
13:50 - zero
13:51 - if it's greater than zero we're gonna
13:53 - put the net at least plus one hundred
13:55 - this way
13:56 - so zero would be about right here right
13:58 - so
13:59 - we're gonna do it this way we're gonna
14:01 - make a positive if it's greater than
14:03 - zero so we're gonna make it go to
14:08 - the duplicate this so we're gonna go to
14:10 - the x position of the team sees boat
14:13 - and then we're gonna get an addition
14:14 - sign we're gonna add 100
14:17 - so that net will go 100 uh like 100
14:21 - steps forward so just go 100 for
14:23 - so we're going to add 100 to this
14:27 - and then we're just going to get the
14:28 - same y position of the team c spoke
14:32 - y position does not change
14:34 - and let's just duplicate this else let's
14:36 - say you're pointing the other direction
14:38 - then we're going to change the x
14:39 - position by teams use both instead we're
14:41 - going to add negative 100 or you can
14:43 - just use that subtraction sign and minus
14:46 - 100 but for the simplicity we're just
14:48 - going to use keep the addition and just
14:49 - do adding negative 100
14:52 - and then
14:53 - next we're going to broadcast and wait
14:55 - for a
14:56 - message we're gonna broadcast and wait
14:59 - because
15:00 - we don't want like the boat to move
15:02 - around while we're throwing the net so
15:04 - we're gonna broadcast a message
15:06 - name it cast
15:08 - the net
15:10 - cast the net and then we're gonna set
15:11 - casting the net
15:13 - to no
15:17 - and then
15:18 - since we already uh
15:20 - set it to y up here as you can see yes
15:23 - when the space is pressed
15:24 - it's going to set it to yes and then
15:26 - after this action is finished we're
15:28 - going to set it back to no as you can
15:30 - see
15:31 - all right so that's pretty much it for
15:33 - this and then we're going to receive the
15:34 - message so
15:36 - when i receive the message casting the
15:38 - net then we're going to switch the
15:40 - costume to costume one which is the
15:41 - first costume
15:43 - so let's go to the costumes the first
15:45 - one
15:46 - and then we're going to go to the front
15:48 - layer
15:51 - and then we're going to go backward one
15:52 - layer so we want it to be on top of like
15:54 - the garbage but under the boat so that's
15:56 - what we want
15:58 - go backward one layer so we're just
15:59 - gonna do that
16:02 - and then we're gonna show
16:03 - show the net and then we're gonna repeat
16:06 - seven
16:06 - times because we're starting on the
16:09 - costume one so we only have to do seven
16:10 - times so we're gonna repeat seven times
16:13 - and then we're going to wait point one
16:15 - seconds
16:15 - [Music]
16:18 - and then we're gonna next costume
16:21 - if you just heard that fireworks is
16:22 - because like the default celebrations uh
16:25 - celebrations they're just like having
16:27 - fireworks outside
16:28 - just like ignore that for now
16:30 - and then uh
16:33 - wait 0.5
16:34 - seconds right here
16:37 - before sending it back so we're gonna
16:38 - wait five seconds
16:39 - make sure the costume is on costume rate
16:42 - we're gonna wait 45 seconds before
16:44 - bringing the net back we can just
16:45 - duplicate this
16:47 - and put it down here but instead we're
16:49 - gonna have to do something like
16:50 - subtraction so we're gonna instead of
16:52 - next costume we're gonna switch the
16:53 - costume
16:55 - to um
16:56 - costume number subtracted by one
16:58 - because we want to subtract
17:00 - one and go back to the first one so
17:02 - we're gonna subtract each one until we
17:04 - get back to the first costume
17:06 - subtraction so costume number
17:11 - costume number subtract by one
17:15 - okay move this over by a little bit so
17:16 - you can see and then we're going to wait
17:18 - 45 seconds and then hide the net again
17:22 - so let's zoom out i'll show you the code
17:24 - and then i'll demonstrate how it works
17:26 - all right
17:27 - so now we can move around you can see
17:29 - when you press the space bar the net
17:30 - goes out and comes back
17:33 - that goes out comes back
17:36 - obviously we have to make it like not
17:38 - move when you're throwing the net and we
17:41 - will work on that now so
17:44 - okay so now let's go back to the tmc's
17:46 - boat i told you guys we would go back
17:48 - here
17:49 - after we finished something so we're
17:50 - just gonna cut uh combine two and
17:53 - statements
17:54 - so the up arrow key is pressed and
17:57 - it's equal to uh
17:59 - the casting net is equal to no so
18:02 - we're only going to let it move if the
18:03 - casting net is equal to end
18:07 - casting the net
18:08 - to go to zero and and we're going to use
18:11 - another variable called uh collecting
18:13 - trash like i said earlier
18:15 - so we're going to
18:16 - uh and
18:18 - collecting
18:19 - uh trash collecting or whatever
18:21 - is equal to no so we'll use that later
18:23 - you don't have to worry about for now
18:24 - but just put it into the code
18:26 - and just duplicate this all
18:29 - and put this in here take this out
18:33 - put this in here
18:35 - duplicate this put this in here
18:38 - oops
18:40 - substitute that and put that in there
18:43 - duplicate one more time
18:45 - put that in here
18:46 - and switch this out okay
18:49 - so now we are finally done with that
18:52 - play it so now as you can see you cannot
18:54 - move
18:55 - if uh
18:58 - you cannot move if there is
19:01 - a net being cast so
19:05 - as you can see and we'll have to reset
19:07 - the casting net back to uh
19:12 - right now um you cannot move this yet
19:14 - because we have not set the variable
19:16 - trash collecting so now we are going to
19:17 - set up the variable trash collecting so
19:20 - then we can actually move the ship now
19:22 - okay so now we're going to go back to
19:24 - the we're going to get to the trash
19:25 - sprite so we're going to go with the
19:26 - trash
19:27 - inside the trash we're going to get a
19:29 - 135 clicked
19:31 - let's just zoom in
19:32 - when we fly click we're going to set the
19:35 - trash counter
19:38 - trash counter to zero and we're gonna
19:40 - set the pounds of trash
19:42 - to zero
19:44 - and we're gonna set the collecting to no
19:48 - trash can collecting to no so now it
19:51 - should work so let's try it out
19:53 - so as you can see when you throw the net
19:54 - you cannot move
19:56 - once the net is gone you can move freely
19:58 - again so there you go
20:00 - now it's working fine so now we have to
20:02 - finish the code for the trash
20:04 - so in the trash we're going to make it
20:05 - go to the front layer and then make it
20:07 - go backwards three layers so that it's
20:09 - behind the boat and the net it's going
20:11 - to make it go backwards three layer
20:14 - we want it in front of some layer but
20:16 - behind some other layers we want it in
20:17 - front of the ocean but we want it behind
20:19 - some other layers like the boat and the
20:21 - net
20:22 - and we're going to hide
20:26 - and forever loop
20:28 - uh waits
20:29 - one to three seconds so we're gonna wait
20:31 - i pick random one to three seconds
20:32 - before it starts spawning uh the trash
20:35 - so one two three and then we're going to
20:37 - put it as a max limit as four clones
20:41 - so sometimes it might go to four but
20:43 - it'll never go higher than four because
20:45 - sometimes the clothes generate too
20:46 - quickly
20:47 - but we're going to make it so it's less
20:49 - than four sometimes the fourth one can
20:52 - generate so trash
20:54 - uh counter
20:55 - is less than four
20:57 - and then we're going to wait 0.2 seconds
21:00 - we want to go to 0.2 seconds because we
21:02 - want variety
21:03 - inside so right now we have like six
21:05 - costumes you see so um if we don't wait
21:08 - then it won't there be like no variety
21:10 - in the trash now all look the same so
21:13 - that's why we need that and then we're
21:14 - gonna put a create a clone of myself
21:16 - after this
21:18 - and then up here when we start as a
21:19 - clone
21:20 - we are going to when we start this clone
21:23 - when i start as a clone
21:24 - we are going to change the trash counter
21:26 - by one
21:30 - change trash counter by one and then
21:32 - we're gonna go to okay so let's go to um
21:36 - negative 180 to 180 for the x position
21:44 - to 180 and then for the y we're going to
21:47 - go pick random
21:49 - negative 130 to 130.
21:54 - okay and then we're going to switch
21:57 - and i'm gonna put a pick random one to
21:59 - six
22:02 - and then we're gonna show
22:07 - and forever
22:10 - if
22:13 - it's touching the nets
22:18 - i'm touching the net then we're gonna
22:19 - set the collecting like the trash
22:21 - collecting
22:23 - charge collecting to yes
22:25 - when it's touching the net
22:26 - and then we're gonna wait two seconds
22:28 - and then we're gonna drag the trash back
22:31 - so we're going to point direction
22:35 - point in direction
22:38 - and then we're gonna get this uh block
22:40 - right here
22:41 - point direction and then we're gonna get
22:42 - the tmc's boat
22:44 - and we're gonna get the direction of
22:46 - that
22:47 - and we're gonna glide two seconds
22:51 - two seconds and then we're going to
22:53 - glide those wrong one glide two seconds
22:56 - to the tmc's uh boat
22:58 - right there and we're going to change
23:00 - the pounds of trash by pick random 10 to
23:02 - 30.
23:04 - change the
23:05 - pounds of trash
23:07 - 10 to 30.
23:09 - if you guys have no idea what pounds are
23:10 - because you are like from a different
23:12 - country that does not use pounds
23:15 - uh you can put kilograms of trash i
23:17 - don't know it's basically the same thing
23:20 - uh and then we're gonna set collecting
23:23 - trash collecting to know
23:25 - so after that
23:27 - after you bring it back it's gonna set
23:29 - it to no
23:30 - and then change
23:31 - the trash counter by negative one once
23:33 - you take one and change the trash can by
23:35 - negative one
23:36 - and then we're gonna delete this clone
23:38 - once it is all gone so
23:40 - right there
23:42 - as you can see that's all the code and
23:44 - let you just put it anything you missed
23:48 - and then finally we have the ocean so
23:51 - for the ocean we're going to make this
23:52 - backdrop so i've learned this tutorial
23:54 - from the scratch team so if you want to
23:56 - check out the original video you can
23:58 - check it out so i'm just going to give
23:59 - credit to them for uh showing me how to
24:02 - do this it's pretty cool
24:03 - so like we gotta get a one green five
24:05 - plates
24:08 - uh then we're gonna go to the back layer
24:11 - so we're gonna make like the ocean move
24:13 - so you can see like the water moving
24:16 - go to the back layer and then we're
24:17 - going to go to zero zero bring it into
24:18 - the origin of the screen
24:20 - zero zero
24:22 - and then we're gonna create a clone of
24:23 - myself
24:26 - and then we're gonna forever
24:29 - and then if x if else we're going to get
24:31 - if else so if else the exposition is
24:33 - greater than negative 1 450 negative 450
24:36 - is like somewhere right here so
24:38 - if this x is like greater than negative
24:41 - 450 so
24:43 - if it's greater than negative 450
24:47 - the x position is greater than negative
24:49 - 450
24:51 - we are going to change the x my negative
24:53 - one so it's gonna keep on sliding this
24:55 - way to the left
24:57 - i'm gonna change the x by negative one
25:02 - and then else we're going to go to
25:05 - 450
25:07 - and then we're going to get a zero
25:09 - so else is going to go to that position
25:11 - and then when i start as a clone the
25:13 - clone is pretty much the same thing
25:15 - when i start as a clone
25:17 - we can just
25:18 - duplicate this part except we can just
25:20 - remove some of this
25:22 - we do not need this and 450
25:25 - for that x and then we're going to make
25:26 - it to go to the back layer
25:29 - go to back layer
25:33 - right back layer and just keep all this
25:35 - all right
25:36 - so now the game is pretty much complete
25:40 - just wait for the trash to come out
25:42 - oh okay we need to make the trash
25:45 - maybe we can make the trash go
25:47 - four layers
25:49 - uh
25:50 - two layers backwards
25:52 - i don't remember the exact yeah now you
25:54 - can see there you go
25:57 - so you can see you can drag the trash in
25:59 - there you go 25 pounds of trash
26:02 - so now the game is working
26:03 - like
26:04 - it like we did before so
26:07 - sometimes um if you drag it from the end
26:09 - it'll have like a little bit delay
26:11 - but
26:12 - it's okay
26:13 - it looks fine
26:15 - yes so now we're finished with our game
26:18 - and it's working perfectly fine
26:20 - so that is pretty much for today's video
26:25 - okay so that's pretty much it for the
26:26 - video if you want to check out more
26:28 - information about team c's it's in the
26:30 - description below teamses.org if you
26:32 - want to donate money to tmc's for saving
26:34 - the environment and stuff like that it's
26:36 - also going to be the link in the
26:37 - description
26:38 - um
26:40 - yeah so that's pretty much it like we
26:42 - mentioned in the beginning of the video
26:44 - every like this video gets in the next
26:46 - 24 hours we will donate one dollar to
26:48 - team c's for every like we get so
26:51 - thank you guys for watching
26:53 - don't forget to like share and subscribe
26:55 - and ring the notification bell and i'll
26:57 - see you guys in the next video

27:09 - you

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here today we'll be doing a video on tmc's if you're paying attention on youtube you might know what team c's is because like literally every single youtuber has made a video about team seas it's basically a thing where mr beast every dollar donate you get one pound of trash removed from the ocean so for this video in the next 24 hours the amount of likes we get is the amount of money we donate to team sees so you better like this video if you want to see more money donated every single like on this video in 24 hours equals one dollar for every single like in uh the next 24 hours on this video so be sure to smash that like button yeah yeah so and then uh we will be also um showing a game for team seas we made a game for it um so i'll be showing you guys um the demonstration of the game so right now we have the team c's trash collector and then so let's go to full screen and then uh you just move around you press spacebar you grab the trash when you grab it it increases your pounds of trash as you can see grab all that so yeah that's pretty much it it's pretty simple but it's kind of like a tmc's gamer just collect trash yeah so a game on team trees not team c sorry okay so now let's hop into the project okay so let's hop right into this tutorial so i just started a new project and let's rename the project we're going to name it uh tmc's tmc's ah trash collector game collector uh and then we're going to uh delete the scratch cap we're going to get some sprites from what we had before we have the tmc's like the trash collector with the boat and then with the net that shoots out the garbage oh there it is and then we have the ocean is the scrolling background and then we can also put the ocean in here so we're also going to use the same ocean thing for the background so let's sometimes when you're scrolling you see this like white area so we don't want that so we're also going to put the ocean for the background so i'm going to show you how we draw it so i'm going to create a new costume so i'm going to just like this and delete it so what we do is get the um so we're going to get the uh backdrop from it's called city with water yeah this one so basically we're only gonna need this water down here so we're going to convert to bitmap so keep yourself on bitmap and we're just going to cut a small chunk of it out ctrl c ctrl v as you can see you split vertical because the dark area looks really ugly with the light area so if you flip it so let's say if you like click it and then you flip it it will look really ugly because like there's the dark and light together it doesn't look good so what you do is just keep on control c control v copying like the light area and just copy paste and stack them on top of each other as you can see okay so it'll look something like that so what i do is like i only get the light part i'm gonna get all of that and then paste it to the right side where it's a little bit darker so it looks a little bit better yeah so kind of like that so you get the idea of how to do it it's not perfect obviously you can perfect it however you want um just copy this into the other backdrop okay so that's how you do it um but we have this in our google drive if you would like to download it or you can just export it straight from this project in the link in the description we need both the ocean and the backdrop since we're going to be doing the scrolling with the ocean so we're going to have to use both of them and it's just the same thing on both things okay so now let's go to the boats i'll show you how to draw this one as well so here we have the boat my dad drew this boat actually so i'm going to try to draw it but i'm not that good at drawing i'll try to do it as best as i can so first i'm going to show you what's inside the boat so we're going to ungroup everything first we have the white part this is like part of the boat and this blue part is the back just like the tail of the boat oops and then here we have the two like this is like the top of the boat and then right here we have the blue part which is the glass and the black part is basically a smaller version of the white part but it's just all black and then we have the blue part which represents the glass of the boat and the lines are just like i don't know like you know how boats have that little line thing i'll just put in i'll just put an image right here to show you uh so yes basically what it is so for this you have to like be sure what layers your like drawings are on they can be in the back or the front layer you need them in either the back or front layer so i'm going to be drawing it but i'm going to like speed it up a little bit with the time lapse so we can save you guys a little bit of time okay so we're going to draw our uh boat now i'm going to timelapse it like i said before um save you guys a little bit of time but this is how it looks like i'm going to try to draw as best as i can okay so now i just finished i don't think it's as good as the original one as you can see right here uh so now we're gonna just rotate the boat to the right side so i'm going to select the whole thing and i'm just going to get the flip uh i'm going to group it and then flip horizontal so then it goes to the other side okay so yeah that's pretty much it that's how you draw it that that's just like a fast time lapse of how you draw it okay so now let's go to the net how to draw the net so basically for the net it's just like a giant circle right here and then we reshape it and drag it out and then we just draw some lines see the lines there's just some lines we reshape the lines as well and then one longer line some thicker line right here and then we just make a bunch of costumes and then we make it further each time so let's zoom out a little bit so as you can see it goes a little bit further each time each costume you go it goes a little further so that's basically how you do it and there's eight costumes we have so that's pretty much how you draw it you can just get it from our google drive or export it just from here and our trash is basically just like some just like different assortment of trash like bags cans bottles we drew this in our like earth game or save the earth game um here we have the plastic rings it's just some clear um some open circles some white open circles and then here just fill it up right here with like a closed circle with a colored one so yeah that's pretty much how you draw it and these bottles cans and bags we just got from online we did not draw it okay so enough with the drawing so now let's get to the coding all right so now let's go delete this and then let's go all right so inside the code we are going to inside the team sees boat we're going to get a one green flag plates let's zoom in all right so when preflight clicked we're going to go to uh negative 125 and then for y position negative 50 and then point direction of 90 so it's pointing to the right side and then we're going to get a forever loop and then we're going to go to the front layer so we want the boat to be in the front layer so we're going to make it go to the front and then if on edge bounce we don't want it to go off the screen so we're just going to do bounce so it stays on the screen um and then we're going to get a if then statement and then we're going to get if up arrow is pressed so if the key up is pressed then we're going to change the y by 10. we'll come back to the boat after to code some other stuff for some other like casting the net and collecting trash but um we will change it we'll do it afterwards and also with the select this one i forgot to tell you that um because we don't want the boat to rotate upside down so if you just like do this that means you can rotate the boat all around so we just want to select the middle thing so it doesn't rotate upside down when you move left and right okay and then we're going to duplicate this if the down arrows press then we're going to change the y by negative 10 and then we can duplicate all this instead we're going to do x position now so the right arrows press we're going to change the x by 10 and when the left arrow is oops left arrow is pressed we're going to change the x by negative 10. so there we have the simple movement of the boat and then we also have to change the point in direction of which side the boat is pointing towards so for right arrow we're going to put direction of 90 which is facing the right side and left arrow is going to be negative 90. okay okay so now let's save the project run it so it's basically just you can move around the boat now okay so now we can just have the simple movement of the boat now let's go into the net so inside the net we are going to get a when we're going to make two variables inside the nets so one variable is going to be called casting the net all right so casting the net for all sprites casting the nets and the other variable will be called uh trash uh collecting so we can just name it trash collecting trash collecting so this is collecting the trash and we're gonna make another variable those are the two we will use for now but we'll make another one called pounds of trash this is basically a score it's just to calculate how many pounds of trash you have picked up and then finally we have the trash counter counter that's to keep track of how many pieces of trash are on the screen at once all right and then inside this net we are going to first let's just uncheck all these we'll keep the pounds of trash out oops kinds of trash is basically the score we'll keep that on now all right and then so inside here the net we are going to get a one group like plates when graphite is clicked we are going to set casting the net to no which is end casting the net to no so the beginning you're not casting a net and we're gonna hide and then forever we're gonna use the space bar to release the net so if the key space is pressed we're gonna set casting the net to yes which is why and then we're going to point direction point direction so we have to pay attention right here so we use this thing you have to uh check this thing first so we're going to get this team seized boat select the tmc's boat first before we can do anything here we're gonna form direction of the direction of the team sees boat so now in the direction of this boat and we're gonna get if l statement so control if else if uh direction of team c's boat is greater than zero direction of the team sees quote you can just like duplicate this direction the team sees both is greater than zero we're gonna do zero so let's say the direction is pointing zero if it's greater than zero we're gonna put the net at least plus one hundred this way so zero would be about right here right so we're gonna do it this way we're gonna make a positive if it's greater than zero so we're gonna make it go to the duplicate this so we're gonna go to the x position of the team sees boat and then we're gonna get an addition sign we're gonna add 100 so that net will go 100 uh like 100 steps forward so just go 100 for so we're going to add 100 to this and then we're just going to get the same y position of the team c spoke y position does not change and let's just duplicate this else let's say you're pointing the other direction then we're going to change the x position by teams use both instead we're going to add negative 100 or you can just use that subtraction sign and minus 100 but for the simplicity we're just going to use keep the addition and just do adding negative 100 and then next we're going to broadcast and wait for a message we're gonna broadcast and wait because we don't want like the boat to move around while we're throwing the net so we're gonna broadcast a message name it cast the net cast the net and then we're gonna set casting the net to no and then since we already uh set it to y up here as you can see yes when the space is pressed it's going to set it to yes and then after this action is finished we're going to set it back to no as you can see all right so that's pretty much it for this and then we're going to receive the message so when i receive the message casting the net then we're going to switch the costume to costume one which is the first costume so let's go to the costumes the first one and then we're going to go to the front layer and then we're going to go backward one layer so we want it to be on top of like the garbage but under the boat so that's what we want go backward one layer so we're just gonna do that and then we're gonna show show the net and then we're gonna repeat seven times because we're starting on the costume one so we only have to do seven times so we're gonna repeat seven times and then we're going to wait point one seconds and then we're gonna next costume if you just heard that fireworks is because like the default celebrations uh celebrations they're just like having fireworks outside just like ignore that for now and then uh wait 0.5 seconds right here before sending it back so we're gonna wait five seconds make sure the costume is on costume rate we're gonna wait 45 seconds before bringing the net back we can just duplicate this and put it down here but instead we're gonna have to do something like subtraction so we're gonna instead of next costume we're gonna switch the costume to um costume number subtracted by one because we want to subtract one and go back to the first one so we're gonna subtract each one until we get back to the first costume subtraction so costume number costume number subtract by one okay move this over by a little bit so you can see and then we're going to wait 45 seconds and then hide the net again so let's zoom out i'll show you the code and then i'll demonstrate how it works all right so now we can move around you can see when you press the space bar the net goes out and comes back that goes out comes back obviously we have to make it like not move when you're throwing the net and we will work on that now so okay so now let's go back to the tmc's boat i told you guys we would go back here after we finished something so we're just gonna cut uh combine two and statements so the up arrow key is pressed and it's equal to uh the casting net is equal to no so we're only going to let it move if the casting net is equal to end casting the net to go to zero and and we're going to use another variable called uh collecting trash like i said earlier so we're going to uh and collecting uh trash collecting or whatever is equal to no so we'll use that later you don't have to worry about for now but just put it into the code and just duplicate this all and put this in here take this out put this in here duplicate this put this in here oops substitute that and put that in there duplicate one more time put that in here and switch this out okay so now we are finally done with that play it so now as you can see you cannot move if uh you cannot move if there is a net being cast so as you can see and we'll have to reset the casting net back to uh right now um you cannot move this yet because we have not set the variable trash collecting so now we are going to set up the variable trash collecting so then we can actually move the ship now okay so now we're going to go back to the we're going to get to the trash sprite so we're going to go with the trash inside the trash we're going to get a 135 clicked let's just zoom in when we fly click we're going to set the trash counter trash counter to zero and we're gonna set the pounds of trash to zero and we're gonna set the collecting to no trash can collecting to no so now it should work so let's try it out so as you can see when you throw the net you cannot move once the net is gone you can move freely again so there you go now it's working fine so now we have to finish the code for the trash so in the trash we're going to make it go to the front layer and then make it go backwards three layers so that it's behind the boat and the net it's going to make it go backwards three layer we want it in front of some layer but behind some other layers we want it in front of the ocean but we want it behind some other layers like the boat and the net and we're going to hide and forever loop uh waits one to three seconds so we're gonna wait i pick random one to three seconds before it starts spawning uh the trash so one two three and then we're going to put it as a max limit as four clones so sometimes it might go to four but it'll never go higher than four because sometimes the clothes generate too quickly but we're going to make it so it's less than four sometimes the fourth one can generate so trash uh counter is less than four and then we're going to wait 0.2 seconds we want to go to 0.2 seconds because we want variety inside so right now we have like six costumes you see so um if we don't wait then it won't there be like no variety in the trash now all look the same so that's why we need that and then we're gonna put a create a clone of myself after this and then up here when we start as a clone we are going to when we start this clone when i start as a clone we are going to change the trash counter by one change trash counter by one and then we're gonna go to okay so let's go to um negative 180 to 180 for the x position to 180 and then for the y we're going to go pick random negative 130 to 130. okay and then we're going to switch and i'm gonna put a pick random one to six and then we're gonna show and forever if it's touching the nets i'm touching the net then we're gonna set the collecting like the trash collecting charge collecting to yes when it's touching the net and then we're gonna wait two seconds and then we're gonna drag the trash back so we're going to point direction point in direction and then we're gonna get this uh block right here point direction and then we're gonna get the tmc's boat and we're gonna get the direction of that and we're gonna glide two seconds two seconds and then we're going to glide those wrong one glide two seconds to the tmc's uh boat right there and we're going to change the pounds of trash by pick random 10 to 30. change the pounds of trash 10 to 30. if you guys have no idea what pounds are because you are like from a different country that does not use pounds uh you can put kilograms of trash i don't know it's basically the same thing uh and then we're gonna set collecting trash collecting to know so after that after you bring it back it's gonna set it to no and then change the trash counter by negative one once you take one and change the trash can by negative one and then we're gonna delete this clone once it is all gone so right there as you can see that's all the code and let you just put it anything you missed and then finally we have the ocean so for the ocean we're going to make this backdrop so i've learned this tutorial from the scratch team so if you want to check out the original video you can check it out so i'm just going to give credit to them for uh showing me how to do this it's pretty cool so like we gotta get a one green five plates uh then we're gonna go to the back layer so we're gonna make like the ocean move so you can see like the water moving go to the back layer and then we're going to go to zero zero bring it into the origin of the screen zero zero and then we're gonna create a clone of myself and then we're gonna forever and then if x if else we're going to get if else so if else the exposition is greater than negative 1 450 negative 450 is like somewhere right here so if this x is like greater than negative 450 so if it's greater than negative 450 the x position is greater than negative 450 we are going to change the x my negative one so it's gonna keep on sliding this way to the left i'm gonna change the x by negative one and then else we're going to go to 450 and then we're going to get a zero so else is going to go to that position and then when i start as a clone the clone is pretty much the same thing when i start as a clone we can just duplicate this part except we can just remove some of this we do not need this and 450 for that x and then we're going to make it to go to the back layer go to back layer right back layer and just keep all this all right so now the game is pretty much complete just wait for the trash to come out oh okay we need to make the trash maybe we can make the trash go four layers uh two layers backwards i don't remember the exact yeah now you can see there you go so you can see you can drag the trash in there you go 25 pounds of trash so now the game is working like it like we did before so sometimes um if you drag it from the end it'll have like a little bit delay but it's okay it looks fine yes so now we're finished with our game and it's working perfectly fine so that is pretty much for today's video okay so that's pretty much it for the video if you want to check out more information about team c's it's in the description below teamses.org if you want to donate money to tmc's for saving the environment and stuff like that it's also going to be the link in the description um yeah so that's pretty much it like we mentioned in the beginning of the video every like this video gets in the next 24 hours we will donate one dollar to team c's for every like we get so thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe and ring the notification bell and i'll see you guys in the next video you
