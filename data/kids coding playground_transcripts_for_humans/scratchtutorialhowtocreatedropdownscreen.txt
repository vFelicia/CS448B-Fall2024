00:06 - so welcome back to the channel guys
00:08 - today we'll be doing a video on how to
00:11 - make a drop-down screen so for the
00:15 - drop-down screen well so this is a
00:18 - example game that I have a drop-down
00:21 - screen on so when you press either the
00:23 - stop button this will drop down or when
00:28 - you press the thumbnail I mean give up
00:31 - button it will drop down so today I'll
00:35 - be teaching you guys how to do it so
00:37 - when you enter any game in the beginning
00:40 - of any game the timer this thing right
00:44 - here will start running but what this
00:46 - code does is it keeps on resetting the
00:49 - timer so it get to zero and then when
00:53 - you print either press a stop button or
00:55 - give up stops the script and then the
00:58 - timer will start running again and when
01:00 - timer is greater than 0.1 then this
01:03 - thing will drop down okay so let's just
01:08 - get a new project we can name this drop
01:16 - down of that okay we don't need this cat
01:23 - and you upload a sprite so this is a
01:29 - spray I have so I'm gonna delete this
01:33 - code and go through it one by one
01:35 - so first we'll need a one when clicked
01:38 - when flag clicked we'll need to go to
01:41 - zero zero so this will go to the center
01:46 - we want it to go to the front layer when
01:49 - it drops down so you want to go to the
01:51 - front layer high so it will hide in the
01:54 - beginning until you press the stop
01:57 - button you want the forever timer so
02:01 - they'll keep on row setting the timer so
02:04 - the timer won't start so if you take
02:07 - this out and you press the timer
02:09 - timeless
02:10 - running what would you do this and you
02:14 - put the tiger it's at zero cuz it
02:16 - forever resetting the time okay next
02:20 - we'll need this block the violinists
02:28 - which it's a timer 0.1 and critical
02:31 - warning yet we wanted to go to we want
02:35 - this sprite to go to zero why 300 so it
02:39 - will appear off the map and collide in
02:41 - so that's off the screen and glide it
02:44 - through it we'll get the effect of
02:46 - gliding in so we'll need it to show and
02:50 - then when they maybe glide 0.5 seconds
02:54 - to the center of the map screen yeah
02:58 - so if you play this
03:00 - nothing will happen in the beginning
03:02 - going to press the stop one this glides
03:04 - down I hope this video helped you guys
