00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - so welcome back to another video on kids
00:09 - go to playground today we'll be making
00:11 - game called t-rex and peridot
00:13 - pterodactyls so we have another game
00:15 - similar to this which is cat getting the
00:18 - apples but this one is a t-rex getting
00:21 - the pterodactyls this is how the game
00:23 - looks like so I'll be explaining how to
00:26 - play the game so use the arrow keys to
00:28 - move and the objective is just score as
00:31 - much points as you can press the
00:33 - spacebar to jump with the t-rex to eat
00:37 - the pterodactyls to get points this
00:43 - video is like the Apple cat one cat
00:46 - video except this one has added stuff so
00:50 - the cat one is more of a beginner's
00:52 - video if you're a beginner I suggest you
00:54 - to watch the other one this one is more
00:56 - of an intermediate video so in this game
01:01 - we'll be learning these following
01:02 - concepts such as broadcasting messages
01:05 - using the random operator touching
01:07 - sprites one key press and the joint
01:10 - function so I'll be demoing the game
01:13 - first before we start so when we make
01:17 - this full screen so as you can see this
01:20 - music in the background when you move
01:23 - around the dinosaur switches costumes
01:27 - when you press the spacebar it jumps and
01:29 - as you can see when you
01:31 - the kind of geeks the pterodactyls right
01:34 - they switch costume so yeah without
01:39 - further ado get a new project ready so
01:43 - new first we can rename it to t-rexes
01:48 - and pterodactyls think that's how you
02:01 - spell it
02:01 - but you can change it later so we we
02:06 - want to delete this cat then we'll want
02:10 - to get backdrop so let's get a
02:12 - background to this project we want the
02:22 - dress background because it's kind of
02:24 - like a dinosaur themed game so we can
02:30 - get the t-rex Dino dinosaur 4 and you'll
02:40 - need the pterodactyl type of Dino turn I
02:48 - wonder need some trees tree tree and
02:57 - just duplicate these right click
02:58 - duplicate right we'll need three trees
03:02 - okay first of all let's go to the
03:05 - backdrop so we'll need a one clicked
03:08 - forever
03:10 - play sound jungle will get a sound oh I
03:14 - prefer to pick the jungle I just search
03:25 - so this kind of a sounds drastic so
03:31 - before I can continue I would like you
03:34 - guys to please like share subscribe to
03:36 - this video and subscribe to our channel
03:39 - thank you so now let's continue
03:45 - so I code for the t-rex okay so as you
03:50 - guys in the first video we used like the
03:52 - key space key is pressed this is less
03:56 - smooth than the if-then statement and
03:59 - then you use the sensing key left arrow
04:02 - or right arrow press this is more
04:04 - smoother so we want the t-rex to go to
04:06 - the front layer in the beginning then go
04:11 - to somewhere like right here we want it
04:15 - to go to like a zero Center zero I'm
04:21 - just gonna put a random coordinate that
04:24 - might fit it zero negative 50 see that's
04:31 - pretty much in the center so now when
04:34 - you forever Lee if I'm edge bounce so it
04:39 - can't go off the map if then statement
04:47 - if then the left arrow is pressed take
04:50 - this left arrows press then point
04:55 - direction of negative 90 because he has
04:58 - eternal life he'll look to the left side
05:04 - so negative 90 move 10 steps so move
05:10 - this is like the movement for it and
05:14 - then switch costume to pick random one
05:16 - two three we want this because it can
05:20 - switch costume when it's moving we don't
05:23 - want it to switch costume next costume
05:25 - because we don't want it to switch to
05:28 - this costume because we don't want it
05:30 - when it's moving we don't want it to
05:31 - open its mouth randomly so we can just
05:35 - duplicate this code
05:38 - instead of left we can do right instead
05:40 - of one direction just put it to 90 move
05:44 - ten steps and pick random it's um one
05:47 - two three yeah we don't want to do it
05:49 - too wonderful
05:51 - put this under here so this is a
05:54 - movement of the Dino dinosaur so next
05:58 - we'll need to do the jumping up so when
06:03 - the key space is pressed repeat 15 times
06:10 - so this will make it jump up and then
06:12 - get back down change Y my 10 so go up
06:18 - change Y by 10 next costume so they'll
06:24 - open its mouth now change costume 1 2 4
06:27 - when you jump up then we can just
06:30 - duplicate this 15 times and then you
06:34 - have to make it negative time because
06:35 - you want it to go back down and you want
06:39 - to switch the dinosaur for this costume
06:43 - because you want it to open its mouth
06:45 - when it's jumping so as you can see now
06:49 - we've got the movement done oh yeah and
06:52 - I forgot you have to do this direction
06:57 - you to put it to this so it will rotate
06:59 - upside down now the dinosaur can jump up
07:06 - and down
07:07 - and move left and right I know the music
07:09 - center mode okay so next we'll move on
07:14 - some more code for the t-rex so we'll
07:18 - need to get it when clicked and flat
07:21 - clicked when they make a variable called
07:24 - score so score we want to set the score
07:29 - 2-0 in the beginning four to zero
07:33 - forever loop so in the forever loop we
07:37 - want to put it at the end statement if
07:40 - then touching the Dino 3 which is the
07:42 - pterodactyl or ever dinosaur 3 then
07:47 - broadcast when you broadcast and played
07:50 - a message called gap give this I spell
08:03 - it so next we move on to the pterodactyl
08:09 - code so when it receives got pterodactyl
08:14 - we can switch costume to the Dino 3d
08:21 - which is the one that's screaming I
08:24 - guess and then we wait 3.5 seconds to
08:28 - give it a slight pause 2.5 then we hide
08:34 - because it's eaten switch costume - Dino
08:40 - 3e
08:42 - which is this one they want it to start
08:46 - on this one
08:48 - so when clicked we need a one click this
08:52 - bigger thank us when the flag is clicked
08:55 - we want to switch costume to the Dyna 3e
08:58 - this one hide okay so we need a forever
09:04 - loop so wait pick random one two three
09:09 - seconds every single time it spawns so
09:12 - pick a random one two three seconds
09:14 - before spawning one two three go to it
09:19 - go to
09:20 - we're in a position but instead we'll
09:23 - take a join join function and a pick
09:29 - random so what this basically means is
09:31 - we need to add tree in a tree pick
09:34 - random 1 2 3 so you know we have 3 trees
09:37 - right so when you click on this tree 3
09:40 - see when you click on it it will join
09:45 - the tree plus the number so I'll
09:47 - actually go to the sprite tree 1 2 3
09:50 - either one of those see so we just put
09:56 - this right here
09:57 - so that's that code and then we want to
10:01 - change X change the X change the x pick
10:09 - random negative 50 to 50 so over you
10:11 - somewhere from the end of the tree to
10:14 - the other under the tree so pick random
10:16 - negative 50 to 50 okay we wanna change Y
10:25 - to 75 so be somewhere up here instead
10:28 - because if you say go to tree it would
10:31 - be in the center of the tree so we
10:33 - wanted to be up here so change Y by 75
10:38 - change by 75 okay so now you want to
10:44 - show show the pterodactyl wait two
10:49 - seconds and then hot okay now we just
10:58 - need to set up all the things we can put
11:01 - the tree one right here
11:02 - three two right here entry 3 let's move
11:07 - it a little bit more like this okay
11:17 - we also have to make the dinosaur go to
11:20 - the front so go to the front layer go to
11:26 - front layer when you bite it the
11:37 - dinosaur disappears
11:38 - oh yeah you can make the score change by
11:43 - one when you get the parameter doctorate
11:46 - so when you receive the message got to
11:50 - Rin Jarrod after you change the score by
11:53 - one yeah so now you can see the scores
12:01 - changing up using position the trees and
12:05 - different place if you want so yeah that
12:18 - pretty much sums up the video thank you
12:20 - guys for watching and don't remember to

12:25 - channel and comment down in the comments
12:28 - below on what you think about this video

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back to another video on kids go to playground today we'll be making game called trex and peridot pterodactyls so we have another game similar to this which is cat getting the apples but this one is a trex getting the pterodactyls this is how the game looks like so I'll be explaining how to play the game so use the arrow keys to move and the objective is just score as much points as you can press the spacebar to jump with the trex to eat the pterodactyls to get points this video is like the Apple cat one cat video except this one has added stuff so the cat one is more of a beginner's video if you're a beginner I suggest you to watch the other one this one is more of an intermediate video so in this game we'll be learning these following concepts such as broadcasting messages using the random operator touching sprites one key press and the joint function so I'll be demoing the game first before we start so when we make this full screen so as you can see this music in the background when you move around the dinosaur switches costumes when you press the spacebar it jumps and as you can see when you the kind of geeks the pterodactyls right they switch costume so yeah without further ado get a new project ready so new first we can rename it to trexes and pterodactyls think that's how you spell it but you can change it later so we we want to delete this cat then we'll want to get backdrop so let's get a background to this project we want the dress background because it's kind of like a dinosaur themed game so we can get the trex Dino dinosaur 4 and you'll need the pterodactyl type of Dino turn I wonder need some trees tree tree and just duplicate these right click duplicate right we'll need three trees okay first of all let's go to the backdrop so we'll need a one clicked forever play sound jungle will get a sound oh I prefer to pick the jungle I just search so this kind of a sounds drastic so before I can continue I would like you guys to please like share subscribe to this video and subscribe to our channel thank you so now let's continue so I code for the trex okay so as you guys in the first video we used like the key space key is pressed this is less smooth than the ifthen statement and then you use the sensing key left arrow or right arrow press this is more smoother so we want the trex to go to the front layer in the beginning then go to somewhere like right here we want it to go to like a zero Center zero I'm just gonna put a random coordinate that might fit it zero negative 50 see that's pretty much in the center so now when you forever Lee if I'm edge bounce so it can't go off the map if then statement if then the left arrow is pressed take this left arrows press then point direction of negative 90 because he has eternal life he'll look to the left side so negative 90 move 10 steps so move this is like the movement for it and then switch costume to pick random one two three we want this because it can switch costume when it's moving we don't want it to switch costume next costume because we don't want it to switch to this costume because we don't want it when it's moving we don't want it to open its mouth randomly so we can just duplicate this code instead of left we can do right instead of one direction just put it to 90 move ten steps and pick random it's um one two three yeah we don't want to do it too wonderful put this under here so this is a movement of the Dino dinosaur so next we'll need to do the jumping up so when the key space is pressed repeat 15 times so this will make it jump up and then get back down change Y my 10 so go up change Y by 10 next costume so they'll open its mouth now change costume 1 2 4 when you jump up then we can just duplicate this 15 times and then you have to make it negative time because you want it to go back down and you want to switch the dinosaur for this costume because you want it to open its mouth when it's jumping so as you can see now we've got the movement done oh yeah and I forgot you have to do this direction you to put it to this so it will rotate upside down now the dinosaur can jump up and down and move left and right I know the music center mode okay so next we'll move on some more code for the trex so we'll need to get it when clicked and flat clicked when they make a variable called score so score we want to set the score 20 in the beginning four to zero forever loop so in the forever loop we want to put it at the end statement if then touching the Dino 3 which is the pterodactyl or ever dinosaur 3 then broadcast when you broadcast and played a message called gap give this I spell it so next we move on to the pterodactyl code so when it receives got pterodactyl we can switch costume to the Dino 3d which is the one that's screaming I guess and then we wait 3.5 seconds to give it a slight pause 2.5 then we hide because it's eaten switch costume Dino 3e which is this one they want it to start on this one so when clicked we need a one click this bigger thank us when the flag is clicked we want to switch costume to the Dyna 3e this one hide okay so we need a forever loop so wait pick random one two three seconds every single time it spawns so pick a random one two three seconds before spawning one two three go to it go to we're in a position but instead we'll take a join join function and a pick random so what this basically means is we need to add tree in a tree pick random 1 2 3 so you know we have 3 trees right so when you click on this tree 3 see when you click on it it will join the tree plus the number so I'll actually go to the sprite tree 1 2 3 either one of those see so we just put this right here so that's that code and then we want to change X change the X change the x pick random negative 50 to 50 so over you somewhere from the end of the tree to the other under the tree so pick random negative 50 to 50 okay we wanna change Y to 75 so be somewhere up here instead because if you say go to tree it would be in the center of the tree so we wanted to be up here so change Y by 75 change by 75 okay so now you want to show show the pterodactyl wait two seconds and then hot okay now we just need to set up all the things we can put the tree one right here three two right here entry 3 let's move it a little bit more like this okay we also have to make the dinosaur go to the front so go to the front layer go to front layer when you bite it the dinosaur disappears oh yeah you can make the score change by one when you get the parameter doctorate so when you receive the message got to Rin Jarrod after you change the score by one yeah so now you can see the scores changing up using position the trees and different place if you want so yeah that pretty much sums up the video thank you guys for watching and don't remember to smash the like button subscribe to your channel and comment down in the comments below on what you think about this video thank you guys for watching and I'll see you guys next time
