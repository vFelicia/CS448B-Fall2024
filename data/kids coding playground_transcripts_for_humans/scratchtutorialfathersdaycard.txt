00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:08 - kids coding playground today we'll be
00:11 - making a Father's Day card cuz tomorrow
00:13 - is Father's Day you it doesn't have to
00:16 - say Father's Day on it it could be for a
00:18 - birthday card I guess so that's how it
00:22 - looks like so in the Father's Day card
00:26 - today we'll be learning these concepts
00:28 - custom sprites like like art like if the
00:32 - draal sprites sprite animation like
00:34 - switching costumes and broadcasting
00:36 - messages so like let's start a new
00:38 - project here so let me show you guys how
00:43 - this project what's up so in the
00:46 - beginning there's our robots witches
00:48 - costumes and you move your mouse on here
00:51 - it wobbles around and you click on it
00:54 - and the robot will mince and music will
00:59 - play in the background and I'll say you
01:02 - see on the right side let's start a new
01:07 - project so in a new project we need to
01:12 - get set up with the sprites so we'll
01:16 - need to delete the scratch cat so let's
01:19 - get some sprites so we'll need the
01:21 - robots
01:23 - stick both of them beat both of them so
01:26 - for this one we don't need these two
01:28 - costs because you can just delete them
01:29 - so we don't need them
01:31 - and one more sprite another robot this
01:37 - one this one's for the inside next we'll
01:41 - need balloon it's a balloon you can
01:45 - duplicate it cuz they have two balloons
01:48 - so one balloon can be orange one to be
01:50 - blue I guess orange and yellow yeah so
01:55 - those are sprites or me to make the some
02:02 - other sprites painters to paint two
02:04 - sprites once that says happy Father's
02:07 - Day and texts take a beating
02:11 - marker
02:13 - Seabury happy day sorry
02:25 - happy Father's Day
02:27 - okay let's move this it's in the middle
02:30 - system so this is the Happy's Father's
02:33 - Day let's make it a bit bigger put like
02:37 - right here so happy Father's Day right
02:41 - here we'll need to draw another sprite
02:44 - the click here to open the card that's
02:49 - right so you'll need to make an arrow so
02:54 - just use the paint tool just get a green
02:59 - color make it about 20 size 20 size that
03:05 - looks fine draw it like that like that
03:10 - like an arrow like an arrow and then we
03:14 - can right click here and text so when
03:19 - you get the text I put a red color put a
03:23 - red color right click here so click here
03:31 - an exclamation mark or you can make a
03:33 - bit bigger I think yeah
03:35 - I'll turn it I love them like this so
03:40 - this week a group of sprites together so
03:46 - you can get this like to put them
03:50 - together okay it's now they're groups
03:55 - you can group them together so that's
03:57 - good now we want to add a party hat on
04:00 - this robot so we can get us breakfast
04:04 - right library called Corby hat tick the
04:10 - balloon we have balloon take the party
04:12 - hat
04:12 - yeah so the party hat we want to just
04:17 - delete this we don't need these just
04:20 - take the first one you want to put this
04:23 - together
04:24 - control-c puppy it and go to this bot
04:28 - the bot
04:29 - and control-v now you can put this on
04:32 - his head so using it like in the party
04:37 - look we're here and then now you have to
04:40 - group the robot and the party hat
04:43 - together so you can drag it around hold
04:46 - down the shift key so you can get the
04:48 - thing move down the shift key and group
04:52 - so now it's grouped together and I can
04:55 - move it around like them so now we have
04:58 - the setup done let's move on to the
05:02 - background so the background we will
05:04 - need to make the party cards so we need
05:06 - three backdrops so let's get the square
05:11 - sprite don't you don't want filling in
05:13 - in the beginning just don't feel it and
05:16 - you want a black outline so the best is
05:20 - for output port I've tested it and for
05:24 - is the best for this thing so you make
05:27 - like rectangle shape get the selected
05:32 - drag it like right there so duplicate
05:37 - this twice so you get three costumes um
05:40 - and we'll need to draw the first costume
05:46 - so you wanna you want to feel it
05:49 - actually first so so to get the Select
05:52 - tool select this fill it's like a blue
05:57 - color so there you got a light blue
06:01 - color next you want to make this card
06:07 - closed this is a closed card so let's
06:11 - zoom in a little so you do it like that
06:17 - well it's not that even this make it a
06:23 - four and you want it off for right here
06:33 - maybe like right here like this far hold
06:40 - down the shift key when you're going
06:42 - down so you get a straight line see the
06:47 - straight line right here oh no we want
06:56 - it to be for change that so you want to
07:00 - hold down the shift key to look right
07:02 - here like this for its kind of difficult
07:14 - okay so we got that now we need to maybe
07:19 - a little longer actually and then we can
07:23 - do this connect it down here so now we
07:29 - have the closing garden you want to
07:32 - select this box this rectangle not the
07:35 - other one
07:35 - and fill it with like green so you know
07:40 - it's green the clothes card is great so
07:43 - now let's work on the other cards so we
07:48 - need to fill this one fill this with
07:52 - blue kind of a light blue color like
07:59 - this color like that color so no kill
08:04 - this and now we can take the line tool
08:07 - yen for and we can make it open a little
08:11 - bit more this time like maybe up here
08:14 - it's opening and then from here you hold
08:21 - down the shift key so you get a straight
08:24 - line until like right here and drag it
08:29 - down into the edge like this okay now
08:33 - you take the Select tool select this
08:36 - rectangle and fill it with green there
08:43 - you go
08:44 - so that's like the opening card and this
08:46 - one is fully open heart so we want to
08:49 - take the select tool
08:51 - color this light blue color and you take
09:00 - the tool and crack into the lock right
09:06 - here hold down the shift key so you get
09:11 - a good no this is too short let's make
09:15 - out a bit longer can make it a bit
09:19 - longer and select right here I hold down
09:22 - the shift key so it goes down and drag
09:28 - it back to the town to the corner so now
09:32 - we have the three backdrops but yeah I
09:35 - left the color fill this with the blue
09:41 - like this blue star and so like this one
09:47 - fill the greenish color drink okay so
09:51 - now we have three backdrops as you can
09:53 - see when I click through them there it
09:55 - looks like they're opening up so now
10:00 - let's work on the ratio robot we want it
10:02 - to duplicate the costume look you know
10:06 - how they have them in the beginning they
10:09 - have confetti I guess use a pen I mean
10:13 - the line outline you pick a color choose
10:17 - red I guess shoes it red you want to add
10:21 - 20 um you can just right okay so you can
10:30 - just drag a couple random lines
10:38 - DRO like four or five of them then you
10:41 - can make another color like green - like
10:45 - a dream green and we can do like a
10:51 - yellow and orange yellow i don't you do
10:58 - it work a couple orders lines and we can
11:07 - actually make this green a bit and fill
11:10 - it with a bit darker green because the
11:14 - background is green so we can fill this
11:18 - you can actually just make a couple more
11:25 - let's make it over this that's I think
11:32 - that's good enough for now I don't think
11:36 - we need this one this too much just
11:39 - erase this one so now we have that we
11:43 - can duplicate it and we already have the
11:46 - duplicate so all we have to do is just
11:50 - trim you can just duplicate this one X
11:52 - this one out and we can just arrange
11:55 - he's arranged these it doesn't work it
12:00 - doesn't it doesn't allow us to do that
12:02 - so like that can import it back in sorry
12:08 - for that go back to the robot sorry
12:12 - so get the robot um the referee robot
12:16 - and get the lines you can put different
12:20 - colors this time I guess just different
12:25 - pattern color you can do blue this time
12:29 - I guess we can do a darker green so we
12:37 - have a darker green
12:43 - you can do like a pink oh yes purple
12:47 - thing okay that looks pretty good I
12:52 - guess
12:53 - we don't really need this party hat you
12:56 - think you still good now um so go back
12:59 - to the retro robot so we now have all
13:01 - the art done this is epic
13:03 - we'll be working for the code on the
13:05 - robot or so when the backdrop switches
13:08 - to backdrop one we do this so that drop
13:12 - one is the closed card backdrop so all
13:16 - we have to do is put a forever loop
13:17 - under it under the Patrick one we want
13:21 - it to switch your next costume next
13:24 - costume wait 0.2 seconds they'll have a
13:27 - little pulse I guess so it will change
13:30 - colors like this it would change colors
13:35 - and its are just backdrop to so a1 sorry
13:39 - okay so when it opens the car let me see
13:42 - these backdrops so this is 1 2 & 3
13:44 - ok so we need to work on the back now
13:49 - let's work on the back background coat
13:52 - so if we will work on the background
13:53 - coat then we'll go back to the Russian
13:55 - robot okay
13:57 - so one click do you want to switch the
14:00 - backdrop one always watch the backdrop
14:05 - one so next you want to you want to get
14:12 - um to click the click here thing so when
14:17 - they switch is the backdrop one we want
14:21 - to forever Li if then touching mouse
14:25 - pointer so if it's touching your mouse
14:27 - then next costumes would wait 0.2
14:31 - seconds so I'm here making new costume
14:34 - forgot about the sprites let's make a
14:37 - new costume for this one just duplicate
14:42 - this select and you can just turn it
14:46 - down a little like this so go like this
14:49 - yeah it's - so it's like
14:54 - like that assessment centre of Novi
14:58 - Center so now it looks like it's tilting
15:04 - up and down I think we can actually
15:07 - change the color because it's green he
15:09 - doesn't really fit it yeah just make it
15:18 - work so that's great now let's go back
15:20 - to the code someone clicked when the
15:25 - mouse is clicked when the flag is
15:27 - clicked we wanted to show in the
15:28 - beginning
15:30 - okay so we'll need a win sprite clicked
15:33 - we'll need to broadcast a message called
15:36 - open card so the card will actually open
15:40 - open card open card so whenever it's
15:56 - eaves open card when this sprite
15:59 - receives open card
16:00 - we can hide because we don't want to
16:03 - show anymore so when when the backdrop
16:11 - will receive the open card so when the
16:16 - backdrop receives open card oh it's a
16:20 - regard switch backdrop to backdrop - and
16:24 - wait 0.5 seconds 0.5 seconds and switch
16:31 - backdrop back-to-back shrubs 3 so open
16:36 - and also when it receives open card
16:39 - forever loop it can play a song I'm
16:42 - gonna get the dance dance celebrate song
16:45 - in the sound library ants and sound this
16:56 - one so put this until done into the four
17:01 - active so next
17:05 - you want to get the code for the Red
17:08 - Room
17:08 - robot 1 when it receives open card then
17:14 - you'll hi is this until in the front and
17:19 - when clicked it will show in the
17:23 - beginning so next we have the robot -
17:28 - this one the robot this one what when
17:34 - the backdrop so just a backdrop 3 this
17:37 - will show slow show and forever loop
17:45 - next costume weight 0.3 seconds so it
17:51 - looks dance it'll look like it's dancing
17:56 - 0.3 seconds yeah like this see it's like
18:05 - dancing and one clicked it will hide in
18:08 - the beginning hot
18:15 - so now we'll need to get for the balloon
18:18 - 1 and the happy Father's Day this is the
18:23 - last piece of code there is so when
18:26 - backdrop so should sit down for up 3
18:29 - show and one clicked hot you can just
18:39 - drag this into each of them balloon
18:43 - crack it into here here right here so we
18:51 - can put this click here so we can take
18:58 - out the code for the click here first so
19:01 - we can move it wait on they also change
19:05 - the color for this one color ok move it
19:10 - here it's making a bit smaller like 75
19:17 - 75 is good sighs yeah and you can move
19:22 - the robot robot we can decrease the size
19:25 - for like 75 monster yeah that looks like
19:28 - a good size so now we let's put the code
19:33 - back in can you click it let's play it
19:40 - again okay we can move this on the other
19:46 - side these balloons we can move on this
19:49 - side but this you can make the balloons
19:53 - like 75 size also both the balloons like
20:01 - one overlapping the other with this that
20:05 - looks pretty good and it says happy
20:09 - Father's Day on top of the balloons we
20:12 - can make the happy Father's Day sprite
20:14 - smaller like 50 sighs yeah
20:18 - people can see that maybe six feet so
20:23 - it's 60 yeah so 60 and then the robot
20:27 - can be right here you can decrease its
20:30 - size to 75 so just play it and we can
20:41 - also add the party hat to all these
20:42 - costumes already hat so you can just
20:58 - duplicate select this delete these
21:03 - select so see they do this robot control
21:09 - feet so just give it to all its costumes
21:13 - yeah
21:15 - grip it group it together with a bot
21:23 - get it here quick bot okay so now - oops
21:34 - sorry control we only need the Hat sorry
21:42 - I don't copy button you'll see you know
21:48 - we can control these here yeah the Hat

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today we'll be making a Father's Day card cuz tomorrow is Father's Day you it doesn't have to say Father's Day on it it could be for a birthday card I guess so that's how it looks like so in the Father's Day card today we'll be learning these concepts custom sprites like like art like if the draal sprites sprite animation like switching costumes and broadcasting messages so like let's start a new project here so let me show you guys how this project what's up so in the beginning there's our robots witches costumes and you move your mouse on here it wobbles around and you click on it and the robot will mince and music will play in the background and I'll say you see on the right side let's start a new project so in a new project we need to get set up with the sprites so we'll need to delete the scratch cat so let's get some sprites so we'll need the robots stick both of them beat both of them so for this one we don't need these two costs because you can just delete them so we don't need them and one more sprite another robot this one this one's for the inside next we'll need balloon it's a balloon you can duplicate it cuz they have two balloons so one balloon can be orange one to be blue I guess orange and yellow yeah so those are sprites or me to make the some other sprites painters to paint two sprites once that says happy Father's Day and texts take a beating marker Seabury happy day sorry happy Father's Day okay let's move this it's in the middle system so this is the Happy's Father's Day let's make it a bit bigger put like right here so happy Father's Day right here we'll need to draw another sprite the click here to open the card that's right so you'll need to make an arrow so just use the paint tool just get a green color make it about 20 size 20 size that looks fine draw it like that like that like an arrow like an arrow and then we can right click here and text so when you get the text I put a red color put a red color right click here so click here an exclamation mark or you can make a bit bigger I think yeah I'll turn it I love them like this so this week a group of sprites together so you can get this like to put them together okay it's now they're groups you can group them together so that's good now we want to add a party hat on this robot so we can get us breakfast right library called Corby hat tick the balloon we have balloon take the party hat yeah so the party hat we want to just delete this we don't need these just take the first one you want to put this together controlc puppy it and go to this bot the bot and controlv now you can put this on his head so using it like in the party look we're here and then now you have to group the robot and the party hat together so you can drag it around hold down the shift key so you can get the thing move down the shift key and group so now it's grouped together and I can move it around like them so now we have the setup done let's move on to the background so the background we will need to make the party cards so we need three backdrops so let's get the square sprite don't you don't want filling in in the beginning just don't feel it and you want a black outline so the best is for output port I've tested it and for is the best for this thing so you make like rectangle shape get the selected drag it like right there so duplicate this twice so you get three costumes um and we'll need to draw the first costume so you wanna you want to feel it actually first so so to get the Select tool select this fill it's like a blue color so there you got a light blue color next you want to make this card closed this is a closed card so let's zoom in a little so you do it like that well it's not that even this make it a four and you want it off for right here maybe like right here like this far hold down the shift key when you're going down so you get a straight line see the straight line right here oh no we want it to be for change that so you want to hold down the shift key to look right here like this for its kind of difficult okay so we got that now we need to maybe a little longer actually and then we can do this connect it down here so now we have the closing garden you want to select this box this rectangle not the other one and fill it with like green so you know it's green the clothes card is great so now let's work on the other cards so we need to fill this one fill this with blue kind of a light blue color like this color like that color so no kill this and now we can take the line tool yen for and we can make it open a little bit more this time like maybe up here it's opening and then from here you hold down the shift key so you get a straight line until like right here and drag it down into the edge like this okay now you take the Select tool select this rectangle and fill it with green there you go so that's like the opening card and this one is fully open heart so we want to take the select tool color this light blue color and you take the tool and crack into the lock right here hold down the shift key so you get a good no this is too short let's make out a bit longer can make it a bit longer and select right here I hold down the shift key so it goes down and drag it back to the town to the corner so now we have the three backdrops but yeah I left the color fill this with the blue like this blue star and so like this one fill the greenish color drink okay so now we have three backdrops as you can see when I click through them there it looks like they're opening up so now let's work on the ratio robot we want it to duplicate the costume look you know how they have them in the beginning they have confetti I guess use a pen I mean the line outline you pick a color choose red I guess shoes it red you want to add 20 um you can just right okay so you can just drag a couple random lines DRO like four or five of them then you can make another color like green like a dream green and we can do like a yellow and orange yellow i don't you do it work a couple orders lines and we can actually make this green a bit and fill it with a bit darker green because the background is green so we can fill this you can actually just make a couple more let's make it over this that's I think that's good enough for now I don't think we need this one this too much just erase this one so now we have that we can duplicate it and we already have the duplicate so all we have to do is just trim you can just duplicate this one X this one out and we can just arrange he's arranged these it doesn't work it doesn't it doesn't allow us to do that so like that can import it back in sorry for that go back to the robot sorry so get the robot um the referee robot and get the lines you can put different colors this time I guess just different pattern color you can do blue this time I guess we can do a darker green so we have a darker green you can do like a pink oh yes purple thing okay that looks pretty good I guess we don't really need this party hat you think you still good now um so go back to the retro robot so we now have all the art done this is epic we'll be working for the code on the robot or so when the backdrop switches to backdrop one we do this so that drop one is the closed card backdrop so all we have to do is put a forever loop under it under the Patrick one we want it to switch your next costume next costume wait 0.2 seconds they'll have a little pulse I guess so it will change colors like this it would change colors and its are just backdrop to so a1 sorry okay so when it opens the car let me see these backdrops so this is 1 2 & 3 ok so we need to work on the back now let's work on the back background coat so if we will work on the background coat then we'll go back to the Russian robot okay so one click do you want to switch the backdrop one always watch the backdrop one so next you want to you want to get um to click the click here thing so when they switch is the backdrop one we want to forever Li if then touching mouse pointer so if it's touching your mouse then next costumes would wait 0.2 seconds so I'm here making new costume forgot about the sprites let's make a new costume for this one just duplicate this select and you can just turn it down a little like this so go like this yeah it's so it's like like that assessment centre of Novi Center so now it looks like it's tilting up and down I think we can actually change the color because it's green he doesn't really fit it yeah just make it work so that's great now let's go back to the code someone clicked when the mouse is clicked when the flag is clicked we wanted to show in the beginning okay so we'll need a win sprite clicked we'll need to broadcast a message called open card so the card will actually open open card open card so whenever it's eaves open card when this sprite receives open card we can hide because we don't want to show anymore so when when the backdrop will receive the open card so when the backdrop receives open card oh it's a regard switch backdrop to backdrop and wait 0.5 seconds 0.5 seconds and switch backdrop backtoback shrubs 3 so open and also when it receives open card forever loop it can play a song I'm gonna get the dance dance celebrate song in the sound library ants and sound this one so put this until done into the four active so next you want to get the code for the Red Room robot 1 when it receives open card then you'll hi is this until in the front and when clicked it will show in the beginning so next we have the robot this one the robot this one what when the backdrop so just a backdrop 3 this will show slow show and forever loop next costume weight 0.3 seconds so it looks dance it'll look like it's dancing 0.3 seconds yeah like this see it's like dancing and one clicked it will hide in the beginning hot so now we'll need to get for the balloon 1 and the happy Father's Day this is the last piece of code there is so when backdrop so should sit down for up 3 show and one clicked hot you can just drag this into each of them balloon crack it into here here
