00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids coding
00:09 - playground here and today we're back for
00:11 - another video on scratch and today
00:14 - we're making um a sort of scientific
00:17 - um molecule game called molecules in
00:21 - motion
00:22 - and um it's kind of like science
00:26 - because if you didn't learn this at
00:27 - school yet um
00:29 - let's just start it you start at one
00:31 - molecule
00:33 - you can add molecules it's kind of a
00:36 - scientific
00:37 - science if you're like a teacher oh you
00:40 - can use this material um
00:42 - well not really but like still you know
00:44 - uh you can start at 10.
00:47 - this is one it's really cold and i know
00:50 - there's a fire under it just ignore that
00:52 - and
00:52 - this is like when it's really cold the
00:54 - wall kills move
00:56 - slower like in real life if you're
00:57 - colder you'll move slower
00:59 - um obviously and if it gets
01:02 - hotter it'll get quicker
01:07 - and yeah so
01:12 - uh it can go really really slow like
01:15 - just
01:15 - really really slow this is like winter
01:18 - no this is like fall maybe no this is
01:21 - like fall
01:22 - and then this is like spring and this is
01:25 - summer
01:26 - so it's like um the molecules moving
01:29 - this is probably when you're boiling
01:30 - something like if you're boiling water
01:32 - or like um
01:34 - uh i don't know
01:37 - uh vegetables whatever then the
01:40 - molecules
01:42 - in the water will move
01:45 - and yeah so it's a kind of scientific
01:49 - material you can keep on adding
01:50 - molecules
01:51 - and they range in colors so there's
01:55 - plenty of colors you could choose from
01:57 - so
01:58 - uh yeah anyways let's get started
02:03 - so hey what's up guys i'm back and i
02:05 - just deleted the scratch cat that's it
02:07 - okay
02:08 - yeah you get the point you always have
02:09 - to delete the scratch cat unless if
02:11 - you're making something
02:12 - that concludes the scratch cap and this
02:14 - um
02:15 - we are not so anyways let's just um
02:18 - upload the things from my backpack you
02:20 - can come to my project and export them
02:21 - or you can download them in the google
02:23 - drive
02:24 - and my user's gumball098 so
02:27 - you can come in and um
02:31 - export my sprites so that you can make
02:34 - it for yourself
02:36 - and uh or you can just download it from
02:39 - the google drive
02:40 - and yeah let's just put this in
02:44 - so we got fire this is actually the one
02:45 - from the spring cookout
02:47 - um game not game animation uh so
02:50 - yeah you can get that and this is a
02:53 - little molecule
02:55 - um faster and stuff to make the
02:57 - molecules quicker
02:59 - and this is the molecule itself
03:02 - so the molecule itself is just easy to
03:04 - draw just a circle
03:05 - and then the color for this it doesn't
03:07 - matter what color but
03:09 - you use the swap function over here i'm
03:11 - going to try to draw one on my
03:12 - own just delete this real quick
03:15 - let's draw one of my own let's just oh i
03:19 - should do blue for a swap
03:21 - and then go for like
03:24 - red it's a very interesting color
03:29 - so yeah you basically hold shift
03:32 - and around this size i hope
03:35 - possibly oh maybe a little bit smaller
03:38 - but you get the point guys
03:40 - uh maybe a little bit smaller
03:45 - so yeah you can create customize your
03:47 - own molecules
03:48 - and i hope they all look really good so
03:50 - and next thing
03:52 - i have to draw on this list well you
03:54 - already learned how to draw the fire in
03:55 - the spring cookout animation
03:57 - well it's really hard to draw this thing
03:59 - it's just
04:00 - my dad drew it and so yeah you can just
04:03 - go to my project and export everything
04:06 - so and we have the molecule thing
04:10 - the molecule machine molecular
04:14 - molecular machine so and it's just
04:17 - the same um a circle
04:21 - thing and just paint
04:24 - draw a rectangle or
04:28 - and just reshape it i think that's how
04:30 - you supposed to do it
04:35 - let me try to draw the thing so um so
04:38 - first start out
04:39 - it doesn't matter what color it is just
04:40 - make it a random color
04:42 - and enlarge the rectangle and i'm trying
04:45 - to draw it here
04:46 - and just reshape the sides to make it
04:49 - sort of
04:51 - not a rectangle
04:55 - as you can see um that's actually
04:57 - turning out pretty well
04:59 - it's like one of those index cards
05:02 - or pudding pudding more like pudding so
05:05 - yeah
05:06 - click it and drag it out so yeah it's
05:08 - like make it look like
05:10 - jello maybe so the sides are like kind
05:13 - of circles
05:15 - not really circles like what is those
05:17 - like smooth
05:18 - smooth sides like like a id or something
05:20 - index card
05:22 - and then there we got that and we make
05:23 - the little table under it
05:27 - just brown color and regular fill
05:33 - and drag that thing back
05:37 - and possibly up the saturation a little
05:40 - bit and
05:41 - change this to possibly five
05:46 - as you can see we're putting that in
05:50 - here
05:52 - drag it behind it we're going to use the
05:54 - backwards
05:55 - thing back
06:01 - and we make the two little things
06:04 - other two little things that hold up the
06:06 - table so
06:08 - so we might have to put this thing back
06:09 - in front because i think it looks better
06:11 - originally
06:12 - so yeah you get the point guys and you
06:14 - make the little blue
06:15 - uh uh
06:19 - the little blue rectangles in the back
06:22 - little blue things that hold up it
06:27 - there's also a black line that like you
06:30 - know the back of a table the
06:31 - end of a table has that little thing
06:34 - so why not make it full black
06:41 - you have black
06:44 - there we go
06:50 - and we just extended a little bit
06:56 - blue so the little blue little thing it
06:59 - doesn't matter what color you put it at
07:01 - but the original project was blue so why
07:04 - not
07:06 - make it straight and then tilt it
07:08 - sideways
07:13 - and then tilt done and you just
07:15 - duplicate it
07:16 - make a second one so and you make it go
07:19 - back
07:21 - ctrl c ctrl v
07:24 - flip horizontal and put it on the other
07:27 - side
07:27 - make it back to there we got it
07:31 - our table but i think the original one
07:33 - looks better than this one
07:34 - honestly so let's just delete this and
07:38 - use the original one so remember you can
07:40 - export these sprites in our um
07:42 - my project number09a check out my
07:44 - profile um
07:45 - yeah now let's start coding
07:49 - so the first thing we actually lc'd is
07:52 - um a stop and a button
07:58 - uh adding button and another button this
08:01 - button
08:02 - i think we have to make it a little bit
08:04 - smaller i think it's 50.
08:10 - and we put it around here
08:13 - okay yeah around here and then we put a
08:16 - little
08:17 - edition thing on it
08:21 - so we can oh yeah where's this thing
08:28 - and then we just put shift
08:32 - and we make a line oh
08:36 - and we make another line
08:41 - there we have it we have the
08:45 - uh button the button to add the
08:47 - molecules
08:48 - and now we have to make the stop button
08:51 - so let's just delete this and get a new
08:54 - button
09:00 - and change this thing to here
09:04 - and right we have to change the thing
09:07 - wait a second
09:08 - and put it on black
09:12 - no white white white
09:15 - yes we've got white and then we write
09:18 - stop
09:21 - and yeah we have that we can let's put
09:24 - it in the middle
09:27 - and then yeah we have it
09:31 - and we might actually make the stop
09:33 - larger because it's maybe too small
09:35 - that's around the size and delete this
09:39 - and we're also going to make this 50 and
09:41 - move it somewhere reasonable
09:43 - so
09:46 - here there we have it we have our whole
09:49 - setup
09:50 - done finished and now oh yeah with the
09:52 - backdrop
09:54 - and we have the blue sky too and then
09:57 - finally we start working at on the fire
10:00 - so
10:00 - in my original one we have a fire sound
10:03 - where's the fire sound
10:05 - yeah here
10:09 - so yeah just a fire crackling um and you
10:12 - just have to make it louder
10:17 - so this should be around the good one
10:21 - and you can customize that sound and
10:23 - it'll sound pretty good you know
10:26 - and go forever
10:34 - and make play sound fire until done
10:38 - and then also when green flag is clicked
10:42 - i'll go to
10:43 - x0 negative 155 because i
10:46 - uploaded my backpack doesn't matter
10:48 - where you put it just put it somewhere
10:49 - reasonable
10:50 - and then we have a forever
10:54 - next costume and a weight 0.2
10:58 - for a little weight you know it's better
11:00 - to have a little weight
11:04 - yeah so make it different costumes so
11:07 - look you see
11:08 - fire's moving is making sound and now
11:10 - we're done with that
11:11 - now we just have to work on the molecule
11:13 - generator
11:15 - which should be really simple
11:18 - when green flag is pressed just go to a
11:21 - position
11:23 - and then the molecule itself
11:26 - has the most code in this whole entire
11:29 - script
11:30 - and we might have to use some code that
11:34 - um you might have not used before
11:37 - some operators and i i myself haven't
11:40 - used some of these operators before
11:42 - so let's dive right in so when the green
11:46 - flag is clipped
11:48 - it will clear all the graphic effects
11:51 - because you know
11:52 - um it's just a regular color because you
11:55 - know it always changes color whenever
11:56 - you add a molecule
11:58 - so you want to do a clear graphic effect
12:02 - and set temperature to 20. so this is
12:05 - really tricky you got to make a variable
12:08 - called temp butcher this is how you
12:11 - spell it
12:12 - 10 pair
12:19 - yeah i'm right okay there's the red
12:21 - squiggly line
12:22 - and then for all sprites and then okay
12:27 - and then you see it over here you double
12:30 - click it
12:31 - and you double click it again and then
12:35 - you
12:35 - right click it and you do change slider
12:38 - range
12:40 - so i'm just going to do that again for
12:41 - you i actually want to do that again
12:43 - because
12:44 - so you you know when you make a variable
12:46 - it's always like that
12:48 - double click it double click it
12:52 - right click change slider range and then
12:55 - the minimum you can make
12:57 - 10 or 5 or 1 or whatever
13:01 - and make the maximum 200 or you can do 2
13:03 - 000 but your choice
13:05 - and then okay so you can now increase it
13:08 - and decrease it and the lowest is 10.
13:12 - so now and then you use when the
13:15 - clear graphic effects and you set
13:18 - temperature
13:25 - set temperature to 20
13:30 - and then you create clone of myself
13:36 - and then you'll hide
13:42 - so actually i had a variable this whole
13:43 - entire time called speed because i've
13:45 - done this project before
13:46 - and i actually got it from the old
13:48 - project so
13:49 - i have a variable called speed and i
13:51 - will delete it and show you how to make
13:53 - it
13:53 - and do not make it yet because it's only
13:55 - for the sprite only so i'll show you
13:57 - in a moment once we get to that point
13:59 - and then when i start as a clone
14:00 - it'll go to x00 and then
14:04 - it will and then no point in direction
14:09 - um
14:09 - [Music]
14:12 - pick random so it'll like
14:15 - range
14:18 - so so when it starts they'll either
14:21 - bounce up on the
14:22 - left side or the right side so that's
14:25 - why we have
14:26 - negative 89 to 89
14:31 - yeah so and it will bounce either
14:34 - left or right left or right
14:38 - left or right and then we have go to the
14:41 - front layer
14:45 - and then it will set color effect
14:50 - where's the set i barely use the set
14:52 - color effect
14:53 - uh um block because i always use the
14:55 - chain color effect so
14:57 - pick random 0
15:00 - to 300 and it will show
15:06 - we also have a forever loop next
15:10 - and this is where it gets really tricky
15:13 - you add a set speed variable so let's
15:17 - make a
15:17 - let's just delete this variable right
15:19 - now delete and then make a new variable
15:23 - speed spent speed
15:27 - and then for this sprite only
15:31 - i'm using clone so that's why we only
15:34 - make it for
15:35 - this sprite only so okay and we have the
15:38 - set speed
15:41 - to temperature divided by 10.
15:44 - let's get the divide
15:55 - just close this real quick and then next
15:58 - we have to do
15:59 - if then
16:03 - um that you have you need a
16:07 - so you have this is the trickiest part
16:10 - of this whole entire place
16:12 - so first you need one of these blocks
16:15 - and then you put x position
16:19 - right in front of it and then
16:23 - oh at least i can never ride is that
16:25 - wrong you keep the exposition though
16:27 - and then you use abs and your abs means
16:31 - absolute value so
16:33 - if there's negative 100 what's the
16:35 - absolute value 100
16:36 - so abs of x
16:40 - position is
16:43 - greater than 150.
16:51 - so put that in
16:56 - so the reason why you need 150 is
16:58 - because
16:59 - actually varies of how big your box is
17:02 - so if your box was bigger
17:03 - that means you need a maybe a larger
17:06 - number or a smaller number if your box
17:08 - was smaller
17:08 - so and the reason of this is because if
17:11 - you use a line
17:13 - and you put it so i'm gonna paint a line
17:18 - maybe like 10 thickness um
17:22 - and you put a line
17:27 - well shift it
17:34 - and then i'm going to get a line shift
17:38 - oh straight so and you move this to the
17:40 - molecule thing
17:43 - so side what is the position of the line
17:45 - negative 166.
17:48 - so that means you got a minus around 10
17:51 - because of the um yeah you have to minus
17:54 - around 10
17:56 - on both sides which is 169 the other
17:58 - side is negative 160 something
18:01 - so and that's why you minus 10
18:04 - for the sides and so i'm going to delete
18:08 - the line sprite
18:10 - that's why you use absolute uh i that's
18:13 - how you use 150 so
18:14 - i'm going to delete this line sprite
18:17 - real quick
18:19 - go back to the molecule
18:22 - and let's keep let's continue and you
18:25 - need
18:25 - inside that you need a point in
18:28 - direction
18:34 - you need to multiply
18:37 - you need one direction negative one
18:43 - direction because it'll turn it negative
18:48 - i'll turn it to the opposite side
18:51 - because if it was
18:52 - this side it would go this side and it
18:55 - goes this side
18:58 - yeah so it'll point in direction
19:01 - negative one times direction because
19:05 - if you had 90 then it'll go negative 90.
19:09 - so it will just move around the molecule
19:11 - generator
19:13 - and then you have another if then
19:15 - statement
19:19 - if then um so it's the same thing as
19:23 - this except a hundred and
19:25 - and this is x y position so this is y
19:28 - position
19:31 - and then you have a hundred
19:35 - so abs of y position is greater than 100
19:40 - and then you have to point in direction
19:48 - 180 minus direction
19:56 - minus direction and then
20:01 - so small numbers are up and big numbers
20:03 - are down so if you had the point in
20:05 - direction
20:06 - that means you had to go up so
20:09 - because look zero right and then you go
20:13 - back down that's 180
20:15 - so you have that in 180
20:18 - minus direction so it's something random
20:21 - and you have the one
20:22 - like up here it'll go back down
20:26 - and then if it's down it will go up
20:29 - so that's the um basically what this
20:33 - means
20:34 - oh yeah and it's a hundred because you
20:36 - have to draw a line and
20:38 - i'll show you this you need a ten
20:44 - and then you move it up 112 so minus 10
20:49 - so it's 102. so about that
20:51 - uh size and look there's 114 so you
20:54 - minus
20:54 - the 10 and you'll make it to negative
20:57 - 110.
20:58 - now a hundred so yeah so that's that's
21:01 - the meaning of
21:03 - the molecule and now you go to the
21:06 - molecule
21:07 - and you'll give a little bit code left
21:10 - and it's move speed steps
21:16 - because i'll move the amount of
21:19 - the temperature so that means yeah
21:22 - because of this
21:23 - if it's higher it will move quicker
21:27 - and if it's lower it'll move slower so
21:30 - and then when i receive
21:33 - delete oh yeah yeah we have to finish
21:37 - something before we do that i literally
21:39 - forgot
21:39 - and then we haven't finished this
21:42 - when this sprite is clicked create clone
21:46 - of
21:46 - molecule that's all you have to do for
21:48 - this because
21:49 - you have to create a clone of molecule
21:54 - because you're creating another of these
21:55 - molecules so the
21:57 - button three and you have
22:00 - when this sprite is clicked and button
22:02 - three is the stop button so
22:04 - when this sprite is clicked
22:07 - it will broadcast delete all molecules
22:10 - and that's what leads back
22:12 - to that broadcast delete all molecules
22:20 - and we have that and go over here and
22:23 - when i receive delete all molecules
22:26 - if i'm not mistaken it will delete this
22:29 - clone
22:32 - and that is the game
22:35 - so yeah here's a minimize to rev up
22:39 - under code so
22:40 - here we go fire sound check
22:43 - uh molecule temperature
22:47 - slower quicker slower
22:50 - slower and we have another one another
22:54 - one another one another one another one
22:55 - another one so
22:56 - you can just spam this and it's like if
22:59 - it's 61 it goes at this pace
23:02 - but it feels like 200 would be whirring
23:06 - all over the place but if it was like
23:08 - 10 let's click the stop button there all
23:11 - the volunteers then you add one
23:13 - and it's a peaceful boy 200 yeah
23:17 - and you know
23:20 - there we have it so like
23:24 - you could like play around with this uh
23:27 - molecule uh thing and
23:31 - accelerator so you can like
23:34 - get a bunch of molecules
23:38 - and have some fun
23:41 - so yeah that's basically what this game
23:44 - is about it's scientific it's science
23:46 - and
23:47 - please like share subscribe and comment
23:49 - in the comment section below
23:51 - other games you want to see on our
23:52 - channel so that we can make it for you
23:54 - guys
23:55 - so anyways um oh yeah one more thing
23:58 - uh so if you guys comment like really
24:00 - hard things i cannot do it like
24:03 - what if you like said a scrolling cloud
24:06 - platformer
24:07 - a maze whatever and i i cannot do that
24:11 - honestly so maybe one of you guys can do
24:13 - that and

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here and today we're back for another video on scratch and today we're making um a sort of scientific um molecule game called molecules in motion and um it's kind of like science because if you didn't learn this at school yet um let's just start it you start at one molecule you can add molecules it's kind of a scientific science if you're like a teacher oh you can use this material um well not really but like still you know uh you can start at 10. this is one it's really cold and i know there's a fire under it just ignore that and this is like when it's really cold the wall kills move slower like in real life if you're colder you'll move slower um obviously and if it gets hotter it'll get quicker and yeah so uh it can go really really slow like just really really slow this is like winter no this is like fall maybe no this is like fall and then this is like spring and this is summer so it's like um the molecules moving this is probably when you're boiling something like if you're boiling water or like um uh i don't know uh vegetables whatever then the molecules in the water will move and yeah so it's a kind of scientific material you can keep on adding molecules and they range in colors so there's plenty of colors you could choose from so uh yeah anyways let's get started so hey what's up guys i'm back and i just deleted the scratch cat that's it okay yeah you get the point you always have to delete the scratch cat unless if you're making something that concludes the scratch cap and this um we are not so anyways let's just um upload the things from my backpack you can come to my project and export them or you can download them in the google drive and my user's gumball098 so you can come in and um export my sprites so that you can make it for yourself and uh or you can just download it from the google drive and yeah let's just put this in so we got fire this is actually the one from the spring cookout um game not game animation uh so yeah you can get that and this is a little molecule um faster and stuff to make the molecules quicker and this is the molecule itself so the molecule itself is just easy to draw just a circle and then the color for this it doesn't matter what color but you use the swap function over here i'm going to try to draw one on my own just delete this real quick let's draw one of my own let's just oh i should do blue for a swap and then go for like red it's a very interesting color so yeah you basically hold shift and around this size i hope possibly oh maybe a little bit smaller but you get the point guys uh maybe a little bit smaller so yeah you can create customize your own molecules and i hope they all look really good so and next thing i have to draw on this list well you already learned how to draw the fire in the spring cookout animation well it's really hard to draw this thing it's just my dad drew it and so yeah you can just go to my project and export everything so and we have the molecule thing the molecule machine molecular molecular machine so and it's just the same um a circle thing and just paint draw a rectangle or and just reshape it i think that's how you supposed to do it let me try to draw the thing so um so first start out it doesn't matter what color it is just make it a random color and enlarge the rectangle and i'm trying to draw it here and just reshape the sides to make it sort of not a rectangle as you can see um that's actually turning out pretty well it's like one of those index cards or pudding pudding more like pudding so yeah click it and drag it out so yeah it's like make it look like jello maybe so the sides are like kind of circles not really circles like what is those like smooth smooth sides like like a id or something index card and then there we got that and we make the little table under it just brown color and regular fill and drag that thing back and possibly up the saturation a little bit and change this to possibly five as you can see we're putting that in here drag it behind it we're going to use the backwards thing back and we make the two little things other two little things that hold up the table so so we might have to put this thing back in front because i think it looks better originally so yeah you get the point guys and you make the little blue uh uh the little blue rectangles in the back little blue things that hold up it there's also a black line that like you know the back of a table the end of a table has that little thing so why not make it full black you have black there we go and we just extended a little bit blue so the little blue little thing it doesn't matter what color you put it at but the original project was blue so why not make it straight and then tilt it sideways and then tilt done and you just duplicate it make a second one so and you make it go back ctrl c ctrl v flip horizontal and put it on the other side make it back to there we got it our table but i think the original one looks better than this one honestly so let's just delete this and use the original one so remember you can export these sprites in our um my project number09a check out my profile um yeah now let's start coding so the first thing we actually lc'd is um a stop and a button uh adding button and another button this button i think we have to make it a little bit smaller i think it's 50. and we put it around here okay yeah around here and then we put a little edition thing on it so we can oh yeah where's this thing and then we just put shift and we make a line oh and we make another line there we have it we have the uh button the button to add the molecules and now we have to make the stop button so let's just delete this and get a new button and change this thing to here and right we have to change the thing wait a second and put it on black no white white white yes we've got white and then we write stop and yeah we have that we can let's put it in the middle and then yeah we have it and we might actually make the stop larger because it's maybe too small that's around the size and delete this and we're also going to make this 50 and move it somewhere reasonable so here there we have it we have our whole setup done finished and now oh yeah with the backdrop and we have the blue sky too and then finally we start working at on the fire so in my original one we have a fire sound where's the fire sound yeah here so yeah just a fire crackling um and you just have to make it louder so this should be around the good one and you can customize that sound and it'll sound pretty good you know and go forever and make play sound fire until done and then also when green flag is clicked i'll go to x0 negative 155 because i uploaded my backpack doesn't matter where you put it just put it somewhere reasonable and then we have a forever next costume and a weight 0.2 for a little weight you know it's better to have a little weight yeah so make it different costumes so look you see fire's moving is making sound and now we're done with that now we just have to work on the molecule generator which should be really simple when green flag is pressed just go to a position and then the molecule itself has the most code in this whole entire script and we might have to use some code that um you might have not used before some operators and i i myself haven't used some of these operators before so let's dive right in so when the green flag is clipped it will clear all the graphic effects because you know um it's just a regular color because you know it always changes color whenever you add a molecule so you want to do a clear graphic effect and set temperature to 20. so this is really tricky you got to make a variable called temp butcher this is how you spell it 10 pair yeah i'm right okay there's the red squiggly line and then for all sprites and then okay and then you see it over here you double click it and you double click it again and then you right click it and you do change slider range so i'm just going to do that again for you i actually want to do that again because so you you know when you make a variable it's always like that double click it double click it right click change slider range and then the minimum you can make 10 or 5 or 1 or whatever and make the maximum 200 or you can do 2 000 but your choice and then okay so you can now increase it and decrease it and the lowest is 10. so now and then you use when the clear graphic effects and you set temperature set temperature to 20 and then you create clone of myself and then you'll hide so actually i had a variable this whole entire time called speed because i've done this project before and i actually got it from the old project so i have a variable called speed and i will delete it and show you how to make it and do not make it yet because it's only for the sprite only so i'll show you in a moment once we get to that point and then when i start as a clone it'll go to x00 and then it will and then no point in direction um pick random so it'll like range so so when it starts they'll either bounce up on the left side or the right side so that's why we have negative 89 to 89 yeah so and it will bounce either left or right left or right left or right and then we have go to the front layer and then it will set color effect where's the set i barely use the set color effect uh um block because i always use the chain color effect so pick random 0 to 300 and it will show we also have a forever loop next and this is where it gets really tricky you add a set speed variable so let's make a let's just delete this variable right now delete and then make a new variable speed spent speed and then for this sprite only i'm using clone so that's why we only make it for this sprite only so okay and we have the set speed to temperature divided by 10. let's get the divide just close this real quick and then next we have to do if then um that you have you need a so you have this is the trickiest part of this whole entire place so first you need one of these blocks and then you put x position right in front of it and then oh at least i can never ride is that wrong you keep the exposition though and then you use abs and your abs means absolute value so if there's negative 100 what's the absolute value 100 so abs of x position is greater than 150. so put that in so the reason why you need 150 is because actually varies of how big your box is so if your box was bigger that means you need a maybe a larger number or a smaller number if your box was smaller so and the reason of this is because if you use a line and you put it so i'm gonna paint a line maybe like 10 thickness um and you put a line well shift it and then i'm going to get a line shift oh straight so and you move this to the molecule thing so side what is the position of the line negative 166. so that means you got a minus around 10 because of the um yeah you have to minus around 10 on both sides which is 169 the other side is negative 160 something so and that's why you minus 10 for the sides and so i'm going to delete the line sprite that's why you use absolute uh i that's how you use 150 so i'm going to delete this line sprite real quick go back to the molecule and let's keep let's continue and you need inside that you need a point in direction you need to multiply you need one direction negative one direction because it'll turn it negative i'll turn it to the opposite side because if it was this side it would go this side and it goes this side yeah so it'll point in direction negative one times direction because if you had 90 then it'll go negative 90. so it will just move around the molecule generator and then you have another if then statement if then um so it's the same thing as this except a hundred and and this is x y position so this is y position and then you have a hundred so abs of y position is greater than 100 and then you have to point in direction 180 minus direction minus direction and then so small numbers are up and big numbers are down so if you had the point in direction that means you had to go up so because look zero right and then you go back down that's 180 so you have that in 180 minus direction so it's something random and you have the one like up here it'll go back down and then if it's down it will go up so that's the um basically what this means oh yeah and it's a hundred because you have to draw a line and i'll show you this you need a ten and then you move it up 112 so minus 10 so it's 102. so about that uh size and look there's 114 so you minus the 10 and you'll make it to negative 110. now a hundred so yeah so that's that's the meaning of the molecule and now you go to the molecule and you'll give a little bit code left and it's move speed steps because i'll move the amount of the temperature so that means yeah because of this if it's higher it will move quicker and if it's lower it'll move slower so and then when i receive delete oh yeah yeah we have to finish something before we do that i literally forgot and then we haven't finished this when this sprite is clicked create clone of molecule that's all you have to do for this because you have to create a clone of molecule because you're creating another of these molecules so the button three and you have when this sprite is clicked and button three is the stop button so when this sprite is clicked it will broadcast delete all molecules and that's what leads back to that broadcast delete all molecules and we have that and go over here and when i receive delete all molecules if i'm not mistaken it will delete this clone and that is the game so yeah here's a minimize to rev up under code so here we go fire sound check uh molecule temperature slower quicker slower slower and we have another one another one another one another one another one another one so you can just spam this and it's like if it's 61 it goes at this pace but it feels like 200 would be whirring all over the place but if it was like 10 let's click the stop button there all the volunteers then you add one and it's a peaceful boy 200 yeah and you know there we have it so like you could like play around with this uh molecule uh thing and accelerator so you can like get a bunch of molecules and have some fun so yeah that's basically what this game is about it's scientific it's science and please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below other games you want to see on our channel so that we can make it for you guys so anyways um oh yeah one more thing uh so if you guys comment like really hard things i cannot do it like what if you like said a scrolling cloud platformer a maze whatever and i i cannot do that honestly so maybe one of you guys can do that and anyways um school is starting so we might post less videos but at least we'll try to post once every week or two weeks so anyway anyways please like share subscribe and comment down um ideas below so that we can make your games into reality see you guys next time
