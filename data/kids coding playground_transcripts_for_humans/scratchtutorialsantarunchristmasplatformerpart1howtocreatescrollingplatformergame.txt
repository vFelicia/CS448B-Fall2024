00:03 - [Music]
00:08 - hello guys and welcome back to kids
00:10 - coding playground
00:11 - so today we're going to work on this
00:13 - center run scrolling platformer game
00:16 - i think we showed it last week
00:19 - we showed the gameplay how it works so
00:22 - if you guys have not seen that you can
00:24 - watch our first video
00:25 - with the gameplay and get idea what this
00:27 - game is about so basically you have the
00:30 - center
00:30 - you kind of run around and uh in the
00:33 - platform and try to avoid the
00:34 - tiger and some traps um
00:38 - as you can see i took the actual my game
00:40 - before from the
00:42 - among us platformer and then trying to
00:44 - create this game
00:45 - so that you that's why you see the
00:46 - smasher and the
00:48 - trampoline but i'm not using that at the
00:50 - moment so otherwise
00:52 - other than that i'm using other stuff
00:55 - okay and then next
00:58 - so we'll be learning these uh following
01:01 - concept in scratch
01:02 - the key to control the sprites uh which
01:04 - is the center move
01:06 - broadcast messages custom block uh
01:08 - variable and then the
01:10 - platforming scrolling logic and then the
01:13 - background like scrolling
01:14 - so that it looks better for the game and
01:17 - then these are the
01:18 - links below i'll keep it on the video as
01:21 - well you can download the original
01:24 - game tile set for the uh window
01:27 - tile set and then the santa claus and
01:30 - then the tiger
01:31 - but uh this tiger this sheets here you
01:34 - actually have to cut it
01:35 - so we actually use a game maker studio
01:38 - to actually cut the
01:40 - tiger and then clean up the background
01:42 - and adjust it so that it looks right so
01:44 - i can give you the tiger one
01:46 - but the uh the uh santa claus one that
01:50 - you can actually make it yourself you
01:51 - download it from here
01:53 - all right so i'll show you guys how to
01:54 - do that
01:56 - okay all right so we are in our uh
01:59 - scratch project so this is our scratch
02:01 - project
02:02 - i do have things in my backpack uh but
02:04 - i'm gonna show you how to do it as well
02:06 - so let's say i take the main character
02:09 - out and then my santa claus so far okay
02:12 - let's just take these two
02:14 - so and then i will show you but 7 cards
02:16 - have a lot of different
02:18 - costume so what i'm going to show you is
02:21 - so i have my um
02:23 - black box so for the black box uh
02:27 - i actually have i have two set so you
02:30 - can see here there's a bigger one
02:32 - and then there's a smaller one so
02:34 - basically because
02:35 - when the center switch to sliding and
02:37 - when the center slide across the
02:39 - spike you want to have a lower uh
02:42 - box uh hitbox so that it will not get
02:45 - hit by the spike
02:46 - so that's why i actually have two okay
02:49 - so what you have to do
02:50 - is let's say you go to your center you
02:52 - take a ctrl a ctrl c
02:55 - so you want to make the hit box around
02:57 - the same size as your center clasp as
02:59 - you can see it's a little bit smaller
03:00 - than my center clasp
03:02 - right so that's why you want the hitbox
03:04 - around that okay
03:05 - and then trying to adjust the sender and
03:07 - the hitbox at the center you see when i
03:09 - move it
03:10 - you hit the center so make sure that you
03:12 - adjust your
03:13 - your bar uh black box or whatever color
03:16 - box you want to use
03:17 - in the center okay so same thing for the
03:20 - slide so this is for the small one
03:23 - so the small one is for the slide so
03:25 - same thing let's say i take this one
03:28 - my center and then i go here
03:31 - so as you can see the slide is kind of
03:33 - in the middle of the center
03:34 - so center is in the middle here so it's
03:36 - not exactly middle so you see this
03:38 - because the center is a little bit lower
03:40 - so but i still want to adjust it so that
03:43 - way it's kind of lined up to the middle
03:45 - so when you when you create your santa
03:47 - claus uh
03:48 - sprite is very important that you keep
03:50 - it all online so i'll show you what i
03:52 - mean
03:52 - so let's say i don't have a scent yet
03:55 - right let's say i
03:56 - i don't have anything so what you can do
03:58 - is go paint it'll give you a new sprite
04:01 - so in here what you can do is you can
04:03 - click on this upload
04:05 - and here you you just pick wherever your
04:07 - your what once you download the santa
04:09 - claus
04:10 - sprite you can extract it when you
04:12 - extract it you have something like this
04:14 - um just go into the png
04:17 - location and you can see all the center
04:20 - so uh whatever you want to use so let's
04:22 - say idle i only use one of them i did
04:24 - not make
04:24 - idle actually moving that's not going to
04:27 - take more
04:28 - um you know like if santa doesn't move
04:31 - it move a little bit i don't think it's
04:33 - really needed because
04:34 - actually gonna cause some problem with
04:37 - the game
04:37 - and also make it slower so i only use
04:41 - one of the idle costumes so if you want
04:43 - only one just take one
04:45 - so you just take like let's say the
04:47 - costume for the center
04:48 - right this is your first costume and
04:50 - then whatever or whatever you need let's
04:52 - say you need the um
04:55 - like the running right let's say running
04:58 - then you take the
04:59 - running from like one
05:02 - just hold the shift key and then
05:05 - all the way over here to run so this
05:08 - will be all your runnings right
05:10 - so when you load all your running sprite
05:12 - in as you can see right um
05:16 - you can change it so what i did was i
05:17 - actually change it to like one
05:19 - or something like that or for i don't
05:22 - only use one then you don't need the one
05:24 - you can keep it like blank right for
05:26 - these i
05:27 - i didn't like the parentheses so
05:29 - actually for me actually rename it like
05:31 - this
05:31 - what run one run two whatever
05:34 - but uh the important thing is that you
05:37 - want to
05:38 - make sure that you want to keep the
05:40 - center in the middle
05:41 - so what you have to do is this either
05:43 - click on the vector convert to vector
05:45 - and then you can move the center in the
05:47 - middle because what we have is we have
05:49 - the
05:50 - gray black box also in the middle so you
05:53 - kind of have to adjust the center so
05:54 - let's see
05:55 - i'll take the center let's see it's
05:56 - about the same size my black box yep
05:58 - it's about the same size so it's good
06:00 - so if you don't have the black box the
06:02 - same size you can make it the same size
06:04 - just draw this square
06:06 - like this let's draw the black box okay
06:08 - and no outline
06:10 - so once you have your center so you have
06:12 - to adjust each of the costume so
06:14 - it takes a little bit time so make sure
06:16 - you convert it to
06:18 - vector and then oops sorry
06:21 - and then you click on click on this and
06:23 - adjust it to the middle
06:24 - so center class so you have to make sure
06:26 - all your center is adjusted in the
06:28 - middle
06:29 - and then uh same thing for the dead and
06:31 - then same thing for the jump
06:33 - so same thing so i just show you the run
06:35 - so exactly
06:36 - so if you look at my original one same
06:38 - thing
06:39 - i did the run right after i did the run
06:43 - i have the jump so this is center
06:46 - jumping
06:47 - so i all my costume i have converted to
06:49 - a vector so that i can move them around
06:52 - so make sure that you see when i move it
06:54 - you see the cross is in the middle
06:56 - so right so make sure you have that in
06:58 - the middle
06:59 - for all your costume except for the
07:01 - slide
07:02 - so the slide one you do not want to have
07:03 - the middle or the dead
07:05 - so those are a little bit different so
07:07 - these may be a little bit down
07:09 - right since the center is a little bit
07:11 - down so you can just adjust it you can
07:13 - put like a little tape around
07:14 - here on the top so you can and on the
07:17 - side so that you could
07:18 - kind of see it just how you want to
07:20 - adjust your center clasp so that it
07:22 - looks more
07:23 - more or less like you know uh in the
07:27 - right position
07:28 - right so same thing for the slide so the
07:30 - slide is a little bit you see it's not
07:32 - exactly
07:33 - um you see this it's not exactly on the
07:35 - middle right because the slide is down
07:37 - so make sure that the center is the same
07:40 - same
07:40 - location as the feet of the center like
07:43 - for this one
07:44 - so the slide should be in the same
07:46 - location as the
07:47 - idle right for the feet so like right
07:51 - here
07:53 - so you see how how the slide and the
07:55 - center standing is around the same
07:57 - location
07:58 - so that's what you want to do okay so
08:00 - enough of that
08:02 - so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
08:04 - trash the uh this one
08:05 - so uh if you guys really would like to
08:08 - learn actually you would it's better to
08:10 - you do it yourself if you want i can
08:12 - also upload these guys for you
08:15 - okay all right so we're done with that
08:18 - so next thing uh so this first video we
08:22 - probably won't do too much of the coding
08:23 - or more of a setup so next thing let's
08:26 - say we have something called
08:28 - uh the sprite for the ground
08:31 - and then we have something called
08:32 - virtual ground so what i'm gonna explain
08:35 - to you is this
08:36 - so the ground is like the each of the
08:38 - costume
08:39 - that you build for your level so you can
08:41 - name it like 1-1
08:43 - 1-2 and h3 however you want to name it
08:47 - so you want to name this similar thing
08:49 - for your
08:50 - virtual ground you see how my virtual
08:52 - ground and my uh
08:54 - actual ground is the same so you see
08:56 - this so what you want to do
08:58 - is in the other platform we usually
09:00 - don't have uh
09:01 - platform always stands on right so the
09:04 - thing is if you do that
09:05 - and if you have background sprite then
09:08 - if you play with that then the the
09:10 - sprite will actually climb under the
09:12 - tree
09:12 - so that's what you don't want right so
09:15 - what you can do is you create one set
09:17 - of uh platform that has the design
09:21 - and then you have another set that is
09:23 - actually going to be the hitbox so this
09:25 - is the actual so the virtual background
09:27 - is going to
09:28 - detect the touching of the center
09:31 - right this is more of a design
09:34 - so so you do the design work here uh
09:38 - whatever you do the design work uh for
09:40 - the ground you do the same thing
09:42 - for the uh for the virtual uh area
09:45 - so basically let's say if i take a copy
09:47 - of this i say control a
09:50 - and i go here i say control v as you can
09:52 - see
09:53 - uh my my my hit box is the same place as
09:56 - the um
09:58 - this this uh this this thing right you
10:00 - see that
10:01 - the hitbox is exactly the same so you
10:03 - have to adjust your hit box so that
10:05 - the virtual ground is the same place as
10:09 - your
10:09 - uh you know a little bit lower uh than
10:12 - the uh
10:12 - the uh you know the uh the design one
10:16 - so that way you know you can keep it the
10:18 - way
10:19 - you can keep the ground and then the so
10:22 - that looks like the center standing on
10:24 - the ground
10:25 - so so this is how you do the design so
10:28 - this is like my level two
10:29 - so my level two have something up right
10:32 - so same thing here i have something up
10:35 - right in here
10:36 - so that's how you do it okay so this is
10:38 - just like square
10:40 - you can just draw the square box here uh
10:42 - without the without the
10:44 - outline whatever color you want so i
10:46 - have blue
10:47 - uh you can have it red or black or
10:49 - whatever doesn't really matter
10:51 - so and then like number three i have a
10:53 - gap here same thing here so this one i
10:55 - have a gap here so make sure you have
10:56 - the similar
10:57 - graph gap so what i can do is i can give
11:00 - you guys some of these um
11:01 - let's say um one two five or something
11:05 - like that
11:05 - and then you guys can build on to the
11:07 - rest so um that way you can have
11:10 - different design
11:10 - not the same as me right so um if i give
11:13 - you
11:14 - uh one to five i think you'll give you
11:15 - enough idea how to do it right
11:17 - so you can just place any way you want
11:20 - and then you can just copy these
11:21 - whatever you want just copy them you can
11:24 - group them together
11:25 - as one right and then you can move them
11:28 - and you can like copy uh like let's say
11:31 - if i want to build a new one it's pretty
11:32 - easy right so
11:33 - let's say i just paint new sprite
11:37 - right so if i want to let's say i want
11:40 - something like similar to this
11:42 - guy let's say i'll take this and then
11:45 - i'll go to my new sprite
11:46 - and i paste it down here right and then
11:49 - i can delete the tree let's say i want
11:51 - that for the rock
11:53 - i can highlight this copy and then i say
11:56 - okay put a rock over here
11:58 - so this is my new one so let's say i
12:00 - want a tree
12:03 - so i will say copy this convert to
12:05 - vector let me do that
12:07 - copy that and then you can go here i can
12:10 - put the tree let's say the
12:11 - trees on this side you can make it
12:13 - smaller whatever
12:15 - whatever design you want and if you want
12:17 - the tree to be taller you can drag it up
12:19 - so something like this right so that way
12:21 - you can
12:22 - design your your level okay
12:26 - so that's that's pretty much it so i'll
12:28 - trash this so you guys understand how to
12:30 - do that
12:31 - i'll give you this uh all my uh i
12:34 - already
12:34 - cut it and put it in the place right
12:36 - place some of them
12:37 - so you can actually do the hill and
12:39 - stuff like that so you just kind of move
12:41 - them
12:42 - around whatever you like so like this
12:44 - one the bridge actually
12:45 - put a bridge in there and uh you can put
12:48 - a tree
12:49 - so different design right so this one
12:51 - has some ice cube
12:53 - a box that way you can jump on it from
12:55 - the center
12:56 - so and then these things you can move it
12:58 - in the back so
13:00 - if you move in the back layer like let's
13:01 - say the let's say the trees in the front
13:03 - you want to put them in the back click
13:05 - on this so that way you know the trees
13:07 - in the back
13:08 - this thing so when you have something
13:09 - like this make sure you have also have
13:11 - the same
13:12 - kind of style in your in your uh virtual
13:15 - ground
13:16 - so for example this is 2 4 right so you
13:19 - go to my virtual
13:20 - ground 2 4 you can see that you have
13:23 - this
13:23 - and then you have this box so this is
13:25 - the two ice cube
13:26 - this is the platform on top and this is
13:28 - a
13:29 - wooden box so same thing here
13:33 - so if i if i have to copy this and paste
13:35 - it in here will be exactly the same
13:37 - location
13:38 - so these you can just use the uh this
13:42 - uh uh this uh reshape tool to reshape
13:45 - the uh
13:46 - the square right whatever you want so
13:49 - let's say the square you draw a square
13:50 - like this
13:52 - and then you can use the reshape tool
13:54 - you can like
13:55 - bend it down a little bit you know
13:57 - whatever you want
13:59 - right something like this right
14:03 - and then if you it depends on how how
14:07 - your platform looks like right so just
14:09 - bend it in in the way that looks like
14:11 - this right
14:13 - something like that
14:16 - right something like that i mean i'm
14:18 - doing a little bit better here but uh
14:20 - this is just an example what it looked
14:21 - like
14:22 - so all right okay and then
14:26 - for the scrolling background i'll show
14:29 - you how that's to be done
14:31 - so what i did is i only had one
14:35 - one so uh what i did was i put some tree
14:38 - here some tree here
14:40 - as you can see and then i put some water
14:43 - block
14:44 - here and then i put a little bit of
14:46 - white this is like a white
14:48 - uh color uh thing i draw and then i
14:51 - reshape it
14:52 - so it looks like a snow right on top of
14:55 - that
14:55 - and then i put some little uh small um
14:58 - you know bush and then rocks and then
15:01 - crystal behind there
15:03 - so this is my background for scrolling
15:05 - so uh
15:06 - so that later you know when we look make
15:08 - it look like you know the scrolling is
15:10 - in the background
15:12 - and then center is like jumping here and
15:14 - then it looks really good
15:15 - so this is similar to how we designed
15:17 - the other one just design one page
15:19 - i only have one i mean you can obviously
15:22 - have more than one
15:23 - but really we don't really need more
15:25 - than one actually so what we can do is
15:27 - we can flip this uh
15:29 - uh sprite uh left and right uh
15:32 - uh so basically from negative 90 to 90
15:34 - so that will look a little bit different
15:36 - so
15:37 - so like this is regular right not 90. so
15:39 - if you flip it around then you have the
15:41 - three tree on this side and you have one
15:42 - tree on this side
15:44 - so that way you know the scrolling will
15:45 - be look really good
15:47 - uh if you have more obviously will look
15:49 - better i don't have more i only have one
15:52 - okay okay let me get all my sprites set
15:56 - up so that next
15:57 - uh video we can do our coding so we have
16:00 - the uh spike
16:01 - and we have the enemy and then with the
16:04 - item
16:06 - and we have the sound so i'll explain
16:09 - how each of them will work
16:11 - so the so here
16:15 - we have the spike so the spike is pretty
16:17 - easy that's the costume you make the
16:19 - three uh red triangle
16:21 - kind of put them together okay
16:24 - the enemy this is the one that is a
16:26 - little bit hard so i have to actually
16:28 - draw it
16:29 - i mean i'll cut it and uh from the
16:31 - sprite sheet and clean it up
16:33 - so and then i put it into the uh correct
16:36 - position
16:37 - for the cat so there's like three
16:39 - costumes for the cat
16:41 - and then i repeat three more costumes
16:44 - for the cat
16:45 - for the running so that it looks more
16:47 - you know
16:48 - better with the running and then i have
16:50 - the strike
16:51 - where the cat actually hits something so
16:54 - it has this strike and then the strike
16:57 - and then the strike so this is the
16:59 - yellow cat yellow
17:00 - tiger i guess and then this is the white
17:02 - tiger so i just named it like white
17:04 - tiger run
17:05 - yellow tiger run right two three
17:08 - four and then there's the tiger
17:11 - same thing right and then i have the
17:13 - howling and then this
17:15 - is this is from the sprite if you don't
17:17 - like this red then you can remove it but
17:20 - i have like that so if you touch the red
17:22 - part you will also get killed
17:24 - by the tiger so that's a little bit
17:26 - annoying with the white tiger
17:28 - but you can remove it if you like just
17:30 - erase it
17:31 - okay so that's the tiger one
17:35 - and then the item the item is uh just a
17:38 - two of the uh
17:39 - snowflake that i got online so this is
17:42 - the white snowflake as you can see is
17:44 - white
17:45 - and this is the blue snowflake okay and
17:48 - you can get a png file download like uh
17:51 - you know
17:52 - snowflake png or something like that and
17:54 - i can give it to you if you'd like
17:56 - and this is just a sound i just
17:58 - downloaded icon online
18:00 - you can do anything you like you don't
18:02 - have to actually
18:03 - have an icon you can just make one
18:06 - simple sprite
18:07 - so what the sound we are going to do is
18:09 - we can lower all the sound into this
18:11 - sprite
18:12 - here so that way we can um
18:15 - later on we can have different sound
18:17 - playing so we will not actually have any
18:19 - sound on the tiger or on the on the
18:22 - on the um you know
18:25 - the animated character or the main
18:27 - character so everything will be here
18:30 - so uh you can have the jump sound and
18:33 - then this is the ouch
18:35 - uh i mean i made this sound i recorded
18:37 - it's kind of bad if you guys don't want
18:39 - it you can trash it make your own
18:41 - i just like look like this and then
18:43 - there's the plunge sound this is the
18:44 - water you can get that from uh
18:47 - the sprite library it drops into the
18:50 - water
18:51 - this is the music that i got from
18:54 - online from google uh
18:58 - our youtube channel they give out free
19:01 - uh
19:02 - song so i got this song so this song is
19:05 - pretty nice
19:06 - i like it so there's a good
19:10 - little black background music i found
19:12 - that it's really good
19:13 - it's uh called invisible ability okay by
19:16 - this person
19:18 - so pretty good and then this
19:21 - is the thing sound and then this is
19:23 - another thing
19:24 - so just some sounds here we have so this
19:28 - is pretty much the
19:29 - setup for the game so once we have this
19:31 - then then
19:32 - and then the background what i did was
19:36 - this
19:38 - so for the background um what i did was
19:41 - this i
19:42 - i'll show you so it's a little tricky
19:45 - over here
19:46 - so the the background i
19:50 - have it so if you click a look at my
19:52 - background it has like multiple layer
19:55 - okay you see this so what happened is
19:58 - the
19:58 - original background does not have um
20:01 - let me show you what i mean so if i go
20:04 - to this
20:05 - resource oops back
20:09 - um the winter tile set
20:12 - uh the background so this is the
20:15 - original background
20:18 - if you see it doesn't cover everything
20:20 - so what i did was i
20:21 - make sure you convert to vector so what
20:23 - i did was i kind of move them up like
20:25 - this
20:25 - and then i made a copy and then i say
20:29 - paste
20:29 - and then i move it in the back
20:31 - background so like go to the back layer
20:34 - so that way you know i i have like so i
20:37 - try to make it so that it will fit the
20:39 - whole screen
20:40 - i didn't want to drag it so you see how
20:42 - it's longer now if i
20:43 - drag this right it looks way back right
20:46 - it looks bad
20:47 - it doesn't look good so what i did was i
20:49 - take another one
20:51 - and then i just copy and then i send it
20:53 - to the back layer
20:54 - so like this send it to the back layer
20:57 - so that way you know he so you see i can
21:00 - move it up a little bit so you can see
21:02 - so it looks better right so what i did
21:05 - was i keep on doing that
21:06 - until i get the uh you know the full
21:10 - full background okay and
21:13 - you have to align it right so you see
21:15 - that i aligned it so if you can see mine
21:18 - it's like multiple you see so you just
21:20 - align it
21:21 - correctly that way you know you cover
21:23 - everything for the background
21:24 - okay so that's how i did the background
21:28 - so
21:30 - so um if you want to do your own right
21:32 - just do it like this first follow
21:33 - my kind of my style here do it and then
21:36 - after that you can convert to bitmap and
21:38 - it will become like one picture
21:40 - if you like or you can leave it like a
21:43 - vector but uh anyway so this is pretty
21:46 - much the
21:46 - first video i just explained how you do
21:49 - your own
21:50 - sprite and stuff if you have the
21:51 - download online let's say you don't like
21:53 - the
21:53 - center you want the ninja right you do
21:56 - the similar way
21:58 - or let's say you want a different
21:59 - background you know you can download
22:01 - online
22:03 - there's a website like if if you go to
22:05 - the link that i
22:06 - provide to you in the video below for
22:08 - the winter set
22:09 - you can see other set also you can
22:11 - download the desert set
22:13 - the jungle set or whatever you want and
22:15 - then you can do
22:16 - whatever stuff you like so okay
22:19 - all right so this is the end of the
22:21 - video thank you for uh
22:23 - sticking around and please give us a
22:25 - thumbs up if you like the video
22:27 - and um alright so next time we'll have
22:30 - the
22:30 - other video that go into the actual
22:32 - coding of the
22:33 - this game thank you guys see you guys
22:36 - next time bye
22:46 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys and welcome back to kids coding playground so today we're going to work on this center run scrolling platformer game i think we showed it last week we showed the gameplay how it works so if you guys have not seen that you can watch our first video with the gameplay and get idea what this game is about so basically you have the center you kind of run around and uh in the platform and try to avoid the tiger and some traps um as you can see i took the actual my game before from the among us platformer and then trying to create this game so that you that's why you see the smasher and the trampoline but i'm not using that at the moment so otherwise other than that i'm using other stuff okay and then next so we'll be learning these uh following concept in scratch the key to control the sprites uh which is the center move broadcast messages custom block uh variable and then the platforming scrolling logic and then the background like scrolling so that it looks better for the game and then these are the links below i'll keep it on the video as well you can download the original game tile set for the uh window tile set and then the santa claus and then the tiger but uh this tiger this sheets here you actually have to cut it so we actually use a game maker studio to actually cut the tiger and then clean up the background and adjust it so that it looks right so i can give you the tiger one but the uh the uh santa claus one that you can actually make it yourself you download it from here all right so i'll show you guys how to do that okay all right so we are in our uh scratch project so this is our scratch project i do have things in my backpack uh but i'm gonna show you how to do it as well so let's say i take the main character out and then my santa claus so far okay let's just take these two so and then i will show you but 7 cards have a lot of different costume so what i'm going to show you is so i have my um black box so for the black box uh i actually have i have two set so you can see here there's a bigger one and then there's a smaller one so basically because when the center switch to sliding and when the center slide across the spike you want to have a lower uh box uh hitbox so that it will not get hit by the spike so that's why i actually have two okay so what you have to do is let's say you go to your center you take a ctrl a ctrl c so you want to make the hit box around the same size as your center clasp as you can see it's a little bit smaller than my center clasp right so that's why you want the hitbox around that okay and then trying to adjust the sender and the hitbox at the center you see when i move it you hit the center so make sure that you adjust your your bar uh black box or whatever color box you want to use in the center okay so same thing for the slide so this is for the small one so the small one is for the slide so same thing let's say i take this one my center and then i go here so as you can see the slide is kind of in the middle of the center so center is in the middle here so it's not exactly middle so you see this because the center is a little bit lower so but i still want to adjust it so that way it's kind of lined up to the middle so when you when you create your santa claus uh sprite is very important that you keep it all online so i'll show you what i mean so let's say i don't have a scent yet right let's say i i don't have anything so what you can do is go paint it'll give you a new sprite so in here what you can do is you can click on this upload and here you you just pick wherever your your what once you download the santa claus sprite you can extract it when you extract it you have something like this um just go into the png location and you can see all the center so uh whatever you want to use so let's say idle i only use one of them i did not make idle actually moving that's not going to take more um you know like if santa doesn't move it move a little bit i don't think it's really needed because actually gonna cause some problem with the game and also make it slower so i only use one of the idle costumes so if you want only one just take one so you just take like let's say the costume for the center right this is your first costume and then whatever or whatever you need let's say you need the um like the running right let's say running then you take the running from like one just hold the shift key and then all the way over here to run so this will be all your runnings right so when you load all your running sprite in as you can see right um you can change it so what i did was i actually change it to like one or something like that or for i don't only use one then you don't need the one you can keep it like blank right for these i i didn't like the parentheses so actually for me actually rename it like this what run one run two whatever but uh the important thing is that you want to make sure that you want to keep the center in the middle so what you have to do is this either click on the vector convert to vector and then you can move the center in the middle because what we have is we have the gray black box also in the middle so you kind of have to adjust the center so let's see i'll take the center let's see it's about the same size my black box yep it's about the same size so it's good so if you don't have the black box the same size you can make it the same size just draw this square like this let's draw the black box okay and no outline so once you have your center so you have to adjust each of the costume so it takes a little bit time so make sure you convert it to vector and then oops sorry and then you click on click on this and adjust it to the middle so center class so you have to make sure all your center is adjusted in the middle and then uh same thing for the dead and then same thing for the jump so same thing so i just show you the run so exactly so if you look at my original one same thing i did the run right after i did the run i have the jump so this is center jumping so i all my costume i have converted to a vector so that i can move them around so make sure that you see when i move it you see the cross is in the middle so right so make sure you have that in the middle for all your costume except for the slide so the slide one you do not want to have the middle or the dead so those are a little bit different so these may be a little bit down right since the center is a little bit down so you can just adjust it you can put like a little tape around here on the top so you can and on the side so that you could kind of see it just how you want to adjust your center clasp so that it looks more more or less like you know uh in the right position right so same thing for the slide so the slide is a little bit you see it's not exactly um you see this it's not exactly on the middle right because the slide is down so make sure that the center is the same same location as the feet of the center like for this one so the slide should be in the same location as the idle right for the feet so like right here so you see how how the slide and the center standing is around the same location so that's what you want to do okay so enough of that so what i'm going to do is i'm going to trash the uh this one so uh if you guys really would like to learn actually you would it's better to you do it yourself if you want i can also upload these guys for you okay all right so we're done with that so next thing uh so this first video we probably won't do too much of the coding or more of a setup so next thing let's say we have something called uh the sprite for the ground and then we have something called virtual ground so what i'm gonna explain to you is this so the ground is like the each of the costume that you build for your level so you can name it like 11 12 and h3 however you want to name it so you want to name this similar thing for your virtual ground you see how my virtual ground and my uh actual ground is the same so you see this so what you want to do is in the other platform we usually don't have uh platform always stands on right so the thing is if you do that and if you have background sprite then if you play with that then the the sprite will actually climb under the tree so that's what you don't want right so what you can do is you create one set of uh platform that has the design and then you have another set that is actually going to be the hitbox so this is the actual so the virtual background is going to detect the touching of the center right this is more of a design so so you do the design work here uh whatever you do the design work uh for the ground you do the same thing for the uh for the virtual uh area so basically let's say if i take a copy of this i say control a and i go here i say control v as you can see uh my my my hit box is the same place as the um this this uh this this thing right you see that the hitbox is exactly the same so you have to adjust your hit box so that the virtual ground is the same place as your uh you know a little bit lower uh than the uh the uh you know the uh the design one so that way you know you can keep it the way you can keep the ground and then the so that looks like the center standing on the ground so so this is how you do the design so this is like my level two so my level two have something up right so same thing here i have something up right in here so that's how you do it okay so this is just like square you can just draw the square box here uh without the without the outline whatever color you want so i have blue uh you can have it red or black or whatever doesn't really matter so and then like number three i have a gap here same thing here so this one i have a gap here so make sure you have the similar graph gap so what i can do is i can give you guys some of these um let's say um one two five or something like that and then you guys can build on to the rest so um that way you can have different design not the same as me right so um if i give you uh one to five i think you'll give you enough idea how to do it right so you can just place any way you want and then you can just copy these whatever you want just copy them you can group them together as one right and then you can move them and you can like copy uh like let's say if i want to build a new one it's pretty easy right so let's say i just paint new sprite right so if i want to let's say i want something like similar to this guy let's say i'll take this and then i'll go to my new sprite and i paste it down here right and then i can delete the tree let's say i want that for the rock i can highlight this copy and then i say okay put a rock over here so this is my new one so let's say i want a tree so i will say copy this convert to vector let me do that copy that and then you can go here i can put the tree let's say the trees on this side you can make it smaller whatever whatever design you want and if you want the tree to be taller you can drag it up so something like this right so that way you can design your your level okay so that's that's pretty much it so i'll trash this so you guys understand how to do that i'll give you this uh all my uh i already cut it and put it in the place right place some of them so you can actually do the hill and stuff like that so you just kind of move them around whatever you like so like this one the bridge actually put a bridge in there and uh you can put a tree so different design right so this one has some ice cube a box that way you can jump on it from the center so and then these things you can move it in the back so if you move in the back layer like let's say the let's say the trees in the front you want to put them in the back click on this so that way you know the trees in the back this thing so when you have something like this make sure you have also have the same kind of style in your in your uh virtual ground so for example this is 2 4 right so you go to my virtual ground 2 4 you can see that you have this and then you have this box so this is the two ice cube this is the platform on top and this is a wooden box so same thing here so if i if i have to copy this and paste it in here will be exactly the same location so these you can just use the uh this uh uh this uh reshape tool to reshape the uh the square right whatever you want so let's say the square you draw a square like this and then you can use the reshape tool you can like bend it down a little bit you know whatever you want right something like this right and then if you it depends on how how your platform looks like right so just bend it in in the way that looks like this right something like that right something like that i mean i'm doing a little bit better here but uh this is just an example what it looked like so all right okay and then for the scrolling background i'll show you how that's to be done so what i did is i only had one one so uh what i did was i put some tree here some tree here as you can see and then i put some water block here and then i put a little bit of white this is like a white uh color uh thing i draw and then i reshape it so it looks like a snow right on top of that and then i put some little uh small um you know bush and then rocks and then crystal behind there so this is my background for scrolling so uh so that later you know when we look make it look like you know the scrolling is in the background and then center is like jumping here and then it looks really good so this is similar to how we designed the other one just design one page i only have one i mean you can obviously have more than one but really we don't really need more than one actually so what we can do is we can flip this uh uh sprite uh left and right uh uh so basically from negative 90 to 90 so that will look a little bit different so so like this is regular right not 90. so if you flip it around then you have the three tree on this side and you have one tree on this side so that way you know the scrolling will be look really good uh if you have more obviously will look better i don't have more i only have one okay okay let me get all my sprites set up so that next uh video we can do our coding so we have the uh spike and we have the enemy and then with the item and we have the sound so i'll explain how each of them will work so the so here we have the spike so the spike is pretty easy that's the costume you make the three uh red triangle kind of put them together okay the enemy this is the one that is a little bit hard so i have to actually draw it i mean i'll cut it and uh from the sprite sheet and clean it up so and then i put it into the uh correct position for the cat so there's like three costumes for the cat and then i repeat three more costumes for the cat for the running so that it looks more you know better with the running and then i have the strike where the cat actually hits something so it has this strike and then the strike and then the strike so this is the yellow cat yellow tiger i guess and then this is the white tiger so i just named it like white tiger run yellow tiger run right two three four and then there's the tiger same thing right and then i have the howling and then this is this is from the sprite if you don't like this red then you can remove it but i have like that so if you touch the red part you will also get killed by the tiger so that's a little bit annoying with the white tiger but you can remove it if you like just erase it okay so that's the tiger one and then the item the item is uh just a two of the uh snowflake that i got online so this is the white snowflake as you can see is white and this is the blue snowflake okay and you can get a png file download like uh you know snowflake png or something like that and i can give it to you if you'd like and this is just a sound i just downloaded icon online you can do anything you like you don't have to actually have an icon you can just make one simple sprite so what the sound we are going to do is we can lower all the sound into this sprite here so that way we can um later on we can have different sound playing so we will not actually have any sound on the tiger or on the on the on the um you know the animated character or the main character so everything will be here so uh you can have the jump sound and then this is the ouch uh i mean i made this sound i recorded it's kind of bad if you guys don't want it you can trash it make your own i just like look like this and then there's the plunge sound this is the water you can get that from uh the sprite library it drops into the water this is the music that i got from online from google uh our youtube channel they give out free uh song so i got this song so this song is pretty nice i like it so there's a good little black background music i found that it's really good it's uh called invisible ability okay by this person so pretty good and then this is the thing sound and then this is another thing so just some sounds here we have so this is pretty much the setup for the game so once we have this then then and then the background what i did was this so for the background um what i did was this i i'll show you so it's a little tricky over here so the the background i have it so if you click a look at my background it has like multiple layer okay you see this so what happened is the original background does not have um let me show you what i mean so if i go to this resource oops back um the winter tile set uh the background so this is the original background if you see it doesn't cover everything so what i did was i make sure you convert to vector so what i did was i kind of move them up like this and then i made a copy and then i say paste and then i move it in the back background so like go to the back layer so that way you know i i have like so i try to make it so that it will fit the whole screen i didn't want to drag it so you see how it's longer now if i drag this right it looks way back right it looks bad it doesn't look good so what i did was i take another one and then i just copy and then i send it to the back layer so like this send it to the back layer so that way you know he so you see i can move it up a little bit so you can see so it looks better right so what i did was i keep on doing that until i get the uh you know the full full background okay and you have to align it right so you see that i aligned it so if you can see mine it's like multiple you see so you just align it correctly that way you know you cover everything for the background okay so that's how i did the background so so um if you want to do your own right just do it like this first follow my kind of my style here do it and then after that you can convert to bitmap and it will become like one picture if you like or you can leave it like a vector but uh anyway so this is pretty much the first video i just explained how you do your own sprite and stuff if you have the download online let's say you don't like the center you want the ninja right you do the similar way or let's say you want a different background you know you can download online there's a website like if if you go to the link that i provide to you in the video below for the winter set you can see other set also you can download the desert set the jungle set or whatever you want and then you can do whatever stuff you like so okay all right so this is the end of the video thank you for uh sticking around and please give us a thumbs up if you like the video and um alright so next time we'll have the other video that go into the actual coding of the this game thank you guys see you guys next time bye you
