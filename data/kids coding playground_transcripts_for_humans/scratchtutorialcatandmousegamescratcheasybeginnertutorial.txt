00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:09 - kids coding playground
00:11 - today we'll be doing a cat in the mouse
00:13 - game
00:14 - so we've been doing a lot of platformers
00:16 - lately so
00:17 - we've been we've decided to make a
00:19 - beginner's game
00:20 - so today we're going to be working in
00:22 - this game the objective of the game is
00:24 - to get
00:24 - five points uh by collecting the cheese
00:28 - right here that will randomly appear
00:30 - around the screen
00:31 - you will use your mouse to control the
00:33 - sprite mouse this mouse
00:36 - and you will you will try you should try
00:38 - to avoid getting caught by the cat
00:42 - and today we'll be following we'll be
00:44 - learning these following concepts in
00:46 - scratch
00:47 - variables loops broadcasting messages
00:50 - controlling sprites with your mouse and
00:54 - custom block and custom block
00:57 - so let's go to our project
01:02 - so um
01:06 - let's show you i'll show you guys how
01:07 - this game works so
01:09 - play it and make it full screen so as
01:12 - you can see when you hit the mouse it
01:13 - says game over
01:15 - added some music and
01:19 - let me get the cheese so when you
01:20 - collect the cheese you will
01:22 - receive one point and i'll try to win
01:27 - and use the mouse pointer to control
01:29 - where you want the cat's
01:30 - mouse to move and the cat will follow
01:40 - and jesus will spawn like every two
01:42 - seconds
01:45 - and when you get five points i'll say
01:46 - you win
01:49 - you can make the cat a bit slower if you
01:50 - want because it's in my opinion it's
01:52 - pretty fast
01:54 - so without further ado let's start a new
01:57 - project
01:59 - so first we want to rename the project
02:02 - to cat and mouse
02:06 - and let's take out the um you can throw
02:09 - away your
02:10 - cat and we'll chew some sprites
02:16 - so we have the cat
02:19 - we have the mouse
02:26 - and where i just got a cheese from
02:29 - online
02:30 - um you can just search up cheese png
02:34 - so i actually uploaded a
02:38 - sprite cheese for my uh backpack
02:41 - so i just got a cheese from online
02:45 - uh and and
02:48 - um if you don't want a backdrop for your
02:50 - um keys like some
02:52 - they have like a white backdrop you can
02:54 - search up png cheese png instead
02:57 - so right now let's work on the cat code
03:01 - and we'll need to make one variable
03:03 - called score
03:05 - which will be keeping track of the score
03:08 - when you touch the cheese
03:10 - and for the cat let's get a one flat
03:11 - clicked
03:14 - go to 180
03:18 - z y position is zero so i made it spawn
03:22 - somewhere right here
03:24 - and uh now i wanted to make the mouse
03:26 - spawn somewhere in the middle
03:28 - so it will have some distance for it to
03:30 - catch up to the mouse
03:32 - and get a forever loop point towards the
03:35 - mouse
03:37 - point towards mouse
03:40 - move three steps i mean you can do two
03:43 - or something but i'm just doing three um
03:47 - and then so that's all the code for the
03:49 - cat for now
03:50 - let's go to the mouse so from the mouse
03:54 - we're gonna get a one flat clicked go to
03:56 - zero zero which is the
03:58 - center zero zero
04:02 - i set the size to fifty percent in the
04:04 - beginning
04:06 - so it's not too big as you can see it's
04:08 - kind of big
04:09 - get a forever loop point towards the
04:12 - mouse pointer
04:15 - so you want it to point towards the
04:16 - mouse pointer and move
04:18 - six steps so it's double the speed of
04:21 - the
04:22 - cat one flat clicked get another one so
04:25 - this is optional i guess but it's just
04:28 - to make it look like
04:28 - it's walking i guess so one flat clicked
04:31 - get a forever loop
04:33 - next costume wait 0.1 seconds
04:42 - 0.1 seconds so
04:45 - and then for the cheese we will need
04:47 - some custom blocks for this actually
04:50 - so let's make a custom block called
04:53 - generate cheese
04:56 - we are making this custom block so then
04:58 - we don't have to keep on repeating code
05:01 - and we can just call it at different
05:03 - places
05:05 - so it's easier to understand and keep
05:07 - organized
05:08 - and you can call it at different places
05:10 - so um
05:12 - for the x position i didn't go to pick
05:14 - random
05:16 - 200 to negative 200
05:19 - for the x position and then for the y
05:22 - position
05:24 - i did it pick random 150 to negative
05:27 - 150.
05:29 - so 200 is right here negative 200 is
05:31 - right here
05:32 - 150 is about right here and negative 150
05:34 - is about right here
05:36 - and then put show after that
05:40 - and again one flight clicked and then
05:42 - flag clicked set you want to set the
05:44 - score
05:45 - to zero in the beginning and then
05:48 - forever
05:51 - forever generate cheese so then in the
05:53 - beginning it will
05:54 - always generate a piece of cheese wait
05:57 - until
05:58 - we want to wait until touching the mouse
06:05 - the mouse and then we can change the
06:07 - score by one
06:08 - if it's touching the mouse and then we
06:11 - can hide
06:12 - after it's done touching the mouse
06:17 - and then finally we can add a um
06:20 - win and lose message so i'm just going
06:22 - to paint a sprite
06:24 - so let's go text i'm just going to use
06:26 - pixel
06:28 - so you lose you lose
06:33 - you lose i'm gonna make this a bit
06:34 - bigger like this big
06:38 - and then i'm gonna duplicate the costume
06:40 - and then uh
06:41 - rename this to you in but i'm gonna make
06:44 - it green
06:45 - just because uh
06:48 - oops accidentally deleted the whole
06:50 - thing before that happened so
06:53 - let me just delete this
06:57 - so you it's supposed to be green
07:03 - so i have to change it to green so
07:07 - you win like that
07:10 - and don't forget to center all your
07:12 - sprites
07:13 - and all your costumes so i've centered
07:16 - all of them
07:18 - and one flag clicked you want to go to
07:21 - zero
07:22 - zero go to the middle
07:26 - and then you want to hide in the
07:28 - beginning
07:30 - and then let's go back to our cat okay
07:33 - so in our cat we need an if then
07:35 - statement if
07:37 - it is touching the mouse touching the
07:41 - mouse
07:42 - that we want to broadcast a message
07:43 - called game over
07:48 - game over and then um
07:51 - the you lose sprite can receive the game
07:54 - over when i receive game over
07:56 - then we switch costume to the first
07:58 - costume
08:00 - because the first costume is the you
08:02 - lose
08:04 - and then we want to show and stop all
08:09 - stop all and then let's go back to the
08:13 - mouse
08:14 - no not the uh yeah let's go back no the
08:16 - cheese i mean i meant the cheese
08:18 - let's go back to the cheese and then for
08:20 - here let's add
08:21 - an extra piece of code if the score is
08:25 - equal to five
08:26 - you can do it any whatever amount you
08:29 - want
08:30 - score whatever amount you want then we
08:33 - can broadcast a message
08:34 - called win new message called win
08:38 - and then we wait two seconds so have
08:40 - like a two second delay before creating
08:42 - another cheese
08:45 - and then for the broadcast message the
08:48 - message right here
08:49 - i can rename it to message actually
08:52 - message
08:53 - uh i'm gonna duplicate this when i
08:55 - receive win instead of game over
08:58 - and switch costumes to costume two
09:00 - because the second costume
09:02 - is the winning as you can see and
09:05 - show and then stop all
09:09 - so now the game should function
09:10 - correctly but one last thing
09:12 - we can add music and a backdrop so
09:15 - let's add a backdrop so i just made like
09:17 - a little fade of blue
09:19 - so i'm just gonna paint bucket so for
09:22 - the first one i just made a little bit
09:24 - darker blue
09:25 - like this dark and then i used this one
09:28 - i made a light blue
09:30 - a little fade it kind of like
09:34 - fades so i'm just going to convert to
09:37 - bitmap so i can
09:38 - fill it oops accidentally made a mistake
09:41 - there
09:42 - so i just undo that so as you can see
09:46 - you have a pretty good backdrop and
09:48 - let's play the game
09:50 - as you can see you can move around a
09:52 - cheese shows up let's collect the cheese
09:55 - i got a score and as you can see i
09:58 - started out with two scores because
10:00 - probably the cheese spawned right on top
10:02 - of me so
10:04 - see you got five score you win when you
10:07 - touch the cat
10:08 - you lose i'm gonna do it one last time
10:12 - and oh yeah i forgot to add music let's
10:15 - add music right now so let's go
10:17 - to code i'm just going to get a random
10:19 - song
10:21 - from the library go to loops i'm just
10:24 - going to take bossa nova because that's
10:25 - the one i used
10:26 - for my other game from the game
10:30 - forever one fly clicked you want to
10:31 - forever play
10:33 - bossa nova until done now you have the
10:36 - music
10:39 - one last time
10:44 - this is a pretty simple game and it's
10:46 - kind of fun for beginners
10:48 - to learn
10:54 - one more score there you go
10:57 - five score and you win so save your
10:59 - project
11:01 - and that concludes our video for today

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today we'll be doing a cat in the mouse game so we've been doing a lot of platformers lately so we've been we've decided to make a beginner's game so today we're going to be working in this game the objective of the game is to get five points uh by collecting the cheese right here that will randomly appear around the screen you will use your mouse to control the sprite mouse this mouse and you will you will try you should try to avoid getting caught by the cat and today we'll be following we'll be learning these following concepts in scratch variables loops broadcasting messages controlling sprites with your mouse and custom block and custom block so let's go to our project so um let's show you i'll show you guys how this game works so play it and make it full screen so as you can see when you hit the mouse it says game over added some music and let me get the cheese so when you collect the cheese you will receive one point and i'll try to win and use the mouse pointer to control where you want the cat's mouse to move and the cat will follow and jesus will spawn like every two seconds and when you get five points i'll say you win you can make the cat a bit slower if you want because it's in my opinion it's pretty fast so without further ado let's start a new project so first we want to rename the project to cat and mouse and let's take out the um you can throw away your cat and we'll chew some sprites so we have the cat we have the mouse and where i just got a cheese from online um you can just search up cheese png so i actually uploaded a sprite cheese for my uh backpack so i just got a cheese from online uh and and um if you don't want a backdrop for your um keys like some they have like a white backdrop you can search up png cheese png instead so right now let's work on the cat code and we'll need to make one variable called score which will be keeping track of the score when you touch the cheese and for the cat let's get a one flat clicked go to 180 z y position is zero so i made it spawn somewhere right here and uh now i wanted to make the mouse spawn somewhere in the middle so it will have some distance for it to catch up to the mouse and get a forever loop point towards the mouse point towards mouse move three steps i mean you can do two or something but i'm just doing three um and then so that's all the code for the cat for now let's go to the mouse so from the mouse we're gonna get a one flat clicked go to zero zero which is the center zero zero i set the size to fifty percent in the beginning so it's not too big as you can see it's kind of big get a forever loop point towards the mouse pointer so you want it to point towards the mouse pointer and move six steps so it's double the speed of the cat one flat clicked get another one so this is optional i guess but it's just to make it look like it's walking i guess so one flat clicked get a forever loop next costume wait 0.1 seconds 0.1 seconds so and then for the cheese we will need some custom blocks for this actually so let's make a custom block called generate cheese we are making this custom block so then we don't have to keep on repeating code and we can just call it at different places so it's easier to understand and keep organized and you can call it at different places so um for the x position i didn't go to pick random 200 to negative 200 for the x position and then for the y position i did it pick random 150 to negative 150. so 200 is right here negative 200 is right here 150 is about right here and negative 150 is about right here and then put show after that and again one flight clicked and then flag clicked set you want to set the score to zero in the beginning and then forever forever generate cheese so then in the beginning it will always generate a piece of cheese wait until we want to wait until touching the mouse the mouse and then we can change the score by one if it's touching the mouse and then we can hide after it's done touching the mouse and then finally we can add a um win and lose message so i'm just going to paint a sprite so let's go text i'm just going to use pixel so you lose you lose you lose i'm gonna make this a bit bigger like this big and then i'm gonna duplicate the costume and then uh rename this to you in but i'm gonna make it green just because uh oops accidentally deleted the whole thing before that happened so let me just delete this so you it's supposed to be green so i have to change it to green so you win like that and don't forget to center all your sprites and all your costumes so i've centered all of them and one flag clicked you want to go to zero zero go to the middle and then you want to hide in the beginning and then let's go back to our cat okay so in our cat we need an if then statement if it is touching the mouse touching the mouse that we want to broadcast a message called game over game over and then um the you lose sprite can receive the game over when i receive game over then we switch costume to the first costume because the first costume is the you lose and then we want to show and stop all stop all and then let's go back to the mouse no not the uh yeah let's go back no the cheese i mean i meant the cheese let's go back to the cheese and then for here let's add an extra piece of code if the score is equal to five you can do it any whatever amount you want score whatever amount you want then we can broadcast a message called win new message called win and then we wait two seconds so have like a two second delay before creating another cheese and then for the broadcast message the message right here i can rename it to message actually message uh i'm gonna duplicate this when i receive win instead of game over and switch costumes to costume two because the second costume is the winning as you can see and show and then stop all so now the game should function correctly but one last thing we can add music and a backdrop so let's add a backdrop so i just made like a little fade of blue so i'm just gonna paint bucket so for the first one i just made a little bit darker blue like this dark and then i used this one i made a light blue a little fade it kind of like fades so i'm just going to convert to bitmap so i can fill it oops accidentally made a mistake there so i just undo that so as you can see you have a pretty good backdrop and let's play the game as you can see you can move around a cheese shows up let's collect the cheese i got a score and as you can see i started out with two scores because probably the cheese spawned right on top of me so see you got five score you win when you touch the cat you lose i'm gonna do it one last time and oh yeah i forgot to add music let's add music right now so let's go to code i'm just going to get a random song from the library go to loops i'm just going to take bossa nova because that's the one i used for my other game from the game forever one fly clicked you want to forever play bossa nova until done now you have the music one last time this is a pretty simple game and it's kind of fun for beginners to learn one more score there you go five score and you win so save your project and that concludes our video for today if you enjoyed this video please be sure to leave a like and subscribe
