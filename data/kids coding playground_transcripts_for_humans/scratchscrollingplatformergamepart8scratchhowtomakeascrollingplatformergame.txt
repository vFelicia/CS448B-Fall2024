00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys
00:08 - to the another video on the scrolling
00:11 - platformer
00:12 - so today we'll be covering a lot of
00:14 - stuff today so we
00:16 - uh first do the backdrop change so this
00:19 - is optional you can do it if you want
00:21 - but it'll certainly make your game look
00:23 - much better
00:25 - and then next we will do the play
00:28 - play button and um like the scrolling
00:31 - platformer word up here
00:32 - to let the player know it's a scrolling
00:34 - platformer i guess
00:36 - and then we will do the icons for
00:38 - selection like we did
00:39 - in our two-player fighting game um we
00:42 - did
00:42 - icons you can select whichever person
00:44 - you want um
00:46 - this one we made skins to select
00:49 - and then after that we will do the you
00:51 - win
00:53 - and after that we'll do the drop down
00:54 - screen which is the thumbnail
00:56 - so first let's start out with the change
00:59 - backdrop so you can
01:00 - do this if you want it's optional so i
01:03 - will
01:05 - uh get a broadcast and wait
01:08 - uh so you want to broadcast and wait a
01:10 - new message called
01:11 - change backdrop oops
01:22 - change backdrop and then
01:25 - um for here in the um
01:28 - player win after that you want to also
01:31 - broadcast the change backdrop so after
01:33 - each level it will change the backdrop
01:36 - and wait and wait you need to make it
01:39 - change backdrop and wait
01:41 - so now we want to work onto the backdrop
01:45 - so
01:45 - let's go into our backdrop so
01:49 - right now we don't we only have the
01:51 - mouse code well we will add the change
01:53 - backdrop
01:54 - so when i receive the change backdrop uh
01:57 - get an if then statement
01:58 - if the level is equal to one
02:05 - level is equal to one
02:08 - then we can switch the backdrop to
02:10 - backdrop one
02:12 - the first backdrop this one and then
02:16 - i'm gonna duplicate this if it's equal
02:19 - to level two
02:20 - then we'll switch to backdrop two if the
02:23 - level is level three
02:26 - then i guess we can switch uh to
02:28 - backdrop three
02:30 - so our backdrop one two
02:33 - this is two and backdrop three the one
02:35 - we drew
02:37 - so uh let's duplicate this one last time
02:42 - if the level is equal to four i'm just
02:44 - going to do a
02:46 - backdrop to backdrop one again at the
02:48 - end
02:50 - you can do any actually so i'm going to
02:52 - get one flight clicked
02:55 - you want to switch back up to the first
02:57 - backdrop in the beginning
03:00 - and then you get a forever loop
03:04 - and next we want to play some music so i
03:06 - already have some music downloaded
03:09 - so i got like the horizon bound music
03:11 - from the uh
03:13 - uh two player fighting game so i'm just
03:16 - gonna get a forever loop
03:18 - um place that horizon down until done
03:22 - and then next you can do any music but
03:25 - i'm just doing this
03:26 - maybe you can get a sound from the
03:27 - library or you can download it from
03:29 - online i'm just doing
03:30 - this music so as you can see when you
03:33 - play it now
03:35 - the backdrop will change
03:37 - [Music]
03:38 - let me collect these collectibles
03:41 - when i get to the next level
03:45 - the backdrop should change
03:51 - as you can see the backdrop changed so
03:55 - um when we go to the third backdrop it
03:57 - should change the backdrop three
04:01 - so next let's work on the play button so
04:04 - i already have
04:06 - it in here just going to drag it i
04:09 - already have a play button
04:11 - and these are words i guess let's just
04:13 - say scrolling platformer
04:15 - so let's work on the play button first
04:17 - so let's go to our play button
04:21 - so uh we're going to make it so when the
04:24 - play button touches the mouse pointer
04:25 - it'll get
04:26 - bigger and then you'll grow smaller
04:27 - again so when flat clicked
04:31 - um you want you want to set set the size
04:34 - to zero percent
04:36 - so it'll grow big it'll like it's kind
04:38 - of like uh
04:39 - when like it sets the size to zero
04:40 - percent but then it gets it bigger again
04:42 - so then
04:43 - it'll look like it's growing the
04:45 - beginning i guess makes your game
04:47 - look much better of course so i set
04:50 - my thing at x zero y negative ninety
04:55 - so next you want to get a show in the
04:58 - beginning you always want to show
05:01 - forever if
05:06 - touching mouse pointer then um
05:10 - you want to change this oh if else sorry
05:12 - it's an if else
05:14 - get the if else so this is um if it's
05:17 - touching mouse pointer
05:18 - then you want to change the size
05:22 - change size by um
05:26 - you need division sign so change
05:30 - 120 120 minus
05:33 - 120 minus the size of the
05:37 - play button which is 100 so 20
05:41 - size and then you divide it
05:44 - by three and then we want to set ghost
05:48 - effect
05:50 - set ghost to
05:53 - 30 so when it's touching the mouse
05:56 - pointer it can
05:57 - like ghost a little bit and then you can
05:59 - do just duplicate this code
06:01 - but instead we'll do 100 here so this is
06:04 - just
06:05 - making it so if it the um if it's not
06:08 - touching the mouse pointer
06:10 - then it will shrink back down so instead
06:13 - we'll just make it go back into negative
06:15 - 10.
06:16 - okay and now you want to get
06:20 - a uh if
06:23 - when the sprite is clicked so you can
06:26 - play this on pop
06:27 - you can just do this if you want it's
06:29 - optional
06:30 - um you want to hide broadcast
06:34 - um start game to let every
06:37 - other sprites know to start the game
06:39 - once this button is clicked
06:42 - so let's broadcast a new message
06:46 - start game
06:51 - so we have start game so now let's
06:53 - broadcast it to
06:55 - all the other sprites so we want to stop
06:57 - the script after that
06:59 - stopped the script now let's go to the
07:03 - player
07:04 - so for here it said when flag clicked
07:07 - let's take it the one fly clicked and
07:09 - instead when i receive
07:10 - start game it will run everything under
07:13 - it so
07:15 - game right here
07:19 - and next let's work on the words so i
07:21 - have
07:22 - them right here i just wrote scrolling
07:23 - platformer you can just write that
07:26 - and then next first words it's the code
07:29 - for the shrinking
07:30 - and growing is the same so just
07:34 - drag and drop that in here
07:37 - like that and then when i receive a
07:41 - start game you want to hide
07:44 - because you don't want it to show
07:46 - anymore after the play button is
07:48 - clicked so you can hide it
07:53 - um and next let's work on the icons
07:57 - so in the um um what is that
08:00 - the two player fighting game i taught
08:02 - you guys how to
08:03 - make these buttons
08:07 - um so if you have not watched that video
08:11 - be sure to watch that first or so
08:14 - what we did was just draw a circle
08:18 - so let me do like this so we just drew a
08:20 - circle with outline
08:22 - um copy pasted the costume for the um
08:26 - square thing the player and then
08:28 - duplicated it
08:29 - and then we just made it a different
08:31 - color and shrink the eyes
08:33 - eyes as well and we grouped it and then
08:36 - for the second one we just
08:38 - made a wording with selected and changed
08:41 - the border
08:42 - and the color so now
08:46 - let's work on the buttons so let's go to
08:49 - the code
08:50 - so when flag clicks i'm gonna go to this
08:52 - x and y position
08:54 - um negative one second five y zero let's
08:57 - go to the front layer
09:01 - switch costume to the first costume in
09:04 - the beginning
09:05 - so it won't be selected and then you
09:08 - want to show
09:11 - in the beginning um and then
09:14 - when i receive start game
09:18 - uh starting then
09:22 - on hide so when the game starts you want
09:25 - of course you want to hide the buttons
09:28 - and we'll need a new variable
09:30 - let's name it player color and
09:33 - don't forget to make it in all caps
09:37 - because uh because um it's global
09:40 - variable
09:41 - like rich patch said i am still doing
09:43 - that same rule
09:45 - as you can see all the global variables
09:47 - are all
09:48 - in caps so
09:51 - when the sprite is clicked
09:54 - so the code is similar here with the two
09:57 - player fighting game
09:59 - so when the sprite is clicked then we
10:01 - want to set the
10:03 - player color to red because this is the
10:07 - um this is the um
10:10 - a red button so when you click this
10:12 - it'll set it to red
10:15 - and then after that we want to broadcast
10:17 - a new message called
10:18 - selected color
10:24 - selected color and then we want to
10:26 - switch costume to the second costume
10:28 - so then it'll appear as selected
10:32 - and then when i receive selected
10:35 - color and i receive selected color
10:41 - then get an if else statement if
10:44 - the player color is equal to red
10:48 - the variable player color is equal to
10:50 - red
10:54 - red then switch costume to the second
10:56 - costume
10:58 - to make it selected else we wanted to
11:01 - switch costume to the first costume
11:04 - so all the code for the characters are
11:07 - all the same just drag and drop it
11:08 - except for the x and y position
11:10 - so i have to remember to add that
11:14 - drag and drop it here
11:19 - and okay so we have all the code right
11:22 - here
11:24 - um in x and y position for the green i
11:27 - did it at zero zero
11:29 - um and the costumes um let me delete
11:33 - this real quick
11:34 - it's the same thing i just made it a
11:36 - different color green
11:38 - of course you can do any color you want
11:41 - and then instead of player color is red
11:44 - we set it to
11:44 - green and then um
11:47 - instead of player color right here we
11:49 - have to do green as well
11:52 - so there you have it now let's um
11:56 - drag and drop it to the character three
12:05 - okay so now we have all the code in
12:07 - character three
12:10 - um let's change the colors instead of
12:12 - green we have to do blue
12:15 - and instead of playing color here we
12:17 - have to do blue
12:19 - blue and there we have it that's it
12:23 - and one last thing i forgot to change
12:25 - the x and y position
12:27 - where here i did 175 and the y position
12:30 - is zero
12:32 - okay so back at the player we have to
12:35 - make it switch costumes of course so
12:38 - zoom in so right now we don't have any
12:41 - costumes right here so i already have it
12:43 - in my backpack
12:44 - so what you would do is um go in here
12:47 - and copy paste it
12:48 - into here or duplicate this and then
12:52 - make it the same color
12:53 - as this so i already have it right here
12:58 - okay so i have three costumes costume
13:00 - one costume two costume three
13:03 - so right here right before this we want
13:06 - to add if-then statements
13:08 - if the player color is equal to red
13:16 - player color is equal to red
13:20 - then we'll switch the costume to one so
13:23 - it will become the red
13:24 - costume instead and
13:27 - just duplicate this if the player color
13:32 - oops is equal to green
13:37 - and we'll switch the costume to the
13:38 - second costume
13:41 - and let's duplicate this one last time
13:44 - if the player costume is equal to blue
13:48 - then we'll switch the costume to the
13:49 - third costume
13:53 - so we have all the costume switching now
13:57 - and let's play it i guess
14:01 - and one last thing we had to change the
14:04 - x and y position
14:05 - for the words so let's change it
14:08 - to um negative 15
14:11 - this is what i had before so negative 15
14:13 - and y
14:14 - is 120. so now let's try it out
14:17 - so let's play the game so as you can see
14:21 - when you put your mouse hover on top of
14:23 - it it'll get bigger
14:25 - and i'm going to select the blue one
14:28 - so as you can see it selects to the
14:30 - corresponding color
14:32 - [Music]
14:33 - everything still works so i'm just going
14:37 - to go to the next level to
14:38 - show you guys if the change backdrop
14:40 - still works
14:42 - as you can see it worked so now
14:45 - we shall continue to our uh you win
14:48 - let's work on the
14:49 - winning so i already have it my backpack
14:53 - i think yeah you win right here
14:56 - and let me drag this no
15:00 - that's not it um so the un
15:03 - and um that's it for now
15:07 - so and also i forgot thumbnail
15:10 - yeah it's where you win we're gonna add
15:13 - some code
15:16 - so we're gonna make a new variable
15:19 - called stop timer make it in all caps
15:23 - because it's global variable
15:24 - stop timer so this is for the drop
15:27 - down screen we'll need a variable so
15:31 - unlike the in another video i taught you
15:33 - guys how to make a drop down screen
15:34 - i use the reset timer but this time we
15:37 - will have to use a variable
15:39 - called stop timer because um
15:42 - it it keeps on um for the drop down
15:46 - screen because we are also using the
15:48 - timer
15:49 - to um calculate how long it takes
15:52 - the player to get to the end so
15:56 - right now let's work on the uin
16:00 - and when i receive start game
16:05 - then you want to show the variable timer
16:11 - we'll deal with the stop we'll deal with
16:13 - the stop timer later
16:15 - we want it to go to zero zero though you
16:17 - win
16:19 - wait until level is equal to four
16:27 - level is equal to four
16:32 - and then when the level is equal to four
16:34 - then we wait one second just to give it
16:36 - a little bit pause
16:37 - just give it a little bit time then we
16:39 - will show it
16:42 - or also show a little bit too early then
16:45 - we want to hide
16:48 - the variable level
16:51 - level and then we broadcast another
16:55 - message
16:57 - we can brought call it a stop timer
17:05 - stop timer
17:08 - stop timer and then next
17:12 - we'll do a um when i receive start game
17:20 - um forever set the timer
17:26 - timer of the um how long it takes
17:30 - to finish to that actual timer
17:33 - right here um and when i receive start
17:37 - stop timer
17:41 - stop timer you want to stop other
17:44 - scripts in the sprite
17:47 - stop other scripts in the sprite and
17:50 - when flag clicked
17:54 - um you want to hide
17:57 - and hide the variable timer
18:02 - hide variable timer
18:05 - and set the timer to zero
18:08 - oops number one set timer to zero
18:13 - okay now we have the wind
18:16 - down we can work on the thumbnail
18:18 - finally this will be our last one to do
18:21 - so um like i mentioned earlier the reset
18:24 - timer will not work
18:26 - since the timer that calculates how long
18:29 - it takes the player to complete the game
18:32 - will interfere with the thumbnail thing
18:35 - so let's get one flight clicked
18:38 - um we'll go to zero zero
18:42 - and let's go to the front layer
18:48 - and hide in the beginning gonna hide
18:52 - um and next you to get the set stop
18:56 - timer to 0.1
18:57 - we'll set the timer to 0.1
19:01 - set the stop timer to 0.1 so what this
19:05 - does is
19:05 - detect if the stop sign is getting
19:07 - clicked
19:09 - so forever
19:12 - uh set the stop timer
19:18 - to timer the variable timer
19:22 - i mean not the variable timer the
19:24 - sensing block
19:25 - timer plus oops
19:30 - plus 0.1 so it will always make the stop
19:33 - timer a little bit of 0.1 seconds faster
19:36 - than the timer so always be faster than
19:39 - timer
19:41 - so when the timer
19:45 - when timer is greater than the
19:48 - stop timer
19:52 - hide the variable level and
19:55 - hide the variable timer
20:01 - um i want it to go to zero
20:05 - y is 300 so it'll be off the screen
20:09 - show after that you want to show when
20:12 - the timer is greater than stop timer
20:14 - glide maybe 0.5 seconds
20:19 - oops 0.5 seconds to zero zero
20:25 - okay um so i just got this
20:28 - uh thumbnail from one of our video
20:30 - thumbnails
20:32 - so you you can make your own i guess
20:34 - just draw it
20:36 - so now let's try out the game let me
20:39 - save my project
20:41 - so let's play it and when you press the
20:44 - stop button
20:45 - this thing comes down and we can make
20:48 - these
20:49 - hide when um
20:52 - when it at the end so
20:56 - to do that to make these hide
21:00 - uh we simply just get the
21:04 - timer thing if it's greater than the
21:06 - stop timer
21:09 - then hide
21:13 - and just drag and drop that to all three
21:15 - of the button selector
21:17 - selections um
21:22 - i'll see okay
21:26 - and right here so now let's play the
21:29 - game
21:29 - [Music]
21:32 - they're all hide so let's
21:35 - let's play this one time i'll
21:37 - demonstrate it
21:39 - i will now demonstrate the game so
21:42 - you you cannot select two of them i
21:45 - would select the blue one so it's easier
21:47 - to see it
21:48 - and there's all these
21:51 - selected blue ones so um
22:01 - [Music]
22:08 - [Applause]
22:09 - [Music]
22:10 - collect
22:15 - so i'm pretty sure it's working so
22:17 - that's it for this video guys
22:20 - and oh yeah and to fix that
22:23 - you can instead of um for this instead
22:26 - of doing front layer
22:28 - if you don't want that sometimes it will
22:30 - not go in front of it so you can make it
22:32 - go
22:32 - for 99 layers instead this will work
22:37 - so as you can see when you play it
22:40 - it'll go to the front
22:43 - because this is in the front layer so to
22:46 - fix that
22:47 - we will have to add the um
22:50 - same code right here just drag and drop
22:52 - it to the player
22:56 - it's going to be somewhere here right
22:59 - here
23:02 - so that's it for the video guys as you
23:05 - can see when you click the stop
23:07 - covers everything
23:09 - [Music]
23:10 - so thank you guys for watching don't
23:13 - forget to
23:14 - like share and subscribe and uh see you
23:16 - guys
23:17 - in the next video
23:22 - [Music]
23:29 - you

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys to the another video on the scrolling platformer so today we'll be covering a lot of stuff today so we uh first do the backdrop change so this is optional you can do it if you want but it'll certainly make your game look much better and then next we will do the play play button and um like the scrolling platformer word up here to let the player know it's a scrolling platformer i guess and then we will do the icons for selection like we did in our twoplayer fighting game um we did icons you can select whichever person you want um this one we made skins to select and then after that we will do the you win and after that we'll do the drop down screen which is the thumbnail so first let's start out with the change backdrop so you can do this if you want it's optional so i will uh get a broadcast and wait uh so you want to broadcast and wait a new message called change backdrop oops change backdrop and then um for here in the um player win after that you want to also broadcast the change backdrop so after each level it will change the backdrop and wait and wait you need to make it change backdrop and wait so now we want to work onto the backdrop so let's go into our backdrop so right now we don't we only have the mouse code well we will add the change backdrop so when i receive the change backdrop uh get an if then statement if the level is equal to one level is equal to one then we can switch the backdrop to backdrop one the first backdrop this one and then i'm gonna duplicate this if it's equal to level two then we'll switch to backdrop two if the level is level three then i guess we can switch uh to backdrop three so our backdrop one two this is two and backdrop three the one we drew so uh let's duplicate this one last time if the level is equal to four i'm just going to do a backdrop to backdrop one again at the end you can do any actually so i'm going to get one flight clicked you want to switch back up to the first backdrop in the beginning and then you get a forever loop and next we want to play some music so i already have some music downloaded so i got like the horizon bound music from the uh uh two player fighting game so i'm just gonna get a forever loop um place that horizon down until done and then next you can do any music but i'm just doing this maybe you can get a sound from the library or you can download it from online i'm just doing this music so as you can see when you play it now the backdrop will change let me collect these collectibles when i get to the next level the backdrop should change as you can see the backdrop changed so um when we go to the third backdrop it should change the backdrop three so next let's work on the play button so i already have it in here just going to drag it i already have a play button and these are words i guess let's just say scrolling platformer so let's work on the play button first so let's go to our play button so uh we're going to make it so when the play button touches the mouse pointer it'll get bigger and then you'll grow smaller again so when flat clicked um you want you want to set set the size to zero percent so it'll grow big it'll like it's kind of like uh when like it sets the size to zero percent but then it gets it bigger again so then it'll look like it's growing the beginning i guess makes your game look much better of course so i set my thing at x zero y negative ninety so next you want to get a show in the beginning you always want to show forever if touching mouse pointer then um you want to change this oh if else sorry it's an if else get the if else so this is um if it's touching mouse pointer then you want to change the size change size by um you need division sign so change 120 120 minus 120 minus the size of the play button which is 100 so 20 size and then you divide it by three and then we want to set ghost effect set ghost to 30 so when it's touching the mouse pointer it can like ghost a little bit and then you can do just duplicate this code but instead we'll do 100 here so this is just making it so if it the um if it's not touching the mouse pointer then it will shrink back down so instead we'll just make it go back into negative 10. okay and now you want to get a uh if when the sprite is clicked so you can play this on pop you can just do this if you want it's optional um you want to hide broadcast um start game to let every other sprites know to start the game once this button is clicked so let's broadcast a new message start game so we have start game so now let's broadcast it to all the other sprites so we want to stop the script after that stopped the script now let's go to the player so for here it said when flag clicked let's take it the one fly clicked and instead when i receive start game it will run everything under it so game right here and next let's work on the words so i have them right here i just wrote scrolling platformer you can just write that and then next first words it's the code for the shrinking and growing is the same so just drag and drop that in here like that and then when i receive a start game you want to hide because you don't want it to show anymore after the play button is clicked so you can hide it um and next let's work on the icons so in the um um what is that the two player fighting game i taught you guys how to make these buttons um so if you have not watched that video be sure to watch that first or so what we did was just draw a circle so let me do like this so we just drew a circle with outline um copy pasted the costume for the um square thing the player and then duplicated it and then we just made it a different color and shrink the eyes eyes as well and we grouped it and then for the second one we just made a wording with selected and changed the border and the color so now let's work on the buttons so let's go to the code so when flag clicks i'm gonna go to this x and y position um negative one second five y zero let's go to the front layer switch costume to the first costume in the beginning so it won't be selected and then you want to show in the beginning um and then when i receive start game uh starting then on hide so when the game starts you want of course you want to hide the buttons and we'll need a new variable let's name it player color and don't forget to make it in all caps because uh because um it's global variable like rich patch said i am still doing that same rule as you can see all the global variables are all in caps so when the sprite is clicked so the code is similar here with the two player fighting game so when the sprite is clicked then we want to set the player color to red because this is the um this is the um a red button so when you click this it'll set it to red and then after that we want to broadcast a new message called selected color selected color and then we want to switch costume to the second costume so then it'll appear as selected and then when i receive selected color and i receive selected color then get an if else statement if the player color is equal to red the variable player color is equal to red red then switch costume to the second costume to make it selected else we wanted to switch costume to the first costume so all the code for the characters are all the same just drag and drop it except for the x and y position so i have to remember to add that drag and drop it here and okay so we have all the code right here um in x and y position for the green i did it at zero zero um and the costumes um let me delete this real quick it's the same thing i just made it a different color green of course you can do any color you want and then instead of player color is red we set it to green and then um instead of player color right here we have to do green as well so there you have it now let's um drag and drop it to the character three okay so now we have all the code in character three um let's change the colors instead of green we have to do blue and instead of playing color here we have to do blue blue and there we have it that's it and one last thing i forgot to change the x and y position where here i did 175 and the y position is zero okay so back at the player we have to make it switch costumes of course so zoom in so right now we don't have any costumes right here so i already have it in my backpack so what you would do is um go in here and copy paste it into here or duplicate this and then make it the same color as this so i already have it right here okay so i have three costumes costume one costume two costume three so right here right before this we want to add ifthen statements if the player color is equal to red player color is equal to red then we'll switch the costume to one so it will become the red costume instead and just duplicate this if the player color oops is equal to green and we'll switch the costume to the second costume and let's duplicate this one last time if the player costume is equal to blue then we'll switch the costume to the third costume so we have all the costume switching now and let's play it i guess and one last thing we had to change the x and y position for the words so let's change it to um negative 15 this is what i had before so negative 15 and y is 120. so now let's try it out so let's play the game so as you can see when you put your mouse hover on top of it it'll get bigger and i'm going to select the blue one so as you can see it selects to the corresponding color everything still works so i'm just going to go to the next level to show you guys if the change backdrop still works as you can see it worked so now we shall continue to our uh you win let's work on the winning so i already have it my backpack i think yeah you win right here and let me drag this no that's not it um so the un and um that's it for now so and also i forgot thumbnail yeah it's where you win we're gonna add some code so we're gonna make a new variable called stop timer make it in all caps because it's global variable stop timer so this is for the drop down screen we'll need a variable so unlike the in another video i taught you guys how to make a drop down screen i use the reset timer but this time we will have to use a variable called stop timer because um it it keeps on um for the drop down screen because we are also using the timer to um calculate how long it takes the player to get to the end so right now let's work on the uin and when i receive start game then you want to show the variable timer we'll deal with the stop we'll deal with the stop timer later we want it to go to zero zero though you win wait until level is equal to four level is equal to four and then when the level is equal to four then we wait one second just to give it a little bit pause just give it a little bit time then we will show it or also show a little bit too early then we want to hide the variable level level and then we broadcast another message we can brought call it a stop timer stop timer stop timer and then next we'll do a um when i receive start game um forever set the timer timer of the um how long it takes to finish to that actual timer right here um and when i receive start stop timer stop timer you want to stop other scripts in the sprite stop other scripts in the sprite and when flag clicked um you want to hide and hide the variable timer hide variable timer and set the timer to zero oops number one set timer to zero okay now we have the wind down we can work on the thumbnail finally this will be our last one to do so um like i mentioned earlier the reset timer will not work since the timer that calculates how long it takes the player to complete the game will interfere with the thumbnail thing so let's get one flight clicked um we'll go to zero zero and let's go to the front layer and hide in the beginning gonna hide um and next you to get the set stop timer to 0.1 we'll set the timer to 0.1 set the stop timer to 0.1 so what this does is detect if the stop sign is getting clicked so forever uh set the stop timer to timer the variable timer i mean not the variable timer the sensing block timer plus oops plus 0.1 so it will always make the stop timer a little bit of 0.1 seconds faster than the timer so always be faster than timer so when the timer when timer is greater than the stop timer hide the variable level and hide the variable timer um i want it to go to zero y is 300 so it'll be off the screen show after that you want to show when the timer is greater than stop timer glide maybe 0.5 seconds oops 0.5 seconds to zero zero okay um so i just got this uh thumbnail from one of our video thumbnails so you you can make your own i guess just draw it so now let's try out the game let me save my project so let's play it and when you press the stop button this thing comes down and we can make these hide when um when it at the end so to do that to make these hide uh we simply just get the timer thing if it's greater than the stop timer then hide and just drag and drop that to all three of the button selector selections um i'll see okay and right here so now let's play the game they're all hide so let's let's play this one time i'll demonstrate it i will now demonstrate the game so you you cannot select two of them i would select the blue one so it's easier to see it and there's all these selected blue ones so um collect so i'm pretty sure it's working so that's it for this video guys and oh yeah and to fix that you can instead of um for this instead of doing front layer if you don't want that sometimes it will not go in front of it so you can make it go for 99 layers instead this will work so as you can see when you play it it'll go to the front because this is in the front layer so to fix that we will have to add the um same code right here just drag and drop it to the player it's going to be somewhere here right here so that's it for the video guys as you can see when you click the stop covers everything so thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe and uh see you guys in the next video you
