00:07 - hello it's kidscodingplayground here and
00:09 - today we're back with another video on a
00:11 - scratch tutorial so as you all know
00:13 - today is january 1st of 2022
00:17 - depending on where you live for us it's
00:19 - january 1st so it marks the first day of
00:21 - the new year so in google they have
00:24 - something like this thing we're going to
00:25 - be making this in scratch for new year's
00:27 - so when you click on this you see how
00:29 - confetti goes everywhere
00:31 - we're going to be doing that
00:33 - on scratch so
00:35 - of course it's not going to be 100
00:36 - accurate but it's going to be quite
00:38 - similar to what whatever this is
00:41 - so let me show you guys the game
00:44 - so when you play it's just 20 22 you
00:46 - click on the little popper thing
00:49 - you have like all the confetti
00:53 - and as you can see
00:54 - um
00:55 - before you um
00:57 - get
00:58 - the confetti to get right there you
00:59 - cannot click again so you can't keep
01:01 - spamming confetti it does not work
01:04 - because we have a script for that
01:06 - so that's pretty much for their project
01:08 - today so let's start a new project
01:10 - and no we will not be using any sprites
01:13 - from our backpack or anything this is
01:15 - all from scratch so you do not need any
01:17 - other sprites
01:19 - apparently 92.8 percent of our viewers
01:22 - are not subscribed and only 7.2 percent
01:24 - are subscribed so it would really help
01:26 - us if you guys just clicked that
01:27 - subscribe button and left a like on this
01:30 - video and
01:31 - as always just comment something down
01:33 - below tell us what you did over new
01:35 - year's now back to the video okay so
01:39 - first let's rename the project let's
01:41 - name it new year's
01:44 - 2022 how about that okay
01:47 - new year sorry
01:50 - and then next let's delete the scratch
01:52 - cat and then we'll get the party hat so
01:54 - just search a party in your thing so you
01:56 - see the party hats right
01:59 - how the way we made the popper was we
02:00 - deleted these two costumes and then we
02:02 - removed this little thing right there
02:05 - so now we have the little popper
02:07 - and then we can just group it
02:09 - flip it over just
02:12 - flip it over
02:14 - like that
02:15 - something like that
02:18 - and censor your sprite
02:20 - okay so now we have our little popper
02:22 - we'll put it like in the bottom
02:24 - left-hand corner let's make it like
02:26 - actually a little bit more to the left
02:28 - so that's your popper and then the
02:30 - backdrop we just took the night city
02:32 - so night city this one we picked this
02:34 - one for a backdrop so it's easy to see
02:36 - the confetti
02:38 - and then next let's get our confetti so
02:40 - all we did was just paint a few sprites
02:43 - it's really easy to draw
02:45 - so we're gonna make four costumes
02:48 - um for confetti and one costume for the
02:50 - confetti ball as you can see it goes
02:51 - like right there and then all the
02:52 - confetti goes everywhere so
02:55 - we're just gonna get red color
02:58 - and then we're gonna like
03:00 - for the confetti cluster we're just
03:02 - gonna like draw let's zoom in actually
03:05 - let's zoom in
03:08 - maybe like right here
03:10 - so all you want to do is just draw some
03:12 - small squares
03:13 - and rectangles so we can draw a perfect
03:16 - square right there
03:18 - rectangle
03:19 - you can rotate it a little bit and then
03:22 - maybe some diamonds as well
03:24 - rhombuses
03:25 - so make a perfect
03:27 - square rotate it
03:29 - uh hold down shift so it rotates
03:31 - perfectly and then you can drag it out
03:32 - and you get a little rhombus
03:35 - put that right there let's make it a
03:36 - little smaller
03:39 - you have
03:40 - just
03:41 - make whatever you want
03:43 - make it into a little cluster
03:51 - and then after you got you're satisfied
03:53 - with the amount of shapes you have you
03:55 - can just copy and paste what you like so
03:57 - let's just copy and paste a few of these
04:00 - ctrl c ctrl v
04:03 - rotate it let's put it up here
04:06 - i guess
04:07 - ctrl c ctrl v
04:11 - move this one down a little bit
04:14 - and let's just copy one more
04:17 - and put this down here great okay
04:22 - so we have our little cluster of
04:24 - confetti
04:25 - um
04:26 - maybe let's put one more right here so
04:28 - it looks a little bit better
04:30 - right here
04:32 - rotate it
04:34 - like that
04:36 - okay
04:37 - so now let's group our sprites
04:39 - right here let's group it so we have
04:42 - confetti cluster let's just name it
04:44 - confetti
04:46 - cluster
04:47 - let's make that capital
04:50 - and then next we want to make the
04:52 - confetti we'll just use these sprites
04:54 - right here
04:55 - so i should have actually grouped it
04:57 - earlier so you can just ungroup it and
04:59 - then you can just move like copy paste
05:01 - this into another sprite so we're gonna
05:03 - paint
05:04 - okay so we're gonna get four sprites so
05:07 - let's get a perfect square for one of
05:09 - the costumes on the sprite
05:12 - so should copy it in here
05:15 - zoom in
05:16 - center
05:18 - just right
05:21 - that
05:22 - also let's center our confetti i forgot
05:25 - to do that so let's center that
05:27 - um
05:28 - and then right here we have the first
05:30 - one so we're going to rename the sprite
05:32 - to confetti
05:34 - confetti and then we're going to make a
05:36 - new
05:36 - costume we can just duplicate this one i
05:38 - guess
05:39 - delete
05:40 - this thing
05:42 - and then we can get another one like a
05:43 - rectangle or something
05:46 - and rotate it
05:48 - this way
05:49 - hold down shift
05:52 - like right there
05:57 - and then next you get another one so
05:59 - let's
06:00 - get this one
06:03 - duplicate the costume
06:05 - to get that
06:07 - there you go you have that
06:09 - and then let's do one more
06:12 - just get a rectangle and rotate it on
06:14 - the side so
06:15 - we're gonna just draw it
06:18 - just like that
06:20 - center it make it a little bit smaller
06:23 - hold down alt so it
06:24 - doesn't
06:25 - okay so now we have our four costumes
06:27 - for confetti
06:29 - next we want to make right that you know
06:31 - the 2022 right there so we're gonna just
06:33 - make a new sprite choose a new sprite
06:35 - and then you see the two
06:39 - there's the glow too
06:40 - and we just need
06:42 - the costume get the glow zero
06:46 - and then we just need these two
06:49 - you copy paste the zero
06:52 - into the first costume okay we're gonna
06:54 - zoom out it's a little bit too big
06:56 - to zero
06:58 - so now we just delete this one so
07:01 - let's move this to the left
07:04 - so right 20 22
07:08 - 20 22.
07:12 - we're gonna rotate it a little bit like
07:14 - in our old project we had it like kind
07:16 - of like that
07:18 - so it looks a little bit better you know
07:20 - like rotate the entire thing
07:28 - kind of rotate
07:30 - a little bit just a little bit
07:33 - and then we're gonna get this one
07:36 - duplicate again
07:38 - rotate slightly again
07:41 - let me get the zero
07:46 - oh 20 20 22 sorry
07:49 - uh
07:50 - there you go
07:53 - there we have our 2022 we can group this
07:57 - entire sprite now
07:59 - so
08:00 - there you go
08:02 - it's not perfect but you can make it
08:04 - better if you would like so
08:06 - let's group it
08:09 - and we're going to center it
08:13 - so there we have our 2022 we'll move it
08:15 - like right here maybe
08:17 - okay now let's start coding let's go to
08:19 - our party hat
08:21 - inside the party hat we are going to
08:24 - point green flag clicked
08:26 - we are going to go to this position
08:29 - wherever you put it
08:31 - and then we're going to make new
08:32 - variable we're going to name it confetti
08:34 - is flying
08:37 - confetti is flying for all sprites
08:39 - that's fine
08:41 - and then next we're going to
08:44 - set the confetti is flying to no in the
08:46 - beginning
08:48 - so that basically this is to check if
08:50 - the confetti is flying up
08:52 - and we won't let the players spam this
08:55 - popper thing
08:56 - so that's what we need it for
08:58 - and then we're gonna get a one this
09:00 - sprite is clicked
09:02 - when this sprite is clicked we're gonna
09:03 - do if
09:05 - the confetti is flying is equal to no
09:07 - meaning that
09:08 - the confetti is not in the air so
09:12 - if the confetti is not in the air then
09:13 - we're going to allow the player to shoot
09:15 - confetti so we're going to broadcast the
09:17 - message
09:18 - name it shoot
09:20 - confetti so there you go and then next
09:24 - when i receive the message shoot
09:26 - confetti
09:27 - we're going to set
09:29 - the confetti is flying to yes because
09:32 - it is fine now is this in the
09:34 - air next we're going to get an if-then
09:37 - statement so if
09:39 - the confetti flying is equal to yes so
09:41 - if it's in the air
09:43 - confetti is falling
09:45 - is equal to y
09:47 - we're going to play the sound pop until
09:49 - done so inside the sprite we're going to
09:50 - make the sound a little louder so you
09:53 - see how it's kind of soft
09:55 - well we're going to click the louder
09:56 - button
09:57 - so as loud as it can possibly be
10:00 - okay so we have the pop
10:01 - and they're going to wait one second
10:02 - because it will take about one second
10:05 - for the confetti cluster to travel to
10:06 - the middle where it all splits so we're
10:09 - gonna put wait one second and then you
10:11 - hear this like you said you know how
10:12 - there's a sound
10:14 - that's how we actually got it from this
10:16 - thing so what we're going to do is go to
10:18 - the sounds
10:19 - and we're going to record a sound so
10:22 - this is how you record a sound you click
10:23 - this one
10:25 - and then you click begin recording
10:28 - and i'm going to be quiet for a little
10:29 - bit so i can record the sound
10:35 - [Music]
10:38 - okay now you go back and you cut the
10:40 - recording so we're gonna play the
10:42 - recording
10:47 - stop right there and then we can just
10:49 - cut
10:49 - all this
10:51 - up to like right here
10:53 - let's play it again
10:55 - yeah that's all we need and we cut it
10:58 - right there
11:02 - so that's pretty good okay it might be a
11:04 - little quiet i'll turn up the volume so
11:06 - you guys can hear
11:08 - [Music]
11:10 - okay now you click save that's good
11:11 - enough
11:13 - you can make it louder actually
11:15 - we'll make it louder
11:17 - okay that's good enough okay so now
11:20 - we'll rename our recording one
11:22 - let's rename it
11:24 - to party
11:26 - party okay so this is kind of like a
11:27 - party sound so and then after that we're
11:29 - going to play the sound
11:31 - party
11:33 - and then we're also going to after this
11:34 - we're going to set the confetti as
11:36 - flying to know
11:39 - okay so we're going to reset that back
11:41 - to now okay and then next let's go to
11:43 - our confetti cluster
11:46 - in the confetti cluster
11:47 - let's go
11:48 - make it big
11:50 - zoom in and then we're going to go
11:52 - when
11:53 - uh green flag clicks we're going to make
11:55 - the confetti cluster go to the party hat
11:58 - which is basically the thing that
11:59 - launches it and we're also going to hide
12:01 - it in the beginning
12:03 - and then after that when i receive the
12:06 - message shoot confetti
12:08 - we are going to show
12:11 - now for showing we're going to uh go to
12:13 - the party hats which is basically this
12:16 - thing
12:17 - and then we're going to make it shoot
12:18 - into the air somewhere around like here
12:21 - so
12:22 - like there's not some
12:25 - like somewhere here
12:27 - and what i got
12:29 - was
12:30 - i got the coordinates of 0 and 50. so
12:33 - it would launch around like somewhere
12:35 - here so
12:36 - 0 as the x position and the y is 50.
12:40 - maybe i might have to move this one up a
12:42 - little bit because if you change this to
12:44 - 50
12:45 - you can see it's a little bit too high
12:47 - so maybe i can move this up a little bit
12:49 - to make it look better okay and then
12:52 - right here
12:53 - we'll put s50 and zero you see it's
12:56 - about like right here
12:58 - maybe move this to the left a little bit
13:00 - so it looks more
13:02 - even
13:03 - and after that okay so we're gonna glide
13:05 - one second to this coordinate and then
13:07 - we're going to hide after that
13:09 - and then broadcast another message we're
13:11 - gonna name it
13:13 - make confetti fly so this is where it
13:14 - breaks up and all the confetti flies
13:16 - everywhere so may confetti
13:18 - fly and then
13:20 - when i receive shoot confetti in here
13:22 - we're also going to change the color so
13:24 - it the confetti cluster is a different
13:26 - color every time you shoot it
13:28 - most of the time at least so we're going
13:29 - to
13:30 - set the color sorry that cheek
13:32 - set the color effect to a pick random 25
13:35 - to 300.
13:39 - okay now let's go on to the confetti so
13:41 - inside the confetti we are going to
13:43 - uh when reflect
13:45 - we're going to hide
13:50 - okay
13:51 - also but before we begin on the code
13:54 - let's show
13:55 - uh demonstrate the thing we just did so
13:58 - see it shoots at the confetti cluster
14:00 - place the sound so yeah that's exactly
14:02 - what we want except one thing as you can
14:04 - see when you click it it's on the front
14:06 - of the thing with the popper so you want
14:08 - to make it go to the back so we can just
14:10 - easily change this by just putting go to
14:12 - back layer so
14:13 - now as you can see let's play it
14:15 - it comes from the back
14:17 - so it definitely looks better
14:20 - so we'll just do that okay now let's go
14:21 - back to the confetti inside the confetti
14:24 - we are going to when i receive make
14:26 - confetti fly we're going to make a
14:28 - hundred clones of this confetti so we're
14:30 - going to repeat 100 times and then we're
14:32 - going to create a clone of myself
14:36 - and then when i start as a clone this is
14:38 - where the code for the clones are we are
14:40 - going to switch a costume to pick a
14:42 - random one to four which is either one
14:44 - of these costumes
14:45 - so we're gonna switch the costume to
14:47 - pick random one to four
14:51 - pick random one to four
14:53 - and we're gonna go to the front layer
14:57 - go to front layer with the confetti so
14:59 - it goes in front of the 2022
15:01 - and then we're also gonna show it
15:03 - after that
15:04 - and then we're gonna make it go to
15:07 - we're gonna make the confetti like
15:08 - randomly spawn like from negative 200 to
15:11 - 200
15:12 - around this area and we're going to keep
15:14 - the y position as the same which is 50.
15:16 - so we're going to go to
15:18 - x
15:19 - pick random negative 200 to 200
15:23 - and then for the y we are going to
15:25 - change it to 50 as normal and then we
15:28 - are going to point direction
15:30 - point direction
15:32 - of
15:33 - the thing to pick random 0 to 360. so
15:36 - it's in like a 360 circle because 360 is
15:38 - a circle so it's going all around
15:42 - it looks better when you do it like that
15:43 - so we're going to do it like that so
15:45 - zero to 360.
15:48 - and next we're going to repeat until
15:50 - it's touching the edge
15:52 - so it's gonna just keep on moving until
15:54 - it touches the edge so we're gonna
15:55 - repeat until touching edge
15:59 - and we're going to change the color
16:00 - effect
16:02 - by 25 so the color is like different
16:05 - it also changes and then we're gonna
16:06 - move five steps towards the edge
16:10 - and after that it touches the edge we
16:12 - are going to delete this claim
16:14 - and boom there you go
16:15 - and then finally one last bit of code in
16:17 - the 2022 we are going to when green fly
16:20 - clicked
16:21 - zoom in
16:22 - when you fly clicked we're gonna get a
16:24 - forever loop forever
16:26 - we're gonna set the color
16:28 - set the color effect to pick around one
16:31 - to three hundred
16:33 - so it's like
16:34 - a flash and it changes to a different
16:36 - color it looks better than just like
16:38 - changing the color effect by one because
16:41 - it just doesn't look as good it's like
16:43 - blinking to a different color and we're
16:45 - gonna put a wait one second
16:48 - so it stays in the color for one second
16:50 - so
16:51 - there you go let's demonstrate the game
16:54 - full screen
16:56 - okay so you see the color is changing
16:58 - right there let's click this button
17:01 - you can see it is working the confetti
17:03 - is flying everywhere
17:06 - there you go so
17:08 - a very simple project for beginners um
17:12 - for the start of 2022
17:14 - so
17:16 - that's all i have for this video
17:18 - thank you guys for watching don't forget
17:20 - to like share and subscribe
17:22 - and ring the notification bell and happy
17:25 - new years
17:26 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hello it's kidscodingplayground here and today we're back with another video on a scratch tutorial so as you all know today is january 1st of 2022 depending on where you live for us it's january 1st so it marks the first day of the new year so in google they have something like this thing we're going to be making this in scratch for new year's so when you click on this you see how confetti goes everywhere we're going to be doing that on scratch so of course it's not going to be 100 accurate but it's going to be quite similar to what whatever this is so let me show you guys the game so when you play it's just 20 22 you click on the little popper thing you have like all the confetti and as you can see um before you um get the confetti to get right there you cannot click again so you can't keep spamming confetti it does not work because we have a script for that so that's pretty much for their project today so let's start a new project and no we will not be using any sprites from our backpack or anything this is all from scratch so you do not need any other sprites apparently 92.8 percent of our viewers are not subscribed and only 7.2 percent are subscribed so it would really help us if you guys just clicked that subscribe button and left a like on this video and as always just comment something down below tell us what you did over new year's now back to the video okay so first let's rename the project let's name it new year's 2022 how about that okay new year sorry and then next let's delete the scratch cat and then we'll get the party hat so just search a party in your thing so you see the party hats right how the way we made the popper was we deleted these two costumes and then we removed this little thing right there so now we have the little popper and then we can just group it flip it over just flip it over like that something like that and censor your sprite okay so now we have our little popper we'll put it like in the bottom lefthand corner let's make it like actually a little bit more to the left so that's your popper and then the backdrop we just took the night city so night city this one we picked this one for a backdrop so it's easy to see the confetti and then next let's get our confetti so all we did was just paint a few sprites it's really easy to draw so we're gonna make four costumes um for confetti and one costume for the confetti ball as you can see it goes like right there and then all the confetti goes everywhere so we're just gonna get red color and then we're gonna like for the confetti cluster we're just gonna like draw let's zoom in actually let's zoom in maybe like right here so all you want to do is just draw some small squares and rectangles so we can draw a perfect square right there rectangle you can rotate it a little bit and then maybe some diamonds as well rhombuses so make a perfect square rotate it uh hold down shift so it rotates perfectly and then you can drag it out and you get a little rhombus put that right there let's make it a little smaller you have just make whatever you want make it into a little cluster and then after you got you're satisfied with the amount of shapes you have you can just copy and paste what you like so let's just copy and paste a few of these ctrl c ctrl v rotate it let's put it up here i guess ctrl c ctrl v move this one down a little bit and let's just copy one more and put this down here great okay so we have our little cluster of confetti um maybe let's put one more right here so it looks a little bit better right here rotate it like that okay so now let's group our sprites right here let's group it so we have confetti cluster let's just name it confetti cluster let's make that capital and then next we want to make the confetti we'll just use these sprites right here so i should have actually grouped it earlier so you can just ungroup it and then you can just move like copy paste this into another sprite so we're gonna paint okay so we're gonna get four sprites so let's get a perfect square for one of the costumes on the sprite so should copy it in here zoom in center just right that also let's center our confetti i forgot to do that so let's center that um and then right here we have the first one so we're going to rename the sprite to confetti confetti and then we're going to make a new costume we can just duplicate this one i guess delete this thing and then we can get another one like a rectangle or something and rotate it this way hold down shift like right there and then next you get another one so let's get this one duplicate the costume to get that there you go you have that and then let's do one more just get a rectangle and rotate it on the side so we're gonna just draw it just like that center it make it a little bit smaller hold down alt so it doesn't okay so now we have our four costumes for confetti next we want to make right that you know the 2022 right there so we're gonna just make a new sprite choose a new sprite and then you see the two there's the glow too and we just need the costume get the glow zero and then we just need these two you copy paste the zero into the first costume okay we're gonna zoom out it's a little bit too big to zero so now we just delete this one so let's move this to the left so right 20 22 20 22. we're gonna rotate it a little bit like in our old project we had it like kind of like that so it looks a little bit better you know like rotate the entire thing kind of rotate a little bit just a little bit and then we're gonna get this one duplicate again rotate slightly again let me get the zero oh 20 20 22 sorry uh there you go there we have our 2022 we can group this entire sprite now so there you go it's not perfect but you can make it better if you would like so let's group it and we're going to center it so there we have our 2022 we'll move it like right here maybe okay now let's start coding let's go to our party hat inside the party hat we are going to point green flag clicked we are going to go to this position wherever you put it and then we're going to make new variable we're going to name it confetti is flying confetti is flying for all sprites that's fine and then next we're going to set the confetti is flying to no in the beginning so that basically this is to check if the confetti is flying up and we won't let the players spam this popper thing so that's what we need it for and then we're gonna get a one this sprite is clicked when this sprite is clicked we're gonna do if the confetti is flying is equal to no meaning that the confetti is not in the air so if the confetti is not in the air then we're going to allow the player to shoot confetti so we're going to broadcast the message name it shoot confetti so there you go and then next when i receive the message shoot confetti we're going to set the confetti is flying to yes because it is fine now is this in the air next we're going to get an ifthen statement so if the confetti flying is equal to yes so if it's in the air confetti is falling is equal to y we're going to play the sound pop until done so inside the sprite we're going to make the sound a little louder so you see how it's kind of soft well we're going to click the louder button so as loud as it can possibly be okay so we have the pop and they're going to wait one second because it will take about one second for the confetti cluster to travel to the middle where it all splits so we're gonna put wait one second and then you hear this like you said you know how there's a sound that's how we actually got it from this thing so what we're going to do is go to the sounds and we're going to record a sound so this is how you record a sound you click this one and then you click begin recording and i'm going to be quiet for a little bit so i can record the sound okay now you go back and you cut the recording so we're gonna play the recording stop right there and then we can just cut all this up to like right here let's play it again yeah that's all we need and we cut it right there so that's pretty good okay it might be a little quiet i'll turn up the volume so you guys can hear okay now you click save that's good enough you can make it louder actually we'll make it louder okay that's good enough okay so now we'll rename our recording one let's rename it to party party okay so this is kind of like a party sound so and then after that we're going to play the sound party and then we're also going to after this we're going to set the confetti as flying to know okay so we're going to reset that back to now okay and then next let's go to our confetti cluster in the confetti cluster let's go make it big zoom in and then we're going to go when uh green flag clicks we're going to make the confetti cluster go to the party hat which is basically the thing that launches it and we're also going to hide it in the beginning and then after that when i receive the message shoot confetti we are going to show now for showing we're going to uh go to the party hats which is basically this thing and then we're going to make it shoot into the air somewhere around like here so like there's not some like somewhere here and what i got was i got the coordinates of 0 and 50. so it would launch around like somewhere here so 0 as the x position and the y is 50. maybe i might have to move this one up a little bit because if you change this to 50 you can see it's a little bit too high so maybe i can move this up a little bit to make it look better okay and then right here we'll put s50 and zero you see it's about like right here maybe move this to the left a little bit so it looks more even and after that okay so we're gonna glide one second to this coordinate and then we're going to hide after that and then broadcast another message we're gonna name it make confetti fly so this is where it breaks up and all the confetti flies everywhere so may confetti fly and then when i receive shoot confetti in here we're also going to change the color so it the confetti cluster is a different color every time you shoot it most of the time at least so we're going to set the color sorry that cheek set the color effect to a pick random 25 to 300. okay now let's go on to the confetti so inside the confetti we are going to uh when reflect we're going to hide okay also but before we begin on the code let's show uh demonstrate the thing we just did so see it shoots at the confetti cluster place the sound so yeah that's exactly what we want except one thing as you can see when you click it it's on the front of the thing with the popper so you want to make it go to the back so we can just easily change this by just putting go to back layer so now as you can see let's play it it comes from the back so it definitely looks better so we'll just do that okay now let's go back to the confetti inside the confetti we are going to when i receive make confetti fly we're going to make a hundred clones of this confetti so we're going to repeat 100 times and then we're going to create a clone of myself and then when i start as a clone this is where the code for the clones are we are going to switch a costume to pick a random one to four which is either one of these costumes so we're gonna switch the costume to pick random one to four pick random one to four and we're gonna go to the front layer go to front layer with the confetti so it goes in front of the 2022 and then we're also gonna show it after that and then we're gonna make it go to we're gonna make the confetti like randomly spawn like from negative 200 to 200 around this area and we're going to keep the y position as the same which is 50. so we're going to go to x pick random negative 200 to 200 and then for the y we are going to change it to 50 as normal and then we are going to point direction point direction of the thing to pick random 0 to 360. so it's in like a 360 circle because 360 is a circle so it's going all around it looks better when you do it like that so we're going to do it like that so zero to 360. and next we're going to repeat until it's touching the edge so it's gonna just keep on moving until it touches the edge so we're gonna repeat until touching edge and we're going to change the color effect by 25 so the color is like different it also changes and then we're gonna move five steps towards the edge and after that it touches the edge we are going to delete this claim and boom there you go and then finally one last bit of code in the 2022 we are going to when green fly clicked zoom in when you fly clicked we're gonna get a forever loop forever we're gonna set the color set the color effect to pick around one to three hundred so it's like a flash and it changes to a different color it looks better than just like changing the color effect by one because it just doesn't look as good it's like blinking to a different color and we're gonna put a wait one second so it stays in the color for one second so there you go let's demonstrate the game full screen okay so you see the color is changing right there let's click this button you can see it is working the confetti is flying everywhere there you go so a very simple project for beginners um for the start of 2022 so that's all i have for this video thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share
