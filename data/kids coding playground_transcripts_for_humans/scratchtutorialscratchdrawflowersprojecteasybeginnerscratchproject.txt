00:11 - making a draw flowers game so
00:14 - it's um we're drawing some flowers today
00:17 - so
00:18 - let's go
00:20 - when you click on the stage
00:22 - you will draw these vibrant colored
00:24 - flowers that
00:25 - come in all shapes and sizes and
00:28 - yeah it's just uh
00:31 - oh yeah it's just like we made some
00:33 - christmas themed so
00:35 - i think they're christmas themed they
00:36 - kind of look like christmas themed to me
00:38 - we actually made this one christmas
00:40 - themed this one
00:42 - but it's just uh
00:44 - it's just random color so this is what
00:46 - happens all right so um there's gonna be
00:49 - this special on my scratch account so
00:52 - uh i'll be now accepting f4f for the
00:55 - rest of november so if you really want
00:58 - me to follow you and you want to follow
01:00 - me follow me and i'll follow you so i am
01:02 - accepting for f for the rest of this
01:04 - month i'll have to change my scratch
01:06 - profile after this video so anyways um
01:10 - let's um
01:12 - start uh
01:14 - with the code so
01:17 - so i created a new project and i'll be
01:19 - showing you how to draw the um
01:21 - the flowers and i actually am going to
01:24 - take a backdrop so
01:27 - i'm gonna make
01:29 - a
01:33 - uh
01:34 - blue backdrop i don't want it to be
01:38 - fine about this
01:41 - yep there we go
01:44 - get down saturation
01:47 - yeah
01:48 - all right
01:53 - and as you can see i'm gonna make a
01:55 - backdrop so this is gonna be our
01:56 - backdrop and we're gonna show you how to
01:58 - draw the petals for the flowers so let's
02:00 - paint a new sprite and it's time to
02:02 - controlling
02:03 - so i put my stuff in the backpack but if
02:05 - you wanna do something different besides
02:07 - exporting the sprites for my project
02:10 - visit me at gumball098 and if you do not
02:13 - want to do that i want to make your own
02:14 - because you're feeling a little bit
02:15 - creative today then um we're going to
02:18 - make a tutorial for you so we start 10
02:20 - 100 100 so
02:23 - thickness five so
02:26 - and no no fail so let's start drawing
02:31 - draw a circle
02:32 - a circle kind of like an oval shape
02:35 - it's a circle but it's an oval on an
02:37 - ellipse because it's oh wait and very
02:40 - important you always have to keep the
02:42 - bottom of the thing on the um
02:45 - bottom of the sprite on the cross so
02:49 - the cross is
02:50 - something where you put the spray on you
02:53 - you don't you don't have
02:55 - like people don't use it but you have to
02:57 - for
02:58 - this one so
03:01 - you have to reshape it a little bit
03:05 - always put the bottom on the cross so if
03:07 - you feel like
03:08 - skipping this part please do not skip
03:10 - this part uh
03:12 - it's very important put the cross yep
03:14 - put the cross there
03:16 - shrink
03:19 - then we put in the cross there we go and
03:21 - now
03:23 - we're gonna duplicate and we're gonna
03:25 - make some we're gonna make some
03:27 - variants of this
03:30 - uh petal so
03:32 - you can make your own variants we're
03:34 - just going to give you a few examples
03:36 - so
03:37 - the normal line variant which is just
03:41 - lines
03:42 - across the pedal
03:45 - in such
03:47 - a vibrant
03:48 - flower color
03:51 - so
03:52 - that's just one of the most basic
03:54 - designs you can do
03:57 - there's more designs you can do
04:02 - so we have
04:03 - and there's also the polka dot that's
04:04 - also a very easy design to do so
04:10 - for the festivity we're gonna do
04:12 - um a christmas theme so we have that and
04:15 - we have this
04:17 - so it's kind of like a christmas
04:20 - type of
04:21 - theme so
04:23 - it's just gonna be like ctrl c ctrl v
04:26 - and we're gonna add that control v and
04:28 - we're gonna add that so it's basically
04:30 - just some christmas theme
04:33 - uh
04:34 - green and red
04:39 - so yeah that's basically the basic polka
04:42 - dot design
04:46 - so we're gonna do some uh so we do have
04:49 - another sprite which is gonna be our one
04:51 - that we're gonna be using for this
04:52 - project so uh
04:54 - we're gonna have one of the costumes for
04:57 - reference so this is the polka dot
05:01 - so the wavy line one
05:05 - uh
05:06 - the kind of football one that's like see
05:09 - that's like fall themed because
05:11 - well you know football
05:13 - yeah
05:14 - and
05:16 - to make the design just draw a line
05:18 - horizontal lines this would take a
05:20 - really long time so we're not deciding
05:23 - to do this one
05:24 - and the christmas themed one
05:27 - kind of like a christmas tree with red
05:30 - inside so
05:34 - you just draw a line
05:36 - like that
05:37 - bring out the reshape tool and start
05:40 - curving it as so
05:44 - remember guys go to my
05:46 - uh go to my uh scratch account gumball
05:49 - 0982
05:51 - if you are not
05:52 - willing to do this just go to my scratch
05:54 - account and export my sprite and
05:57 - uh
05:59 - we actually made a little spot for the
06:01 - red spot as you can see the spot is a
06:04 - little bit red
06:07 - that's like uh
06:09 - what's that thing called you call put on
06:11 - a christmas tree garland or something
06:13 - that is the garland part of the tree
06:17 - and you
06:18 - just yeah
06:22 - oh
06:23 - use red and
06:26 - no outline
06:28 - do this make a circle
06:32 - you put it on the reason we don't fill
06:34 - that in is because it's not going to be
06:36 - a perfect line and you make it go back
06:38 - because it's not going to be a perfect
06:40 - line there's a little bit sticking out
06:41 - but
06:48 - we're gonna
06:49 - yep close that in yep
06:51 - so that's basically
06:53 - like the things you put around the
06:54 - christmas tree the
06:56 - yeah so
06:57 - that's basically
06:58 - this one
07:00 - so so now we are going to
07:06 - go straight to the code so
07:08 - let's close that go to sprite 2 which is
07:11 - now
07:12 - sprite 1 and rename the project
07:18 - uh
07:21 - draw flowers so that's gonna be the name
07:23 - of this project the thing we're gonna
07:25 - start out with today is the backdrop
07:28 - and the backdrop is
07:31 - what it broadcasts from and there's
07:32 - something new i figured out oh we have
07:34 - pen too so
07:37 - go to pen
07:39 - yeah so we have pen
07:40 - make sure you have pen on as you can see
07:43 - this over here pen so
07:46 - we're going to do the backdrop so
07:50 - when stage clicked i've actually never
07:52 - used this block in my whole entire life
07:54 - in scratch so this i'm using it today so
07:58 - yeah until now so
08:00 - uh and we're gonna have a race all
08:01 - effects on in the when the stages
08:04 - clicked
08:05 - because you have to start new flowers
08:08 - so we're gonna get uh broadcast
08:10 - draw flowers and wait
08:12 - uh
08:13 - uh we're gonna take uh weight so be sure
08:16 - to take that and then you write draw so
08:19 - and we're done with the backdrop here so
08:21 - we just go to our pedal and we finish up
08:23 - the code
08:25 - so when the green flag is clicked
08:28 - it will erase all
08:31 - it'll take out all the pen effects and
08:33 - it will hide
08:37 - and now we're gonna have the draw
08:40 - so when i receive draw
08:44 - it will set x
08:50 - to
08:51 - negative 165
08:53 - so it's going to be
08:55 - on the left side
08:57 - and it'll switch costume to costume one
09:04 - now we're going to have a repeat
09:08 - five
09:12 - and
09:14 - as you can see we have five costumes the
09:16 - regular one with nothing inside the wavy
09:19 - line
09:19 - the polka dot
09:21 - the football and the
09:23 - christmas tree
09:24 - so we have that repeat five and we will
09:27 - set y
09:29 - to pick random because we want the
09:30 - flowers to be somewhere else
09:33 - set y
09:34 - to pick random
09:37 - negative 100 to positive 100 so
09:42 - negative 100 positive 100 so it's going
09:45 - to be around this area
09:47 - and
09:48 - it will broadcast a new message called
09:52 - broadcasting wait
09:54 - a new flower call oh i mean a new
09:57 - message called
09:58 - draw flower
10:04 - and now we're gonna
10:06 - change x by 80 so
10:13 - your next costume
10:18 - so now we're gonna have the draw flower
10:21 - almost done so hang in with there
10:24 - hang in with me
10:26 - so when i receive draw flower which is a
10:29 - new broadcast message you'll set a
10:31 - random color because we want a random
10:32 - color but we have a range
10:35 - that we will decide from so set color
10:39 - effects
10:40 - to
10:41 - i'll pick random
10:44 - zero
10:47 - to a hundred
10:53 - so zero to a hundred that's gonna be a
10:55 - range of the color and then it'll set
10:57 - brightness effect uh we also have a
11:03 - brightness effect here i think so
11:08 - to pick random
11:10 - negative 20 to positive 20 so we're
11:14 - going to have some brightness here
11:17 - and now we're going to set the size to a
11:19 - pick random effect so everything's
11:21 - basically random here cited by the
11:24 - computer
11:25 - so
11:26 - it will set size to
11:28 - pick random
11:33 - 80 to a hundred percent so
11:37 - why not keep writing 11 100
11:40 - and um now we're going to repeat 15
11:42 - times
11:48 - and we're going to stamp
11:50 - because that's the
11:51 - thing that makes them draw
11:54 - just stamp it and then it will rotate 24
11:58 - degrees
12:00 - so now we're done with the project and
12:02 - um feel free to pause to
12:06 - uh
12:07 - feel free to pause to um get the code
12:11 - written down and done so
12:13 - yeah let's test it
12:15 - so now let's test it so
12:17 - green flag click on the stage
12:21 - and you see we have the polka dot we
12:23 - have the football
12:24 - we have the christmas tree we have the
12:27 - christmas tree no that's the wavy line
12:29 - we have the regular
12:31 - we have the regular we have the wavy
12:33 - line the polka dot the football so it's
12:36 - just a bunch of um
12:39 - designs of flowers uh
12:41 - so yeah and remember i'm doing for f for
12:44 - the rest of november for a
12:47 - uh kind of thanksgiving christmas

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's kind of playground here today we're back with another video in scratch and today we're making a draw flowers game so it's um we're drawing some flowers today so let's go when you click on the stage you will draw these vibrant colored flowers that come in all shapes and sizes and yeah it's just uh oh yeah it's just like we made some christmas themed so i think they're christmas themed they kind of look like christmas themed to me we actually made this one christmas themed this one but it's just uh it's just random color so this is what happens all right so um there's gonna be this special on my scratch account so uh i'll be now accepting f4f for the rest of november so if you really want me to follow you and you want to follow me follow me and i'll follow you so i am accepting for f for the rest of this month i'll have to change my scratch profile after this video so anyways um let's um start uh with the code so so i created a new project and i'll be showing you how to draw the um the flowers and i actually am going to take a backdrop so i'm gonna make a uh blue backdrop i don't want it to be fine about this yep there we go get down saturation yeah all right and as you can see i'm gonna make a backdrop so this is gonna be our backdrop and we're gonna show you how to draw the petals for the flowers so let's paint a new sprite and it's time to controlling so i put my stuff in the backpack but if you wanna do something different besides exporting the sprites for my project visit me at gumball098 and if you do not want to do that i want to make your own because you're feeling a little bit creative today then um we're going to make a tutorial for you so we start 10 100 100 so thickness five so and no no fail so let's start drawing draw a circle a circle kind of like an oval shape it's a circle but it's an oval on an ellipse because it's oh wait and very important you always have to keep the bottom of the thing on the um bottom of the sprite on the cross so the cross is something where you put the spray on you you don't you don't have like people don't use it but you have to for this one so you have to reshape it a little bit always put the bottom on the cross so if you feel like skipping this part please do not skip this part uh it's very important put the cross yep put the cross there shrink then we put in the cross there we go and now we're gonna duplicate and we're gonna make some we're gonna make some variants of this uh petal so you can make your own variants we're just going to give you a few examples so the normal line variant which is just lines across the pedal in such a vibrant flower color so that's just one of the most basic designs you can do there's more designs you can do so we have and there's also the polka dot that's also a very easy design to do so for the festivity we're gonna do um a christmas theme so we have that and we have this so it's kind of like a christmas type of theme so it's just gonna be like ctrl c ctrl v and we're gonna add that control v and we're gonna add that so it's basically just some christmas theme uh green and red so yeah that's basically the basic polka dot design so we're gonna do some uh so we do have another sprite which is gonna be our one that we're gonna be using for this project so uh we're gonna have one of the costumes for reference so this is the polka dot so the wavy line one uh the kind of football one that's like see that's like fall themed because well you know football yeah and to make the design just draw a line horizontal lines this would take a really long time so we're not deciding to do this one and the christmas themed one kind of like a christmas tree with red inside so you just draw a line like that bring out the reshape tool and start curving it as so remember guys go to my uh go to my uh scratch account gumball 0982 if you are not willing to do this just go to my scratch account and export my sprite and uh we actually made a little spot for the red spot as you can see the spot is a little bit red that's like uh what's that thing called you call put on a christmas tree garland or something that is the garland part of the tree and you just yeah oh use red and no outline do this make a circle you put it on the reason we don't fill that in is because it's not going to be a perfect line and you make it go back because it's not going to be a perfect line there's a little bit sticking out but we're gonna yep close that in yep so that's basically like the things you put around the christmas tree the yeah so that's basically this one so so now we are going to go straight to the code so let's close that go to sprite 2 which is now sprite 1 and rename the project uh draw flowers so that's gonna be the name of this project the thing we're gonna start out with today is the backdrop and the backdrop is what it broadcasts from and there's something new i figured out oh we have pen too so go to pen yeah so we have pen make sure you have pen on as you can see this over here pen so we're going to do the backdrop so when stage clicked i've actually never used this block in my whole entire life in scratch so this i'm using it today so yeah until now so uh and we're gonna have a race all effects on in the when the stages clicked because you have to start new flowers so we're gonna get uh broadcast draw flowers and wait uh uh we're gonna take uh weight so be sure to take that and then you write draw so and we're done with the backdrop here so we just go to our pedal and we finish up the code so when the green flag is clicked it will erase all it'll take out all the pen effects and it will hide and now we're gonna have the draw so when i receive draw it will set x to negative 165 so it's going to be on the left side and it'll switch costume to costume one now we're going to have a repeat five and as you can see we have five costumes the regular one with nothing inside the wavy line the polka dot the football and the christmas tree so we have that repeat five and we will set y to pick random because we want the flowers to be somewhere else set y to pick random negative 100 to positive 100 so negative 100 positive 100 so it's going to be around this area and it will broadcast a new message called broadcasting wait a new flower call oh i mean a new message called draw flower and now we're gonna change x by 80 so your next costume so now we're gonna have the draw flower almost done so hang in with there hang in with me so when i receive draw flower which is a new broadcast message you'll set a random color because we want a random color but we have a range that we will decide from so set color effects to i'll pick random zero to a hundred so zero to a hundred that's gonna be a range of the color and then it'll set brightness effect uh we also have a brightness effect here i think so to pick random negative 20 to positive 20 so we're going to have some brightness here and now we're going to set the size to a pick random effect so everything's basically random here cited by the computer so it will set size to pick random 80 to a hundred percent so why not keep writing 11 100 and um now we're going to repeat 15 times and we're going to stamp because that's the thing that makes them draw just stamp it and then it will rotate 24 degrees so now we're done with the project and um feel free to pause to uh feel free to pause to um get the code written down and done so yeah let's test it so now let's test it so green flag click on the stage and you see we have the polka dot we have the football we have the christmas tree we have the christmas tree no that's the wavy line we have the regular we have the regular we have the wavy line the polka dot the football so it's just a bunch of um designs of flowers uh so yeah and remember i'm doing for f for the rest of november for a uh kind of thanksgiving christmas special so feel free to follow me and i will follow you back if i do not follow you just um comment on my profile and then i will eventually follow you so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below of this video on what else games you have in mind for us to make and um see you guys next time you
