00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids from
00:09 - playground here and today we're back for
00:10 - another video in scratch and today we're
00:12 - back with the how to draw series and um
00:16 - as you know we started a new series
00:17 - called how to draw and today i'll be
00:19 - teaching you how to draw this very uh
00:21 - this gopher here um if you don't know
00:24 - what a gopher is it's like a type of
00:27 - i think it's like some
00:29 - it's like a groundhog
00:30 - i think it's like
00:32 - it's like a rat i think it's a mammal
00:34 - it's a mammal definitely and it's like
00:36 - they live in prairies and they have like
00:38 - gopher holes to like come out and they
00:40 - like hide from snakes and stuff so
00:41 - anyways um
00:43 - this is a gopher and i'll be trying to
00:46 - teach you how to draw a gopher
00:48 - and let's start drawing so
00:51 - first we have to make the fill a dark
00:54 - brown color which is um
00:57 - maybe like
01:00 - so i got my color up here 0 57 51 and um
01:05 - we'll be using this to try to
01:07 - uh or attempt to draw the
01:10 - um the plump side of the body and you
01:13 - want to turn the thickness to five
01:18 - draw a circle do not hold shift guys i
01:21 - know mainly i told you guys hold shift
01:23 - but no do not hold shift because you
01:24 - want it to be like an oval shape to
01:26 - maybe look like a peanut or so
01:29 - something like that so
01:31 - i just hid my gopher so you could see it
01:33 - better and so there we have it put it
01:35 - over there and you need the reshape tool
01:39 - remember now
01:39 - oval guys and we're just going to
01:41 - flatten it out
01:44 - so reshape tool and we're going to make
01:46 - it look like it got rolled by a dough
01:48 - pin and make it uh extended
01:52 - out
01:55 - so there we have that and we make it go
01:58 - a little bit up
01:59 - and a little bit out like
02:02 - kind of
02:04 - like that
02:05 - like it's not it's like a serp it's like
02:08 - a oval it's like a lips a lip so it's
02:10 - just looks more like a lips so uh and
02:14 - then you put the sides in
02:18 - and there we have a
02:22 - peanut shell
02:25 - which is the body of the gopher
02:28 - and we're going to make the eyes next
02:31 - which is just a white pupil i mean just
02:34 - white just white just bright white
02:37 - so like that and then the outline is
02:40 - five
02:41 - or three i forgot
02:43 - and then you hold shift for this one
02:46 - and then you do that
02:49 - and then you around put it over there
02:51 - and then you have to uh put the black
02:53 - pupil
02:56 - pure blob no nevermind i have to make a
02:58 - new
02:59 - click
03:00 - uh
03:01 - pure black
03:02 - and then
03:06 - make a smaller point no fill i mean no
03:09 - line
03:10 - and then you put it on hold shift
03:13 - and you make this
03:16 - part of the eye
03:19 - and then you put a uh
03:23 - a white
03:24 - pupil inside
03:26 - the iris
03:29 - so yep there we got it and then we go
03:31 - shift and make
03:33 - i
03:34 - go shift
03:37 - and then do that it's almost impossible
03:40 - to see but once you put in the black it
03:42 - should be fine
03:43 - and you want to be a little bit smaller
03:46 - and
03:47 - there we have the pupil of the gopher
03:52 - and then you put the mouse hold down
03:55 - shift
03:57 - you get the mouse hold down shift so
03:59 - then you can group the whole thing
04:02 - shift and then you click on all three of
04:03 - those
04:05 - and then group and then ctrl c ctrl v
04:07 - and then you make the second i
04:13 - and then now
04:14 - you have to
04:15 - make the nose and the mouth
04:19 - so the nose is just an oval shape
04:22 - uh black
04:26 - we're gonna do the um actually the peach
04:29 - the peach color first so
04:31 - a hundred saturation 25 and then now we
04:35 - have that outline we don't need outline
04:38 - actually we do need outline we need a
04:40 - shade of
04:41 - and then you need three for that and
04:44 - then you go
04:46 - make yourself a oval do not hold down
04:48 - shift so it looks like rudolph
04:50 - and then you reshape the thing
04:57 - to a
05:00 - kind of like looks like a pea pod
05:03 - yeah
05:05 - yeah there we go see like that kind of
05:07 - shape
05:12 - a little bit down
05:15 - and then now you have to make the nose
05:16 - the button knows just a black just pure
05:20 - black
05:21 - and then you use the outline
05:24 - no outline
05:26 - and then you just make
05:28 - a nice nose
05:30 - right now the gopher looks like as a
05:31 - mustache but after when it finishes it
05:33 - won't look like it will so you make the
05:36 - two little teeth or just two rectangles
05:38 - that are white pure white
05:42 - and then you can make the outline you
05:44 - need to put on outline you make it black
05:46 - and you make the thing is three so if
05:48 - you want to be creative with your items
05:50 - you can actually make the teeth a yellow
05:52 - color but i'm not going to do that here
05:54 - like it has stained teeth or something
05:56 - so and then you have that
05:58 - you reshape it
06:01 - and then you pull it out
06:05 - and then you ctrl c ctrl v actually yes
06:10 - ctrl c ctrl v and then
06:12 - you put it right over there
06:16 - make the teeth touch
06:19 - and then you make it go back
06:23 - you can reshape the teeth to make it
06:25 - look crooked and
06:26 - like it can you can be creative with
06:28 - your ideas and
06:30 - uh like a little bit like that so
06:32 - because you know all teeth are not the
06:35 - same so you can
06:37 - make that
06:39 - and they will
06:41 - touch
06:44 - and then we touch them and make them go
06:47 - back
06:51 - so
06:52 - we have this mouse pointer
06:55 - hold down shift and then you group these
06:57 - two together
06:58 - and make them go all the way in the back
07:00 - and then click forward and then they
07:02 - will be right
07:04 - behind
07:06 - the
07:09 - mouth so
07:10 - now it's time to draw the ears
07:13 - so it's just a circle but we'll be using
07:16 - only half of the circle so and the
07:19 - outline is five and then you draw
07:23 - a circle like that
07:25 - and you put it in
07:28 - and then you um
07:30 - make and you make it go to the back
07:33 - and there we have it we have our ears
07:36 - and now you have to draw
07:39 - the
07:40 - inside but first yes we have to draw the
07:43 - inside
07:46 - appear black
07:48 - and then
07:50 - make
07:51 - it
07:52 - a small no outline make it a small
07:54 - semi-circle so um
07:57 - we have that put it over here
08:04 - and there we have that and then we make
08:06 - it go back and then click on clicking
08:08 - forward until it goes over there and now
08:10 - we can group these two and then make a
08:12 - second ear so hold down shift and then
08:14 - ctrl c
08:17 - and then ctrl v
08:19 - you group it
08:21 - and then it's in the front right now so
08:22 - make it go
08:24 - you flip horizontal
08:27 - make it go back
08:29 - send them back
08:31 - and then you the other ear you send it
08:33 - back to
08:36 - and there we have our two little ears
08:40 - and now it's time to make
08:43 - the
08:44 - two little
08:46 - it's time to draw the hands which are
08:48 - the um
08:49 - which are just hands
08:52 - uh
08:53 - which are this color this peach color
08:56 - and
08:57 - you make the five for the thickness e
09:01 - long one and then you make a three for
09:04 - the thickness and then
09:06 - you click and then you make the five for
09:07 - the thickness and then you make the um
09:10 - hand which is just a circle a feet feet
09:14 - which is just a circle and then you
09:17 - draw a line right through it chop the
09:19 - line through it
09:21 - and yeah you just spin it with that
09:23 - thing you know how to use that right
09:26 - and then you reshape it to make it look
09:29 - like
09:31 - a s oval with the bend inside so like
09:34 - that
09:35 - like something a horseshoe would look
09:37 - like
09:37 - and then you have to
09:40 - extend your little
09:42 - make a line right through it chop a line
09:45 - right through the
09:47 - foot
09:48 - and then you
09:50 - make it
09:52 - you reshape the line
09:55 - a little bit so it looks like it's
09:58 - a line like
10:00 - curved line
10:02 - so yeah and now we just have to make
10:04 - this go to the back
10:06 - you hold down shift for both of those
10:07 - and then group it to the back
10:11 - group and then
10:12 - send them back and then you ctrl c ctrl
10:15 - v and then you have the other side of
10:17 - the flip horizontal
10:20 - place on the other side
10:23 - back
10:24 - and now we have to make the arms which
10:26 - is just a duplicate of the foot but just
10:27 - a small a lot smaller and the line
10:30 - inside their hands are just different
10:35 - and then yep we have that
10:38 - make it a little bit smaller
10:42 - and then make the line inside
10:44 - ungroup it and make the line inside
10:48 - delete it
10:49 - just delete it and then make a new line
10:52 - and cut it right through just a straight
10:54 - line
10:56 - no crooks no anything
10:58 - and now right here we have to
11:01 - make it
11:02 - now group it and now we can make it go
11:04 - to the back and you control c control v
11:06 - it and then you make the second arm
11:09 - perspective and you flip it horizontal
11:12 - and then we have both of the arms
11:16 - finished
11:17 - so that's our gopher guys feel free to
11:20 - pause anywhere you had trouble with and
11:23 - yeah um
11:24 - this
11:25 - looks
11:27 - so the first one that i made looked a
11:29 - lot better than
11:32 - whatever
11:33 - um i drew right here so i'm just going
11:35 - to delete it
11:37 - gone
11:38 - and now
11:39 - and we have this which is my original
11:42 - gopher and every single time i draw
11:44 - something i want to make a variant there
11:46 - we got futuristic we got lever and
11:48 - everything so yeah and um you can also
11:51 - make some costumes you want to be
11:53 - creative with your thinking you can just
11:56 - uh make

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's kids from playground here and today we're back for another video in scratch and today we're back with the how to draw series and um as you know we started a new series called how to draw and today i'll be teaching you how to draw this very uh this gopher here um if you don't know what a gopher is it's like a type of i think it's like some it's like a groundhog i think it's like it's like a rat i think it's a mammal it's a mammal definitely and it's like they live in prairies and they have like gopher holes to like come out and they like hide from snakes and stuff so anyways um this is a gopher and i'll be trying to teach you how to draw a gopher and let's start drawing so first we have to make the fill a dark brown color which is um maybe like so i got my color up here 0 57 51 and um we'll be using this to try to uh or attempt to draw the um the plump side of the body and you want to turn the thickness to five draw a circle do not hold shift guys i know mainly i told you guys hold shift but no do not hold shift because you want it to be like an oval shape to maybe look like a peanut or so something like that so i just hid my gopher so you could see it better and so there we have it put it over there and you need the reshape tool remember now oval guys and we're just going to flatten it out so reshape tool and we're going to make it look like it got rolled by a dough pin and make it uh extended out so there we have that and we make it go a little bit up and a little bit out like kind of like that like it's not it's like a serp it's like a oval it's like a lips a lip so it's just looks more like a lips so uh and then you put the sides in and there we have a peanut shell which is the body of the gopher and we're going to make the eyes next which is just a white pupil i mean just white just white just bright white so like that and then the outline is five or three i forgot and then you hold shift for this one and then you do that and then you around put it over there and then you have to uh put the black pupil pure blob no nevermind i have to make a new click uh pure black and then make a smaller point no fill i mean no line and then you put it on hold shift and you make this part of the eye and then you put a uh a white pupil inside the iris so yep there we got it and then we go shift and make i go shift and then do that it's almost impossible to see but once you put in the black it should be fine and you want to be a little bit smaller and there we have the pupil of the gopher and then you put the mouse hold down shift you get the mouse hold down shift so then you can group the whole thing shift and then you click on all three of those and then group and then ctrl c ctrl v and then you make the second i and then now you have to make the nose and the mouth so the nose is just an oval shape uh black we're gonna do the um actually the peach the peach color first so a hundred saturation 25 and then now we have that outline we don't need outline actually we do need outline we need a shade of and then you need three for that and then you go make yourself a oval do not hold down shift so it looks like rudolph and then you reshape the thing to a kind of like looks like a pea pod yeah yeah there we go see like that kind of shape a little bit down and then now you have to make the nose the button knows just a black just pure black and then you use the outline no outline and then you just make a nice nose right now the gopher looks like as a mustache but after when it finishes it won't look like it will so you make the two little teeth or just two rectangles that are white pure white and then you can make the outline you need to put on outline you make it black and you make the thing is three so if you want to be creative with your items you can actually make the teeth a yellow color but i'm not going to do that here like it has stained teeth or something so and then you have that you reshape it and then you pull it out and then you ctrl c ctrl v actually yes ctrl c ctrl v and then you put it right over there make the teeth touch and then you make it go back you can reshape the teeth to make it look crooked and like it can you can be creative with your ideas and uh like a little bit like that so because you know all teeth are not the same so you can make that and they will touch and then we touch them and make them go back so we have this mouse pointer hold down shift and then you group these two together and make them go all the way in the back and then click forward and then they will be right behind the mouth so now it's time to draw the ears so it's just a circle but we'll be using only half of the circle so and the outline is five and then you draw a circle like that and you put it in and then you um make and you make it go to the back and there we have it we have our ears and now you have to draw the inside but first yes we have to draw the inside appear black and then make it a small no outline make it a small semicircle so um we have that put it over here and there we have that and then we make it go back and then click on clicking forward until it goes over there and now we can group these two and then make a second ear so hold down shift and then ctrl c and then ctrl v you group it and then it's in the front right now so make it go you flip horizontal make it go back send them back and then you the other ear you send it back to and there we have our two little ears and now it's time to make the two little it's time to draw the hands which are the um which are just hands uh which are this color this peach color and you make the five for the thickness e long one and then you make a three for the thickness and then you click and then you make the five for the thickness and then you make the um hand which is just a circle a feet feet which is just a circle and then you draw a line right through it chop the line through it and yeah you just spin it with that thing you know how to use that right and then you reshape it to make it look like a s oval with the bend inside so like that like something a horseshoe would look like and then you have to extend your little make a line right through it chop a line right through the foot and then you make it you reshape the line a little bit so it looks like it's a line like curved line so yeah and now we just have to make this go to the back you hold down shift for both of those and then group it to the back group and then send them back and then you ctrl c ctrl v and then you have the other side of the flip horizontal place on the other side back and now we have to make the arms which is just a duplicate of the foot but just a small a lot smaller and the line inside their hands are just different and then yep we have that make it a little bit smaller and then make the line inside ungroup it and make the line inside delete it just delete it and then make a new line and cut it right through just a straight line no crooks no anything and now right here we have to make it now group it and now we can make it go to the back and you control c control v it and then you make the second arm perspective and you flip it horizontal and then we have both of the arms finished so that's our gopher guys feel free to pause anywhere you had trouble with and yeah um this looks so the first one that i made looked a lot better than whatever um i drew right here so i'm just going to delete it gone and now and we have this which is my original gopher and every single time i draw something i want to make a variant there we got futuristic we got lever and everything so yeah and um you can also make some costumes you want to be creative with your thinking you can just uh make like you know ghost you can make ghost you know be creative have fun you can make like ghost uh gopher gopher ghost gg and um yeah you can make a bunch of things on lot on that you think are really cool so it's just some art that you could do in your free time so yeah you can do whatever you want make it uneven do whatever you want you can make this mustard yellow and then you can make one the outline yellow you can be creative with your thinking there's millions of things that you can do with this uh thing and yeah you can just be creative with your thinking so so yeah uh i don't know what this is right now but okay uh and yeah we have mr gopher man so um we have our gopher here mr gopher all messed up but okay it's all fine just be creative and you can make your own animations with these things that we taught you how to draw like we have our penguin for example we have that we can you can make a thing like if you made futuristic penguin you can make the futuristic penguins beat the jurassic penguin you know or you can make penguin meets gopher and stuff like that you know have some fun with that and um please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below what else you want us to draw and anyways see you guys next time you
