00:00 - [Music]
00:08 - welcome back guys it's kids quitting
00:10 - playground here and today we're back for
00:12 - another video
00:13 - and this is rock blaster 1.2 so
00:16 - this is my old game rock blaster so um
00:20 - yeah all these loves favorites all these
00:23 - remixes and
00:24 - views thank you for giving me 7854 views
00:28 - 146 remixes 76 favorites and 95 likes
00:31 - so thank you for all your support on
00:33 - this video
00:34 - uh just like all like all these people
00:38 - so
00:38 - thank you for doing this so
00:42 - in this in in this game
00:46 - we're gonna add the
00:49 - rocks going the speed because i made
00:53 - the speed for all all sprites only so
00:56 - this thing i made it all sprites only so
00:59 - they should be for this sprite only
01:01 - and that's what i did wrong so this was
01:03 - before uh no
01:05 - for all this sprite only not for all so
01:08 - yeah so that's what i did wrong for the
01:10 - rocks and yeah now this variable is over
01:13 - here
01:15 - and then spaceship we have
01:18 - um uh score no
01:22 - lives now so lives we are going to add
01:25 - lives actually
01:26 - so in this project we're going to add
01:28 - lives so
01:29 - because people are requesting for lives
01:31 - because they think the game's too hard
01:33 - maybe because one shot kill and then for
01:37 - the laser
01:38 - in the end of the game when you die or
01:41 - something
01:42 - uh the laser just you can keep on
01:45 - shooting it if you click
01:46 - space so as you can see look bam bam
01:49 - bam and there's no rocks and you're
01:51 - already dead so we're gonna
01:53 - change that so these so this is
01:56 - our original game so i'm gonna show you
02:00 - my original game so
02:06 - so we already changed the speed because
02:10 - yeah we already have the speed done
02:14 - and then but the we're gonna die
02:18 - so you know we didn't have live stream
02:20 - and it says will breathe
02:22 - so yeah that's what we have
02:26 - so i'm going to make a new project and
02:28 - start this game all over to a fresh
02:30 - start
02:31 - so save as a copy
02:37 - and then now i have to see my
02:40 - copy instead change it to 1.2
02:44 - so this is rock blaster 1.2 um
02:48 - it's going to be more enhanced version
02:49 - but i doubt it's gonna get more views
02:51 - than the original one because
02:52 - original is always better than copy so
02:56 - because original always better than
02:58 - spin-offs
02:59 - so yeah um we're gonna start with the
03:02 - rocks
03:02 - so we're gonna add the speed first
03:07 - we're we're gonna add a sh uh
03:10 - we're gonna delete this show we may not
03:13 - need that show here
03:18 - and then game over we could keep we are
03:21 - going to keep that
03:22 - yeah when i start as a clone go to this
03:25 - this but this time we need a show
03:31 - and then we have to set speed we already
03:33 - done the speed
03:37 - so speed yeah
03:40 - i'm going to show this yeah we already
03:42 - done speed
03:44 - so yeah just change it to for this
03:47 - sprite only
03:48 - not yet yeah for this right only and
03:52 - just name it like speed
03:53 - so that's what uh you're supposed to do
03:57 - and yeah so that's all you have to do
04:01 - and then instead of
04:06 - a broadcast message here because we have
04:08 - lives now
04:10 - we have to do forever instead of vodka
04:13 - forever so over here above the repeat
04:17 - until
04:18 - let's first just clear this i'll put
04:20 - this on the side first
04:21 - and see what we need and what we don't
04:23 - need so
04:24 - i'm gonna code this new script so if
04:27 - then
04:29 - touching rocket ship
04:35 - then hide
04:41 - and broadcast hit spaceship
04:45 - so we have to oh yeah we also have to
04:48 - put this in
04:49 - i'm gonna put this first and broadcast
04:51 - hit spaceship
04:55 - because we have wives now so he's way
04:58 - different
04:59 - and then um
05:03 - i always get confused from the hit
05:04 - spaceship and wait
05:06 - we need to wait instead of broadcast
05:08 - just regular
05:09 - just a weight and then um we can
05:12 - this is uh hit spaceship and then this
05:16 - is a go
05:16 - to and then i already have at the
05:18 - position i'm just gonna drag this in
05:21 - so after the broadcast just follow my
05:24 - lead i'll just try to go slow
05:26 - and then click
05:29 - this block show and then put it under go
05:32 - to
05:34 - and then we have to change x by speed
05:39 - i i actually could take this whole block
05:41 - in and
05:43 - put out what i get out
05:46 - so i actually don't need that i'm gonna
05:48 - put change
05:49 - x of speed first and then uh
05:52 - i'm pretty sure this is the same code
05:55 - yeah and this is the same code so we
05:57 - don't have to change this because this
05:58 - is the one
05:59 - this is the score so we obviously do not
06:02 - have to change this
06:03 - and this is the rocks position so yeah
06:06 - we don't need to change this either
06:08 - and then we can just throw this away
06:12 - and then now we have to work on the
06:15 - rocket ship
06:16 - so the rocket ship has a little bit more
06:19 - code than normal
06:20 - not that much so
06:24 - variables we gotta make live
06:27 - which is lives because multiple so
06:31 - um yeah we have that
06:34 - set score to zero and set lives to five
06:37 - you can set it to one you can set it a
06:39 - million i don't care what you set it to
06:40 - but i'm gonna set it to five because
06:43 - it's probably the most relevant so in
06:46 - those set size of 50
06:48 - point in direction 180
06:56 - 180 180
07:00 - 180 um and forever
07:03 - touching forever you just don't you
07:06 - don't even need touching rocks
07:07 - because it doesn't have to wait
07:10 - you don't need this so
07:14 - yeah touching the rocks yeah so we don't
07:16 - need this anymore because you're not
07:18 - gonna die from one hit one kill
07:20 - so now we need a forever
07:25 - and then put that in and then we have
07:27 - game over
07:28 - we have to keep that and then when i
07:30 - receive hit spaceship so
07:32 - we made that variable i mean broadcast
07:35 - message
07:36 - uh then change live by -1
07:39 - so it will lose a life every time it
07:42 - gets hit by a rock
07:44 - or you can make it 100 lives lost or
07:46 - something i don't care
07:47 - and then you need it if then
07:50 - so over here drag this over here if then
07:54 - you need to or if then
07:59 - the lives is less than
08:02 - zero then you'll lose so i'm gonna take
08:05 - this
08:06 - lives is less than zero
08:09 - or equal to zero because you could die
08:13 - from five rocks exactly or you can die
08:15 - from six rocks
08:16 - so yeah let's put this in
08:20 - yeah so that looks fine and then
08:22 - broadcast
08:23 - game over
08:33 - yeah broadcast uh game over yeah not hit
08:37 - spaceship
08:37 - sorry and then after that laser time
08:41 - so lasers also have a bug game over i
08:44 - don't think they have a bug
08:46 - as this uh yeah game over is always the
08:48 - same because
08:49 - it's always game over when you die so
08:52 - anyways
08:53 - let's do this so um we have
08:57 - some code left and
09:00 - first we have to so
09:04 - ah then we have to add something to this
09:07 - so i'm going to delete this real quick
09:10 - because we do not
09:11 - need this and after that we need to go
09:14 - forever
09:17 - zoom in a little bit because i don't
09:19 - think you guys can see that uh
09:20 - if then so if then um
09:24 - the key space is pressed which is
09:28 - yeah that's the key space so if that's
09:30 - pressed
09:31 - then it will wait until
09:34 - not keep spaces pressed so wait until
09:39 - where's that block
09:42 - wait until so this is for that you
09:45 - cannot spam the space key
09:47 - so if you just hold it go like
09:51 - something like that so if you add this
09:53 - code
09:54 - it will not spam it not
09:57 - spam it so key space pressed
10:03 - it will create clone of myself
10:11 - so we have all of this code done
10:16 - and yeah we're good because on the old
10:19 - code we did one space key espresso
10:21 - create clone
10:22 - of myself which you can spam so um
10:26 - we decided to make this so after because
10:29 - of that
10:30 - you can also shoot because the game is
10:32 - over and we want to keep the
10:34 - code the weight of the a different way
10:36 - because um people notice that when you
10:38 - die
10:39 - they'll just you can still hold the key
10:41 - space for us and you can
10:43 - shoot after when you die so we changed
10:45 - this
10:46 - in this um one so yeah
10:49 - and then yeah let's see how our project
10:52 - is first of all we'll screen it
10:54 - so the rocks are moving at a different
10:56 - momentum
10:57 - so and look the lives are going down so
11:00 - as you can see
11:02 - you can't even spare anymore see more
11:04 - good
11:05 - i'm clicking it do not hear this do you
11:08 - not hear this
11:10 - so uh that's what we have so you cannot
11:13 - spam
11:14 - afterwards so um yeah i'm gonna try to
11:18 - get some score so we have to kill the
11:20 - rocks
11:21 - so they're moving a different momentum
11:23 - so they were not moving in a different
11:25 - momentum on my nine month one so
11:27 - that one my old one my old project so
11:30 - they were not moving at a different
11:31 - momentum so
11:32 - some are slow some are quick some of the
11:34 - speed of sound
11:36 - all different so great and we also added
11:39 - the
11:40 - um live so you can just
11:43 - die now you don't get one shot killed so
11:46 - that's really annoying if you do so
11:48 - that's why we decided and you cannot
11:50 - spam
11:52 - or or do the thing after when you die so
11:55 - yeah
11:56 - great so i'm going to show you the code
11:59 - for all the sprites i have so
12:01 - let's just zoom in a little bit no no
12:03 - one more out yeah yeah you guys can see
12:05 - that right
12:06 - so um i'm going to make this smaller so
12:08 - then you guys can see that better
12:10 - so if you do this um
12:13 - yeah feel free to pause whenever you
12:16 - need to so i'm just reviewing over the
12:17 - code so you can also zoom into your
12:19 - youtube
12:20 - youtube video so yeah and then the
12:22 - rocket ship this is what we have
12:24 - so feel free to pause laser
12:30 - i'm trying to move these together so
12:32 - that you guys can see it better
12:35 - so look laser
12:39 - laser feel free to pause
12:42 - game over we didn't work with the game
12:44 - over today but
12:46 - you can change that i know if you didn't
12:49 - add it in the last video
12:50 - so anyways so in the backdrop
12:55 - i could also add some music because
12:57 - music is always better
12:59 - we always add music and sounds for our
13:01 - thing cause sound
13:02 - so i'm gonna get a sound i don't know
13:04 - which one i should get
13:06 - probably um a good one
13:10 - like yeah this isn't space
13:14 - space i'm gonna take dance space
13:20 - i like this one so let's put this
13:22 - forever
13:24 - i think it's not loud enough and i i
13:27 - think it's fine actually
13:29 - so play sand dance face until so i just
13:31 - enhanced the game a little
13:35 - [Music]
13:45 - so i'm not spamming actually flicking it
13:47 - up so you can't spam look
13:49 - i'm holding down the space key like you
13:51 - cannot spam so you can try that for
13:53 - yourself
13:54 - so yeah
13:58 - yeah so and then i can
14:02 - [Music]
14:12 - so nice so this is what we have for our
14:14 - game
14:15 - so you can check this out because i'm
14:17 - going to share this uh

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's kids quitting playground here and today we're back for another video and this is rock blaster 1.2 so this is my old game rock blaster so um yeah all these loves favorites all these remixes and views thank you for giving me 7854 views 146 remixes 76 favorites and 95 likes so thank you for all your support on this video uh just like all like all these people so thank you for doing this so in this in in this game we're gonna add the rocks going the speed because i made the speed for all all sprites only so this thing i made it all sprites only so they should be for this sprite only and that's what i did wrong so this was before uh no for all this sprite only not for all so yeah so that's what i did wrong for the rocks and yeah now this variable is over here and then spaceship we have um uh score no lives now so lives we are going to add lives actually so in this project we're going to add lives so because people are requesting for lives because they think the game's too hard maybe because one shot kill and then for the laser in the end of the game when you die or something uh the laser just you can keep on shooting it if you click space so as you can see look bam bam bam and there's no rocks and you're already dead so we're gonna change that so these so this is our original game so i'm gonna show you my original game so so we already changed the speed because yeah we already have the speed done and then but the we're gonna die so you know we didn't have live stream and it says will breathe so yeah that's what we have so i'm going to make a new project and start this game all over to a fresh start so save as a copy and then now i have to see my copy instead change it to 1.2 so this is rock blaster 1.2 um it's going to be more enhanced version but i doubt it's gonna get more views than the original one because original is always better than copy so because original always better than spinoffs so yeah um we're gonna start with the rocks so we're gonna add the speed first we're we're gonna add a sh uh we're gonna delete this show we may not need that show here and then game over we could keep we are going to keep that yeah when i start as a clone go to this this but this time we need a show and then we have to set speed we already done the speed so speed yeah i'm going to show this yeah we already done speed so yeah just change it to for this sprite only not yet yeah for this right only and just name it like speed so that's what uh you're supposed to do and yeah so that's all you have to do and then instead of a broadcast message here because we have lives now we have to do forever instead of vodka forever so over here above the repeat until let's first just clear this i'll put this on the side first and see what we need and what we don't need so i'm gonna code this new script so if then touching rocket ship then hide and broadcast hit spaceship so we have to oh yeah we also have to put this in i'm gonna put this first and broadcast hit spaceship because we have wives now so he's way different and then um i always get confused from the hit spaceship and wait we need to wait instead of broadcast just regular just a weight and then um we can this is uh hit spaceship and then this is a go to and then i already have at the position i'm just gonna drag this in so after the broadcast just follow my lead i'll just try to go slow and then click this block show and then put it under go to and then we have to change x by speed i i actually could take this whole block in and put out what i get out so i actually don't need that i'm gonna put change x of speed first and then uh i'm pretty sure this is the same code yeah and this is the same code so we don't have to change this because this is the one this is the score so we obviously do not have to change this and this is the rocks position so yeah we don't need to change this either and then we can just throw this away and then now we have to work on the rocket ship so the rocket ship has a little bit more code than normal not that much so variables we gotta make live which is lives because multiple so um yeah we have that set score to zero and set lives to five you can set it to one you can set it a million i don't care what you set it to but i'm gonna set it to five because it's probably the most relevant so in those set size of 50 point in direction 180 180 180 180 um and forever touching forever you just don't you don't even need touching rocks because it doesn't have to wait you don't need this so yeah touching the rocks yeah so we don't need this anymore because you're not gonna die from one hit one kill so now we need a forever and then put that in and then we have game over we have to keep that and then when i receive hit spaceship so we made that variable i mean broadcast message uh then change live by 1 so it will lose a life every time it gets hit by a rock or you can make it 100 lives lost or something i don't care and then you need it if then so over here drag this over here if then you need to or if then the lives is less than zero then you'll lose so i'm gonna take this lives is less than zero or equal to zero because you could die from five rocks exactly or you can die from six rocks so yeah let's put this in yeah so that looks fine and then broadcast game over yeah broadcast uh game over yeah not hit spaceship sorry and then after that laser time so lasers also have a bug game over i don't think they have a bug as this uh yeah game over is always the same because it's always game over when you die so anyways let's do this so um we have some code left and first we have to so ah then we have to add something to this so i'm going to delete this real quick because we do not need this and after that we need to go forever zoom in a little bit because i don't think you guys can see that uh if then so if then um the key space is pressed which is yeah that's the key space so if that's pressed then it will wait until not keep spaces pressed so wait until where's that block wait until so this is for that you cannot spam the space key so if you just hold it go like something like that so if you add this code it will not spam it not spam it so key space pressed it will create clone of myself so we have all of this code done and yeah we're good because on the old code we did one space key espresso create clone of myself which you can spam so um we decided to make this so after because of that you can also shoot because the game is over and we want to keep the code the weight of the a different way because um people notice that when you die they'll just you can still hold the key space for us and you can shoot after when you die so we changed this in this um one so yeah and then yeah let's see how our project is first of all we'll screen it so the rocks are moving at a different momentum so and look the lives are going down so as you can see you can't even spare anymore see more good i'm clicking it do not hear this do you not hear this so uh that's what we have so you cannot spam afterwards so um yeah i'm gonna try to get some score so we have to kill the rocks so they're moving a different momentum so they were not moving in a different momentum on my nine month one so that one my old one my old project so they were not moving at a different momentum so some are slow some are quick some of the speed of sound all different so great and we also added the um live so you can just die now you don't get one shot killed so that's really annoying if you do so that's why we decided and you cannot spam or or do the thing after when you die so yeah great so i'm going to show you the code for all the sprites i have so let's just zoom in a little bit no no one more out yeah yeah you guys can see that right so um i'm going to make this smaller so then you guys can see that better so if you do this um yeah feel free to pause whenever you need to so i'm just reviewing over the code so you can also zoom into your youtube youtube video so yeah and then the rocket ship this is what we have so feel free to pause laser i'm trying to move these together so that you guys can see it better so look laser laser feel free to pause game over we didn't work with the game over today but you can change that i know if you didn't add it in the last video so anyways so in the backdrop i could also add some music because music is always better we always add music and sounds for our thing cause sound so i'm gonna get a sound i don't know which one i should get probably um a good one like yeah this isn't space space i'm gonna take dance space i like this one so let's put this forever i think it's not loud enough and i i think it's fine actually so play sand dance face until so i just enhanced the game a little so i'm not spamming actually flicking it up so you can't spam look i'm holding down the space key like you cannot spam so you can try that for yourself so yeah yeah so and then i can so nice so this is what we have for our game so you can check this out because i'm going to share this uh so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below whatever you want to comment i don't care about your comment unless if it's a comment because yeah why not you can comment uh you can comment look at this game or something and i'll sometimes look at it sometimes i'll favorite it yeah sometimes i'll do these stuff okay great guys um bye guys and see you guys next time
