00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - okay so welcome back guys it's kids
00:09 - coding polygram here
00:10 - so today we will be finishing up apple
00:12 - dash so you guys may be asking
00:14 - why haven't you been posting the video
00:17 - it's been over a month
00:18 - well it's because i have end of the year
00:21 - exams
00:21 - and have to um like study it for the
00:25 - tests
00:26 - but now school is over i can upload more
00:29 - frequently
00:30 - so we will be working on the last part
00:33 - of apple dash
00:34 - so before we start i will quickly go
00:36 - through the code of
00:37 - the game all right zoom in
00:41 - so inside the player here is the
00:43 - movement and
00:45 - switching the skins if you buy the other
00:47 - one the starting up the game
00:50 - and we got the bomb this is the code for
00:52 - the bomb
00:55 - the sound when it hits the player when
00:57 - the bomb falling out of the sky
01:00 - and the hp on the character
01:04 - the basket fruits
01:07 - so it's like the fruit movement the
01:09 - fruit falling down
01:11 - so this is the fruit and now we got the
01:13 - begin button really simple just
01:14 - it's like clicking the begin button
01:17 - coins this is the currency of the game
01:19 - you use this to buy different upgrades
01:24 - you can pause it if you'd like
01:27 - hit box the shop the shop icon
01:32 - you can click on it
01:36 - all right so that's the shop icon the
01:37 - shop background
01:39 - switches the background into the shop
01:41 - the exit button
01:43 - in the shop so you can click and exit
01:49 - and then this is the speed
01:52 - upgrade
01:59 - okay and then this is the bigger basket
02:06 - upgrade
02:08 - and then we have the different skin
02:10 - purchase you can buy the pig
02:15 - all right and this is the button let's
02:18 - say you want to switch back to the ghost
02:20 - you just click it all right so right now
02:23 - we're gonna add like a little title
02:24 - screen so when you start the game
02:26 - as you can see it's kind of like blank
02:27 - right here we're gonna add like a little
02:29 - title screen right there
02:30 - so it'll look a little bit better
02:34 - so i actually got the skirts for my dad
02:37 - he helped me add this thing so
02:40 - let's paint a new sprite so first we're
02:42 - going to
02:43 - i'm going to get like a yellowish color
02:46 - like kind of yellow or orange
02:48 - with no outline um make the saturation
02:52 - max and i'll click on the text probably
02:55 - going to make it
02:56 - a marker because it's easier to see so
02:59 - i'm going to write
03:00 - apple dash
03:03 - dash like that uh make it bigger
03:07 - okay all right so we have our texas make
03:11 - it a little bit smaller
03:14 - so apple dash okay
03:18 - all right so first in apple dash in this
03:21 - a title we're gonna rename this thing to
03:24 - title
03:27 - capslock title title
03:30 - all right so let's start coding inside
03:32 - the title so
03:34 - when i receive the start screen
03:38 - uh message on the title we're going to
03:42 - go to the font layer
03:44 - go to front layer and i'm going to go to
03:48 - x0 and y10
03:51 - so it's going to be somewhere like right
03:52 - here about like right there
03:55 - and we're going to show the sprite
03:58 - and we're going to go point in direction
04:00 - of 90
04:01 - point direction 90. i'm going to set the
04:03 - size of zero percent
04:06 - all right so like it's gonna like
04:09 - turn small and flash big that's what
04:11 - we're gonna do
04:12 - and we're going to make a new variable
04:15 - we're going to call it turn
04:18 - turn for all sprites so inside turn
04:21 - we're going to set it to zero
04:23 - at the beginning so that so we're also
04:25 - going to make this apple logo apple dash
04:27 - title like rotate side to side so we're
04:29 - gonna make
04:29 - something called turn to zero and we're
04:32 - gonna get a forever loop
04:33 - forever forever um we're going to change
04:39 - change the size oops change the size
04:43 - uh by 150 divided by
04:46 - 150 we're going to divide and subtract
04:50 - so we're going to subtract the 150
04:53 - by the size well
04:56 - size and then we're going to divide by
04:58 - three
05:00 - so remember the um subtract has to be in
05:03 - the first slot
05:05 - and then we're going to change the turn
05:06 - by four we'll use the term
05:09 - uh we're going to change the turn by
05:11 - four
05:12 - [Music]
05:14 - we are going to turn this amount of
05:16 - degrees
05:17 - so this is just to make this thing
05:20 - rotate side to side so turn
05:22 - going to get a divide by two
05:26 - divide by two and we're gonna get cosine
05:30 - all right um oops
05:34 - move it to the front cosine
05:38 - of turn
05:43 - all right and then if it if we're gonna
05:46 - move the mouse on the sprite the title
05:49 - sprite we're gonna make it flash big
05:51 - okay
05:52 - and we're gonna get so we're gonna get
05:54 - if
05:56 - the touching mouse pointer
06:00 - then we're going to we can just
06:01 - duplicate this
06:04 - change this instead of 150 we're doing
06:07 - 200
06:08 - 200 minus the size divided by three all
06:11 - right
06:12 - and then one more script right here when
06:14 - i receive start game
06:16 - so when the game has started when you
06:17 - click on the begin button
06:19 - we're going to hide this and stop the
06:21 - script stop other scripts in the spring
06:25 - [Music]
06:29 - okay so now we can save the project
06:33 - as you can see this thing is right there
06:35 - it is
06:37 - toggling from side to side you put your
06:39 - mouse on it gets bigger
06:40 - i think we can actually make this sprite
06:43 - smaller in the costumes
06:46 - so i'm going to make it a little bit
06:47 - smaller looks a little bit too big
06:52 - i think this is better
06:55 - there you go that looks better and when
06:58 - you click play as you can see it flashes
06:59 - big
07:00 - that's why we said it's a zero percent
07:02 - right
07:04 - just makes your game look a little bit
07:05 - better with this little thing
07:07 - title all right so now
07:11 - we can start working on our uh fruit
07:14 - armageddon scripts
07:17 - so what this is is uh
07:20 - so at some points a bombard of fruits
07:24 - and bombs will fall
07:26 - into into the game to make it more
07:27 - interesting you know
07:29 - so we are going to make a new sprite
07:32 - i'm gonna paint it okay uh
07:36 - text we're gonna use the red we're gonna
07:39 - use marker i guess
07:41 - and then we're going to say i guess
07:43 - incoming
07:51 - uh use the we will add the force field
07:55 - after this
07:55 - use the force field
08:00 - by getting the
08:06 - f key all right
08:10 - uh let's go into text
08:14 - let's space it out a little bit so it
08:17 - looks better
08:20 - here we go and we're gonna make this
08:22 - text flash
08:23 - so it'll look better
08:26 - all right okay so we have the text
08:30 - we're gonna go into the code uh we can
08:32 - probably shrink this inside like that
08:36 - so we'll get more space to increase the
08:39 - size
08:45 - let's make it a little bit smaller
08:48 - okay there you go all right so now let's
08:52 - go back to the code for this thing
08:54 - and then when i receive start game
08:58 - uh start game we're going to
09:01 - make a new variable we're going to call
09:02 - it uh
09:04 - fruit arm get done
09:08 - definitely spell it
09:14 - uh this is for all sprites again so
09:17 - we're gonna set it to off
09:18 - in the beginning because it is
09:22 - um it will occur every off every so
09:24 - often
09:25 - so in the beginning we don't want it to
09:27 - play and then we're going to get forever
09:30 - forever if
09:34 - we're going to get an if uh
09:37 - then statement so if not
09:40 - so if it's not equal
09:44 - if the fruit or what we're getting is on
09:46 - so if it's not
09:47 - that means it's gonna be off
09:51 - if it's not this then we're going to
09:54 - wait 10 seconds so probably like
09:58 - every 10 seconds and armageddon will
10:01 - occur
10:02 - so we're gonna repeat four times we're
10:05 - gonna make it like flashes making the
10:06 - text flash so we're gonna go hide
10:10 - wait 0.5 seconds
10:16 - 0.5 seconds and then we're going to show
10:20 - i'm going to wait another 0.5 seconds
10:25 - all right and then we're going to hide
10:28 - after this is done playing we're going
10:30 - to hide this
10:32 - and then we're going to set the fruit
10:34 - i'm getting to on so it's
10:36 - in progress of doing it set through i'm
10:39 - getting status to on
10:41 - you know we're going to broadcast a
10:44 - message called fruit armageddon
10:46 - this will be uh um the
10:49 - fruits will receive this message
10:50 - actually so you're gonna get broadcast
10:57 - [Music]
10:58 - fruit
11:00 - and then we're going to wait another 10
11:02 - seconds so it won't be that pretty good
11:06 - all right so here's the code for that
11:08 - and then we're going to get our one
11:09 - green flag clicked
11:12 - uh i'll probably keep this text like
11:15 - right here
11:16 - in the middle of the screen maybe like
11:18 - zero zero or something so we're gonna
11:19 - hide
11:22 - and then we're going to go to zero zero
11:25 - which is the origin zero zero
11:28 - and we're going to set the status to off
11:31 - set
11:33 - fruit i'm getting status to off
11:37 - um and then when i receive
11:42 - here end game right here we're going to
11:46 - stop
11:46 - other scripts in the sprite all right
11:52 - okay so now let's go back to our fruits
11:58 - so inside the fruits we're going to
12:00 - receive the message
12:02 - when i receive fruit armageddon okay so
12:05 - when i receive fruit
12:09 - armageddon we are going to set the fruit
12:11 - speed to negative 15.
12:12 - so right here fruit speed is negative
12:14 - six we're basically gonna like
12:16 - make it faster so then the fruits will
12:18 - fall faster
12:21 - fruit speed
12:25 - right here we're going to negative 15
12:28 - and then we're gonna wait eight seconds
12:30 - so it'll be
12:31 - like that for eight seconds i'm getting
12:32 - will probably be for eight seconds
12:34 - and we're gonna set the fruit speed back
12:36 - to negative six after it is finished
12:41 - negative six so we're going to set it to
12:43 - negative six
12:44 - and then we're going to broadcast a
12:46 - message called stop
12:47 - fruit armageddon and then the armageddon
12:50 - text will receive that and we'll stop
12:52 - so stop
12:59 - that okay so we're going to go to the
13:03 - sprite um we can rename it's like text
13:06 - or something
13:07 - and when when we receive this message
13:09 - inside the text
13:11 - we are going to receive
13:15 - stop for armageddon
13:20 - stop returning again we're going to stop
13:23 - uh
13:23 - set the fruit arm cutting status to off
13:37 - all right so now we have this fruit
13:38 - armageddon let's test it out
14:06 - also everyone i made one small mistake
14:09 - this has to be on
14:12 - so you have to wait until the fruit
14:13 - armageddon status is equal
14:15 - not equal to on that means is off so i
14:17 - found it out
14:18 - so be sure to put this into your code
14:21 - right so now let's test it out
14:26 - [Music]
14:28 - should happen like every 10 seconds
14:33 - there you go as you can see the text is
14:36 - showing up
14:38 - and the fruits are falling faster
14:41 - we can also make the bombs fall faster
14:43 - by putting the same code
14:44 - into the bomb and the coins all right
14:49 - so it's just that one small mistake i
14:51 - put right there you have to put it
14:52 - on and now off all right
14:56 - so let's go to the bomb we could just
14:58 - pretty much go
14:59 - back to the fruits drag and drop this
15:03 - thing into the bomb and drag and drop
15:05 - this thing
15:06 - into the coin all right
15:10 - so let's start just waiting for another
15:14 - i'm getting
15:21 - as you can see the text is showing up
15:30 - so you can see everything's falling
15:31 - faster
15:33 - yeah let's save our project
15:37 - also i forgot yeah right here you have
15:40 - to
15:41 - switch these this has to be bomb speed
15:44 - not fruit speed bomb speed this also has
15:47 - b bomb speed
15:50 - that uh how fast do we oh we put at
15:53 - negative eight that's the speed of the
15:55 - bomb
15:55 - that's normally um so we're gonna make
15:57 - this like negative 20 or something
16:00 - and inside the coin we have to instead
16:03 - of doing this we're going to have to
16:06 - oops uh we'll have to do this as
16:09 - the same thing corresponding so we're
16:11 - going to use the coin
16:13 - speed the coin speed um
16:18 - and also we have to um set the wait time
16:21 - to zero
16:22 - right here so it won't be waiting wait
16:25 - time
16:25 - zero negative fifth let's do negative 20
16:29 - as well
16:32 - and the wait time wait eight seconds
16:34 - we're gonna put the weight time to three
16:35 - again
16:37 - so this just not let them not spawn too
16:40 - quick
16:41 - wait time to three and then we're going
16:43 - to set the fruit uh
16:45 - coin speed back to original
16:48 - speed which is nine all right
16:51 - negative time okay
16:56 - let's do it now uh
16:59 - okay i just turned on the volume
17:08 - um just wait until the armageddon comes
17:13 - all right so here it is
17:16 - all right see as you can see everything
17:18 - is falling faster now not just the
17:20 - fruits
17:25 - all right so yeah
17:28 - that's the armageddon so now let's work
17:31 - on the force field
17:33 - i don't think we'll actually be able to
17:35 - finish this today
17:37 - if we can then that'd be great so first
17:40 - let me um i think i have my backpack
17:43 - if not i want to get it okay so hold up
17:47 - let me get my
17:48 - force field sprite real quick all right
17:50 - so now we have our force field
17:51 - um purchase uh button
17:55 - and now i have to get my force feel all
17:58 - right so now i have both the force field
18:00 - and the purchase button
18:02 - so something where that's different
18:03 - between these
18:05 - and the force fields you can bought
18:06 - unlimited amount of force fields
18:08 - so that's gonna be one different thing
18:10 - we're gonna have to switch
18:12 - okay so in the force field when i
18:13 - receive start game
18:16 - we are going to hide
18:22 - and when i receive start screen
18:26 - we're going to hide and we're going to
18:30 - switch the costume to costume one
18:32 - which is the non-grayed out one so we
18:33 - have a grayed out one and laundry that
18:35 - one
18:36 - so every time you click it it'll just
18:38 - change a little color
18:39 - that's what i'm just gonna do also one
18:42 - and when i receive um
18:47 - i'm gonna receive what is that um
18:50 - endgame i'm going to hide
18:55 - okay and then so basically we're just
18:57 - going to drag and drop the same thing
18:58 - over here so right here we have this
19:01 - thing right
19:03 - uh this check purchase so we're just
19:06 - going to drag and drop this into
19:09 - right all right so now we have this
19:14 - so i deleted the endgame thing because i
19:17 - realized it's a whole different thing so
19:18 - we
19:18 - need that so right here we have this
19:21 - thing
19:22 - instead we have to make a new variable
19:25 - we're going to call it start buying
19:26 - this this one you could buy infinite
19:28 - amount and it seems that we already have
19:30 - it because i
19:31 - imported this sprite so start buying is
19:33 - the variable it's for all sprites as
19:35 - well
19:35 - so we're going to instead let's change
19:38 - this to start mine because here by
19:40 - infinite amount
19:41 - and we're going to put yes right here
19:44 - and
19:45 - we're going to instead of using this
19:47 - we're going to have to
19:49 - broadcast another message so drag and
19:51 - drop another thing this thing
19:53 - when i receive shop into our force field
19:57 - so when i receive shop i'm gonna make
19:59 - this guy go to
20:01 - negative 60 and negative 25
20:05 - instead and we're going to
20:08 - switch the costume to costume one
20:12 - okay and 100 minus size divided by three
20:15 - that's
20:16 - the same thing and then instead right
20:18 - here we're going to change something
20:20 - different so we're going to allow them
20:21 - by infinite amount
20:23 - so we're going to keep this out for a
20:26 - second
20:27 - now we're going to set the start buying
20:28 - variable
20:32 - start buying
20:35 - to yes and put this
20:38 - broadcast we're gonna use the broadcast
20:40 - and wait instead
20:42 - and we're going to make a new variable
20:45 - called check
20:48 - field purchase
20:53 - check for the purchase and weights all
20:56 - right and right here
20:59 - uh instead of this we're going to do
21:03 - check force field purchase oops
21:08 - and we're going to start buying to yes
21:12 - and instead right here we're going to
21:14 - set to start buying
21:17 - back to n uh
21:20 - so if it's equal to yes could have set
21:23 - it back to
21:24 - no and this has to be an
21:28 - if then statement not if else
21:31 - if don't we we can keep this actually
21:35 - because
21:36 - it's the same cost we're going to set
21:38 - the start by
21:41 - start buying two
21:45 - node and we are going to
21:48 - get an equal operator
21:52 - start buying here
21:55 - to yes
21:59 - and we're just going to put this back in
22:02 - in here
22:03 - if and this has to be an if-then
22:05 - statement again
22:06 - so can you use another if that statement
22:09 - so this is a bit different because you
22:11 - want to buy infinite amounts so
22:12 - if money we're going to make it 25 costs
22:14 - the same as the wings
22:16 - then we're going to change the money
22:20 - the money money by
22:26 - negative 25 and we are going to switch
22:29 - the cost from the costume to
22:32 - switch costume costume two and i'm
22:34 - pretty sure we have the variable
22:35 - force field already force field uh
22:39 - right here yeah so this one we're gonna
22:41 - change the force field
22:43 - by one variable force field it's for all
22:46 - sprites as well
22:47 - so once you buy one you will gain a
22:49 - force field and
22:50 - you're going to wait 0.5 seconds before
22:52 - letting them buy one more again so
22:54 - wait point five seconds and then we're
22:56 - gonna switch back to the original
22:58 - costume allowing them to buy another one
23:01 - switch costume costume one all right
23:06 - so now let's go to our force field
23:08 - actual sprite
23:09 - the actual sprite itself like the actual
23:12 - force field
23:13 - and we are going to
23:18 - get a when the f key is pressed when
23:21 - key f is pressed we're going to get if
23:25 - then statement if
23:27 - so we're going to get if um force field
23:31 - is uh greater than one we're only going
23:32 - to allow it if they have greater than
23:34 - one force field of course you can use
23:36 - one if you don't have any
23:37 - so greater than one and you have two
23:41 - conditions
23:42 - of course fuel greater than one and
23:45 - not forceful status equals on so that
23:47 - means um
23:49 - if a force wheel is on
23:53 - then that means we can't allow them to
23:54 - use another one so they can't stack on
23:56 - each other
23:57 - so we already have the force field
23:59 - status right here
24:01 - i made it and so basically
24:04 - it's for all sprites as well and we're
24:07 - going to get a knot
24:08 - right here not equal
24:11 - to on so
24:14 - force field status not equal to on
24:19 - and then we're going to set the force
24:20 - field timer which is already right here
24:23 - set the force field timer
24:27 - to 10 so it's going to be for 10 seconds
24:31 - and then we're going to broadcast a
24:33 - message
24:35 - and we are going to name it start timer
24:37 - i think we would have it
24:40 - start timer apparently we do not have it
24:43 - so we have to make the message
24:49 - start timer and inside start timer we're
24:51 - going to show
24:54 - go to front layer so it's going to go in
24:56 - front of the actual player
25:00 - we'll go to front layer where is it over
25:03 - here and then we're going to set the
25:04 - ghost effect
25:05 - 50 so it's
25:08 - a little bit see-through so you can see
25:10 - through it a little bit set the
25:13 - ghost 50
25:18 - and we're gonna have forever
25:22 - forever if else if
25:26 - force field timer is greater than zero
25:29 - then it will always go to the fruit
25:30 - catcher so
25:32 - if it's not over basically meaning the
25:34 - force field timer is not over
25:37 - force field timer is not over then we
25:39 - will always go to the fruit catcher
25:42 - or the ghost the player
25:45 - yeah and else if it's over that we are
25:49 - going to
25:49 - set the force field status to off
25:53 - force wheel status to off
25:56 - and we're going to hide and stop the
25:59 - script
26:08 - all right so this is the when you click
26:11 - f this will happen
26:13 - and then we're going to get it when
26:14 - green flag clicked
26:17 - set the force field uh to zero so you'll
26:20 - start out with zero force fields
26:24 - zero and then we're going to set the
26:25 - force field to off
26:27 - force field status to off in the
26:30 - beginning you do not have a force field
26:31 - on
26:32 - and we're gonna hide in the beginning
26:37 - all right and then when i receive start
26:39 - game
26:41 - we are going to
26:45 - uh start game we are going to hide and
26:47 - sing with endgame
26:50 - just duplicate this one and oops
26:54 - uh duplicate this one and we're going to
26:56 - rename it to endgame
26:59 - right here and when i receive start
27:02 - screen
27:02 - we're also going to hide
27:06 - start screen
27:10 - and one last thing this is the timer so
27:12 - when you receive start timer
27:14 - like we broadcasted earlier timer
27:17 - we're going to set the force field
27:18 - status to on
27:20 - so while the timer is active the force
27:23 - field will be on
27:26 - um and we're going to change the force
27:29 - field
27:30 - by negative one because you've used one
27:33 - change force field by negative one
27:37 - and we're going to repeat the amount for
27:39 - force field timer so
27:41 - which is 10 repeat the force field timer
27:46 - amount
27:48 - and we're going to wait one second
27:52 - and change the force field timer by
27:54 - negative one
28:03 - all right so now let's save it let's go
28:06 - full screen
28:09 - all right so as you can see oh yeah we
28:11 - can also hide the variable in the
28:12 - beginning
28:14 - so let me get some money first it costs
28:16 - 25
28:17 - um money
28:22 - i'll get a little bit more so i can show
28:24 - you can buy multiple
28:26 - okay so let me
28:31 - keep on going all right
28:41 - like 50. and
28:44 - remember you can click s to go to the
28:46 - shop all right
28:48 - so we are going to buy some force wheel
28:50 - so as you can see by one
28:51 - by two you get two all right let's hit
28:55 - the
28:55 - f key you can see the force right there
28:59 - and you don't take any damage
29:04 - one last thing i forgot that we have to
29:06 - make it
29:07 - let the player not take any damage when
29:09 - they touch a bomb with the force field
29:11 - active
29:13 - so we are going to go to the player
29:15 - again
29:16 - one last time player
29:20 - so right here i forgot to add this
29:23 - uh not player
29:28 - let's go to the bomb and so right here
29:30 - if the y position
29:32 - we're also going to put a or statement
29:34 - so we're going to put or
29:36 - or or it's touching the
29:40 - force field touching
29:44 - the force field
29:48 - all right so we're going to do the same
29:52 - thing to the fruits and coins
29:55 - so inside the fruit if touching basket
30:00 - or force feel
30:08 - and finally the coin
30:12 - right here in the coin we are going to
30:14 - get a
30:17 - um so we're going to do it down here
30:22 - where it's touching the basket we're
30:23 - going to get an ore
30:26 - touching basket or
30:30 - touch it so apparently the recorder
30:32 - stopped for some reason so
30:35 - you'll see a cut right there so we're
30:37 - going to
30:38 - continue where we left off so we're
30:40 - going to do this one touch if touching
30:42 - force field as well
30:43 - all right and that should be it
30:46 - i'm pretty sure so let's play
30:51 - let's make it bigger all right
31:13 - oh missing all the
31:17 - there we got a coins we're pretty close
31:19 - to 50.
31:20 - i'll show you that you can buy multiple
31:23 - and okay one more
31:26 - one more please
31:30 - so you buy one let's go back
31:36 - all right oh that one gave one come on
31:39 - looks like they gave a random amount
31:43 - um let's buy another one all right let's
31:45 - wait until an armageddon comes and i'll
31:46 - show you that
31:47 - the force field should work or i can
31:49 - just show you right now yeah see
31:51 - as you can see i don't get damaged by
31:53 - the bombs
32:09 - so yeah that's pretty much it
32:12 - for this project um
32:16 - don't forget to like share and subscribe
32:17 - to our channel kids coding playground
32:20 - and i'll see you guys in the next
32:21 - tutorial bye
32:30 - you

Cleaned transcript:

okay so welcome back guys it's kids coding polygram here so today we will be finishing up apple dash so you guys may be asking why haven't you been posting the video it's been over a month well it's because i have end of the year exams and have to um like study it for the tests but now school is over i can upload more frequently so we will be working on the last part of apple dash so before we start i will quickly go through the code of the game all right zoom in so inside the player here is the movement and switching the skins if you buy the other one the starting up the game and we got the bomb this is the code for the bomb the sound when it hits the player when the bomb falling out of the sky and the hp on the character the basket fruits so it's like the fruit movement the fruit falling down so this is the fruit and now we got the begin button really simple just it's like clicking the begin button coins this is the currency of the game you use this to buy different upgrades you can pause it if you'd like hit box the shop the shop icon you can click on it all right so that's the shop icon the shop background switches the background into the shop the exit button in the shop so you can click and exit and then this is the speed upgrade okay and then this is the bigger basket upgrade and then we have the different skin purchase you can buy the pig all right and this is the button let's say you want to switch back to the ghost you just click it all right so right now we're gonna add like a little title screen so when you start the game as you can see it's kind of like blank right here we're gonna add like a little title screen right there so it'll look a little bit better so i actually got the skirts for my dad he helped me add this thing so let's paint a new sprite so first we're going to i'm going to get like a yellowish color like kind of yellow or orange with no outline um make the saturation max and i'll click on the text probably going to make it a marker because it's easier to see so i'm going to write apple dash dash like that uh make it bigger okay all right so we have our texas make it a little bit smaller so apple dash okay all right so first in apple dash in this a title we're gonna rename this thing to title capslock title title all right so let's start coding inside the title so when i receive the start screen uh message on the title we're going to go to the font layer go to front layer and i'm going to go to x0 and y10 so it's going to be somewhere like right here about like right there and we're going to show the sprite and we're going to go point in direction of 90 point direction 90. i'm going to set the size of zero percent all right so like it's gonna like turn small and flash big that's what we're gonna do and we're going to make a new variable we're going to call it turn turn for all sprites so inside turn we're going to set it to zero at the beginning so that so we're also going to make this apple logo apple dash title like rotate side to side so we're gonna make something called turn to zero and we're gonna get a forever loop forever forever um we're going to change change the size oops change the size uh by 150 divided by 150 we're going to divide and subtract so we're going to subtract the 150 by the size well size and then we're going to divide by three so remember the um subtract has to be in the first slot and then we're going to change the turn by four we'll use the term uh we're going to change the turn by four we are going to turn this amount of degrees so this is just to make this thing rotate side to side so turn going to get a divide by two divide by two and we're gonna get cosine all right um oops move it to the front cosine of turn all right and then if it if we're gonna move the mouse on the sprite the title sprite we're gonna make it flash big okay and we're gonna get so we're gonna get if the touching mouse pointer then we're going to we can just duplicate this change this instead of 150 we're doing 200 200 minus the size divided by three all right and then one more script right here when i receive start game so when the game has started when you click on the begin button we're going to hide this and stop the script stop other scripts in the spring okay so now we can save the project as you can see this thing is right there it is toggling from side to side you put your mouse on it gets bigger i think we can actually make this sprite smaller in the costumes so i'm going to make it a little bit smaller looks a little bit too big i think this is better there you go that looks better and when you click play as you can see it flashes big that's why we said it's a zero percent right just makes your game look a little bit better with this little thing title all right so now we can start working on our uh fruit armageddon scripts so what this is is uh so at some points a bombard of fruits and bombs will fall into into the game to make it more interesting you know so we are going to make a new sprite i'm gonna paint it okay uh text we're gonna use the red we're gonna use marker i guess and then we're going to say i guess incoming uh use the we will add the force field after this use the force field by getting the f key all right uh let's go into text let's space it out a little bit so it looks better here we go and we're gonna make this text flash so it'll look better all right okay so we have the text we're gonna go into the code uh we can probably shrink this inside like that so we'll get more space to increase the size let's make it a little bit smaller okay there you go all right so now let's go back to the code for this thing and then when i receive start game uh start game we're going to make a new variable we're going to call it uh fruit arm get done definitely spell it uh this is for all sprites again so we're gonna set it to off in the beginning because it is um it will occur every off every so often so in the beginning we don't want it to play and then we're going to get forever forever if we're going to get an if uh then statement so if not so if it's not equal if the fruit or what we're getting is on so if it's not that means it's gonna be off if it's not this then we're going to wait 10 seconds so probably like every 10 seconds and armageddon will occur so we're gonna repeat four times we're gonna make it like flashes making the text flash so we're gonna go hide wait 0.5 seconds 0.5 seconds and then we're going to show i'm going to wait another 0.5 seconds all right and then we're going to hide after this is done playing we're going to hide this and then we're going to set the fruit i'm getting to on so it's in progress of doing it set through i'm getting status to on you know we're going to broadcast a message called fruit armageddon this will be uh um the fruits will receive this message actually so you're gonna get broadcast fruit and then we're going to wait another 10 seconds so it won't be that pretty good all right so here's the code for that and then we're going to get our one green flag clicked uh i'll probably keep this text like right here in the middle of the screen maybe like zero zero or something so we're gonna hide and then we're going to go to zero zero which is the origin zero zero and we're going to set the status to off set fruit i'm getting status to off um and then when i receive here end game right here we're going to stop other scripts in the sprite all right okay so now let's go back to our fruits so inside the fruits we're going to receive the message when i receive fruit armageddon okay so when i receive fruit armageddon we are going to set the fruit speed to negative 15. so right here fruit speed is negative six we're basically gonna like make it faster so then the fruits will fall faster fruit speed right here we're going to negative 15 and then we're gonna wait eight seconds so it'll be like that for eight seconds i'm getting will probably be for eight seconds and we're gonna set the fruit speed back to negative six after it is finished negative six so we're going to set it to negative six and then we're going to broadcast a message called stop fruit armageddon and then the armageddon text will receive that and we'll stop so stop that okay so we're going to go to the sprite um we can rename it's like text or something and when when we receive this message inside the text we are going to receive stop for armageddon stop returning again we're going to stop uh set the fruit arm cutting status to off all right so now we have this fruit armageddon let's test it out also everyone i made one small mistake this has to be on so you have to wait until the fruit armageddon status is equal not equal to on that means is off so i found it out so be sure to put this into your code right so now let's test it out should happen like every 10 seconds there you go as you can see the text is showing up and the fruits are falling faster we can also make the bombs fall faster by putting the same code into the bomb and the coins all right so it's just that one small mistake i put right there you have to put it on and now off all right so let's go to the bomb we could just pretty much go back to the fruits drag and drop this thing into the bomb and drag and drop this thing into the coin all right so let's start just waiting for another i'm getting as you can see the text is showing up so you can see everything's falling faster yeah let's save our project also i forgot yeah right here you have to switch these this has to be bomb speed not fruit speed bomb speed this also has b bomb speed that uh how fast do we oh we put at negative eight that's the speed of the bomb that's normally um so we're gonna make this like negative 20 or something and inside the coin we have to instead of doing this we're going to have to oops uh we'll have to do this as the same thing corresponding so we're going to use the coin speed the coin speed um and also we have to um set the wait time to zero right here so it won't be waiting wait time zero negative fifth let's do negative 20 as well and the wait time wait eight seconds we're gonna put the weight time to three again so this just not let them not spawn too quick wait time to three and then we're going to set the fruit uh coin speed back to original speed which is nine all right negative time okay let's do it now uh okay i just turned on the volume um just wait until the armageddon comes all right so here it is all right see as you can see everything is falling faster now not just the fruits all right so yeah that's the armageddon so now let's work on the force field i don't think we'll actually be able to finish this today if we can then that'd be great so first let me um i think i have my backpack if not i want to get it okay so hold up let me get my force field sprite real quick all right so now we have our force field um purchase uh button and now i have to get my force feel all right so now i have both the force field and the purchase button so something where that's different between these and the force fields you can bought unlimited amount of force fields so that's gonna be one different thing we're gonna have to switch okay so in the force field when i receive start game we are going to hide and when i receive start screen we're going to hide and we're going to switch the costume to costume one which is the nongrayed out one so we have a grayed out one and laundry that one so every time you click it it'll just change a little color that's what i'm just gonna do also one and when i receive um i'm gonna receive what is that um endgame i'm going to hide okay and then so basically we're just going to drag and drop the same thing over here so right here we have this thing right uh this check purchase so we're just going to drag and drop this into right all right so now we have this so i deleted the endgame thing because i realized it's a whole different thing so we need that so right here we have this thing instead we have to make a new variable we're going to call it start buying this this one you could buy infinite amount and it seems that we already have it because i imported this sprite so start buying is the variable it's for all sprites as well so we're going to instead let's change this to start mine because here by infinite amount and we're going to put yes right here and we're going to instead of using this we're going to have to broadcast another message so drag and drop another thing this thing when i receive shop into our force field so when i receive shop i'm gonna make this guy go to negative 60 and negative 25 instead and we're going to switch the costume to costume one okay and 100 minus size divided by three that's the same thing and then instead right here we're going to change something different so we're going to allow them by infinite amount so we're going to keep this out for a second now we're going to set the start buying variable start buying to yes and put this broadcast we're gonna use the broadcast and wait instead and we're going to make a new variable called check field purchase check for the purchase and weights all right and right here uh instead of this we're going to do check force field purchase oops and we're going to start buying to yes and instead right here we're going to set to start buying back to n uh so if it's equal to yes could have set it back to no and this has to be an if then statement not if else if don't we we can keep this actually because it's the same cost we're going to set the start by start buying two node and we are going to get an equal operator start buying here to yes and we're just going to put this back in in here if and this has to be an ifthen statement again so can you use another if that statement so this is a bit different because you want to buy infinite amounts so if money we're going to make it 25 costs the same as the wings then we're going to change the money the money money by negative 25 and we are going to switch the cost from the costume to switch costume costume two and i'm pretty sure we have the variable force field already force field uh right here yeah so this one we're gonna change the force field by one variable force field it's for all sprites as well so once you buy one you will gain a force field and you're going to wait 0.5 seconds before letting them buy one more again so wait point five seconds and then we're gonna switch back to the original costume allowing them to buy another one switch costume costume one all right so now let's go to our force field actual sprite the actual sprite itself like the actual force field and we are going to get a when the f key is pressed when key f is pressed we're going to get if then statement if so we're going to get if um force field is uh greater than one we're only going to allow it if they have greater than one force field of course you can use one if you don't have any so greater than one and you have two conditions of course fuel greater than one and not forceful status equals on so that means um if a force wheel is on then that means we can't allow them to use another one so they can't stack on each other so we already have the force field status right here i made it and so basically it's for all sprites as well and we're going to get a knot right here not equal to on so force field status not equal to on and then we're going to set the force field timer which is already right here set the force field timer to 10 so it's going to be for 10 seconds and then we're going to broadcast a message and we are going to name it start timer i think we would have it start timer apparently we do not have it so we have to make the message start timer and inside start timer we're going to show go to front layer so it's going to go in front of the actual player we'll go to front layer where is it over here and then we're going to set the ghost effect 50 so it's a little bit seethrough so you can see through it a little bit set the ghost 50 and we're gonna have forever forever if else if force field timer is greater than zero then it will always go to the fruit catcher so if it's not over basically meaning the force field timer is not over force field timer is not over then we will always go to the fruit catcher or the ghost the player yeah and else if it's over that we are going to set the force field status to off force wheel status to off and we're going to hide and stop the script all right so this is the when you click f this will happen and then we're going to get it when green flag clicked set the force field uh to zero so you'll start out with zero force fields zero and then we're going to set the force field to off force field status to off in the beginning you do not have a force field on and we're gonna hide in the beginning all right and then when i receive start game we are going to uh start game we are going to hide and sing with endgame just duplicate this one and oops uh duplicate this one and we're going to rename it to endgame right here and when i receive start screen we're also going to hide start screen and one last thing this is the timer so when you receive start timer like we broadcasted earlier timer we're going to set the force field status to on so while the timer is active the force field will be on um and we're going to change the force field by negative one because you've used one change force field by negative one and we're going to repeat the amount for force field timer so which is 10 repeat the force field timer amount and we're going to wait one second and change the force field timer by negative one all right so now let's save it let's go full screen all right so as you can see oh yeah we can also hide the variable in the beginning so let me get some money first it costs 25 um money i'll get a little bit more so i can show you can buy multiple okay so let me keep on going all right like 50. and remember you can click s to go to the shop all right so we are going to buy some force wheel so as you can see by one by two you get two all right let's hit the f key you can see the force right there and you don't take any damage one last thing i forgot that we have to make it let the player not take any damage when they touch a bomb with the force field active so we are going to go to the player again one last time player so right here i forgot to add this uh not player let's go to the bomb and so right here if the y position we're also going to put a or statement so we're going to put or or or it's touching the force field touching the force field all right so we're going to do the same thing to the fruits and coins so inside the fruit if touching basket or force feel and finally the coin right here in the coin we are going to get a um so we're going to do it down here where it's touching the basket we're going to get an ore touching basket or touch it so apparently the recorder stopped for some reason so you'll see a cut right there so we're going to continue where we left off so we're going to do this one touch if touching force field as well all right and that should be it i'm pretty sure so let's play let's make it bigger all right oh missing all the there we got a coins we're pretty close to 50. i'll show you that you can buy multiple and okay one more one more please so you buy one let's go back all right oh that one gave one come on looks like they gave a random amount um let's buy another one all right let's wait until an armageddon comes and i'll show you that the force field should work or i can just show you right now yeah see as you can see i don't get damaged by the bombs so yeah that's pretty much it for this project um don't forget to like share and subscribe to our channel kids coding playground and i'll see you guys in the next tutorial bye you
