00:00 - [Music]
00:08 - welcome back guys it's kids coding
00:11 - playing around here
00:12 - and today we're back for another video
00:14 - of spaceship adventure
00:16 - game part two two
00:19 - so i'm gonna show you all the code that
00:22 - i've already done
00:23 - and what yeah what i basically done so
00:27 - here it is um so yeah just copy it off
00:30 - feel free to pause anytime
00:35 - so this is laser oh we didn't do the
00:37 - laser yet didn't do alien either
00:39 - background this is background so
00:42 - feel free to pause arrow
00:46 - that this arrow is for the left side
00:48 - this arrows for the right side
00:50 - doesn't really matter what side you put
00:52 - it on but you just have to code it
00:53 - correctly
00:54 - the start button
00:57 - and the thumbnail i will get to that so
00:59 - first we're going to start with the
01:01 - laser
01:02 - so the laser is just a green cloud clip
01:05 - because that's what everything starts
01:06 - out with when you click this magical
01:07 - button
01:08 - um the set size is 20
01:12 - so it doesn't look that big because the
01:14 - laser is
01:15 - humongous right now
01:22 - and then put
01:25 - yeah so um point in direction zero
01:28 - but remember guys i've got a lot of
01:31 - comments of
01:32 - how do you get the laser how do you get
01:34 - the laser so this is how you get the
01:36 - laser
01:37 - it's a button you go here i like what i
01:40 - mentioned in the first part
01:41 - this button right here i'm not going to
01:44 - use this but look you just put it
01:45 - look simple and then you just rename
01:49 - this to laser there you got
01:50 - laser so that's basically what the
01:52 - button is for
01:54 - and then i'll go to
01:59 - i'll go to x position
02:02 - of the tricky block the two tricky you
02:06 - need two tricky blocks so
02:08 - um remember always change the last one
02:11 - first
02:12 - so spaceship go to the x and y
02:16 - so then it will go to the spaceship
02:23 - y position and then now you need to go
02:25 - hide
02:29 - and then go forever
02:33 - the forever glitch isn't here anymore
02:35 - and then if
02:36 - then statement
02:41 - but then the key space is pressed the
02:43 - laser will fire up
02:44 - which is normal for most of our games
02:46 - that we make you can make it
02:49 - any other key but i decided to make
02:50 - space key because space key
02:52 - is honestly the best for shooting out
02:54 - bullets i mean that's how it is
02:56 - and then you need to go to
03:02 - you to go to the x position of the
03:05 - spaceship
03:06 - the y position of the spaceship it'll
03:09 - move
03:10 - 20 steps so it will go to the front of
03:14 - the spaceship when you shoot it out
03:15 - because they'll have some delay if it's
03:17 - in the middle because once you go to
03:19 - it'll be right here in the middle smack
03:21 - dab in the middle
03:22 - so it'll have some delay while you shoot
03:24 - it so we'll go up
03:27 - so you do not want that delay so you
03:29 - want to move 20 steps up so that no
03:30 - glitch
03:32 - so yeah um you also need to show
03:39 - and then you gotta repeat until
03:44 - touching edge
03:50 - and then you also have to do move 20
03:53 - steps
03:57 - if you wanted to go slower then move it
03:59 - less
04:00 - and now you need to hide
04:05 - and then you need a go to
04:09 - x position a go to x position y position
04:12 - spaceship so we could just duplicate
04:14 - this and put it
04:16 - right up there and then now there we are
04:20 - done with the laser so let's try it out
04:26 - oh yeah yeah we have done
04:29 - it so remember the review from last time
04:33 - skin changing phenomenon stuff like that
04:36 - and start button
04:39 - great so now we're gonna work on the
04:42 - alien so we're really close to be done
04:44 - but the alien has a whole hunk of code
04:47 - so
04:47 - i have five different types of aliens
04:49 - downloaded in google drive
04:51 - if you do not know how to download it
04:52 - from google drive please go to our
04:54 - channel and watch our video
04:55 - how to download sprites from google
04:57 - drive so we have everything in the
04:59 - google drive for you
05:00 - so please do not use your uh school
05:02 - account but use your
05:03 - um normal account like if your name was
05:06 - tom smith or something then you would
05:10 - do tom smith and not your school account
05:14 - or whatever so we have ladybug 2a which
05:18 - is just the normal ladybug we always had
05:20 - alien alien 2 costume one costume dude
05:24 - basically
05:24 - this this one's from um what's not
05:27 - called again
05:28 - space invaders space invaders or
05:31 - something
05:32 - uh this one's also from space invaders i
05:35 - only played six invaders a few times
05:37 - but this thing i don't know where this
05:39 - is from online too so
05:40 - i'll give them credit so um
05:43 - yeah so when the green flag is clicked
05:48 - hide and then when i
05:52 - receive start
05:55 - then it will repeat 10 times
06:00 - you know create clone of myself which is
06:02 - basically create
06:03 - types of clones
06:07 - and then when i start as a clone
06:10 - it will switch costume pick random one
06:12 - to five
06:13 - this is because when it switches the
06:16 - costume
06:17 - since i have five costumes it will
06:20 - switch
06:21 - to five costumes so it can pick a random
06:23 - of
06:24 - the costume one to five so it's a 20
06:27 - chance
06:27 - to get the ladybug a 20 chance to get
06:30 - the green monster
06:31 - 20 chance to get the dark green monster
06:34 - 20 chance to get the purple pixel
06:36 - monster
06:37 - and the 20 chance to get the light blue
06:40 - eye alien so
06:43 - um yeah so switch costume no set size is
06:46 - 65
06:48 - because i don't want the aliens that big
06:50 - and not that easy to hit
06:51 - it's already 65 but i'm just adding this
06:53 - and then you guys can change the 65.
06:55 - and it'll show
06:58 - i'll go to x
07:04 - go to x pick random
07:11 - negative 220
07:14 - the positive 220
07:18 - a hundred pick around 100 to 175
07:22 - this is because you don't want aliens
07:25 - spawning down here or like
07:26 - here or like here or here i mean no like
07:29 - these are fine but like
07:30 - here or here or here or on the spaceship
07:33 - itself
07:33 - you do not want aliens to swan there so
07:36 - it's only going to be around here
07:39 - and then now you need a forever loop
07:42 - so forever change y by
07:46 - minus two
07:49 - so go down slowly maturely so
07:53 - change y by minus two
07:57 - so you need if then else
08:00 - if then else
08:03 - the so
08:06 - you need if then else so both the laser
08:08 - and the spaceship
08:10 - will go in and it'll the alien will die
08:12 - so
08:13 - whenever it gets hit by them so i'll
08:15 - code that in just a second so
08:17 - later i will have to use this block so
08:19 - i'm just going to duplicate this put it
08:21 - out to the side for a little bit
08:23 - and i'll take it back once it's chilling
08:25 - and then chilling
08:26 - i'll take it back so so the one
08:30 - if if then else you need if then also
08:33 - if then else the
08:37 - negative 175 is
08:40 - greater than y position
08:46 - then it will go to
08:50 - x position so this
08:53 - this so basically so go back to the top
08:55 - if it's down here or go back to the top
08:58 - and then that's why i put that to the
09:00 - side and then you
09:01 - you need to if then
09:06 - in the if then else and the if
09:09 - then in the if then else has to be
09:12 - an or statement
09:16 - has to be the touching laser
09:23 - or touching spaceship
09:27 - and then um
09:30 - it'll change score by a hundred
09:34 - no i mean you need if then else and then
09:37 - if then that's
09:38 - in the if then else so you need to if
09:41 - then
09:41 - else in the if then in the if then else
09:45 - so you need
09:45 - if then else in the if then so you need
09:48 - to
09:50 - so you need the if then else and if then
09:52 - this and that then else in the forever
09:54 - so if then else you got to put the if
09:57 - you got to put
09:58 - touching laser so
10:00 - [Music]
10:02 - right here we can duplicate this
10:05 - touching laser
10:06 - it will change score by a hundred
10:16 - and then it will change shield by minus
10:18 - five which means
10:20 - the shield will go down if it touches
10:24 - the if it's touching the laser it'll go
10:26 - up the score will go up but if it's
10:27 - touching the spaceship
10:28 - itself it will change yo y minus now
10:32 - broadcast spaceship got hit
10:36 - please i put him there broadcast
10:40 - spaceship got hit
10:44 - oh spaceship
10:49 - ship got hit
10:54 - after we got the spaceship got hit you
10:57 - need to hide
10:58 - but you need to hide under the spaceship
11:02 - got hit
11:03 - script and then you got to put a wait
11:05 - one second
11:08 - a go-to which we need this same
11:12 - thing
11:14 - so we need to put this go to
11:18 - right in here and then after that get to
11:21 - show
11:24 - and then we are almost done with the
11:27 - code we are actually done with the code
11:30 - so our aliens are done
11:33 - so if you guys are confused you guys can
11:35 - copy this down
11:37 - which is just the forever you put the
11:38 - change y by minus two
11:40 - you need if then else and then you gotta
11:43 - put a go to
11:44 - this same as this one and then you gotta
11:46 - i'm just
11:47 - wrapping up the code and then you need
11:49 - to if then
11:50 - so basically that's what you need for
11:52 - this script
11:53 - uh i can zoom in one out so you can see
11:56 - the whole entire thing
11:58 - so yeah now i'm going to show you my
12:00 - game
12:02 - so start once you can choose your skin
12:07 - so i'm going to choose this skin because
12:10 - it looks cool
12:11 - you know i like this one pink rocket
12:14 - let's go you click start look the aliens
12:17 - are coming closer
12:18 - look the aliens are touching the edge so
12:25 - so i'm about to code the end of the
12:27 - spaceship when it dies
12:28 - but for now i'm gonna kill myself no
12:32 - no i didn't kill myself yet but like you
12:34 - know the shield is going down
12:36 - look you can get score whenever you hit
12:38 - an alien and the shield is going down
12:40 - every single time i
12:41 - hit um a alien so
12:46 - so i haven't not coded this stuff yet so
12:50 - i will code the the
12:53 - if the you lost sprite
13:00 - so i'm going to code the spaceship first
13:02 - for the spaceship got hit
13:04 - so what i received spaceship got hit
13:07 - which we just made for after off of the
13:09 - bug
13:09 - it will repeat 10 times so change color
13:11 - effect by
13:13 - minus i mean change color effect by 25
13:18 - so
13:20 - no clear graphic effects in the end so
13:26 - yeah so clear graphic effects where's
13:28 - that
13:29 - right there so there we go we have this
13:33 - coded out so
13:36 - now we have this clear graphic effects
13:39 - so clear graphic effects in the
13:40 - beginning
13:41 - and when you get hit you'll turn back
13:44 - into normal
13:45 - so okay guys we have to code the you
13:48 - lost
13:48 - sprite after that with the code the
13:52 - thumbnail
13:53 - and then the backdrops and we're all
13:55 - good so first we have to get the
13:57 - painting spray
14:02 - go to text um
14:04 - [Music]
14:05 - red i'm go handwriting because
14:10 - in my original game i i actually
14:14 - did you lost in purple and in marker
14:17 - so this one's gonna be handwriting and
14:20 - red because
14:20 - you know whenever you lose in a game or
14:22 - something it's always red
14:24 - i don't know why so you lost
14:30 - i'm going to see if i have to calculate
14:32 - that
14:33 - i don't think i have to you lost
14:36 - and then locally have it so i'm going to
14:39 - make this gigantic
14:43 - so i think that's the right size
14:46 - because whenever you lose it's really
14:48 - big it's like defeat
14:49 - or something so when the green flag is
14:52 - clicked
14:53 - i'll go to zero zero
15:00 - go hide
15:03 - go to front layer
15:09 - it will wait two seconds so this is
15:12 - where the big part comes in
15:13 - so when you lose originally um the
15:17 - if you lose originally one time that
15:20 - means
15:20 - you uh if you do not have this
15:24 - whatever you lose you will you will
15:27 - not be able to play again because the
15:30 - shield is messed up
15:31 - you will see uh you lose when you play
15:33 - it again so
15:34 - basically i'm just gonna code it without
15:37 - without the wait two seconds
15:39 - and i'll show you what happens because
15:42 - i've seen a lot of featured games with
15:44 - without the wait two seconds so they're
15:46 - like refresh the screen if it's not
15:48 - working or something
15:49 - i don't know so it's like
15:52 - i'm going to show you so you know or so
15:54 - if the shield equals
15:57 - or the shield
16:01 - equals zero or the shield
16:06 - is less than zero then
16:09 - show
16:12 - and then stop all so i'll show you i'm
16:15 - gonna die real quick
16:22 - so i already died already so look here
16:25 - the shield 100
16:26 - lucky play i'm gonna
16:33 - so it says you lost see when you click
16:35 - it again it still says you lost
16:38 - like what is this you click it again it
16:40 - works
16:41 - but no one likes that little delay right
16:44 - so you should always put the wait two
16:46 - seconds
16:46 - so then you can play again on your own
16:49 - game
16:50 - without the new loss coming in bug so
16:52 - can we kill myself real quick
16:56 - so it keeps flashing yeah just uh it's
16:59 - like you lost
17:00 - look no you lost it's working
17:03 - yes see um i've seen a lot of featured
17:07 - projects say that
17:09 - it's just glitching whenever um you
17:11 - didn't do that you've lost
17:13 - so remember this is very important
17:16 - and now we have to do the backdrop we
17:18 - have to add edit some music
17:21 - so so i
17:24 - i normally just set it um set the volume
17:27 - to 20
17:28 - just because i want you to hear my voice
17:31 - so set
17:32 - volume to twenty percent or twenty five
17:35 - and then go forever
17:36 - [Music]
17:39 - let's play space
17:42 - ambience i don't wanna pronounce that
17:45 - word
17:49 - [Music]
17:51 - yeah this is space ambience
17:55 - so you just put it in there
17:58 - and look we have our games but first we
18:00 - have to edit a thumbnail
18:02 - i'm just gonna tell you it works
18:05 - lasers working whenever you get hit it's
18:08 - working
18:09 - flash red flashing binary of colors
18:12 - actually
18:14 - [Music]
18:22 - function is working so now i'm going to
18:24 - code the thumbnail
18:26 - so the thumbnail you'll hear the
18:27 - costumes i already have this already
18:29 - so i just wrote space adventure game
18:31 - drew the little space invader ship
18:33 - put some little space invader dudes
18:36 - around it so
18:37 - yeah oh so you can copy it from here
18:41 - like do ctrl a or just drag the whole
18:43 - thing
18:44 - so ctrl c
18:47 - ctrl v to the thumbnail and then you got
18:49 - an alien and you can add it on to your
18:51 - thumbnail
18:52 - so this is just to make it look cooler
18:55 - and in the end
18:56 - it does look pretty cool in my opinion
18:59 - so okay so we're going to work on the
19:01 - thumbnail and
19:03 - so when the green flag is clicked
19:07 - this is optional but i highly recommend
19:09 - it to enhance your game
19:11 - even one little thing can make a
19:13 - difference
19:14 - so it will go to zero zero um go to
19:17 - front layer
19:18 - we actually have a video on this so you
19:20 - guys can watch that um
19:21 - in our channel so yeah there's a lot of
19:25 - videos for you guys to watch
19:26 - we post weekly uh like twice a week
19:30 - maybe three times so
19:34 - yeah so go forever and reset timer today
19:37 - i'm posting on a monday because there's
19:39 - spring break
19:40 - and that means i can record more often
19:43 - so that's great and then when timer
19:46 - so you need to use this so when
19:50 - loudness timer is greater than
19:53 - 0.1 they'll hide variable score so then
19:57 - you can see the
19:58 - little uh
20:02 - the little thing drop down so you also
20:04 - gotta hide the shield
20:05 - and i'll go to x
20:09 - 0 y 300
20:12 - and it'll go to the front layer
20:16 - and then next you have to make it show
20:21 - and then glide 0.5
20:26 - seconds
20:29 - so to zero zero so it is
20:33 - not done it is not quite done so
20:37 - we on this we have to simply i hid the
20:40 - thing
20:41 - i have to show it again or else you you
20:43 - cannot see the both of the variables so
20:46 - show score and then you gotta
20:50 - show variable shield
20:53 - and then there we go we have it
20:56 - i'm gonna save this real quick i already
21:00 - have the shared project up so you guys
21:01 - can look at that if you guys do not know
21:03 - how to do it
21:04 - so we have some spaceships here
21:07 - like all the different skins
21:10 - so when you click to stop space
21:13 - adventure will come down
21:17 - so look great my nails working
21:20 - and yeah about to end it around here i'm
21:22 - watching my little skin
21:25 - so if anybody can beat my high score
21:27 - well
21:28 - um i'll give you
21:32 - nothing i'll give you air but if you can
21:35 - win my high score right now
21:37 - i will be i'll give you something
21:40 - okay so see you guys in a second i got
21:43 - three thousand of course i died on
21:45 - purpose just to finish this video up
21:47 - but anyways um this has been
21:50 - great so uh in the end i will be

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's kids coding playing around here and today we're back for another video of spaceship adventure game part two two so i'm gonna show you all the code that i've already done and what yeah what i basically done so here it is um so yeah just copy it off feel free to pause anytime so this is laser oh we didn't do the laser yet didn't do alien either background this is background so feel free to pause arrow that this arrow is for the left side this arrows for the right side doesn't really matter what side you put it on but you just have to code it correctly the start button and the thumbnail i will get to that so first we're going to start with the laser so the laser is just a green cloud clip because that's what everything starts out with when you click this magical button um the set size is 20 so it doesn't look that big because the laser is humongous right now and then put yeah so um point in direction zero but remember guys i've got a lot of comments of how do you get the laser how do you get the laser so this is how you get the laser it's a button you go here i like what i mentioned in the first part this button right here i'm not going to use this but look you just put it look simple and then you just rename this to laser there you got laser so that's basically what the button is for and then i'll go to i'll go to x position of the tricky block the two tricky you need two tricky blocks so um remember always change the last one first so spaceship go to the x and y so then it will go to the spaceship y position and then now you need to go hide and then go forever the forever glitch isn't here anymore and then if then statement but then the key space is pressed the laser will fire up which is normal for most of our games that we make you can make it any other key but i decided to make space key because space key is honestly the best for shooting out bullets i mean that's how it is and then you need to go to you to go to the x position of the spaceship the y position of the spaceship it'll move 20 steps so it will go to the front of the spaceship when you shoot it out because they'll have some delay if it's in the middle because once you go to it'll be right here in the middle smack dab in the middle so it'll have some delay while you shoot it so we'll go up so you do not want that delay so you want to move 20 steps up so that no glitch so yeah um you also need to show and then you gotta repeat until touching edge and then you also have to do move 20 steps if you wanted to go slower then move it less and now you need to hide and then you need a go to x position a go to x position y position spaceship so we could just duplicate this and put it right up there and then now there we are done with the laser so let's try it out oh yeah yeah we have done it so remember the review from last time skin changing phenomenon stuff like that and start button great so now we're gonna work on the alien so we're really close to be done but the alien has a whole hunk of code so i have five different types of aliens downloaded in google drive if you do not know how to download it from google drive please go to our channel and watch our video how to download sprites from google drive so we have everything in the google drive for you so please do not use your uh school account but use your um normal account like if your name was tom smith or something then you would do tom smith and not your school account or whatever so we have ladybug 2a which is just the normal ladybug we always had alien alien 2 costume one costume dude basically this this one's from um what's not called again space invaders space invaders or something uh this one's also from space invaders i only played six invaders a few times but this thing i don't know where this is from online too so i'll give them credit so um yeah so when the green flag is clicked hide and then when i receive start then it will repeat 10 times you know create clone of myself which is basically create types of clones and then when i start as a clone it will switch costume pick random one to five this is because when it switches the costume since i have five costumes it will switch to five costumes so it can pick a random of the costume one to five so it's a 20 chance to get the ladybug a 20 chance to get the green monster 20 chance to get the dark green monster 20 chance to get the purple pixel monster and the 20 chance to get the light blue eye alien so um yeah so switch costume no set size is 65 because i don't want the aliens that big and not that easy to hit it's already 65 but i'm just adding this and then you guys can change the 65. and it'll show i'll go to x go to x pick random negative 220 the positive 220 a hundred pick around 100 to 175 this is because you don't want aliens spawning down here or like here or like here or here i mean no like these are fine but like here or here or here or on the spaceship itself you do not want aliens to swan there so it's only going to be around here and then now you need a forever loop so forever change y by minus two so go down slowly maturely so change y by minus two so you need if then else if then else the so you need if then else so both the laser and the spaceship will go in and it'll the alien will die so whenever it gets hit by them so i'll code that in just a second so later i will have to use this block so i'm just going to duplicate this put it out to the side for a little bit and i'll take it back once it's chilling and then chilling i'll take it back so so the one if if then else you need if then also if then else the negative 175 is greater than y position then it will go to x position so this this so basically so go back to the top if it's down here or go back to the top and then that's why i put that to the side and then you you need to if then in the if then else and the if then in the if then else has to be an or statement has to be the touching laser or touching spaceship and then um it'll change score by a hundred no i mean you need if then else and then if then that's in the if then else so you need to if then else in the if then in the if then else so you need if then else in the if then so you need to so you need the if then else and if then this and that then else in the forever so if then else you got to put the if you got to put touching laser so right here we can duplicate this touching laser it will change score by a hundred and then it will change shield by minus five which means the shield will go down if it touches the if it's touching the laser it'll go up the score will go up but if it's touching the spaceship itself it will change yo y minus now broadcast spaceship got hit please i put him there broadcast spaceship got hit oh spaceship ship got hit after we got the spaceship got hit you need to hide but you need to hide under the spaceship got hit script and then you got to put a wait one second a goto which we need this same thing so we need to put this go to right in here and then after that get to show and then we are almost done with the code we are actually done with the code so our aliens are done so if you guys are confused you guys can copy this down which is just the forever you put the change y by minus two you need if then else and then you gotta put a go to this same as this one and then you gotta i'm just wrapping up the code and then you need to if then so basically that's what you need for this script uh i can zoom in one out so you can see the whole entire thing so yeah now i'm going to show you my game so start once you can choose your skin so i'm going to choose this skin because it looks cool you know i like this one pink rocket let's go you click start look the aliens are coming closer look the aliens are touching the edge so so i'm about to code the end of the spaceship when it dies but for now i'm gonna kill myself no no i didn't kill myself yet but like you know the shield is going down look you can get score whenever you hit an alien and the shield is going down every single time i hit um a alien so so i haven't not coded this stuff yet so i will code the the if the you lost sprite so i'm going to code the spaceship first for the spaceship got hit so what i received spaceship got hit which we just made for after off of the bug it will repeat 10 times so change color effect by minus i mean change color effect by 25 so no clear graphic effects in the end so yeah so clear graphic effects where's that right there so there we go we have this coded out so now we have this clear graphic effects so clear graphic effects in the beginning and when you get hit you'll turn back into normal so okay guys we have to code the you lost sprite after that with the code the thumbnail and then the backdrops and we're all good so first we have to get the painting spray go to text um red i'm go handwriting because in my original game i i actually did you lost in purple and in marker so this one's gonna be handwriting and red because you know whenever you lose in a game or something it's always red i don't know why so you lost i'm going to see if i have to calculate that i don't think i have to you lost and then locally have it so i'm going to make this gigantic so i think that's the right size because whenever you lose it's really big it's like defeat or something so when the green flag is clicked i'll go to zero zero go hide go to front layer it will wait two seconds so this is where the big part comes in so when you lose originally um the if you lose originally one time that means you uh if you do not have this whatever you lose you will you will not be able to play again because the shield is messed up you will see uh you lose when you play it again so basically i'm just gonna code it without without the wait two seconds and i'll show you what happens because i've seen a lot of featured games with without the wait two seconds so they're like refresh the screen if it's not working or something i don't know so it's like i'm going to show you so you know or so if the shield equals or the shield equals zero or the shield is less than zero then show and then stop all so i'll show you i'm gonna die real quick so i already died already so look here the shield 100 lucky play i'm gonna so it says you lost see when you click it again it still says you lost like what is this you click it again it works but no one likes that little delay right so you should always put the wait two seconds so then you can play again on your own game without the new loss coming in bug so can we kill myself real quick so it keeps flashing yeah just uh it's like you lost look no you lost it's working yes see um i've seen a lot of featured projects say that it's just glitching whenever um you didn't do that you've lost so remember this is very important and now we have to do the backdrop we have to add edit some music so so i i normally just set it um set the volume to 20 just because i want you to hear my voice so set volume to twenty percent or twenty five and then go forever let's play space ambience i don't wanna pronounce that word yeah this is space ambience so you just put it in there and look we have our games but first we have to edit a thumbnail i'm just gonna tell you it works lasers working whenever you get hit it's working flash red flashing binary of colors actually function is working so now i'm going to code the thumbnail so the thumbnail you'll hear the costumes i already have this already so i just wrote space adventure game drew the little space invader ship put some little space invader dudes around it so yeah oh so you can copy it from here like do ctrl a or just drag the whole thing so ctrl c ctrl v to the thumbnail and then you got an alien and you can add it on to your thumbnail so this is just to make it look cooler and in the end it does look pretty cool in my opinion so okay so we're going to work on the thumbnail and so when the green flag is clicked this is optional but i highly recommend it to enhance your game even one little thing can make a difference so it will go to zero zero um go to front layer we actually have a video on this so you guys can watch that um in our channel so yeah there's a lot of videos for you guys to watch we post weekly uh like twice a week maybe three times so yeah so go forever and reset timer today i'm posting on a monday because there's spring break and that means i can record more often so that's great and then when timer so you need to use this so when loudness timer is greater than 0.1 they'll hide variable score so then you can see the little uh the little thing drop down so you also gotta hide the shield and i'll go to x 0 y 300 and it'll go to the front layer and then next you have to make it show and then glide 0.5 seconds so to zero zero so it is not done it is not quite done so we on this we have to simply i hid the thing i have to show it again or else you you cannot see the both of the variables so show score and then you gotta show variable shield and then there we go we have it i'm gonna save this real quick i already have the shared project up so you guys can look at that if you guys do not know how to do it so we have some spaceships here like all the different skins so when you click to stop space adventure will come down so look great my nails working and yeah about to end it around here i'm watching my little skin so if anybody can beat my high score well um i'll give you nothing i'll give you air but if you can win my high score right now i will be i'll give you something okay so see you guys in a second i got three thousand of course i died on purpose just to finish this video up but anyways um this has been great so uh in the end i will be replying to some comments because i have not been inviting people to my studio i had done that in a while but i did start doing that so i'm gonna reply to one comment so thank you all guys for your support like i i got taiwo the scratch user right here thank you for his support or her support so he is or her is giving me support by saying my video is nice so thank you so yeah i think i'll end this video right now maybe yeah so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below um anything you want to comment though if something wrong alright so anyways see you guys
