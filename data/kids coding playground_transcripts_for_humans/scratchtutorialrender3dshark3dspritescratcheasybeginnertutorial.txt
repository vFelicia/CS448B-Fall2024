00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - so welcome back guys today we will be
00:09 - doing another scratch project this time
00:13 - we're gonna do a project on render shark
00:16 - and today we'll be learning about custom
00:18 - blocks what is a custom block you ask
00:21 - custom blocks is a reusable code block
00:24 - that once it is written it can be reused
00:26 - without repeating the same set of code
00:28 - anywhere so you don't have to keep on
00:30 - recoded repeating your code over and
00:33 - over again you can add many functions to
00:36 - a custom block okay so this is the
00:40 - project we will be making today as you
00:42 - can see we will be making a backdrop
00:44 - we'll be getting a shark shark sprite
00:48 - from the library okay so first of all we
00:54 - need to rename this project to render
00:57 - shark then we'll delete the scratch cat
01:05 - go to the sprite library and upload
01:08 - shark we'll be taking this one today
01:14 - okay first we have to set the size to 75
01:18 - obviously cuz it's too big so first
01:23 - we'll always drag it when you click when
01:25 - you like click block then we need a
01:28 - forever loop so everything inside the
01:30 - loop repeats forever until you click the
01:33 - stop button then we'll need to add an
01:36 - extension which is the pen extension
01:38 - right here just click on this once and
01:41 - you'll get all the pen functions so
01:44 - first we want to erase all because we
01:46 - don't want extra stamps to be shown in
01:49 - the beginning so we need erase
01:50 - everything
01:51 - then we'll first really need to make a
01:55 - custom block then after that we'll we
01:57 - need to make a custom block you name it
02:00 - render shirt
02:05 - okay so we need to define render shop
02:08 - first so we need a show bring the show
02:11 - of the shark then we switch costume to
02:15 - shark one so it won't be shark B which
02:18 - is the other shorties and then we repeat
02:21 - 20 times which means everything inside
02:24 - here will repeat for 20 times
02:27 - so then we'll need the pen function
02:31 - stamp stamp
02:33 - is so like make layers of a sprite and
02:37 - then we'll change Y by 1 so it will
02:39 - repeatedly go down go up go up so it'll
02:43 - make an effect that looks like it's
02:45 - stamping so we'll need to get a change Y
02:51 - by 1 oops ok so now we will be needing
03:01 - the go to 0 0 because we want the clock
03:04 - the shark to stay in the middle then
03:10 - since we already have the set size to 75
03:14 - I don't think we'll need that so then
03:17 - we'll need to do render shark which is
03:19 - the custom function then if you put this
03:22 - right here
03:23 - that means it will define this block of
03:25 - code right here and then we'll need it
03:28 - if then statement if then right arrow
03:33 - right arrow is clicked right arrow just
03:41 - click then it will change the degree'
03:44 - turn by 5 so it will just turn right by
03:46 - 5 if you click the right arrow
03:54 - then we'll need to duplicate this code
03:57 - we'll make we'll turn it to the left
04:00 - left arrow and turn it left five degrees
04:09 - so now so now we have the code so if we
04:13 - try it out then they'll stamp but I'll
04:17 - keep on repeatedly stamping if you want
04:19 - this to stop doing this
04:20 - you can go to my blocks and check the
04:24 - run screen without refresh so now when
04:30 - you press play it won't keep on stamping
04:33 - so finally we need to make a backdrop so
04:37 - we hit the backdrop button go to
04:39 - backdrops
04:40 - select like a blue color maybe turn up
04:44 - the saturation to a 100 it's like like a
04:47 - sky-blue color go here
04:50 - we don't need outline this is going to
04:53 - make it look bad then we drag from here
05:00 - so yeah so I censored it now this is a
05:06 - blue background so now let's go back to
05:09 - the code back to shark okay so let's try
05:13 - it so as you can see when you hold down
05:17 - the right button it turns right when you
05:19 - turn the left slot it looks like a 3d
05:21 - figure because it's stamped a lot of
05:23 - times so finally you need to save your
05:28 - project and thank thank you for watching
05:32 - and see you guys next time

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys today we will be doing another scratch project this time we're gonna do a project on render shark and today we'll be learning about custom blocks what is a custom block you ask custom blocks is a reusable code block that once it is written it can be reused without repeating the same set of code anywhere so you don't have to keep on recoded repeating your code over and over again you can add many functions to a custom block okay so this is the project we will be making today as you can see we will be making a backdrop we'll be getting a shark shark sprite from the library okay so first of all we need to rename this project to render shark then we'll delete the scratch cat go to the sprite library and upload shark we'll be taking this one today okay first we have to set the size to 75 obviously cuz it's too big so first we'll always drag it when you click when you like click block then we need a forever loop so everything inside the loop repeats forever until you click the stop button then we'll need to add an extension which is the pen extension right here just click on this once and you'll get all the pen functions so first we want to erase all because we don't want extra stamps to be shown in the beginning so we need erase everything then we'll first really need to make a custom block then after that we'll we need to make a custom block you name it render shirt okay so we need to define render shop first so we need a show bring the show of the shark then we switch costume to shark one so it won't be shark B which is the other shorties and then we repeat 20 times which means everything inside here will repeat for 20 times so then we'll need the pen function stamp stamp is so like make layers of a sprite and then we'll change Y by 1 so it will repeatedly go down go up go up so it'll make an effect that looks like it's stamping so we'll need to get a change Y by 1 oops ok so now we will be needing the go to 0 0 because we want the clock the shark to stay in the middle then since we already have the set size to 75 I don't think we'll need that so then we'll need to do render shark which is the custom function then if you put this right here that means it will define this block of code right here and then we'll need it if then statement if then right arrow right arrow is clicked right arrow just click then it will change the degree' turn by 5 so it will just turn right by 5 if you click the right arrow then we'll need to duplicate this code we'll make we'll turn it to the left left arrow and turn it left five degrees so now so now we have the code so if we try it out then they'll stamp but I'll keep on repeatedly stamping if you want this to stop doing this you can go to my blocks and check the run screen without refresh so now when you press play it won't keep on stamping so finally we need to make a backdrop so we hit the backdrop button go to backdrops select like a blue color maybe turn up the saturation to a 100 it's like like a skyblue color go here we don't need outline this is going to make it look bad then we drag from here so yeah so I censored it now this is a blue background so now let's go back to the code back to shark okay so let's try it so as you can see when you hold down the right button it turns right when you turn the left slot it looks like a 3d figure because it's stamped a lot of times so finally you need to save your project and thank thank you for watching and see you guys next time and remember to subscribe like share and comment
