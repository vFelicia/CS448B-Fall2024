00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to kids coding
00:09 - playground
00:10 - today i'll be making a game called don't
00:12 - get wet
00:13 - so i'll give you a demonstration of the
00:16 - game
00:16 - and then we'll hop onto the code so you
00:19 - have three lives
00:21 - you try to stay under the rain
00:25 - and try not to get wet by staying under
00:28 - the umbrella and the umbrella will move
00:30 - to random places
00:34 - and you try not to get wet and once all
00:36 - three of your lies lost
00:38 - it's game over
01:20 - so as you can see when when you
01:24 - survive for more than 60 seconds um the
01:27 - sky will turn bright
01:29 - and it will say you win so let's hop
01:32 - on to the video the project so let me
01:35 - start a new project
01:38 - so first we don't need the scratch cat
01:42 - um we will be
01:45 - choosing sprites so
01:48 - i will take this one
01:51 - this is the one i took we can keep him
01:55 - and then we'll need two variables first
01:58 - so we need lives
02:02 - and then we need timer
02:06 - that's to count how how long you've been
02:08 - playing the game
02:09 - then we'll need to get our sprites
02:13 - what else sprites are there
02:16 - yeah we need to get the umbrella
02:23 - i think they got they got rid of the
02:24 - umbrella
02:29 - so
02:34 - okay i'm back as you can see i imported
02:37 - the umbrella sprite
02:38 - right here for my old project they took
02:40 - it out from 3.0
02:42 - so i'd recommend you download umbrella
02:45 - from
02:46 - online a png so
02:50 - next we'll need to draw some sprites
02:53 - will be needed to draw the um
02:55 - raindrop spray so the raindrop
02:58 - will just paint and use bright i'll just
03:02 - pick a blue
03:03 - bluish color
03:06 - maybe a little lighter and get the
03:10 - circle tool
03:12 - oops
03:16 - i'll do this and then and then erase the
03:23 - [Music]
03:30 - corners
03:33 - [Music]
03:36 - as you can see i'm trying my best to
03:38 - draw this raindrop which is not very
03:40 - good
03:45 - it's going to group all this make it
03:47 - smaller
03:49 - center okay so that's my raindrop i know
03:53 - it doesn't look very good i'm not
03:55 - very good at scratch art so i can rename
03:58 - it to raindrop
04:01 - okay raindrop and we'll need to get a
04:05 - backdrop
04:09 - so we'll need two backdrops
04:12 - we can take the blue blue sky
04:16 - this one for the winning you know when
04:18 - you win it becomes a blue sky
04:20 - let me just add uh sun i guess
04:25 - in the corner
04:28 - [Music]
04:31 - [Applause]
04:32 - [Music]
04:39 - [Music]
04:42 - okay so i added some clouds and the sun
04:45 - as the winning screen and now i'll add
04:49 - the rainy
04:50 - backdrop so let's just use backdrop one
04:52 - i can rename it to rain
04:54 - gray
05:00 - i will just make the backdrop gray
05:03 - this a grey color
05:10 - first let me make a ground actually so i
05:12 - need green
05:18 - turn down the brightness a little
05:26 - [Music]
05:34 - so this is my rainy backdrop
05:43 - so as you can see this is my rainy
05:44 - backdrop
05:46 - so next we will be working on the
05:48 - backdrop code because the backdrop
05:49 - you will need to do some code so first
05:53 - you want to drag and when clicked when
05:54 - flag clicks
05:56 - switch the backdrop to the rainy
05:58 - backdrop in the beginning
06:02 - then we need a forever loop
06:06 - this is just to detect if you win so
06:09 - forever
06:10 - if then me two if then
06:13 - statements if then
06:16 - timer is equal to 60 or less than six a
06:20 - greater than 60 sorry
06:22 - so this basically means if
06:26 - the time which is one minute is equal or
06:29 - greater than 60
06:31 - seconds then it will
06:35 - win and broadcast win after this
06:39 - we want to broadcast win so we want the
06:42 - greater than sign
06:44 - timer 60 and we'll need a broadcasting
06:48 - message called win
06:51 - because if you uh beat it under
06:54 - if you beat it in 60 seconds then you
06:56 - win
06:57 - and we need another equal sign
07:02 - we need an or
07:07 - equal and uh greater than sign
07:10 - so if the lives is equal to zero
07:14 - or less than zero
07:19 - so i actually need a less than sign
07:22 - but it's i could have put it on the
07:23 - other side but it's easier to read y
07:25 - is less than zero then we can broadcast
07:28 - a message called lose
07:31 - because you lost after you lose three
07:33 - lives
07:35 - lose so when i
07:39 - receive win you want to switch the
07:43 - backdrop
07:45 - when you receive wind
07:48 - you want to switch the backdrop
07:52 - to blue sky that's uh the
07:55 - sunny backdrop then stop other scripts
07:58 - in the sprite
08:04 - and if it receives game over we can just
08:07 - duplicate this
08:09 - and take out that broadcast lose
08:12 - then stop other scripts in the sprint so
08:15 - next
08:16 - let's work on the player movement so
08:19 - let's go to the player
08:21 - i can actually rename
08:26 - so player so when clicked when i hit a
08:29 - one click block
08:30 - set the live to three because he needs
08:33 - three lives in the beginning of the game
08:36 - forever forever loop
08:39 - if then touching the
08:44 - raindrop
08:48 - then it will change the lives by
08:50 - negative one so
08:51 - minus one life
08:56 - so we'll need another if then we'll need
08:59 - two more if then statements you can just
09:01 - duplicate them
09:03 - put them right here so if then
09:07 - right anita if then
09:10 - arrow is press key so if the right arrow
09:14 - is pressed right arrow is pressed
09:18 - then we will change point in direction
09:21 - of 90
09:23 - and put this on don't rotate so it won't
09:25 - flip upside down i forgot to do that
09:28 - so point direction of 90 so i'll be
09:31 - facing the right and move 10 steps
09:34 - and if the key left arrow is pressed
09:40 - then i'll do the opposite a point
09:43 - negative 90 degrees point direction of
09:47 - negative 90.
09:50 - negative 90 and move 10 steps
09:56 - so when you receive game over
09:59 - save game over which is lose then stop
10:02 - other scripts in the sprite
10:06 - and you can make them say game over for
10:09 - two seconds
10:14 - game over say
10:18 - game over
10:23 - and then we can duplicate this if we
10:26 - receive the win
10:29 - then we can say you win
10:32 - [Music]
10:36 - you win and we need forever
10:40 - reset the timer so it will we need
10:43 - forever
10:44 - set timer to timer so the timer variable
10:46 - will keep on going up we need a forever
10:48 - loop
10:50 - rubber lube set timer
10:55 - timer to the this timer
11:00 - drag it in here okay
11:03 - finally no no we should have the
11:05 - umbrella
11:06 - umbrella and raindrop to go so when
11:09 - clicked we can
11:10 - go to 050 negative 50.
11:13 - 0 exposition and
11:17 - negative 50. there's somewhere in the
11:21 - middle
11:22 - show in the beginning
11:26 - forever wait
11:30 - when they wait pick random one to three
11:32 - seconds
11:33 - or one to five seconds one to three
11:36 - seconds
11:38 - um then it'll glide to two seconds to a
11:41 - random position
11:43 - apply two secs to not a random position
11:47 - but we have to
11:49 - put the pick random glide two seconds to
11:53 - pick random negative two hundred for x
11:56 - position
11:57 - to 200 no this is the wrong one
12:01 - i'm gonna glide pick random negative two
12:04 - hundred
12:04 - two seconds to two hundred
12:07 - which is from right here to right here
12:11 - somewhere around there and negative 50
12:14 - same y position
12:17 - and then when you receive the win
12:20 - the win then
12:24 - you can hide
12:28 - stop other scripts in the sprite
12:31 - and same thing for the
12:35 - lose same code
12:39 - okay finally we have the raindrop code
12:42 - so when clicked you want to set the size
12:44 - to 10
12:46 - so be like the size of a raindrop pretty
12:49 - small
12:51 - set the size to 10 percent where is that
12:58 - set size to 10 forever
13:03 - wait wait pick random 0.1 to 0.5
13:07 - so randomly uh produce a new range drop
13:10 - every 0.1 to 0.5 seconds
13:14 - so pick random 0.5
13:18 - 0.1 to 0.5 so 0.1
13:21 - to 0.5
13:24 - so when you create a clone of yourself
13:27 - so
13:29 - let's create a clone
13:33 - so when it starts as a clone we want it
13:36 - to have a forever loop
13:37 - forever
13:38 - [Music]
13:41 - if then touching
13:44 - we need two or statements
13:48 - or and another ore so if then touching
13:53 - touching the player touching
13:57 - the raindrop i mean the umbrella
14:03 - or touching
14:09 - touching the color green you have to do
14:12 - that
14:14 - touching this color
14:20 - which is the background
14:23 - so actually we want to take out the
14:25 - outline for this thing
14:26 - because it's it might just disturb the
14:32 - the so like and the raindrop might touch
14:34 - the black
14:35 - because i remember there's one so
14:38 - let's take out the outline for it okay
14:41 - so now the outline is
14:42 - gone
14:45 - so now we'll need another
14:50 - so if it touches that wait 0.01 seconds
14:53 - a slight pause
14:58 - seconds and delete the clone
15:01 - so the raindrop will go away and
15:05 - we need another one i start as a clone
15:07 - go to pick random
15:10 - pick random negative 200 to negative 240
15:13 - to 240
15:14 - the x position so somewhere right here
15:16 - to right here
15:18 - so negative 240. to 240
15:28 - and why 175 so somewhere up here it'll
15:31 - generate somewhere
15:32 - up there 175. then it'll show
15:39 - and forever
15:43 - glide three seconds
15:47 - like three seconds so that's how long
15:50 - it'll take to touch the floor
15:53 - to x to
15:56 - x exposition
16:00 - so the x position of it to a y negative
16:03 - 180 so glide somewhere down there
16:08 - so same thing as these we can just
16:12 - put that right there and
16:15 - put that right there drag it there so
16:17 - then it will be duplicated right here
16:22 - and we can we have to make devin a bit
16:24 - smaller
16:26 - because he's uh really big
16:30 - as you can see making size 50.
16:35 - maybe size size 75
16:40 - let's make him spawn right there
16:42 - umbrella
16:44 - let's make it size 100
16:48 - and when i when i did the raindrops
16:51 - i shrunk it so let me make it a bit
16:53 - bigger because 10
16:54 - is very small let me select the whole
16:58 - thing
16:59 - sorry about that let's
17:02 - group it and make it big again
17:10 - so setting it to 10 it will be actually
17:13 - a bit more visible
17:15 - so as you can see stay under an umbrella
17:19 - and i touch it when i hit i'm gonna kill
17:22 - myself
17:22 - it'll say game over so when you play
17:26 - again
17:27 - i'll make it full screen for you guys
17:31 - so when i win it will say
17:34 - uh you win and probably say that
17:38 - let's see i'll see if it works
17:45 - so the raindrops are a bit hard to see
17:47 - because they're kind of light blue i can
17:49 - you can change the color if you want
17:53 - but i'm just here to show you guys how
17:56 - this works
18:02 - [Applause]
18:04 - so that's it for the video see it says
18:05 - you win
18:07 - so thank you guys for watching and don't
18:10 - forget to like share subscribe
18:12 - to this channel and like this video and
18:16 - i'll see you guys in the next video
18:18 - thank you guys for watching
18:29 - [Music]
18:32 - you

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys to kids coding playground today i'll be making a game called don't get wet so i'll give you a demonstration of the game and then we'll hop onto the code so you have three lives you try to stay under the rain and try not to get wet by staying under the umbrella and the umbrella will move to random places and you try not to get wet and once all three of your lies lost it's game over so as you can see when when you survive for more than 60 seconds um the sky will turn bright and it will say you win so let's hop on to the video the project so let me start a new project so first we don't need the scratch cat um we will be choosing sprites so i will take this one this is the one i took we can keep him and then we'll need two variables first so we need lives and then we need timer that's to count how how long you've been playing the game then we'll need to get our sprites what else sprites are there yeah we need to get the umbrella i think they got they got rid of the umbrella so okay i'm back as you can see i imported the umbrella sprite right here for my old project they took it out from 3.0 so i'd recommend you download umbrella from online a png so next we'll need to draw some sprites will be needed to draw the um raindrop spray so the raindrop will just paint and use bright i'll just pick a blue bluish color maybe a little lighter and get the circle tool oops i'll do this and then and then erase the corners as you can see i'm trying my best to draw this raindrop which is not very good it's going to group all this make it smaller center okay so that's my raindrop i know it doesn't look very good i'm not very good at scratch art so i can rename it to raindrop okay raindrop and we'll need to get a backdrop so we'll need two backdrops we can take the blue blue sky this one for the winning you know when you win it becomes a blue sky let me just add uh sun i guess in the corner okay so i added some clouds and the sun as the winning screen and now i'll add the rainy backdrop so let's just use backdrop one i can rename it to rain gray i will just make the backdrop gray this a grey color first let me make a ground actually so i need green turn down the brightness a little so this is my rainy backdrop so as you can see this is my rainy backdrop so next we will be working on the backdrop code because the backdrop you will need to do some code so first you want to drag and when clicked when flag clicks switch the backdrop to the rainy backdrop in the beginning then we need a forever loop this is just to detect if you win so forever if then me two if then statements if then timer is equal to 60 or less than six a greater than 60 sorry so this basically means if the time which is one minute is equal or greater than 60 seconds then it will win and broadcast win after this we want to broadcast win so we want the greater than sign timer 60 and we'll need a broadcasting message called win because if you uh beat it under if you beat it in 60 seconds then you win and we need another equal sign we need an or equal and uh greater than sign so if the lives is equal to zero or less than zero so i actually need a less than sign but it's i could have put it on the other side but it's easier to read y is less than zero then we can broadcast a message called lose because you lost after you lose three lives lose so when i receive win you want to switch the backdrop when you receive wind you want to switch the backdrop to blue sky that's uh the sunny backdrop then stop other scripts in the sprite and if it receives game over we can just duplicate this and take out that broadcast lose then stop other scripts in the sprint so next let's work on the player movement so let's go to the player i can actually rename so player so when clicked when i hit a one click block set the live to three because he needs three lives in the beginning of the game forever forever loop if then touching the raindrop then it will change the lives by negative one so minus one life so we'll need another if then we'll need two more if then statements you can just duplicate them put them right here so if then right anita if then arrow is press key so if the right arrow is pressed right arrow is pressed then we will change point in direction of 90 and put this on don't rotate so it won't flip upside down i forgot to do that so point direction of 90 so i'll be facing the right and move 10 steps and if the key left arrow is pressed then i'll do the opposite a point negative 90 degrees point direction of negative 90. negative 90 and move 10 steps so when you receive game over save game over which is lose then stop other scripts in the sprite and you can make them say game over for two seconds game over say game over and then we can duplicate this if we receive the win then we can say you win you win and we need forever reset the timer so it will we need forever set timer to timer so the timer variable will keep on going up we need a forever loop rubber lube set timer timer to the this timer drag it in here okay finally no no we should have the umbrella umbrella and raindrop to go so when clicked we can go to 050 negative 50. 0 exposition and negative 50. there's somewhere in the middle show in the beginning forever wait when they wait pick random one to three seconds or one to five seconds one to three seconds um then it'll glide to two seconds to a random position apply two secs to not a random position but we have to put the pick random glide two seconds to pick random negative two hundred for x position to 200 no this is the wrong one i'm gonna glide pick random negative two hundred two seconds to two hundred which is from right here to right here somewhere around there and negative 50 same y position and then when you receive the win the win then you can hide stop other scripts in the sprite and same thing for the lose same code okay finally we have the raindrop code so when clicked you want to set the size to 10 so be like the size of a raindrop pretty small set the size to 10 percent where is that set size to 10 forever wait wait pick random 0.1 to 0.5 so randomly uh produce a new range drop every 0.1 to 0.5 seconds so pick random 0.5 0.1 to 0.5 so 0.1 to 0.5 so when you create a clone of yourself so let's create a clone so when it starts as a clone we want it to have a forever loop forever if then touching we need two or statements or and another ore so if then touching touching the player touching the raindrop i mean the umbrella or touching touching the color green you have to do that touching this color which is the background so actually we want to take out the outline for this thing because it's it might just disturb the the so like and the raindrop might touch the black because i remember there's one so let's take out the outline for it okay so now the outline is gone so now we'll need another so if it touches that wait 0.01 seconds a slight pause seconds and delete the clone so the raindrop will go away and we need another one i start as a clone go to pick random pick random negative 200 to negative 240 to 240 the x position so somewhere right here to right here so negative 240. to 240 and why 175 so somewhere up here it'll generate somewhere up there 175. then it'll show and forever glide three seconds like three seconds so that's how long it'll take to touch the floor to x to x exposition so the x position of it to a y negative 180 so glide somewhere down there so same thing as these we can just put that right there and put that right there drag it there so then it will be duplicated right here and we can we have to make devin a bit smaller because he's uh really big as you can see making size 50. maybe size size 75 let's make him spawn right there umbrella let's make it size 100 and when i when i did the raindrops i shrunk it so let me make it a bit bigger because 10 is very small let me select the whole thing sorry about that let's group it and make it big again so setting it to 10 it will be actually a bit more visible so as you can see stay under an umbrella and i touch it when i hit i'm gonna kill myself it'll say game over so when you play again i'll make it full screen for you guys so when i win it will say uh you win and probably say that let's see i'll see if it works so the raindrops are a bit hard to see because they're kind of light blue i can you can change the color if you want but i'm just here to show you guys how this works so that's it for the video see it says you win so thank you guys for watching and don't forget to like share subscribe to this channel and like this video and i'll see you guys in the next video thank you guys for watching you
