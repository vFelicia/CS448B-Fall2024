00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys the kids coding around
00:08 - here and today we'll be doing the final
00:10 - part of our easter egg hunt game
00:12 - so
00:13 - recap from last time what we did so we
00:15 - did the ground
00:16 - in the last video we did the ground and
00:19 - we also did the background scrolling
00:21 - in this tutorial and the background yeah
00:23 - forgot about that
00:24 - and in this tutorial we'll be working on
00:26 - the eggs
00:28 - and we will also be working on the left
00:29 - and right arrow keys so when you press
00:31 - down the keys it will show which way
00:33 - you're going to make the game look a
00:35 - little bit better so without further ado
00:37 - let's get into the project
00:38 - so first let's get into choose the
00:41 - sprite right we have the arrows so we
00:44 - have the right arrow key so we're just
00:46 - gonna name this
00:47 - right
00:48 - and then we can just uh go to the
00:50 - costumes
00:51 - delete all the other costumes and then
00:54 - we can just import another one another
00:56 - arrows we're just gonna name this one
00:58 - oops
01:00 - and then this one left
01:03 - and then we're just gonna go costumes
01:04 - and delete all the other ones
01:08 - so now we have our right and left arrow
01:10 - keys
01:11 - okay
01:12 - so remember when we broadcasted the
01:14 - message move rights and move left and
01:16 - hide arrow from the player we're going
01:18 - to be using them right now
01:19 - so in the right arrow key we're going to
01:21 - first we're going to get a one grid flag
01:22 - clicked let's go full screen
01:25 - uh we're gonna go zoom in so we're gonna
01:26 - set the position to 200 and then the y
01:30 - would be zero
01:31 - and then we're going to clear the
01:32 - graphic effects in the beginning because
01:33 - we will be using graphics effects in
01:35 - this arrows so when you move it will
01:37 - change color effect
01:38 - so then we're going to hide
01:40 - hide that and then when i receive
01:43 - move right arrow from the player
01:46 - that move right then we're going to
01:48 - broadcast a message we're going to name
01:49 - it hide left so basically we want to
01:51 - make it so you can only have one arrow
01:53 - showing at a time so people can't click
01:55 - both arrows at the same time and have
01:56 - them both show up so it won't look good
01:58 - so we're gonna make a message called
02:00 - hide left
02:01 - and then hide left and then we're gonna
02:03 - go to the front layer
02:06 - go to front layer so we have go to front
02:09 - layer
02:10 - and then next we're going to change
02:11 - color effect by one
02:14 - and then after that we're going to show
02:17 - and after that we're going to do when i
02:19 - receive
02:21 - hide arrow we're going to clear graphic
02:23 - effects that's when it's not moving
02:26 - then you'll get height arrow so i'll
02:28 - clear all graphic effects and then we'll
02:29 - hide
02:31 - now let's move on to our left arrow key
02:36 - so into our left arrow key we're going
02:38 - to get the same thing pretty much the
02:40 - same thing right here so right here
02:42 - drag and drop that
02:44 - uh right here drag and drop that
02:47 - and then right here we can drag and drop
02:48 - that except we have to change some stuff
02:50 - obviously
02:51 - so we're going to zoom in
02:54 - right here we're going to make it go to
02:55 - negative 200 instead because the left
02:57 - arrow key
02:58 - and then when i receive hide arrow this
03:00 - is the same and then instead we're going
03:02 - to do when i receive move left
03:05 - and then we're going to broadcast hide
03:06 - right instead of hide left so when
03:09 - you're moving to the left you're going
03:10 - to hide the right arrow
03:11 - so we're going to broadcast a new
03:12 - message we're going to name it hide
03:14 - right
03:16 - and then we're going to go to front
03:17 - that's the same okay and then right here
03:20 - since uh when you're using the right
03:22 - arrow key you have to hide the left
03:23 - arrow so we're gonna receive when i
03:25 - receive hide left
03:26 - clear graphic effects and hide
03:29 - so oops i meant to duplicate that
03:32 - duplicate that
03:34 - like that
03:35 - and apparently 91.1 percent of you that
03:38 - are watching this video are not
03:40 - subscribed so please subscribe to our
03:42 - channel
03:43 - it really helped to support our channel
03:46 - and leave a like if you enjoyed watching
03:48 - this video
03:49 - alright so we just finished our left
03:50 - arrow key let's move on to the right
03:52 - arrow key so in the left arrow key it
03:54 - broadcasts a message so we're gonna when
03:56 - i receive hide right
03:57 - so when you're using the left arrow keys
03:59 - you have to hide the right one so we're
04:00 - just going to duplicate this
04:02 - and put it there
04:03 - okay so now we'll save it and let's run
04:06 - it
04:07 - so as you can see when you move to the
04:08 - right the arrow is on the right side
04:10 - showing
04:11 - and it's changing color effects and then
04:14 - when you move to the left it's showing
04:15 - on the left side and changing color
04:17 - effect and you can't hold them both down
04:18 - at the same time
04:20 - uh when you press them both down it'll
04:21 - just go to one of them
04:23 - so as you can see it's working
04:25 - now let's go into our backdrop so we're
04:27 - going to get some code in our backdrop
04:29 - so
04:30 - uh in our scrolling platformer video we
04:33 - showed that um when you like want to
04:35 - place like a backdrop i mean not a
04:38 - platform or like some item in a certain
04:40 - position we're gonna put a script so
04:43 - where you press the m button
04:45 - it's going to uh it's gonna like go to
04:47 - that position of your mouse
04:49 - so you know exactly where to place
04:50 - everything so what we're gonna do is
04:53 - when key m is pressed so we're gonna get
04:55 - m
04:56 - so when key m is pressed we're gonna go
04:58 - full screen
04:59 - and then we're gonna set
05:01 - the g mouse position right here so we're
05:04 - gonna basically just join this
05:06 - we're gonna join
05:08 - this with the mouse x plus the scroll gx
05:12 - g scroll x so
05:13 - we're going to join
05:15 - and then we're going to add mouse x so
05:18 - wherever the position of the mouse is
05:20 - plus
05:21 - the g scroll x
05:23 - and then we're just gonna get another
05:25 - join so we're gonna get another join
05:27 - right here
05:28 - we're gonna put a comma
05:29 - comma space
05:32 - and then we're gonna get the mouse y
05:36 - uh and then we're gonna get the
05:38 - uh that's why right here okay that's all
05:40 - you have to do
05:42 - so
05:43 - and then we're gonna show the variable
05:44 - yeah forget about that we're gonna show
05:46 - it
05:46 - so when you go right here you press m
05:49 - it'll go to wherever the position you
05:52 - are is
05:53 - your mouse is
05:55 - so basically it just makes it easier so
05:58 - when you're placing
05:59 - uh things like objects to collect
06:02 - collectibles and platforms you know
06:04 - where to place them so we're going to
06:06 - use this code to like place all of our
06:08 - eggs
06:10 - you can save the project
06:12 - now let's go into our eggs
06:14 - and let's place our clones
06:18 - all right
06:19 - so inside our eggs first we're going to
06:20 - get our one here if i clicked
06:23 - so when green flag is clicked we're
06:25 - gonna set
06:26 - a new variable so we're gonna make it
06:28 - egg
06:29 - found eggs found
06:31 - so eggs found
06:32 - so make it for all sprites so we're
06:34 - gonna set xfound to zero
06:36 - and we're gonna hide
06:39 - and then we're going to copy some of
06:41 - this code from here the place clones
06:43 - we're gonna need that so
06:45 - we can just drag and drop that into the
06:47 - eggs
06:48 - and then the position we'll take that as
06:50 - well
06:52 - uh we also need the reset
06:56 - and i think that's pretty much it for it
06:58 - let me go back to here
07:00 - let's get this all
07:03 - so this part stays the same
07:05 - this is just a scrolling and then right
07:06 - here we have the place clones
07:09 - so we're going to do place clone at x
07:11 - and y so we're going to do instead of
07:12 - multiplying we're just going to put the
07:14 - x and y
07:15 - and then instead right here we're going
07:16 - to take out the go to and then we have
07:18 - this
07:19 - and then we're just going to
07:21 - put that right here create color myself
07:22 - and we're going to change color effect
07:24 - by 25 so all the eggs vary in color
07:27 - so here we have this code
07:29 - and then next we're going to do a when i
07:31 - start as a clone so
07:34 - uh we're going to move this down here
07:37 - so we have now that
07:38 - and then when i start as a clone
07:42 - we are going to go to the x and y
07:45 - so basically we're going to go to the x
07:47 - and y
07:49 - and then we're going to show it
07:51 - show the egg
07:54 - and then we're going to wait until it's
07:56 - touching the mouse pointer and mouse
07:57 - down so basically you just want to wait
07:59 - until you're clicking on the egg so
08:01 - we're going to do wait until
08:03 - and then we're going to use an end
08:06 - so we're going to wait until touching
08:08 - mouse pointer so we're going to make
08:09 - sure it's touching the mouse pointer and
08:10 - you're clicking down on it and then
08:12 - we're going to start a sound pop so
08:14 - we're going to play sound when you click
08:15 - on it and then we're going to change the
08:17 - number of eggs found by one
08:19 - and then after that we're going to
08:20 - broadcast a message we're going to name
08:22 - it check score we're going to be using
08:24 - this later to check your score
08:27 - to see if it's illegible to win because
08:29 - you need 12 eggs to win
08:31 - and then after that we're gonna delete
08:33 - this clone after you click on it
08:36 - all right next
08:37 - we're gonna get a
08:39 - the scrolling so we're going to receive
08:41 - move ground
08:44 - move ground then i'm just going to get
08:46 - the position
08:48 - and then we're going to do that x minus
08:50 - the g scroll x
08:53 - x minus g scroll x
08:57 - and then we're gonna put the y
09:00 - all right
09:01 - and then next we're gonna have to do the
09:02 - clones so we're gonna have to uh place
09:04 - the clones
09:05 - we're gonna do when i receive setup
09:09 - when i receive setup
09:11 - we are going to
09:12 - set x
09:14 - and we're going to set the y set x and
09:16 - we're also going to set the y
09:18 - both to zero and then we're going to go
09:20 - to the front layer
09:22 - make the eggs go to the front
09:25 - put this down here
09:26 - and then we're going to go backwards one
09:27 - layer so we want to make it go to the
09:28 - front and then back so like we want to
09:30 - make it behind some stuff but in front
09:32 - of others
09:33 - and after that we're going to place some
09:34 - clones so what you do is
09:37 - basically you just move around oh let's
09:39 - say you want to put a clone right here
09:41 - for example maybe you want to put a
09:43 - coloner here right
09:44 - so you would put the m and then you
09:46 - would put
09:48 - the place clone and then you would put
09:50 - 92
09:52 - negative 89.
09:54 - oops i wasn't clicking on it 92 and then
09:56 - negative 89.
09:59 - so here we have
10:01 - place the clone so when you play it it's
10:03 - going to place a clone right there
10:06 - so that's what you want to do
10:08 - so basically just repeat this 12 times
10:11 - until you have enough
10:13 - um
10:14 - you repeat 12 times and then place it in
10:16 - places where you want it and that's
10:18 - pretty much it
10:20 - for the eggs i'm just gonna get my own
10:22 - positions and put them in here
10:26 - okay so now we have all my clones placed
10:29 - down so these are the positions i had
10:31 - for my other game
10:32 - so you don't have to make it the same
10:35 - thing as mine
10:36 - but these are the places where i wanted
10:38 - to put my eggs
10:39 - um this is like wherever you want to put
10:41 - it
10:42 - um
10:43 - depends where you want to put it so
10:44 - let's play it so there you have an egg
10:47 - right there egg exit as you can see it's
10:49 - like
10:50 - visible but like it's uh some of it may
10:52 - be a little bit harder to find
10:54 - like the one in the tree like this one
10:56 - right here
10:58 - yeah so this one right there so yes
11:00 - basically where i put all my eggs
11:03 - and next after you do this we're gonna
11:05 - have to hide it
11:06 - and then we're gonna set
11:08 - the x
11:11 - to negative 999 to move it off the
11:13 - screen once you're done
11:16 - all right
11:17 - so
11:18 - let's
11:19 - go back to normal and let's
11:23 - so i just zoomed out these as all the
11:25 - code in the eggs so if you want to take
11:28 - a look at it
11:30 - so we have all these and then here we
11:32 - have all the clone placements
11:34 - okay
11:35 - so next we have to work on our you win
11:38 - so
11:39 - to win you have to get 12 eggs so we're
11:41 - gonna do the code for that
11:43 - okay so in our you win sprite we're
11:45 - gonna first
11:46 - we're gonna get one green flag clicked
11:50 - so when the green flag is clicked we're
11:51 - gonna hide
11:54 - and then when i receive check score
11:56 - remember that so here we're gonna check
11:58 - the score to see if the player is okay
12:00 - to win so basically if you find all of
12:03 - them then they'll let the player win so
12:05 - we're gonna wait until
12:08 - wait until egg found is equal to 12. so
12:12 - we're going to wait until the eggs found
12:13 - is equal to 12.
12:15 - 12 eggs is the maximum amount and then
12:17 - we're going to broadcast a message we're
12:19 - going to name it you win
12:23 - you win
12:24 - and then next we're gonna do make it go
12:26 - to the front layer
12:28 - go to front
12:30 - go to zero zero
12:33 - and then we're gonna show it
12:35 - and then we're gonna stop all
12:39 - stuff all so here we have the uin
12:42 - and then one more thing in the
12:42 - background we're going to make a timer
12:44 - so you can time yourself and you can try
12:46 - to speed run it
12:47 - so we're going to get a when our green
12:50 - flag is clicked
12:52 - when your flag is clicked we're going to
12:53 - reset the timer
12:55 - and then forever loop
12:58 - i'm going to go forever set the time
13:01 - we're going to make a new variable
13:02 - forgot to make it time
13:05 - time
13:07 - and then we're gonna set the time
13:10 - uh to the timer
13:12 - and sensing
13:14 - and then we're gonna when i receive
13:17 - uh you win so when you when i receive
13:20 - you win
13:21 - then we're going to stop other scripts
13:22 - in the sprite
13:25 - stop other scripts in the sprite and
13:26 - then we're going to do an if-else
13:28 - statement so this is a check if you have
13:30 - the fastest time so
13:32 - if the fastest time we're gonna make a
13:34 - new variable that's gonna be a cloud
13:36 - variable
13:37 - so we're gonna make it
13:39 - fastest time so basically this is
13:42 - basically a high score so we're gonna
13:44 - set the if the fastest time is equal to
13:47 - zero then we're going to set the fastest
13:49 - time
13:51 - to the time so basically if there's no
13:53 - fastest time it'll set the next high
13:54 - score i mean the next score to the
13:56 - fastest time
13:57 - and then we're going to get if then
13:58 - cement
14:01 - so if
14:02 - the time is less than
14:05 - so if the timer is less than the fastest
14:08 - time so if you have a faster time than
14:09 - the fastest time then we'll set the
14:11 - fastest time to the time
14:14 - okay so now this is like a high score
14:16 - and then finally we add our music
14:19 - and we're gonna set the volume to 25
14:24 - and the music we're going to add is none
14:26 - other than eggs
14:28 - the song eggs from the stretch
14:30 - library
14:33 - right here this one
14:36 - okay we're using this one all right
14:38 - so eggs we're just gonna get a forever
14:40 - loop
14:42 - and we're just gonna
14:44 - play some
14:45 - eggs until time
14:48 - okay
14:49 - let's save this uh project
14:52 - hide all the variables that we will not
14:53 - need
14:55 - so eggs found we can keep that time put
14:58 - that like right here
15:01 - and the fastest time maybe in the bottom
15:03 - so then it looks better
15:07 - okay let's try it
15:10 - so stop
15:12 - oh yeah and i forgot we can delete the
15:14 - black dot that was just to show you guys
15:17 - how it works like how the scrolling
15:18 - works so we're just going to delete the
15:20 - black dot
15:21 - delete the costume
15:23 - so we just have nothing in the costume
15:26 - and we don't need this at all we can
15:28 - just delete all this delete this
15:30 - alright now let's save it and then let's
15:33 - play it
15:34 - let's turn on the volume a little bit
15:35 - because it's a little bit too loud
15:38 - so
15:39 - scroll around there's an egg right here
15:42 - and we're here i'm just going to try
15:44 - finding all the eggs
15:47 - oh forgot an egg right there four
15:51 - uh
15:52 - five i already got that one six
15:56 - seven
15:58 - eight
15:59 - nine
16:01 - ten
16:02 - [Music]
16:05 - eleven and one in the tree
16:07 - so as you can see when you get all of
16:08 - them you win and right here as you can
16:10 - see right here
16:12 - in the ground
16:13 - uh
16:15 - right here we can just receive the
16:17 - message when i receive
16:19 - the message uh you win we can just
16:22 - delete all the clones
16:24 - so then this will go away
16:28 - so yeah that's pretty much our project
16:31 - the easter egg hunt in scratch
16:34 - um if you enjoyed this video be sure to
16:36 - leave a like in this on this video and
16:38 - don't forget to like share and subscribe
16:40 - and ring the notification bell and i
16:42 - will see you guys in the next video
16:44 - [Music]
16:54 - you

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys the kids coding around here and today we'll be doing the final part of our easter egg hunt game so recap from last time what we did so we did the ground in the last video we did the ground and we also did the background scrolling in this tutorial and the background yeah forgot about that and in this tutorial we'll be working on the eggs and we will also be working on the left and right arrow keys so when you press down the keys it will show which way you're going to make the game look a little bit better so without further ado let's get into the project so first let's get into choose the sprite right we have the arrows so we have the right arrow key so we're just gonna name this right and then we can just uh go to the costumes delete all the other costumes and then we can just import another one another arrows we're just gonna name this one oops and then this one left and then we're just gonna go costumes and delete all the other ones so now we have our right and left arrow keys okay so remember when we broadcasted the message move rights and move left and hide arrow from the player we're going to be using them right now so in the right arrow key we're going to first we're going to get a one grid flag clicked let's go full screen uh we're gonna go zoom in so we're gonna set the position to 200 and then the y would be zero and then we're going to clear the graphic effects in the beginning because we will be using graphics effects in this arrows so when you move it will change color effect so then we're going to hide hide that and then when i receive move right arrow from the player that move right then we're going to broadcast a message we're going to name it hide left so basically we want to make it so you can only have one arrow showing at a time so people can't click both arrows at the same time and have them both show up so it won't look good so we're gonna make a message called hide left and then hide left and then we're gonna go to the front layer go to front layer so we have go to front layer and then next we're going to change color effect by one and then after that we're going to show and after that we're going to do when i receive hide arrow we're going to clear graphic effects that's when it's not moving then you'll get height arrow so i'll clear all graphic effects and then we'll hide now let's move on to our left arrow key so into our left arrow key we're going to get the same thing pretty much the same thing right here so right here drag and drop that uh right here drag and drop that and then right here we can drag and drop that except we have to change some stuff obviously so we're going to zoom in right here we're going to make it go to negative 200 instead because the left arrow key and then when i receive hide arrow this is the same and then instead we're going to do when i receive move left and then we're going to broadcast hide right instead of hide left so when you're moving to the left you're going to hide the right arrow so we're going to broadcast a new message we're going to name it hide right and then we're going to go to front that's the same okay and then right here since uh when you're using the right arrow key you have to hide the left arrow so we're gonna receive when i receive hide left clear graphic effects and hide so oops i meant to duplicate that duplicate that like that and apparently 91.1 percent of you that are watching this video are not subscribed so please subscribe to our channel it really helped to support our channel and leave a like if you enjoyed watching this video alright so we just finished our left arrow key let's move on to the right arrow key so in the left arrow key it broadcasts a message so we're gonna when i receive hide right so when you're using the left arrow keys you have to hide the right one so we're just going to duplicate this and put it there okay so now we'll save it and let's run it so as you can see when you move to the right the arrow is on the right side showing and it's changing color effects and then when you move to the left it's showing on the left side and changing color effect and you can't hold them both down at the same time uh when you press them both down it'll just go to one of them so as you can see it's working now let's go into our backdrop so we're going to get some code in our backdrop so uh in our scrolling platformer video we showed that um when you like want to place like a backdrop i mean not a platform or like some item in a certain position we're gonna put a script so where you press the m button it's going to uh it's gonna like go to that position of your mouse so you know exactly where to place everything so what we're gonna do is when key m is pressed so we're gonna get m so when key m is pressed we're gonna go full screen and then we're gonna set the g mouse position right here so we're gonna basically just join this we're gonna join this with the mouse x plus the scroll gx g scroll x so we're going to join and then we're going to add mouse x so wherever the position of the mouse is plus the g scroll x and then we're just gonna get another join so we're gonna get another join right here we're gonna put a comma comma space and then we're gonna get the mouse y uh and then we're gonna get the uh that's why right here okay that's all you have to do so and then we're gonna show the variable yeah forget about that we're gonna show it so when you go right here you press m it'll go to wherever the position you are is your mouse is so basically it just makes it easier so when you're placing uh things like objects to collect collectibles and platforms you know where to place them so we're going to use this code to like place all of our eggs you can save the project now let's go into our eggs and let's place our clones all right so inside our eggs first we're going to get our one here if i clicked so when green flag is clicked we're gonna set a new variable so we're gonna make it egg found eggs found so eggs found so make it for all sprites so we're gonna set xfound to zero and we're gonna hide and then we're going to copy some of this code from here the place clones we're gonna need that so we can just drag and drop that into the eggs and then the position we'll take that as well uh we also need the reset and i think that's pretty much it for it let me go back to here let's get this all so this part stays the same this is just a scrolling and then right here we have the place clones so we're going to do place clone at x and y so we're going to do instead of multiplying we're just going to put the x and y and then instead right here we're going to take out the go to and then we have this and then we're just going to put that right here create color myself and we're going to change color effect by 25 so all the eggs vary in color so here we have this code and then next we're going to do a when i start as a clone so uh we're going to move this down here so we have now that and then when i start as a clone we are going to go to the x and y so basically we're going to go to the x and y and then we're going to show it show the egg and then we're going to wait until it's touching the mouse pointer and mouse down so basically you just want to wait until you're clicking on the egg so we're going to do wait until and then we're going to use an end so we're going to wait until touching mouse pointer so we're going to make sure it's touching the mouse pointer and you're clicking down on it and then we're going to start a sound pop so we're going to play sound when you click on it and then we're going to change the number of eggs found by one and then after that we're going to broadcast a message we're going to name it check score we're going to be using this later to check your score to see if it's illegible to win because you need 12 eggs to win and then after that we're gonna delete this clone after you click on it all right next we're gonna get a the scrolling so we're going to receive move ground move ground then i'm just going to get the position and then we're going to do that x minus the g scroll x x minus g scroll x and then we're gonna put the y all right and then next we're gonna have to do the clones so we're gonna have to uh place the clones we're gonna do when i receive setup when i receive setup we are going to set x and we're going to set the y set x and we're also going to set the y both to zero and then we're going to go to the front layer make the eggs go to the front put this down here and then we're going to go backwards one layer so we want to make it go to the front and then back so like we want to make it behind some stuff but in front of others and after that we're going to place some clones so what you do is basically you just move around oh let's say you want to put a clone right here for example maybe you want to put a coloner here right so you would put the m and then you would put the place clone and then you would put 92 negative 89. oops i wasn't clicking on it 92 and then negative 89. so here we have place the clone so when you play it it's going to place a clone right there so that's what you want to do so basically just repeat this 12 times until you have enough um you repeat 12 times and then place it in places where you want it and that's pretty much it for the eggs i'm just gonna get my own positions and put them in here okay so now we have all my clones placed down so these are the positions i had for my other game so you don't have to make it the same thing as mine but these are the places where i wanted to put my eggs um this is like wherever you want to put it um depends where you want to put it so let's play it so there you have an egg right there egg exit as you can see it's like visible but like it's uh some of it may be a little bit harder to find like the one in the tree like this one right here yeah so this one right there so yes basically where i put all my eggs and next after you do this we're gonna have to hide it and then we're gonna set the x to negative 999 to move it off the screen once you're done all right so let's go back to normal and let's so i just zoomed out these as all the code in the eggs so if you want to take a look at it so we have all these and then here we have all the clone placements okay so next we have to work on our you win so to win you have to get 12 eggs so we're gonna do the code for that okay so in our you win sprite we're gonna first we're gonna get one green flag clicked so when the green flag is clicked we're gonna hide and then when i receive check score remember that so here we're gonna check the score to see if the player is okay to win so basically if you find all of them then they'll let the player win so we're gonna wait until wait until egg found is equal to 12. so we're going to wait until the eggs found is equal to 12. 12 eggs is the maximum amount and then we're going to broadcast a message we're going to name it you win you win and then next we're gonna do make it go to the front layer go to front go to zero zero and then we're gonna show it and then we're gonna stop all stuff all so here we have the uin and then one more thing in the background we're going to make a timer so you can time yourself and you can try to speed run it so we're going to get a when our green flag is clicked when your flag is clicked we're going to reset the timer and then forever loop i'm going to go forever set the time we're going to make a new variable forgot to make it time time and then we're gonna set the time uh to the timer and sensing and then we're gonna when i receive uh you win so when you when i receive you win then we're going to stop other scripts in the sprite stop other scripts in the sprite and then we're going to do an ifelse statement so this is a check if you have the fastest time so if the fastest time we're gonna make a new variable that's gonna be a cloud variable so we're gonna make it fastest time so basically this is basically a high score so we're gonna set the if the fastest time is equal to zero then we're going to set the fastest time to the time so basically if there's no fastest time it'll set the next high score i mean the next score to the fastest time and then we're going to get if then cement so if the time is less than so if the timer is less than the fastest time so if you have a faster time than the fastest time then we'll set the fastest time to the time okay so now this is like a high score and then finally we add our music and we're gonna set the volume to 25 and the music we're going to add is none other than eggs the song eggs from the stretch library right here this one okay we're using this one all right so eggs we're just gonna get a forever loop and we're just gonna play some eggs until time okay let's save this uh project hide all the variables that we will not need so eggs found we can keep that time put that like right here and the fastest time maybe in the bottom so then it looks better okay let's try it so stop oh yeah and i forgot we can delete the black dot that was just to show you guys how it works like how the scrolling works so we're just going to delete the black dot delete the costume so we just have nothing in the costume and we don't need this at all we can just delete all this delete this alright now let's save it and then let's play it let's turn on the volume a little bit because it's a little bit too loud so scroll around there's an egg right here and we're here i'm just going to try finding all the eggs oh forgot an egg right there four uh five i already got that one six seven eight nine ten eleven and one in the tree so as you can see when you get all of them you win and right here as you can see right here in the ground uh right here we can just receive the message when i receive the message uh you win we can just delete all the clones so then this will go away so yeah that's pretty much our project the easter egg hunt in scratch um if you enjoyed this video be sure to leave a like in this on this video
