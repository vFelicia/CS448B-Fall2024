00:06 - so welcome back to the channel guys to
00:09 - kids code and clear ground today we'll
00:12 - be doing a video on how to do high-score
00:15 - vomiting so remember the Apple capture
00:18 - game I made a while ago I just added the
00:22 - high score function to it so as you can
00:25 - see when you wash the Apple boss score
00:29 - well on an OP we change to the highest
00:31 - whap because that's the highest power so
00:33 - if I stop the project
00:35 - to play it the high score is still saved
00:37 - as 45 ok so now how do you do this I
00:43 - will show you so first I'll delete this
00:45 - code and delete this so I can go step by
00:51 - step show you how to do it okay so first
00:57 - you have to make a variable called high
00:59 - score so you want it to be cloud
01:05 - variable cloud variable means it will be
01:08 - stored on forever in the server until
01:10 - you change it so there you have the high
01:17 - scoring cloud variable I'll just move it
01:19 - on this side okay we'll need an if-then
01:23 - statement you can just add it right down
01:26 - here you need a greater than sign so if
01:31 - the score you scored is greater than the
01:35 - previous high score then you set the
01:39 - high score to score it's pretty simple
01:45 - yeah Bob Bob so you see the
01:50 - fast-changing Bob and that board goes up
01:53 - that's the fast corn so if you stop it
01:56 - the high score is 35 stop because it's
01:59 - dirt on the bottom variable so I hope
02:02 - this video helped you guys with your
02:04 - games so please like share subscribe and
02:09 - please comment down on this video to
02:12 - give us some feedback
02:14 - thank you for watching you'll see us
