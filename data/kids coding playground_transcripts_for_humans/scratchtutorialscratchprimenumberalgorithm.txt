00:08 - hello guys welcome back to kids coding
00:10 - playground
00:11 - so today we're gonna start on something
00:13 - different i will not be a game actually
00:16 - um trying to do uh a algorithm
00:19 - uh in scratch so uh you know that in
00:22 - other programming languages that says
00:24 - java or python or any other language
00:27 - there's a different algorithm basically
00:29 - is a function
00:31 - on logic that it could solve some
00:34 - problem
00:35 - so um similarly we can also use scratch
00:39 - to do
00:39 - a certain algorithm so this uh
00:43 - is a new series i'm doing it basically
00:46 - it's a different algorithm that we could
00:48 - implement in other language as well as
00:49 - we can implement it in scratch
00:52 - so um since i don't have too much time
00:54 - to work on a complex project so i
00:56 - thought
00:56 - maybe doing some algorithm uh project
00:59 - for you guys
01:00 - all right so uh let's start with this
01:02 - cat so today the algorithm we're working
01:04 - on
01:04 - is uh is a prime number basically if you
01:07 - click on the cat
01:08 - you give them a number the cat will tell
01:10 - you if it's a prime number
01:12 - or not let's say i give it seven so the
01:14 - cat tell you that seven is a prime
01:16 - number
01:17 - if i give uh something let's say number
01:19 - nine
01:22 - the cat said is not a prime number since
01:24 - you know the prime numbers you can
01:25 - divide the number can divide by only
01:28 - one and the num uh and the number
01:31 - itself and one so that's a prime number
01:34 - so let's say
01:35 - you don't let's say you say 57 so 57 is
01:38 - not a prime
01:39 - so um that means you can divide by three
01:43 - right and some other number as well so
01:46 - let's say uh i don't know 51
01:49 - so 51 is also not a prime so
01:52 - you see i mean that there is certain one
01:55 - maybe a prime let's say 61.
01:59 - so 61 is a prime number so it tells you
02:01 - it's a prime number or not
02:03 - okay so we'll work on this project so
02:06 - let's say
02:06 - new
02:10 - okay so what we need to do first is
02:12 - we're going to create two variables
02:14 - so let's make the first one ah say index
02:20 - and then make another one called result
02:24 - okay so we'll make a new block
02:28 - call this prime number
02:32 - and then create a new variable called n
02:36 - so in this prime number we'll start with
02:39 - number two
02:39 - since one is uh by itself you know
02:42 - that's a prime right so we'll start
02:44 - it at number two so we'll set the index
02:46 - at two
02:48 - and then we are going to set the result
02:51 - that's true
02:55 - okay and then we're going to use a
02:57 - forever loop
02:59 - i hope you guys can see this and then we
03:01 - are going to use
03:03 - some operator so we need the o operator
03:06 - oops i forgot the if and else condition
03:09 - then we'll put the or if an operator
03:12 - here
03:12 - and then we are using less than greater
03:15 - than
03:16 - operator so we only need to go up to the
03:19 - square root of
03:20 - n so uh anything um after that
03:24 - uh we'll actually find a lower prime
03:26 - number dividing that number so we only
03:28 - need to go up to the square root of n
03:30 - so what we're going to do is grab this
03:32 - put this here
03:34 - get the square root i hope you guys
03:36 - already run square root
03:37 - uh so like let's say 4 square root of 4
03:40 - is 2
03:41 - like that like or square root of 25 is 5
03:45 - right so i will go up to the
03:48 - square root of n and then check the
03:51 - index
03:54 - okay and then we also need another one
03:58 - here
04:02 - uh operator equals sign
04:05 - oops same thing here
04:09 - take this duplicate put it here
04:12 - and then you put the index here
04:16 - so basically it's a less than or equal
04:19 - or equal to
04:20 - since we don't have uh similar like
04:22 - other application that we have
04:25 - um you know out of language you can do
04:27 - like less than equal to so we're going
04:29 - to use
04:29 - something like this or join and then
04:32 - we're going to check
04:35 - so um we want to make sure that has uh
04:38 - no
04:38 - zero so something we have to use is mod
04:41 - so on so this one let's say you have a
04:45 - number that's a
04:46 - 10 mark two will give you
04:49 - zero remainder basically mod is a
04:52 - remainder so if you say
04:53 - three right you get one right so 10
04:56 - divided by three you get angle one so
04:59 - this is what mods for
05:01 - so we're going to use the mod to tell if
05:02 - it's have a remainder or not
05:04 - okay so we're going to say if
05:09 - put this here and then we are going to
05:12 - use the equal
05:16 - and put this over here and then we're
05:19 - going to say
05:20 - this modding the index
05:25 - equals to zero oops i don't know why
05:28 - this let's keep on running
05:30 - and then we'll say set the result
05:37 - to false so oops
05:41 - where's my mouse going why is my key not
05:45 - working
05:45 - oh hold on
05:49 - okay i'm back so i accidentally got the
05:52 - wrong thing as i couldn't set it
05:54 - so not change okay guys got the wrong
05:56 - thing over here
05:58 - so this should be set okay
06:01 - set the result i will call it false
06:04 - so not a prime because it can be divided
06:07 - by that
06:08 - and that will just stop the script
06:10 - because we have a forever loop right so
06:11 - let's
06:12 - start the script
06:16 - stop this script
06:19 - put that here okay in the else statement
06:23 - we are going to grab another even house
06:26 - here inside
06:28 - and we're going to use the operator
06:32 - equal
06:34 - then we're gonna take the index here and
06:36 - then
06:37 - grab this end here i hate this thing why
06:40 - it's always running
06:42 - so and then we're gonna get the similar
06:45 - thing
06:45 - here put it here and then we're gonna
06:47 - set this to true
06:50 - stop this guy okay okay and then we'll
06:53 - just change the index here
06:56 - change the index by one put that outside
06:59 - up here
07:00 - okay so what it's going to do it's going
07:02 - to go to the loop it's going to try to
07:04 - find the uh
07:05 - the number that can be divided by this
07:08 - uh
07:09 - n uh starting from 2 and it will find a
07:12 - mod equals 0.
07:13 - no remainder then it knows that okay you
07:15 - can divide by it then we'll say
07:17 - is not a prime number else
07:20 - you know i will say it's a prime number
07:23 - okay
07:24 - and if it goes up to the n and it cannot
07:27 - find it the index go up to n and cannot
07:29 - find this number
07:30 - then we're going to say this is a prime
07:31 - number and stop the script
07:33 - okay so what we're going to do is we're
07:36 - going to ask the uh
07:37 - so the cat we're going to come over here
07:40 - so what we're going to do is when the
07:41 - sprite click we're going to go something
07:43 - very simple then we're gonna we're going
07:47 - to use the
07:48 - ask function okay
07:52 - type in a number
07:55 - i will tell you if
07:59 - it is a prime number
08:02 - or not okay
08:06 - so this is what the cat gonna say so
08:08 - what we're going to do is gonna
08:10 - drag this we're gonna call the uh so
08:13 - whenever you type this
08:14 - uh weight the whatever player type it
08:17 - will go to answer so we pass this answer
08:20 - into this prime number and then this is
08:21 - gonna check if it's a prime number or
08:23 - not
08:24 - and then here we can just simply check
08:27 - using
08:28 - if and else
08:31 - i'm gonna check the result
08:34 - i forgot to grab this equal
08:37 - so we're gonna check if the result is
08:39 - true
08:42 - then we will say
08:48 - it is or you can say the number also
08:52 - and you can use the join statement right
08:56 - and use a join statement here and you
08:59 - can
09:00 - put the answer here basically what the
09:03 - user type
09:04 - stop this guy put a space
09:08 - is a prime number
09:13 - then we're gonna duplicate this
09:16 - stop
09:20 - is not although not capital
09:24 - prime number okay all right so let's
09:27 - save this
09:28 - let's test out the code let's zoom out a
09:30 - little bit so you guys can see the whole
09:32 - code
09:33 - so this is pretty much all the code
09:35 - really simple
09:36 - right and then we're going to try it out
09:38 - let's see if it works so we're going to
09:40 - click on the cat
09:42 - then you can ask us is it a prime while
09:44 - piping a number
09:45 - well let's say put 8 so 8 is not a prime
09:48 - number
09:50 - let's put uh 11 11 is a prime number
09:54 - right three yeah three is a prime number
09:58 - two two is a prime number
10:03 - okay so let's say we put one right it's
10:06 - gonna fail you see
10:08 - one is gonna go oh you see that because
10:10 - it could match anything it's starting at
10:12 - two and it could not go
10:14 - go past it keep on continue so what you
10:16 - wanna do is probably
10:18 - you're going to put in a condition here
10:20 - right now you can do it if and else here
10:23 - right or if doesn't matter you can use
10:26 - if
10:27 - and we can say if
10:32 - i'm not taking care of all kind of
10:33 - condition right it could be many many
10:35 - conditions so it could be very
10:37 - complicated
10:38 - but i would just try to do a bare
10:40 - minimum right understand
10:41 - prime or not so what we can do is say if
10:44 - n is equal to one and
10:48 - we are going to say return true
10:54 - right and stop the script that way will
10:57 - not go
10:58 - crazy right and also i'm not taking care
11:00 - of like letters right
11:02 - so let's try again so let's say one
11:05 - so one is a prime number right so
11:08 - not valid so if we type in something
11:10 - like this like some letter
11:12 - junk then it was gonna be a problem also
11:15 - but you can take care of it here
11:17 - like you can check if that actually is a
11:19 - number or not if it's not a number you
11:21 - can
11:22 - ask them to type in the number again you
11:24 - can use a repeat until loop to do that
11:26 - but for simplicity's sake we're not
11:29 - doing all that so this is just some
11:32 - basic algorithm right to to tell if a
11:36 - number is a prime or not
11:37 - so let's try it again let's run it again
11:40 - so let's say we say i don't know
11:44 - 8 654 not a prime right
11:48 - so you can say 53
11:53 - yeah 53 is a prime number 57
11:57 - 57 not a prime music so it can be
12:00 - divided by three
12:01 - so this is how this algorithm works so
12:05 - basically this one just tell is the
12:07 - prime number or not
12:08 - so i hope you guys enjoy this video so
12:10 - um if you like this uh
12:12 - um like algorithm um kind of
12:15 - uh programming uh pro tutorial
12:18 - i'll create more so for now i will stop
12:22 - here
12:22 - thank you and have a good day guys bye

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome back to kids coding playground so today we're gonna start on something different i will not be a game actually um trying to do uh a algorithm uh in scratch so uh you know that in other programming languages that says java or python or any other language there's a different algorithm basically is a function on logic that it could solve some problem so um similarly we can also use scratch to do a certain algorithm so this uh is a new series i'm doing it basically it's a different algorithm that we could implement in other language as well as we can implement it in scratch so um since i don't have too much time to work on a complex project so i thought maybe doing some algorithm uh project for you guys all right so uh let's start with this cat so today the algorithm we're working on is uh is a prime number basically if you click on the cat you give them a number the cat will tell you if it's a prime number or not let's say i give it seven so the cat tell you that seven is a prime number if i give uh something let's say number nine the cat said is not a prime number since you know the prime numbers you can divide the number can divide by only one and the num uh and the number itself and one so that's a prime number so let's say you don't let's say you say 57 so 57 is not a prime so um that means you can divide by three right and some other number as well so let's say uh i don't know 51 so 51 is also not a prime so you see i mean that there is certain one maybe a prime let's say 61. so 61 is a prime number so it tells you it's a prime number or not okay so we'll work on this project so let's say new okay so what we need to do first is we're going to create two variables so let's make the first one ah say index and then make another one called result okay so we'll make a new block call this prime number and then create a new variable called n so in this prime number we'll start with number two since one is uh by itself you know that's a prime right so we'll start it at number two so we'll set the index at two and then we are going to set the result that's true okay and then we're going to use a forever loop i hope you guys can see this and then we are going to use some operator so we need the o operator oops i forgot the if and else condition then we'll put the or if an operator here and then we are using less than greater than operator so we only need to go up to the square root of n so uh anything um after that uh we'll actually find a lower prime number dividing that number so we only need to go up to the square root of n so what we're going to do is grab this put this here get the square root i hope you guys already run square root uh so like let's say 4 square root of 4 is 2 like that like or square root of 25 is 5 right so i will go up to the square root of n and then check the index okay and then we also need another one here uh operator equals sign oops same thing here take this duplicate put it here and then you put the index here so basically it's a less than or equal or equal to since we don't have uh similar like other application that we have um you know out of language you can do like less than equal to so we're going to use something like this or join and then we're going to check so um we want to make sure that has uh no zero so something we have to use is mod so on so this one let's say you have a number that's a 10 mark two will give you zero remainder basically mod is a remainder so if you say three right you get one right so 10 divided by three you get angle one so this is what mods for so we're going to use the mod to tell if it's have a remainder or not okay so we're going to say if put this here and then we are going to use the equal and put this over here and then we're going to say this modding the index equals to zero oops i don't know why this let's keep on running and then we'll say set the result to false so oops where's my mouse going why is my key not working oh hold on okay i'm back so i accidentally got the wrong thing as i couldn't set it so not change okay guys got the wrong thing over here so this should be set okay set the result i will call it false so not a prime because it can be divided by that and that will just stop the script because we have a forever loop right so let's start the script stop this script put that here okay in the else statement we are going to grab another even house here inside and we're going to use the operator equal then we're gonna take the index here and then grab this end here i hate this thing why it's always running so and then we're gonna get the similar thing here put it here and then we're gonna set this to true stop this guy okay okay and then we'll just change the index here change the index by one put that outside up here okay so what it's going to do it's going to go to the loop it's going to try to find the uh the number that can be divided by this uh n uh starting from 2 and it will find a mod equals 0. no remainder then it knows that okay you can divide by it then we'll say is not a prime number else you know i will say it's a prime number okay and if it goes up to the n and it cannot find it the index go up to n and cannot find this number then we're going to say this is a prime number and stop the script okay so what we're going to do is we're going to ask the uh so the cat we're going to come over here so what we're going to do is when the sprite click we're going to go something very simple then we're gonna we're going to use the ask function okay type in a number i will tell you if it is a prime number or not okay so this is what the cat gonna say so what we're going to do is gonna drag this we're gonna call the uh so whenever you type this uh weight the whatever player type it will go to answer so we pass this answer into this prime number and then this is gonna check if it's a prime number or not and then here we can just simply check using if and else i'm gonna check the result i forgot to grab this equal so we're gonna check if the result is true then we will say it is or you can say the number also and you can use the join statement right and use a join statement here and you can put the answer here basically what the user type stop this guy put a space is a prime number then we're gonna duplicate this stop is not although not capital prime number okay all right so let's save this let's test out the code let's zoom out a little bit so you guys can see the whole code so this is pretty much all the code really simple right and then we're going to try it out let's see if it works so we're going to click on the cat then you can ask us is it a prime while piping a number well let's say put 8 so 8 is not a prime number let's put uh 11 11 is a prime number right three yeah three is a prime number two two is a prime number okay so let's say we put one right it's gonna fail you see one is gonna go oh you see that because it could match anything it's starting at two and it could not go go past it keep on continue so what you wanna do is probably you're going to put in a condition here right now you can do it if and else here right or if doesn't matter you can use if and we can say if i'm not taking care of all kind of condition right it could be many many conditions so it could be very complicated but i would just try to do a bare minimum right understand prime or not so what we can do is say if n is equal to one and we are going to say return true right and stop the script that way will not go crazy right and also i'm not taking care of like letters right so let's try again so let's say one so one is a prime number right so not valid so if we type in something like this like some letter junk then it was gonna be a problem also but you can take care of it here like you can check if that actually is a number or not if it's not a number you can ask them to type in the number again you can use a repeat until loop to do that but for simplicity's sake we're not doing all that so this is just some basic algorithm right to to tell if a number is a prime or not so let's try it again let's run it again so let's say we say i don't know 8 654 not a prime right so you can say 53 yeah 53 is a prime number 57 57 not a prime music so it can be divided by three so this is how this algorithm works so basically this one just tell is the prime number or not so i hope you guys enjoy this video so um if you like this uh um like algorithm um kind of uh programming uh pro tutorial i'll create more so for now i will stop here thank you and have a good day guys bye
