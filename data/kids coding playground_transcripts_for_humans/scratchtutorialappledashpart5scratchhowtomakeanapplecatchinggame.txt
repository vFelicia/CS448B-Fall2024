00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys to kids coding
00:08 - playground
00:09 - so today we'll be working on the fifth
00:11 - part i believe for the apple dash game
00:13 - we've been working on so in this video
00:16 - we will be working on
00:18 - the pig skin like we have you can switch
00:21 - skins
00:22 - and if we have time um we might work on
00:26 - the force field as well
00:27 - okay so without further ado let's start
00:30 - it let's get started so
00:31 - before we start we're going just to look
00:34 - through the code
00:35 - so you can get anything you missed to
00:37 - make sure that you guys have everything
00:39 - right so here we have the um player and
00:42 - then we have the bomb
00:44 - this is the bomb movement of the bomb
00:47 - the bomb explodes this will happen if it
00:49 - hits the player
00:51 - the health this is if you hit a bomb
00:53 - you'll lose health
00:55 - the basket to catch the fruit
00:59 - um and then we have the fruit fruit one
01:03 - this is all the fruit there
01:07 - that and then the begin button this just
01:10 - to click it so you can start the game
01:12 - the coin this is the currency of the
01:13 - game uses to buy upgrades
01:16 - okay okay hopefully you got all this
01:20 - down
01:21 - in the hit box for the bottom when the
01:22 - fruits touch it
01:24 - the shop this is if you hover your mouse
01:27 - over it'll get bigger and smaller when
01:28 - you click it
01:29 - this will broadcast a message called
01:31 - shop
01:33 - and here we have the shop background so
01:34 - the shop the background and the shop are
01:36 - different
01:37 - normal background and the shop
01:38 - background under two different backdrops
01:40 - you have the exit button so if you want
01:42 - to exit or something
01:45 - it's just um this is the same thing as
01:48 - the shop when you hover it'll get bigger
01:50 - when you click it it'll go back okay got
01:54 - the wings upgrade to make you go quicker
01:57 - okay let's go inside
02:01 - let's check the purchase of the wings
02:03 - and we have one more scooper here
02:08 - let's go to the basket i'll zoom in so
02:11 - you have a better look at it
02:14 - basket code
02:20 - the larger basket this is gonna make
02:21 - your basket bigger and okay today we'll
02:24 - be working on the pig
02:26 - to add to uh let the player have the
02:28 - option of switching the skin
02:30 - so first we're just gonna drag and drop
02:33 - this code
02:33 - into the pig it's really simple just
02:35 - drag and drop the shop thing
02:37 - we're gonna just duplicate all this uh
02:40 - so
02:40 - we have it right here okay so we have to
02:43 - change some stuff right here
02:44 - so on my previous one i had 60 85 as the
02:47 - coordinates
02:48 - and right here this should all be the
02:51 - same
02:53 - this um should be the same as well just
02:56 - keep this all but with broadcast another
02:58 - message we're going to call it check
03:03 - checked check skin
03:06 - purchase check skin purchase that's what
03:09 - we're going to do
03:10 - this all all this code will be the same
03:13 - all we have to do
03:14 - is receive the message when i receive
03:18 - the um check skin purchase we are going
03:21 - to get an
03:22 - if else statement so we're going to have
03:24 - to make a new variable
03:26 - first so we're going to name it um
03:30 - skin purchase status
03:35 - this is to check if it's bought status
03:39 - okay so we're gonna hide the variables
03:42 - so we're going to
03:43 - get an if else right now so if
03:46 - um so we're gonna go to equals so
03:50 - if the pig character status
03:53 - pig uh skin purchase status is
03:56 - equal to unlocked so let's say you've
03:58 - already unlocked
04:00 - the skin and bought it then we will
04:02 - broadcast a message
04:04 - called switch skin switch
04:08 - to pig skin skin
04:11 - i'll name it like that and then we're
04:13 - going to stop the script
04:14 - so this this is if it has already been
04:17 - bought
04:19 - and down here we're going to check if
04:21 - the player has enough money to purchase
04:22 - it or not
04:23 - so we're going to get a fl statement if
04:25 - then else
04:27 - so we're going to go if money is equal
04:30 - to or greater than
04:31 - 100 so we're gonna i'm gonna price it as
04:33 - a hundred
04:34 - um you can price it at any cost you want
04:37 - just make it a bit reasonable
04:39 - so if it's uh greater than or
04:42 - equal to 100 so 100.
04:46 - so if the money is greater than or equal
04:48 - to 100. so we have the variable money
04:52 - let's put that into the first slot and
04:54 - the money right here
04:56 - and then we're going to change the money
04:57 - by negative 100
04:59 - so you lose the money after you buy it
05:03 - money by minus 100
05:06 - and then we're going to set the uh skin
05:09 - status to unlocked
05:11 - uh skin purchase status we're gonna set
05:13 - it to unlocked once you have bought it
05:16 - and then after that we're gonna switch
05:18 - the costume in the costume two which is
05:19 - the grayed out one
05:21 - the purchased one that means you've
05:23 - already purchased it so we're going to
05:24 - switch the costume
05:26 - to costume 2 and after this we're going
05:28 - to broadcast the message
05:30 - the switch to pigskin message
05:36 - okay and then in the else right here if
05:38 - they do not have enough money and do not
05:40 - buy it then we're going to set the pig
05:42 - character status
05:43 - the skin purchase status to
05:46 - locked so it's not you're not going to
05:49 - be able to buy it
05:51 - and we're going to switch the costume to
05:52 - one the first costume
05:54 - the one that has not been purchased yet
06:00 - okay so now we have the script
06:05 - okay so i could have actually just drag
06:07 - and drop this
06:08 - code in here and change some of the
06:10 - variables
06:11 - but i just wanted to show you step by
06:14 - step you guys can do that if you want
06:17 - okay so in the purchase in the pick
06:21 - we're gonna get what i receive
06:23 - start game we're starting right here
06:27 - start game then we're going to hide
06:32 - okay so also in here
06:36 - let's see if we did yeah we already did
06:38 - this okay i was just trying to check if
06:39 - we
06:39 - did that in here so we have to also put
06:41 - start theme for these
06:42 - and then um we're also going to get a
06:45 - one receive start screen
06:48 - receive start screen
06:51 - then we're going to hide we're going to
06:53 - hide
06:55 - and we're going to set it to locked so
06:57 - you cannot buy it yet
06:59 - and switch it to costume one set skin
07:01 - purchase that's still
07:02 - locked and
07:05 - we're gonna switch the costume to
07:06 - costume one
07:09 - like that okay and then one more script
07:12 - in here and then we can move on
07:13 - to maybe the option where you can switch
07:16 - back to the go skin
07:18 - and then we're gonna get a when i
07:19 - receive starts uh when i receive
07:21 - check the skin purchase check skin
07:24 - purchase
07:25 - we're going to get an if then statement
07:27 - so we're gonna get if
07:29 - the skin is unlocked so we're going to
07:31 - equal
07:34 - if the skin purchase status is equal to
07:36 - unlocked
07:37 - so if it's already bought
07:45 - unlocked then we're going to forever go
07:48 - to control
07:49 - can we hide that group forever
07:54 - we're going to switch costume to costume
07:56 - 2 so it'll be grayed out
07:58 - it would always be the second costume
08:01 - all right
08:03 - so this is the pig's code so this is
08:05 - just like the cosmetic stuff
08:08 - and then right here we have
08:11 - the script to see if it's locked and you
08:13 - can buy it and stuff like that and then
08:14 - right here we have
08:17 - the starting and resetting stuff like
08:19 - that okay now let's go into your last
08:21 - sprite
08:22 - so this is to with the option let's say
08:25 - maybe you want to
08:26 - uh switch the costume um
08:30 - back to the ghost let's say you don't
08:31 - like the pig and you bought it and you
08:33 - switch it back to the ghost
08:34 - so this is what we're going to do
08:38 - so we can drag and drop this script this
08:41 - shop script
08:42 - into the ghost so do that real quick
08:46 - all right so the place
08:49 - i set it to is negative 175 negative 25
08:52 - those are the coordinates i put
08:54 - and i'm going to keep all this same
08:57 - thing and we're going to broadcast
08:58 - another message
09:00 - we're going to broadcast a message
09:02 - called switch
09:07 - to ghost
09:10 - sprite switch to go sprite
09:14 - and in here we're also going to get the
09:15 - same thing we can just drag and drop
09:18 - this script here the start game
09:22 - and the start screen
09:25 - and
09:30 - oops okay i got the two scripts and we
09:33 - will not need this right here
09:35 - to take that out okay so now we have to
09:38 - switch the ghostbrite we're probably
09:39 - we're going to go into the player
09:41 - so inside the fruitcatcher player
09:44 - we're going to receive a message so when
09:46 - i receive
09:52 - switch to ghost
09:55 - switch to ghost sprite oh we are going
09:57 - to
09:58 - uh switch costume uh
10:02 - switch costume to the
10:05 - fruit catcher one which is the this guy
10:09 - and we're actually gonna have to upload
10:11 - a pig costume into this
10:14 - so then we can have a second sprite for
10:16 - the second skin
10:18 - so right now we're going to go back here
10:21 - we're going to switch costume to the
10:22 - fruit catcher or the ghost
10:25 - and then we're going to set we're going
10:26 - to make a new variable we're going to
10:27 - name a character
10:28 - to keep track of what has i think we
10:31 - already made it
10:32 - or it already came with it because i
10:34 - just um dragged the sprite in
10:36 - so we're gonna use the character sprite
10:37 - if you have not made it make it
10:39 - and then we're gonna set the character
10:41 - to ghost
10:43 - character to ghosts
10:48 - ghost and then um in here
10:52 - okay so now we're going to get the pig
10:54 - sprite okay so
10:56 - finally got my um pig costumes
11:00 - from the from another game i had
11:04 - so we have the pig one and we're getting
11:07 - another picks of one
11:08 - is the angry pig and the other one is
11:10 - the smiling pig
11:12 - um so the angry pig is if you get hit by
11:15 - a bomb it will switch that costume
11:17 - so inside the script right here we are
11:19 - going to
11:20 - when i receive um switch
11:24 - to the pig costume we're going to again
11:26 - i want to receive
11:28 - switch to pigskin
11:31 - we are going to switch the costume to
11:34 - costume 2 which is the pig one
11:36 - switch costume to costume 2
11:40 - and we are going to set the character
11:43 - the variable set character
11:47 - to maybe pick
11:51 - all right okay so now
11:54 - that we've got all our code for the
11:56 - player let's start the game
11:58 - so you click again
12:02 - so when you hit s in the shop you go to
12:05 - the shop
12:05 - as you can see the pig sprite is right
12:08 - there and the ghost spray is always
12:10 - available um because it's free
12:14 - and i'm just going to give myself like
12:16 - 100
12:18 - 100 money for now so i can buy the
12:21 - pigskin
12:22 - it'll take a while okay let's
12:25 - buy it as you can see the costume has
12:28 - switched to the pig
12:30 - i might have to re-center the um basket
12:32 - a little bit
12:34 - but now as you can see the costume has
12:36 - become a pig
12:40 - so inside the basket maybe
12:44 - since it um maybe like
12:47 - move it down a little bit
12:52 - like right here i don't know how the
12:54 - ghost would look
12:55 - like on it i'm gonna see
12:59 - that doesn't look that great so i'm just
13:01 - gonna keep what i had before
13:04 - so maybe
13:07 - you can
13:14 - center
13:17 - and go up so it was like about right
13:18 - here so
13:20 - i think that should be okay okay
13:24 - all right
13:29 - i set the money to 100 i'm gonna
13:34 - see as you can see it looks fine i i
13:36 - re-centered it
13:37 - to look a little better let's go to the
13:39 - shop and
13:40 - spy this so once we have the pig
13:43 - let's go back to the shop and switch
13:45 - back to the ghost
13:47 - as you can see it just switched back to
13:50 - the ghost
13:50 - now the costume is back to a ghost
13:54 - all right so now i can switch skins and
13:56 - all that
13:57 - so today we worked on the pigs icon
14:00 - to purchase the pig the um swishing back
14:03 - the skin
14:04 - and the pig skin so yeah i think that
14:06 - should be it for today's tutorial
14:08 - thank you guys for watching don't forget
14:10 - to like share
14:11 - and subscribe to kids going to
14:13 - playground and we'll see you guys in the
14:15 - next tutorial

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys to kids coding playground so today we'll be working on the fifth part i believe for the apple dash game we've been working on so in this video we will be working on the pig skin like we have you can switch skins and if we have time um we might work on the force field as well okay so without further ado let's start it let's get started so before we start we're going just to look through the code so you can get anything you missed to make sure that you guys have everything right so here we have the um player and then we have the bomb this is the bomb movement of the bomb the bomb explodes this will happen if it hits the player the health this is if you hit a bomb you'll lose health the basket to catch the fruit um and then we have the fruit fruit one this is all the fruit there that and then the begin button this just to click it so you can start the game the coin this is the currency of the game uses to buy upgrades okay okay hopefully you got all this down in the hit box for the bottom when the fruits touch it the shop this is if you hover your mouse over it'll get bigger and smaller when you click it this will broadcast a message called shop and here we have the shop background so the shop the background and the shop are different normal background and the shop background under two different backdrops you have the exit button so if you want to exit or something it's just um this is the same thing as the shop when you hover it'll get bigger when you click it it'll go back okay got the wings upgrade to make you go quicker okay let's go inside let's check the purchase of the wings and we have one more scooper here let's go to the basket i'll zoom in so you have a better look at it basket code the larger basket this is gonna make your basket bigger and okay today we'll be working on the pig to add to uh let the player have the option of switching the skin so first we're just gonna drag and drop this code into the pig it's really simple just drag and drop the shop thing we're gonna just duplicate all this uh so we have it right here okay so we have to change some stuff right here so on my previous one i had 60 85 as the coordinates and right here this should all be the same this um should be the same as well just keep this all but with broadcast another message we're going to call it check checked check skin purchase check skin purchase that's what we're going to do this all all this code will be the same all we have to do is receive the message when i receive the um check skin purchase we are going to get an if else statement so we're going to have to make a new variable first so we're going to name it um skin purchase status this is to check if it's bought status okay so we're gonna hide the variables so we're going to get an if else right now so if um so we're gonna go to equals so if the pig character status pig uh skin purchase status is equal to unlocked so let's say you've already unlocked the skin and bought it then we will broadcast a message called switch skin switch to pig skin skin i'll name it like that and then we're going to stop the script so this this is if it has already been bought and down here we're going to check if the player has enough money to purchase it or not so we're going to get a fl statement if then else so we're going to go if money is equal to or greater than 100 so we're gonna i'm gonna price it as a hundred um you can price it at any cost you want just make it a bit reasonable so if it's uh greater than or equal to 100 so 100. so if the money is greater than or equal to 100. so we have the variable money let's put that into the first slot and the money right here and then we're going to change the money by negative 100 so you lose the money after you buy it money by minus 100 and then we're going to set the uh skin status to unlocked uh skin purchase status we're gonna set it to unlocked once you have bought it and then after that we're gonna switch the costume in the costume two which is the grayed out one the purchased one that means you've already purchased it so we're going to switch the costume to costume 2 and after this we're going to broadcast the message the switch to pigskin message okay and then in the else right here if they do not have enough money and do not buy it then we're going to set the pig character status the skin purchase status to locked so it's not you're not going to be able to buy it and we're going to switch the costume to one the first costume the one that has not been purchased yet okay so now we have the script okay so i could have actually just drag and drop this code in here and change some of the variables but i just wanted to show you step by step you guys can do that if you want okay so in the purchase in the pick we're gonna get what i receive start game we're starting right here start game then we're going to hide okay so also in here let's see if we did yeah we already did this okay i was just trying to check if we did that in here so we have to also put start theme for these and then um we're also going to get a one receive start screen receive start screen then we're going to hide we're going to hide and we're going to set it to locked so you cannot buy it yet and switch it to costume one set skin purchase that's still locked and we're gonna switch the costume to costume one like that okay and then one more script in here and then we can move on to maybe the option where you can switch back to the go skin and then we're gonna get a when i receive starts uh when i receive check the skin purchase check skin purchase we're going to get an if then statement so we're gonna get if the skin is unlocked so we're going to equal if the skin purchase status is equal to unlocked so if it's already bought unlocked then we're going to forever go to control can we hide that group forever we're going to switch costume to costume 2 so it'll be grayed out it would always be the second costume all right so this is the pig's code so this is just like the cosmetic stuff and then right here we have the script to see if it's locked and you can buy it and stuff like that and then right here we have the starting and resetting stuff like that okay now let's go into your last sprite so this is to with the option let's say maybe you want to uh switch the costume um back to the ghost let's say you don't like the pig and you bought it and you switch it back to the ghost so this is what we're going to do so we can drag and drop this script this shop script into the ghost so do that real quick all right so the place i set it to is negative 175 negative 25 those are the coordinates i put and i'm going to keep all this same thing and we're going to broadcast another message we're going to broadcast a message called switch to ghost sprite switch to go sprite and in here we're also going to get the same thing we can just drag and drop this script here the start game and the start screen and oops okay i got the two scripts and we will not need this right here to take that out okay so now we have to switch the ghostbrite we're probably we're going to go into the player so inside the fruitcatcher player we're going to receive a message so when i receive switch to ghost switch to ghost sprite oh we are going to uh switch costume uh switch costume to the fruit catcher one which is the this guy and we're actually gonna have to upload a pig costume into this so then we can have a second sprite for the second skin so right now we're going to go back here we're going to switch costume to the fruit catcher or the ghost and then we're going to set we're going to make a new variable we're going to name a character to keep track of what has i think we already made it or it already came with it because i just um dragged the sprite in so we're gonna use the character sprite if you have not made it make it and then we're gonna set the character to ghost character to ghosts ghost and then um in here okay so now we're going to get the pig sprite okay so finally got my um pig costumes from the from another game i had so we have the pig one and we're getting another picks of one is the angry pig and the other one is the smiling pig um so the angry pig is if you get hit by a bomb it will switch that costume so inside the script right here we are going to when i receive um switch to the pig costume we're going to again i want to receive switch to pigskin we are going to switch the costume to costume 2 which is the pig one switch costume to costume 2 and we are going to set the character the variable set character to maybe pick all right okay so now that we've got all our code for the player let's start the game so you click again so when you hit s in the shop you go to the shop as you can see the pig sprite is right there and the ghost spray is always available um because it's free and i'm just going to give myself like 100 100 money for now so i can buy the pigskin it'll take a while okay let's buy it as you can see the costume has switched to the pig i might have to recenter the um basket a little bit but now as you can see the costume has become a pig so inside the basket maybe since it um maybe like move it down a little bit like right here i don't know how the ghost would look like on it i'm gonna see that doesn't look that great so i'm just gonna keep what i had before so maybe you can center and go up so it was like about right here so i think that should be okay okay all right i set the money to 100 i'm gonna see as you can see it looks fine i i recentered it to look a little better let's go to the shop and spy this so once we have the pig let's go back to the shop and switch back to the ghost as you can see it just switched back to the ghost now the costume is back to a ghost all right so now i can switch skins and all that so today we worked on the pigs icon to purchase the pig the um swishing
