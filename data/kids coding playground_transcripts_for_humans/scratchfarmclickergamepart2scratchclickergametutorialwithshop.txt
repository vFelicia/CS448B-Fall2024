00:00 - thank you
00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - welcome back guys to part two of the
00:09 - farm clicker and we will be finishing up
00:12 - our coding for this project
00:16 - so now we're actually going to code the
00:19 - dogs and it's about the same with the
00:22 - hens it's almost the same but we have to
00:25 - change some stuff so we're going to drag
00:27 - this to the dogs
00:30 - some of that
00:32 - all of that
00:34 - and we're actually going to go to the
00:36 - dogs pick up all this code
00:38 - and let's start with this one so instead
00:41 - when the green flag is clicked and
00:43 - instead of going to the same position as
00:45 - a hand you have to go to y15 so there's
00:48 - a difference and then instead of going
00:50 - making hens owned you can make a
00:52 - variable called Dog Zone
00:57 - so dog's own to zero of course you start
00:59 - with no dogs
01:00 - and then when the Sprite is clicked
01:03 - uh instead of
01:07 - or 50 it is actually going to be so
01:11 - instead of 50 it's actually going to be
01:12 - 350 because dogs are 350 and we're going
01:16 - to put 350 for that one and then the
01:18 - maximum cap for dogs is going to be 100
01:20 - you can vary that of course and then
01:23 - it'll change money by minus 350 and then
01:27 - it will change instead of head Zone Dog
01:29 - Zone y1 and then instead of broadcasting
01:32 - uh bot and it'll be bought dog
01:36 - and then we have same with this one
01:39 - and then instead of receiving bot hen
01:41 - you'll actually bought dog and then
01:43 - forever it'll change money by so
01:46 - actually I put some uh differences in
01:49 - Dot
01:50 - we're gonna actually have a
01:53 - multiplication sign
01:55 - over here and we're gonna go dogs owned
02:00 - change money by dog's owned times
02:03 - pick random one two five so it'll give
02:07 - you one to five every one second so we
02:11 - have some differences there
02:13 - and instead of hand zoned of course I
02:17 - forgot to change this it's actually
02:18 - going to be dogs um
02:20 - sorry if I did not notice that
02:23 - and yeah I think we're good
02:25 - so I'm going to show you how the dogs
02:27 - work so and so I'm gonna change my money
02:30 - by 350 so it has the money in the
02:33 - beginning
02:35 - and now we're actually going to buy a
02:37 - dog and you see it's working it's giving
02:39 - me a random amount of money every
02:41 - second from one to five so now we have
02:45 - that finished we're gonna move on to the
02:48 - horse which is relatively similar to the
02:50 - dogs so we just have to move everything
02:52 - to the horse
02:54 - and basically give it its own stuff
02:56 - again
02:57 - so let's work on this horse
03:04 - so we're gonna have all of that so in
03:06 - the grid file I click uh have that
03:08 - instead of
03:10 - dog zoned of course it's gonna be horses
03:12 - oh
03:15 - and change this to horses owned geez
03:18 - horses owned to zero
03:20 - oh yeah I can't forget you have to right
03:21 - click on the I mean double click
03:23 - I'm messing that up and then move it
03:25 - over here
03:28 - and we're actually gonna change this to
03:30 - set horses to own and then when this
03:32 - Sprite clicked if money equals 550
03:36 - because horses are 550 or money is
03:38 - greater than 550.
03:40 - and instead of dogs owned it's going to
03:43 - be a horse's own
03:45 - and it's the max cap for this one 75
03:47 - then it'll start selling glug and then
03:50 - it'll change money by minus 550.
03:54 - then it'll change
03:55 - um of course horses owned by one
04:00 - and then instead of but the bot dog it's
04:02 - somebody bought horse
04:06 - and now we have that finished it'll go
04:09 - to here and then we're gonna go bot
04:11 - horse forever
04:12 - instead we're going to use something
04:14 - else and now we're actually going to put
04:16 - a multiplication sign
04:18 - uh change
04:20 - money by horses owned
04:25 - times
04:27 - 35.
04:29 - so yeah and now I think we have finished
04:32 - the horse
04:34 - and now we're actually going to move on
04:36 - to the llama
04:38 - and we're gonna drag all of that to the
04:41 - llama
04:43 - and
04:45 - we're gonna go to the lava and code it
04:47 - from there
04:52 - so we're gonna go to the llama
04:55 - then let's increase the size a bit so
04:58 - instead of uh using horses owned of
05:01 - course if you use llama so
05:03 - and then we're going to change Ultrazone
05:05 - to llama Zone to zero and then when this
05:07 - Sprite clicked if the money is equal to
05:09 - 1 200 where the money is less than 1 200
05:13 - I mean greater than two one thousand two
05:15 - hundred and then uh the maximum cap for
05:18 - this one's actually going to be
05:20 - um
05:21 - of 50 and we're going to change this to
05:23 - llama's own is less than 50 and let's
05:26 - start selling plug and then change money
05:28 - by minus one thousand two hundred and
05:32 - change
05:33 - uh llamas owned by one
05:37 - so broadcasting bought horse it's gonna
05:39 - be bought llama
05:41 - and instead it'll be broadcast and it's
05:45 - the same for the rest of them and then
05:46 - we move on to here and then you can
05:48 - adjust accordingly on the money of
05:50 - course and then instead we're actually
05:52 - going to change this to llamas owned
05:55 - so instead of giving you 35 It's Gonna
05:57 - Give You sixty dollars of course you can
05:59 - adjust this and it's gonna be every two
06:01 - seconds
06:03 - I noticed that llamas actually don't
06:05 - have value so we're actually going to
06:06 - change this to 80 not 60. of course you
06:09 - can change that accordingly and we're
06:10 - gonna change this to bot llama up here
06:12 - so I think this is the Llama code right
06:16 - here so feel free to pause
06:20 - and now we're going to work on the world
06:21 - record actually we're going to save the
06:23 - world record for the second part well
06:25 - this is going to be the second part so
06:27 - we will do the world record last so
06:31 - we're actually going to move on to the
06:32 - hoe
06:35 - so we're actually gonna see the costumes
06:38 - and this is the hoe before you buy it
06:40 - and you can see how much uh multiplier
06:44 - it gives you and the cost and this is
06:46 - the equipped version and it'll say
06:49 - multiplier and have the green ones so
06:51 - you've equipped it and then for this one
06:53 - you have this is when you're not
06:55 - equipped it but you bought it so let's
06:58 - work on the hook
07:00 - we're gonna start with the green flag
07:03 - when the green flag is clicked
07:06 - it will set
07:08 - hobot
07:11 - well of course we have to make a new
07:13 - variable which is a lot of these
07:15 - variables robot
07:17 - two zero to n actually because we have
07:21 - not bought the hoe and then it'll go to
07:24 - the front layer
07:26 - for you there you go and then switch
07:29 - costume
07:31 - to Ho which is the original one because
07:34 - you haven't bought it yet and yeah
07:37 - and then it'll go to
07:40 - X so we already have this position down
07:43 - here a little reserved spot and then
07:46 - we're gonna actually have when this
07:48 - Sprite clicked it's gonna be you need a
07:52 - if then else I think we're actually
07:55 - going to take the code from before I
07:57 - think that's really similar
07:59 - I'm just going to compare them
08:02 - so yeah let's just move this over here
08:06 - oh that's a little big so when this
08:09 - Sprite clicked if money it oh yeah first
08:13 - let's check if you even bought it so
08:16 - we're actually gonna
08:19 - take this and if hope bought
08:24 - equals
08:26 - hobot
08:29 - equals
08:31 - n
08:32 - then
08:34 - it will so if you haven't bought the
08:36 - whole yet then it will
08:39 - I think it's not lesson so it will
08:43 - you need if then else right here if then
08:46 - else you need a or
08:49 - so you need the money that equals 250
08:56 - .
08:58 - so we're actually going to change if the
09:00 - money equals 250
09:03 - or we're going to duplicate this
09:06 - wait actually we don't
09:07 - you actually need this one so or the
09:10 - money
09:12 - is a greater
09:14 - than 250.
09:19 - and then that means we'll have this and
09:22 - then it will set hobot to Y because now
09:24 - you bought the hoe
09:27 - and now it will
09:29 - start sound glug
09:33 - well we can just pop it really doesn't
09:35 - matter the signal to signify you bought
09:37 - the thing
09:38 - and now it will change money
09:42 - so change
09:44 - money
09:46 - by minus 250.
09:48 - oops 250. because that's how much it
09:51 - will deduct and then now we'll set CPS
09:53 - to two so for every click you'll click
09:56 - on the little chicken they'll give you
09:57 - two
09:58 - and then I'll switch costume
10:01 - to hoe EQ
10:03 - because it's the equipped green one
10:05 - and then it'll broadcast
10:08 - equipped hoe
10:15 - equiptoe and then else it will broadcast
10:18 - you do not have enough money to buy this
10:22 - and then under this else it will set CPS
10:26 - to two
10:28 - and then switch costume
10:32 - to hoichyu
10:34 - and also
10:36 - broadcast
10:40 - equipped up that's correct
10:43 - so we're actually going to come back to
10:45 - this one later and we're actually going
10:47 - to drag this to the rest of them because
10:48 - these buttons are real similar to each
10:50 - other
10:55 - let's work on the wheelbarrow now
10:58 - so the wheelbarrow
11:01 - uh when the green flag is clicked so we
11:03 - actually have some more code for each of
11:05 - the buttons afterwards so we'll be going
11:07 - back to those later
11:09 - and we'll make a new wheelbarrow I mean
11:11 - new variable called wheelbarrow
11:14 - bot to confirm if you bought it or not
11:17 - and then it'll set wheelbarrow bot to
11:20 - end because you have not bought it yet
11:23 - and it'll go to the front layer and do
11:25 - all that good stuff
11:27 - and then when this Sprite is clicked if
11:30 - wheelbarrow bought
11:32 - equals n
11:33 - and then if money equals 600 because you
11:37 - need 600 to buy the wheelbarrow
11:39 - or money is greater than 600 then it
11:42 - will set wheelbarrow bought to y
11:45 - now you have button the wheelbarrow and
11:48 - it'll start sound pop and then change
11:49 - money by minus 607 minus 250 and then
11:52 - set CPS to 10 so you get 10 per click
11:54 - now so that's a pretty good deal and
11:56 - then switch costume to wheelbarrow EQ
12:00 - and now it will also broadcast a new
12:03 - variable oopsies brought this new
12:05 - variable called equipped wheelbarrow
12:08 - [Music]
12:12 - pretty hard for word to spell and then
12:15 - you don't have enough money to buy this
12:17 - over here and then set CPS to 10 and
12:21 - then switch costume to a hoe and instead
12:24 - of hoe wheelbarrow EQ and then broadcast
12:28 - equipped wheelbarrow over here
12:32 - now we're going to do the tractor so the
12:34 - code is quite similar I think you
12:37 - already know what's going to happen
12:39 - so
12:42 - let's go to the Tractor
12:45 - and then if though when the green flags
12:47 - clicked it'll be tractor bot instead so
12:51 - make a new variable tractor I always
12:54 - make mess up on the spelling tractor bot
12:57 - and then no I should be tractor bot to
12:59 - end
13:00 - and instead of negative
13:03 - we're actually going to change the X to
13:05 - 13 and the Y to negative 150. I actually
13:09 - don't even think I changed this one yet
13:11 - I'm sorry
13:13 - but go back to the wheelbarrow and then
13:15 - instead of negative 190 because that's
13:16 - supposed to be the
13:18 - um negative 89.
13:21 - so we have negative I mean positive 13
13:23 - and negative 150 right here and then
13:26 - when this Sprite clicked
13:29 - instead of wheelbarrow bot I think you
13:31 - know what's going to happen it's gonna
13:32 - be tractor bot
13:35 - into equals N Money equals two thousand
13:38 - five hundred
13:40 - 500
13:42 - and then 2 500.
13:45 - as well as set tractor bot to y
13:51 - tractor EQ in a broadcast equipped
13:56 - tractor
13:59 - and then you don't have enough money to
14:01 - buy this and then it will set CPS to 100
14:04 - now
14:06 - tractor EQ and then
14:09 - equip tractor I think that's the code
14:11 - for that oh and sorry this is not 2500
14:16 - negative 2500 because you're taking away
14:18 - money
14:19 - and yes we also have to change the CPS
14:21 - to 100 sorry if I did not notice that
14:24 - and now we will move on back to the hull
14:27 - and we're actually gonna go
14:32 - when I receive
14:34 - equipped wheelbarrow because you cannot
14:36 - equip two tools at once you need if then
14:39 - else
14:40 - if then else if then else a hoe so you
14:45 - need this one
14:46 - a equals
14:50 - and
14:52 - and need a whole bot
14:55 - equals n
14:57 - then it will
15:00 - switch costume to hoe
15:04 - else it'll switch costume to Hope oh
15:07 - basically
15:10 - um changing it back if you don't have
15:12 - the hoe and if you have the wheelbarrow
15:17 - and same with the tractor
15:21 - equipped tractor
15:23 - and then
15:25 - uh if Hobart equals n
15:28 - that's which I'll assume to home and
15:32 - then I'll switch costume to her own
15:34 - cool now we're going to move this to the
15:36 - wheelbarrow and the tractor so
15:39 - move this to the wheelbarrow
15:41 - and move this one to the wheelbarrow too
15:45 - and I think you know what's gonna happen
15:48 - so when I receive
15:51 - instead of equipped wheelbarrow this
15:53 - one's going to be the opposite so
15:54 - equipped hoe this one's going to be
15:56 - equipped tractor so this one's gonna
15:58 - stay like that instead of hobot is going
16:00 - to be wheelbarrow bot same with this one
16:05 - um we'll have to switch cost into
16:07 - wheelbarrow and this winter wheelbarrow
16:09 - owned
16:10 - and this one's a tractor and same with
16:13 - this one
16:16 - and now we're gonna do it for the
16:17 - tractor not last but not least
16:22 - right here
16:24 - and then I think you know what's about
16:26 - to happen
16:27 - so equipped oh this one's gonna stay and
16:29 - it said zombie tractor bot equals n
16:31 - switch costume two tractor and this
16:34 - one's gonna be tractor owned
16:36 - and then this is going to be equipped
16:38 - wheelbarrow
16:40 - and then if it is tractor bot
16:45 - then it's going to be n and switch
16:49 - costume do tractor and then switch
16:51 - costume to tractor own so these are
16:54 - basically all the combinations that you
16:56 - can get
16:57 - our last thing to do is the world record
17:00 - and the music so we're actually gonna
17:04 - right click on this move it to the
17:08 - llamas owned
17:09 - I mean not right click I always messes
17:11 - up double click on this one I think this
17:14 - is horse's own right so this is going to
17:16 - be horse's own double click and then put
17:19 - it right over here
17:21 - and then for this one we're actually
17:23 - going to hide a hobot
17:27 - um wheelbarrow bot and tractor bot
17:33 - I just started the game and I'm sorry I
17:34 - forgot to change the position for the
17:37 - horse and llama that is very stupid of
17:39 - me so we're actually gonna change the
17:42 - horse position to negative 50.
17:46 - offer Y and then for the llamas it's
17:50 - actually going to be
17:52 - negative 110 and we should have
17:55 - everything positioned greatly
17:58 - and yeah we have everything like that
18:01 - cool now let's work on the world record
18:09 - so this one's quite confusing
18:11 - so we're gonna put a little quick demo
18:13 - for what we have right now so
18:15 - you see when the green flags click when
18:17 - you get all of that we're gonna give
18:18 - ourselves a little bit money so I can
18:20 - show you the tools so now we're gonna
18:22 - give ourselves some money so we're gonna
18:24 - go here let's just give ourselves like
18:26 - ten thousand dollars so
18:29 - a thousand dollars
18:31 - so we started this game let's give
18:33 - ourselves ten thousand dollars and now
18:35 - we're gonna buy the tools you see it
18:37 - says we have her equipped and let's buy
18:40 - the wheelbarrow in the home
18:41 - it'll give me two this one and we'll
18:43 - give you 10 and then this one will give
18:45 - you 100. so it does seem to be working
18:48 - that's cool so now we're gonna move into
18:50 - world record it's really similar to the
18:53 - money so let's do that
18:56 - we're actually going to go to the money
18:58 - and
18:59 - drag all these to the world record
19:03 - there are going to be some differences
19:04 - so
19:06 - be aware of that
19:09 - and now we have that all of this over
19:11 - here
19:13 - let's work on the world record
19:16 - so when the green flag is clicked it'll
19:18 - set hide there's no money included so
19:21 - you delete that little chunk over there
19:22 - and then when I receive start game
19:27 - when I see start game it'll actually
19:29 - instead wait one second
19:32 - and then hide
19:35 - before you go to
19:37 - x190 y150 so this is going to be a
19:40 - little bit higher than the
19:43 - or other one and then it will set number
19:45 - to zero
19:48 - and then instead of money number clone
19:50 - it's going to be wrn
19:53 - clone
19:56 - and we're going to change this to wrn
19:59 - clone zero and then forever it'll wait
20:02 - until this is going to be wrn clone is
20:05 - less than length of so we need to make a
20:07 - variable a cloud one so click on this
20:10 - one
20:11 - and we're gonna name it world
20:14 - record
20:17 - so now we're gonna put it like that
20:21 - and now we have our world record
20:23 - variable
20:25 - and over here we're instead of length of
20:27 - money it's going to be length of world
20:31 - record
20:33 - you know change number by one and change
20:37 - world record clone
20:40 - instead of by one instead of the other
20:42 - one and then it'll create color myself
20:45 - and change X by negative 20. then when
20:48 - we move on to here when I start as a
20:50 - clone it'll show and forever if number
20:54 - is greater than length of world record
20:56 - with the cloud variable it'll hide else
20:59 - it'll switch costs a show
21:02 - and also first switch costume to letter
21:07 - length of world record instead
21:11 - minus number minus
21:14 - one
21:17 - uh of world record
21:21 - and you have to add one piece of
21:23 - additional code over here so when the
21:26 - green flag is clicked
21:28 - forever
21:31 - you need a if then statement
21:34 - if then
21:37 - the money is
21:40 - greater than
21:43 - world record so if you beat the world
21:45 - record
21:46 - then it will set
21:49 - world record to money
21:54 - and now that's basically what we have
21:56 - here all right so I'm gonna do some
21:58 - little testing over here so we're
22:00 - actually going to change
22:03 - the
22:05 - world record by
22:08 - uh let's just actually let's just go set
22:11 - world record
22:12 - to 25 so that's going to be the world
22:16 - record
22:20 - so let's set it to 25.
22:22 - 25 right here so now the world record is
22:25 - 25 let's see if it works or not so let's
22:28 - just click until 25. it will not take
22:30 - that long and then if I get 26 that's
22:32 - the new world record
22:34 - that's basically how the world record
22:35 - function works
22:39 - so I forgot actually to change this part
22:41 - so go back to the tools and then
22:44 - um you might have already noticed this
22:45 - but I'm sorry but I did not change this
22:47 - to the correspondent tool and we're
22:50 - actually going to change this one to a
22:51 - tractor and this one to wheelbarrow so
22:54 - for information so I think should work
22:56 - now and yeah we have our tools up and
22:59 - going like that
23:00 - so cool
23:02 - and we're actually going to hide our wrn
23:05 - clone in our world record because it
23:08 - already already says over here so now
23:11 - we basically have it done except for the
23:13 - music so we're gonna go to over here and
23:16 - then when the green flag is clicked
23:20 - uh we'll go switch costume to farm
23:24 - switch back up to farm my bed and then
23:26 - forever
23:28 - it will play this song because it's
23:30 - really good until done and
23:34 - of course you can use any song you want
23:36 - and if you haven't noticed we have
23:38 - actually added this extra WR
23:41 - AP uh text next to the farm uh to
23:44 - indicate the world record up here so
23:47 - that's basically how we have it here
23:49 - so I think I'm finished here and let's
23:52 - try the game
23:54 - and let's see if I can hear the music
23:58 - so you see we do have music
24:01 - I'm gonna turn it up a little bit and
24:03 - then um we have our chicken if you click
24:04 - it it gives us score you can see the
24:07 - little visual effects plus the glow
24:09 - effect that we did earlier as well as
24:11 - the chicken turning and
24:14 - um we can see the chicks raining down
24:18 - uh I think the tens are gonna actually
24:20 - work here
24:22 - I'm gonna buy a hand
24:23 - and it looks like it works it'll
24:26 - probably work for all the other ones too
24:28 - so I'm gonna do some grinding off camera
24:30 - so I did some grinding off camera and I
24:33 - got our
24:34 - uh the stuff and it seems to be working
24:37 - fine and it looks like we're about done
24:40 - here and
24:42 - um I'll have this I'll have the Sprite
24:45 - one shared so you guys can download it
24:47 - from that one as well so you guys can
24:50 - make your own remix that downloaded one
24:52 - that one with the Sprites and you guys
24:55 - can use that for your own game
24:58 - and
24:59 - if you haven't seen on the demo I also
25:01 - have these Mega troops on this side but
25:03 - I'm not doing it a part of this tutorial
25:05 - because it's just the same thing with
25:07 - this one but I just changed the
25:08 - background a little bit and changed the
25:10 - money of course so
25:12 - that's it for this video
25:15 - please like share subscribe and comment
25:17 - in the comment section below what else
25:19 - projects you want and this is actually a
25:21 - um a subscriber
25:24 - uh idea that we took from the comment
25:27 - section and maybe one day you'll find
25:29 - one of your ideas up on our channel so
25:33 - yeah uh if you learn something uh give
25:37 - us a favorite and on our project so
25:39 - Gumball 098 you can also check out my
25:41 - project I will update the original form
25:44 - clicker that I have put on my uh profile
25:47 - and I will update it once in a while for
25:50 - extra Buffs and Nerfs to the cards we're
25:53 - adding new cards in the game so anyway
25:56 - please like share subscribe and comment
25:58 - of course and see you guys next time

Cleaned transcript:

thank you welcome back guys to part two of the farm clicker and we will be finishing up our coding for this project so now we're actually going to code the dogs and it's about the same with the hens it's almost the same but we have to change some stuff so we're going to drag this to the dogs some of that all of that and we're actually going to go to the dogs pick up all this code and let's start with this one so instead when the green flag is clicked and instead of going to the same position as a hand you have to go to y15 so there's a difference and then instead of going making hens owned you can make a variable called Dog Zone so dog's own to zero of course you start with no dogs and then when the Sprite is clicked uh instead of or 50 it is actually going to be so instead of 50 it's actually going to be 350 because dogs are 350 and we're going to put 350 for that one and then the maximum cap for dogs is going to be 100 you can vary that of course and then it'll change money by minus 350 and then it will change instead of head Zone Dog Zone y1 and then instead of broadcasting uh bot and it'll be bought dog and then we have same with this one and then instead of receiving bot hen you'll actually bought dog and then forever it'll change money by so actually I put some uh differences in Dot we're gonna actually have a multiplication sign over here and we're gonna go dogs owned change money by dog's owned times pick random one two five so it'll give you one to five every one second so we have some differences there and instead of hand zoned of course I forgot to change this it's actually going to be dogs um sorry if I did not notice that and yeah I think we're good so I'm going to show you how the dogs work so and so I'm gonna change my money by 350 so it has the money in the beginning and now we're actually going to buy a dog and you see it's working it's giving me a random amount of money every second from one to five so now we have that finished we're gonna move on to the horse which is relatively similar to the dogs so we just have to move everything to the horse and basically give it its own stuff again so let's work on this horse so we're gonna have all of that so in the grid file I click uh have that instead of dog zoned of course it's gonna be horses oh and change this to horses owned geez horses owned to zero oh yeah I can't forget you have to right click on the I mean double click I'm messing that up and then move it over here and we're actually gonna change this to set horses to own and then when this Sprite clicked if money equals 550 because horses are 550 or money is greater than 550. and instead of dogs owned it's going to be a horse's own and it's the max cap for this one 75 then it'll start selling glug and then it'll change money by minus 550. then it'll change um of course horses owned by one and then instead of but the bot dog it's somebody bought horse and now we have that finished it'll go to here and then we're gonna go bot horse forever instead we're going to use something else and now we're actually going to put a multiplication sign uh change money by horses owned times 35. so yeah and now I think we have finished the horse and now we're actually going to move on to the llama and we're gonna drag all of that to the llama and we're gonna go to the lava and code it from there so we're gonna go to the llama then let's increase the size a bit so instead of uh using horses owned of course if you use llama so and then we're going to change Ultrazone to llama Zone to zero and then when this Sprite clicked if the money is equal to 1 200 where the money is less than 1 200 I mean greater than two one thousand two hundred and then uh the maximum cap for this one's actually going to be um of 50 and we're going to change this to llama's own is less than 50 and let's start selling plug and then change money by minus one thousand two hundred and change uh llamas owned by one so broadcasting bought horse it's gonna be bought llama and instead it'll be broadcast and it's the same for the rest of them and then we move on to here and then you can adjust accordingly on the money of course and then instead we're actually going to change this to llamas owned so instead of giving you 35 It's Gonna Give You sixty dollars of course you can adjust this and it's gonna be every two seconds I noticed that llamas actually don't have value so we're actually going to change this to 80 not 60. of course you can change that accordingly and we're gonna change this to bot llama up here so I think this is the Llama code right here so feel free to pause and now we're going to work on the world record actually we're going to save the world record for the second part well this is going to be the second part so we will do the world record last so we're actually going to move on to the hoe so we're actually gonna see the costumes and this is the hoe before you buy it and you can see how much uh multiplier it gives you and the cost and this is the equipped version and it'll say multiplier and have the green ones so you've equipped it and then for this one you have this is when you're not equipped it but you bought it so let's work on the hook we're gonna start with the green flag when the green flag is clicked it will set hobot well of course we have to make a new variable which is a lot of these variables robot two zero to n actually because we have not bought the hoe and then it'll go to the front layer for you there you go and then switch costume to Ho which is the original one because you haven't bought it yet and yeah and then it'll go to X so we already have this position down here a little reserved spot and then we're gonna actually have when this Sprite clicked it's gonna be you need a if then else I think we're actually going to take the code from before I think that's really similar I'm just going to compare them so yeah let's just move this over here oh that's a little big so when this Sprite clicked if money it oh yeah first let's check if you even bought it so we're actually gonna take this and if hope bought equals hobot equals n then it will so if you haven't bought the whole yet then it will I think it's not lesson so it will you need if then else right here if then else you need a or so you need the money that equals 250 . so we're actually going to change if the money equals 250 or we're going to duplicate this wait actually we don't you actually need this one so or the money is a greater than 250. and then that means we'll have this and then it will set hobot to Y because now you bought the hoe and now it will start sound glug well we can just pop it really doesn't matter the signal to signify you bought the thing and now it will change money so change money by minus 250. oops 250. because that's how much it will deduct and then now we'll set CPS to two so for every click you'll click on the little chicken they'll give you two and then I'll switch costume to hoe EQ because it's the equipped green one and then it'll broadcast equipped hoe equiptoe and then else it will broadcast you do not have enough money to buy this and then under this else it will set CPS to two and then switch costume to hoichyu and also broadcast equipped up that's correct so we're actually going to come back to this one later and we're actually going to drag this to the rest of them because these buttons are real similar to each other let's work on the wheelbarrow now so the wheelbarrow uh when the green flag is clicked so we actually have some more code for each of the buttons afterwards so we'll be going back to those later and we'll make a new wheelbarrow I mean new variable called wheelbarrow bot to confirm if you bought it or not and then it'll set wheelbarrow bot to end because you have not bought it yet and it'll go to the front layer and do all that good stuff and then when this Sprite is clicked if wheelbarrow bought equals n and then if money equals 600 because you need 600 to buy the wheelbarrow or money is greater than 600 then it will set wheelbarrow bought to y now you have button the wheelbarrow and it'll start sound pop and then change money by minus 607 minus 250 and then set CPS to 10 so you get 10 per click now so that's a pretty good deal and then switch costume to wheelbarrow EQ and now it will also broadcast a new variable oopsies brought this new variable called equipped wheelbarrow pretty hard for word to spell and then you don't have enough money to buy this over here and then set CPS to 10 and then switch costume to a hoe and instead of hoe wheelbarrow EQ and then broadcast equipped wheelbarrow over here now we're going to do the tractor so the code is quite similar I think you already know what's going to happen so let's go to the Tractor and then if though when the green flags clicked it'll be tractor bot instead so make a new variable tractor I always make mess up on the spelling tractor bot and then no I should be tractor bot to end and instead of negative we're actually going to change the X to 13 and the Y to negative 150. I actually don't even think I changed this one yet I'm sorry but go back to the wheelbarrow and then instead of negative 190 because that's supposed to be the um negative 89. so we have negative I mean positive 13 and negative 150 right here and then when this Sprite clicked instead of wheelbarrow bot I think you know what's going to happen it's gonna be tractor bot into equals N Money equals two thousand five hundred 500 and then 2 500. as well as set tractor bot to y tractor EQ in a broadcast equipped tractor and then you don't have enough money to buy this and then it will set CPS to 100 now tractor EQ and then equip tractor I think that's the code for that oh and sorry this is not 2500 negative 2500 because you're taking away money and yes we also have to change the CPS to 100 sorry if I did not notice that and now we will move on back to the hull and we're actually gonna go when I receive equipped wheelbarrow because you cannot equip two tools at once you need if then else if then else if then else a hoe so you need this one a equals and and need a whole bot equals n then it will switch costume to hoe else it'll switch costume to Hope oh basically um changing it back if you don't have the hoe and if you have the wheelbarrow and same with the tractor equipped tractor and then uh if Hobart equals n that's which I'll assume to home and then I'll switch costume to her own cool now we're going to move this to the wheelbarrow and the tractor so move this to the wheelbarrow and move this one to the wheelbarrow too and I think you know what's gonna happen so when I receive instead of equipped wheelbarrow this one's going to be the opposite so equipped hoe this one's going to be equipped tractor so this one's gonna stay like that instead of hobot is going to be wheelbarrow bot same with this one um we'll have to switch cost into wheelbarrow and this winter wheelbarrow owned and this one's a tractor and same with this one and now we're gonna do it for the tractor not last but not least right here and then I think you know what's about to happen so equipped oh this one's gonna stay and it said zombie tractor bot equals n switch costume two tractor and this one's gonna be tractor owned and then this is going to be equipped wheelbarrow and then if it is tractor bot then it's going to be n and switch costume do tractor and then switch costume to tractor own so these are basically all the combinations that you can get our last thing to do is the world record and the music so we're actually gonna right click on this move it to the llamas owned I mean not right click I always messes up double click on this one I think this is horse's own right so this is going to be horse's own double click and then put it right over here and then for this one we're actually going to hide a hobot um wheelbarrow bot and tractor bot I just started the game and I'm sorry I forgot to change the position for the horse and llama that is very stupid of me so we're actually gonna change the horse position to negative 50. offer Y and then for the llamas it's actually going to be negative 110 and we should have everything positioned greatly and yeah we have everything like that cool now let's work on the world record so this one's quite confusing so we're gonna put a little quick demo for what we have right now so you see when the green flags click when you get all of that we're gonna give ourselves a little bit money so I can show you the tools so now we're gonna give ourselves some money so we're gonna go here let's just give ourselves like ten thousand dollars so a thousand dollars so we started this game let's give ourselves ten thousand dollars and now we're gonna buy the tools you see it says we have her equipped and let's buy the wheelbarrow in the home it'll give me two this one and we'll give you 10 and then this one will give you 100. so it does seem to be working that's cool so now we're gonna move into world record it's really similar to the money so let's do that we're actually going to go to the money and drag all these to the world record there are going to be some differences so be aware of that and now we have that all of this over here let's work on the world record so when the green flag is clicked it'll set hide there's no money included so you delete that little chunk over there and then when I receive start game when I see start game it'll actually instead wait one second and then hide before you go to x190 y150 so this is going to be a little bit higher than the or other one and then it will set number to zero and then instead of money number clone it's going to be wrn clone and we're going to change this to wrn clone zero and then forever it'll wait until this is going to be wrn clone is less than length of so we need to make a variable a cloud one so click on this one and we're gonna name it world record so now we're gonna put it like that and now we have our world record variable and over here we're instead of length of money it's going to be length of world record you know change number by one and change world record clone instead of by one instead of the other one and then it'll create color myself and change X by negative 20. then when we move on to here when I start as a clone it'll show and forever if number is greater than length of world record with the cloud variable it'll hide else it'll switch costs a show and also first switch costume to letter length of world record instead minus number minus one uh of world record and you have to add one piece of additional code over here so when the green flag is clicked forever you need a if then statement if then the money is greater than world record so if you beat the world record then it will set world record to money and now that's basically what we have here all right so I'm gonna do some little testing over here so we're actually going to change the world record by uh let's just actually let's just go set world record to 25 so that's going to be the world record so let's set it to 25. 25 right here so now the world record is 25 let's see if it works or not so let's just click until 25. it will not take that long and then if I get 26 that's the new world record that's basically how the world record function works so I forgot actually to change this part so go back to the tools and then um you might have already noticed this but I'm sorry but I did not change this to the correspondent tool and we're actually going to change this one to a tractor and this one to wheelbarrow so for information so I think should work now and yeah we have our tools up and going like that so cool and we're actually going to hide our wrn clone in our world record because it already already says over here so now we basically have it done except for the music so we're gonna go to over here and then when the green flag is clicked uh we'll go switch costume to farm switch back up to farm my bed and then forever it will play this song because it's really good until done and of course you can use any song you want and if you haven't noticed we have actually added this extra WR AP uh text next to the farm uh to indicate the world record up here so that's basically how we have it here so I think I'm finished here and let's try the game and let's see if I can hear the music so you see we do have music I'm gonna turn it up a little bit and then um we have our chicken if you click it it gives us score you can see the little visual effects plus the glow effect that we did earlier as well as the chicken turning and um we can see the chicks raining down uh I think the tens are gonna actually work here I'm gonna buy a hand and it looks like it works it'll probably work for all the other ones too so I'm gonna do some grinding off camera so I did some grinding off camera and I got our uh the stuff and it seems to be working fine and it looks like we're about done here and um I'll have this I'll have the Sprite one shared so you guys can download it from that one as well so you guys can make your own remix that downloaded one that one with the Sprites and you guys can use that for your own game and if you haven't seen on the demo I also have these Mega troops on this side but I'm not doing it a part of this tutorial because it's just the same thing with this one but I just changed the background a little bit and changed the money of course so that's it for this video please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below what else projects you want and this is actually a um a subscriber uh idea that we took from the comment section and maybe one day you'll find one of your ideas up on our channel so yeah uh if you learn something uh give us a favorite and on our project so Gumball 098 you can also check out my project I will update the original form clicker that I have put on my uh profile and I will update it once in a while for extra Buffs and Nerfs to the cards we're adding new cards in the game so anyway please like share subscribe and comment of course and see you guys next time foreign
