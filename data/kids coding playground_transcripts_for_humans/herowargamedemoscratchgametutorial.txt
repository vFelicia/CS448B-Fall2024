00:00 - welcome back guys it's kids going
00:01 - playground here and today we're back for
00:02 - another video in scratch and today we're
00:04 - making a game called hero War but this
00:06 - is just the demo we'll post parts for of
00:09 - this game later as you can see it's a
00:11 - pretty complicated game so it it's
00:13 - probably the most complicated game I've
00:14 - ever made so let's just show you the
00:17 - demo so in the beginning there's some
00:19 - music if you can hear that and there's
00:21 - three Heroes that you can choose from
00:23 - and you can see they're live so it
00:24 - default is the elf Warrior but the elf
00:26 - Warrior and then the Grand Master Mage
00:28 - and then the fairy queen so you can
00:29 - shoot choose either three Heroes and
00:32 - then I'll choose Al Warrior to show you
00:35 - so all of them have three powerups and
00:37 - then the zombies will be chasing you so
00:38 - there's the armored zombie the Speedy
00:39 - zombie and the regular zombie and um You
00:43 - probably to you have to shoot them down
00:44 - with your basic attack see I'm shooting
00:46 - down the arrows and then each character
00:49 - has three um three powerups as you can
00:52 - see over here so the elf Warrior
00:54 - powerups are the spectral Arrow which
00:56 - will go through all the enemies and do
00:58 - massive damage to everything just just
01:00 - like that and as you can see it keeps a
01:02 - counter over there and you'll get it
01:04 - over time so the death arrow is the
01:06 - second ability it can has the capability
01:08 - to oneshot any like low class peon it
01:11 - cannot onshot any boss or anything it'll
01:14 - just do a lot of damage to the bosses
01:15 - and then we have the Griffin which is a
01:17 - third ability so it'll flap its wings
01:20 - just like that and drop a bomb which
01:22 - will kill everything which is a really
01:24 - strong ability and these will just come
01:26 - over time there's also three bosses in
01:27 - this game well I'm going to demonstrate
01:29 - all the hero abilities first and all the
01:31 - heroes so the grandmas Mage he shoots um
01:34 - stars which do a lot of
01:37 - damage and this uh so his first ability
01:41 - is to teleport so you see over here
01:43 - he'll teleport all things back just like
01:45 - that I'm going try to get another one so
01:48 - wait let's
01:49 - wait um and then you teleport them back
01:52 - just like that and then the second
01:54 - ability gives it the capability to
01:56 - dismantle all armor and it's really
01:58 - strong it's armored enemies as you can
02:00 - see right there he dismantled the armor
02:02 - and it's just really easy to kill right
02:03 - after that look I dismantle all their
02:04 - armor and it's really strong against
02:07 - um uh armored enemies and the third
02:10 - ability is The Apprentice he shoots
02:13 - Stars at the enemies that do massive
02:15 - damage to armored enemy so the Mage
02:17 - basically is really good against armored
02:19 - enemy so it's a turret and just it'll
02:20 - just shoot a certain amount and certain
02:23 - rounds at the enemies that and it just
02:25 - shoots wherever your mouse is so that's
02:27 - basically the powerups of the
02:30 - Mage and let's demonstrate the fairy
02:32 - queen so she is one of the strongest
02:36 - Heroes although her base attack is
02:38 - really weak as you can see like that
02:40 - she's not that strong but she has really
02:42 - strong Powers so her first ability has
02:45 - the capability to heal her back to Max
02:47 - health so that that is really strong
02:51 - that's one of the strongest abilities
02:53 - and then we also have the arrow which is
02:56 - a Teleport Arrow I'll demonstrate that
02:59 - if I got another one see if you shoot it
03:01 - it justes it teleports you to wherever
03:03 - that Arrow lands and it does a lot of
03:05 - damage wait I'll show I'll try to show
03:08 - you let's heal back so oh see it does a
03:13 - lot of damage against enemies and then
03:15 - the third ability is a shield it'll come
03:17 - up and it block enemies and teleport
03:19 - them back while you can shoot them
03:22 - safely from a far distance which is why
03:24 - fairy queen is a really good hero but
03:26 - that's basically all the three
03:28 - Heroes and then after that uh there's
03:31 - going to be three bosses in this game so
03:34 - let's uh let's do that I'm going to try
03:36 - to get to the bosses so this might be a
03:39 - time lapse so let's just
03:45 - [Music]
03:58 - go
03:59 - [Music]
04:07 - so as you can see the first boss after
04:09 - 250 score he'll come out and he has
04:12 - 10,000 Health he's The Siege monster and
04:15 - then he does a lot of damage if you get
04:16 - into him and he summons these baby blue
04:18 - peons have lots of health actually um
04:21 - and they'll follow you and do a lot of
04:23 - damage so I'm going to use the Griffin
04:24 - here to try to clear some of those peons
04:26 - out just like that and then I'll use the
04:29 - arrows to lower its HP uh so then the
04:33 - siege monster can
04:44 - [Music]
04:58 - die
05:06 - so as you can see the second boss comes
05:08 - at 1,250 score and it's the old one so
05:11 - he summons poison vines that poison you
05:14 - if you touch them as you can see and
05:16 - they'll do damage over time and he
05:17 - doesn't move but he does shoot these
05:19 - large projectiles that do 30 damage and
05:22 - try to hit you so see I got poisoned
05:25 - there oh gosh let's try to kill him
05:28 - let's try to kill him I have a griffin
05:31 - real quick oh gosh I'm
05:35 - poison as you can see the old one is
05:39 - dead so time for the last boss and then
05:42 - the mysterious man comes up and gives us
05:45 - some heals as you can see our lives are
05:47 - back up he gives us 1,000
05:49 - [Music]
05:58 - health so as you can see the last boss
06:01 - the final and last boss after 2,000
06:03 - score the zombie King will come up he's
06:05 - really strong he has 15,000 health and
06:08 - he steals your lives so he does 50
06:10 - damage to you and heals 500 health every
06:13 - single time and he can also summon peons
06:15 - which makes him the hardest boss by far
06:17 - as you can see he just stole my hearts
06:18 - and healed himself which is really
06:21 - annoying so let's just try to beat
06:24 - him oh yeah he's stealing my health
06:26 - right now this is not funny
06:30 - the death Arrow are really strong
06:37 - though and you see if I don't have the
06:39 - item it'll say wait before using this
06:41 - item cuz I'm clicking two right now to
06:42 - activate the death Arrow oh gosh I'm
06:44 - about to
06:48 - lose oh no I lost wait I'll I'll pause
06:50 - it and I'll get there real
06:52 - quick as you can see I just beat the old
06:55 - one again and then the mysterious man
06:57 - just healed me again so I'm close to
07:00 - this time I'm going to beat him
07:04 - [Music]
07:11 - bro okay the zombie King's out second
07:14 - attempt let's see I got Griffin out it's
07:17 - really strong I have all my death arrows
07:18 - I'm spamming him right now oh no he's
07:21 - stealing my health it's all right I have
07:24 - oh I'm out of death arrows oh no still
07:27 - 18,000 I'm going to use all my spal
07:29 - arrows right
07:31 - now okay all right we won this time
07:34 - there's no way there's no way his peons
07:36 - aren't strong enough Griffin come down
07:38 - let's go you stealing my lives aren't
07:40 - going to do anything
07:43 - sir okay let's go let's go let's go this
07:47 - guy's
07:49 - low Griffin all right this should be my
07:52 - last Griffin oh gosh one
07:55 - more oh and I killed him just like that
07:59 - so so there's the you win and that's
08:01 - when you beat the zombie King and of
08:02 - course there's also a game over once you
08:04 - lose and uh you can't use two third
08:08 - abilities at the same time or else uh it
08:12 - it won't work cuz there's an in progress
08:13 - function so yeah so those are the three
08:17 - Heroes and the ending so that's the
08:20 - three Heroes and of course um it's
08:22 - probably beable it's it's beatable by
08:24 - every single hero because I've beat it
08:26 - before but uh fairy queen just takes a
08:28 - lot more skill but it's really good so
08:30 - that's basically it for this video it's
08:31 - just the demo part one is going to come
08:33 - out soon as well as the other parts so
08:35 - stay tuned for that anyway see you guys
08:38 - next
