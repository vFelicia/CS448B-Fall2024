01:06 - get to the video uh demo so um
01:09 - yeah so sentinel i don't
01:12 - i think he's a bad guy and you have to
01:15 - throw space and throw his shield and
01:17 - dash and kill all
01:19 - um there's no score so you can counter
01:22 - because it's a simple adventures game
01:24 - and um you don't die
01:26 - so that's pretty cool and you can also
01:29 - dash with the um
01:31 - right arrow key uh throw shields of
01:34 - space
01:34 - and whatever they touch you would die as
01:36 - well
01:36 - [Music]

02:35 - yeah so i really really
02:38 - really really really um
02:42 - appreciate that so

02:47 - comments i don't have much time so
02:50 - uh anyways let's get right into the
02:53 - video
02:54 - so um let's make a new project
03:00 - all the sprites are the links in
03:01 - description if you're doing something
03:03 - wrong you can
03:04 - watch our google drive video so we have
03:06 - cap
03:08 - captain america sentinel
03:12 - and the shield that captain america
03:13 - throws so we have all of these things
03:15 - you can download links in description
03:17 - google drive yeah you can get that
03:18 - so um yeah and
03:21 - on if you're doing something wrong watch
03:23 - our video
03:24 - it's on it's on our channel how to
03:26 - access google drive and do not use your
03:28 - school account use your main account
03:31 - since sentinel was already in my
03:33 - backpack it was already done all this
03:35 - stuff
03:35 - so remember guys put on rotation left
03:38 - right so i'm gonna show this
03:39 - it was pointing to the right side
03:41 - instead of the left side so
03:44 - turn on that and make it negative 90
03:46 - degrees so
03:47 - yeah um let's get let's get to it
03:50 - so uh let's start on sentinel
03:54 - so i actually can get the backdrop first
03:56 - that's the most easiest
03:58 - that's a task that needs to be done um
04:03 - i think this is called stars not sure
04:06 - yeah yeah it's called stars
04:08 - so i'm also going to name this project
04:12 - i named it captain america game so
04:16 - yeah a captain america game
04:24 - captain america okay
04:30 - so yeah i'm gonna do captain america
04:34 - not sentinel so when the green flag is
04:36 - clicked
04:38 - uh hide
04:42 - forever
04:46 - it'll create clone of myself
04:49 - which is sentinel well not me and it'll
04:52 - wait
04:53 - i'll pick random seconds before spawns
04:55 - another one so
04:58 - i'm going to pick random of 0.5 to one
05:02 - side
05:02 - sentinel so yeah and then we have
05:06 - cap we have sentinel uh
05:09 - so we have to make the code for sentinel
05:12 - so when i start as a clone because we
05:15 - always need that
05:16 - and it will switch costume to costume
05:19 - sentinel one
05:20 - because that's the first costume when it
05:23 - not dies
05:24 - there's one two three
05:27 - that's when he's dying and
05:31 - it'll go to a random position
05:36 - set x to 175
05:39 - so let's drag that block in for school
05:41 - so
05:42 - 176 right now so 175 same thing but
05:45 - whatever
05:46 - um show
05:51 - um repeat until touching edge
06:01 - uh move one step
06:07 - and you need to if then so
06:10 - if then the it's touching
06:14 - the shield or cap because of the dash so
06:17 - shield or cap
06:32 - shield or cat so yeah capper shield i
06:36 - did capper ship
06:37 - so let's put that in there and switch
06:39 - costume to sentinel 2
06:42 - so when he gets attacked by
06:46 - the shield or cap and i'll wait 0.2
06:49 - seconds
06:56 - and then there's also delete this clone
07:02 - and delete this clone
07:06 - and then next we're going to work on cap
07:08 - so cat
07:09 - we have
07:12 - so um demo the game for you right now
07:19 - oh we got sentinels
07:23 - they're coming in hot
07:26 - so yeah that's basically what we have
07:28 - right now no we have cap
07:30 - so we have to code someone cap and then
07:32 - we have to code some of the shield so
07:34 - it'll be like a part of cat part of
07:37 - shield part of cap so that's basically
07:39 - what we're gonna do
07:39 - and it'll go to the position i already
07:41 - have it at because that's what it always
07:43 - does no no no
07:44 - actually the y is different but whatever
07:46 - it doesn't matter
07:48 - i'm gonna switch costume to cat
07:52 - one
07:56 - and then so one two
07:59 - three yeah you basically cap dash one
08:01 - you basically get the point and
08:03 - there's like throw shield so yeah that's
08:05 - basically what we have
08:06 - let's switch costume to one cat cat one
08:09 - and then go
08:10 - forever that you know
08:13 - if you need it if then
08:18 - you need an up arrow key
08:20 - [Music]
08:24 - press then it will change y by five
08:33 - duplicate that let's do the down arrow
08:36 - key
08:37 - which is negative five so
08:41 - minus five and then
08:44 - duplicate again but we gotta change the
08:46 - y to x instead
08:48 - but oh actually we have the right arrow
08:50 - we don't we have the right arrow for um
08:53 - the dash so we actually don't need that
08:55 - we just need to broadcast dash
08:59 - and wait
09:06 - dash
09:08 - and we also have to do uh when the
09:12 - space arrow key is pressed
09:16 - no wait until
09:19 - space t not space arrow key
09:22 - and then we gotta wait until not key
09:24 - press so
09:27 - not not a key space press so
09:32 - that will wait until it won't click
09:41 - oh yeah we knew we didn't wait until
09:43 - sorry guys sorry guys
09:44 - not a wait just to wait until um
09:48 - yeah wait until not key space press
09:52 - so let's put that in not key space
09:55 - pressed over here and then instead of
09:57 - broadcast dash you'll be broadcast
09:59 - throw so
10:03 - let's work on the shield now so the
10:06 - shield
10:07 - so when the green slack is clicked it
10:09 - always has to hide because you didn't do
10:11 - anything with the shield yet so
10:13 - you always have to make it hide so yeah
10:16 - and when i receive throw
10:23 - then i'll go to cap
10:29 - go to cap and then it'll
10:32 - show
10:35 - and it'll repeat until
10:39 - touching sentinel so repeat until
10:42 - you know or
10:46 - sentinel
10:52 - signal or touching edge
10:57 - so repeat until it'll move 10 steps
11:02 - hi didn't go to cap so go back to the
11:05 - captain
11:06 - america after when you're done throwing
11:08 - the shield
11:12 - so yeah um put a cap
11:15 - right there cap and there we go so we're
11:18 - gonna work on the captain america
11:20 - again so i'm gonna work on the throw up
11:22 - her cap
11:23 - so um zoom one out i think that's gonna
11:26 - be better uh
11:28 - so when i received throw
11:32 - a switch costing me cap five
11:36 - well it's always 14 cap not cap dash
11:40 - it's just cat
11:41 - five let's get five i thinks
11:46 - and then repeat ten
11:51 - next costume
11:58 - weight 0.05
12:06 - the reason why we have to repeat 10 but
12:08 - i'm gonna finish this real quick switch
12:10 - costume back to cap
12:11 - one so finish this block
12:15 - so the reason why we have to do repeat
12:16 - 10
12:18 - and be between 5 cap 5 to cap
12:22 - 20 cap 14 there's 10 costumes
12:26 - so one two three four five six
12:29 - seven eight nine ten eleven
12:32 - ten yeah ten just ten so that's why um
12:35 - and yeah so
12:36 - we have to do when i receive dash
12:41 - and demo this real quick to show you so
12:44 - the throw is with the bam
12:46 - bam with the the space key so
12:50 - um yeah i'm moving around and like
12:54 - okay yeah so let's work on the dash next
12:56 - um yeah
12:58 - i i noticed that the captain america
13:00 - shields only single target so
13:01 - the dash is all targets so then when i
13:05 - receive
13:05 - dash repeat until touching edge
13:13 - touching edge so keep on going until on
13:16 - the captain america touches the edge
13:18 - and then i'll move ten steps
13:22 - and go back to the position i already
13:23 - have a mat
13:26 - and then when i receive dash
13:31 - i receive dash let's switch costume to
13:34 - cap dash one
13:38 - cap dash not cat one cat dash so
13:41 - um a repeat ten
13:47 - so you can make it nine for y for if you
13:50 - want to do it on the center but i
13:52 - i already have them at this spot so why
13:53 - not um
13:56 - but we also have to change the
14:00 - this is negative six so you gotta match
14:02 - it together so that also has to be
14:04 - negative 16.
14:05 - uh or this can be negative 36 so
14:09 - let's make this negative 16 i mean 36.
14:14 - so get that now let's do when i receive
14:18 - switch cost me the cap dash repeat 10
14:21 - times
14:22 - i already have that uh next costume
14:27 - and weight zero 0.05 seconds
14:34 - i um and switch costume
14:37 - to cap dash just cap one not cap dash
14:40 - switch costume to cat one and we also
14:44 - have to add the music and then we'll
14:45 - that'll be the done we'll be done with
14:47 - this so when the green flag is clicked
14:52 - so the reason why i decided to always
14:55 - use this set
14:58 - a volume to 25 is because i don't want
15:01 - it to
15:01 - that loud then you can hear me so um we
15:04 - also have to have a forever loop
15:06 - and ever and ever and i'll play sound
15:09 - this sound i have
15:11 - movie two i already memorized it i think
15:14 - at least
15:14 - i think it's movie one
15:18 - uh yeah so this is the cool music so
15:20 - please sound
15:21 - movie too until done

cool at the same time please make a game on the avengers at all thomas ali says a h i one seven freestyles freestyler said can you do a tutorial of making avengers end game animation on scratch he said animation but um we'll do uh a game so this dude has come this five months ago so that was pretty long so anyways um i'm gonna get to the video uh demo so um yeah so sentinel i don't i think he's a bad guy and you have to throw space and throw his shield and dash and kill all um there's no score so you can counter because it's a simple adventures game and um you don't die so that's pretty cool and you can also dash with the um right arrow key uh throw shields of space and whatever they touch you would die as well like that oh my god i feel all of it great okay so uh let's get right into the

really um appreciate that so i i can only reply to around three comments i don't have much time so uh anyways let's get right into the video so um let's make a new project all the sprites are the links in description if you're doing something wrong you can watch our google drive video so we have cap captain america sentinel and the shield that captain america throws so we have all of these things you can download links in description google drive yeah you can get that so um yeah and on if you're doing something wrong watch our video it's on it's on our channel how to access google drive and do not use your school account use your main account since sentinel was already in my backpack it was already done all this stuff so remember guys put on rotation left right so i'm gonna show this it was pointing to the right side instead of the left side so turn on that and make it negative 90 degrees so yeah um let's get let's get to it so uh let's start on sentinel so i actually can get the backdrop first that's the most easiest that's a task that needs to be done um i think this is called stars not sure yeah yeah it's called stars so i'm also going to name this project i named it captain america game so yeah a captain america game captain america okay so yeah i'm gonna do captain america not sentinel so when the green flag is clicked uh hide forever it'll create clone of myself which is sentinel well not me and it'll wait i'll pick random seconds before spawns another one so i'm going to pick random of 0.5 to one side sentinel so yeah and then we have cap we have sentinel uh so we have to make the code for sentinel so when i start as a clone because we always need that and it will switch costume to costume sentinel one because that's the first costume when it not dies there's one two three that's when he's dying and it'll go to a random position set x to 175 so let's drag that block in for school so 176 right now so 175 same thing but whatever um show um repeat until touching edge uh move one step and you need to if then so if then the it's touching the shield or cap because of the dash so shield or cap shield or cat so yeah capper shield i did capper ship so let's put that in there and switch costume to sentinel 2 so when he gets attacked by the shield or cap and i'll wait 0.2 seconds and then there's also delete this clone and delete this clone and then next we're going to work on cap so cat we have so um demo the game for you right now oh we got sentinels they're coming in hot so yeah that's basically what we have right now no we have cap so we have to code someone cap and then we have to code some of the shield so it'll be like a part of cat part of shield part of cap so that's basically what we're gonna do and it'll go to the position i already have it at because that's what it always does no no no actually the y is different but whatever it doesn't matter i'm gonna switch costume to cat one and then so one two three yeah you basically cap dash one you basically get the point and there's like throw shield so yeah that's basically what we have let's switch costume to one cat cat one and then go forever that you know if you need it if then you need an up arrow key press then it will change y by five duplicate that let's do the down arrow key which is negative five so minus five and then duplicate again but we gotta change the y to x instead but oh actually we have the right arrow we don't we have the right arrow for um the dash so we actually don't need that we just need to broadcast dash and wait dash and we also have to do uh when the space arrow key is pressed no wait until space t not space arrow key and then we gotta wait until not key press so not not a key space press so that will wait until it won't click oh yeah we knew we didn't wait until sorry guys sorry guys not a wait just to wait until um yeah wait until not key space press so let's put that in not key space pressed over here and then instead of broadcast dash you'll be broadcast throw so let's work on the shield now so the shield so when the green slack is clicked it always has to hide because you didn't do anything with the shield yet so you always have to make it hide so yeah and when i receive throw then i'll go to cap go to cap and then it'll show and it'll repeat until touching sentinel so repeat until you know or sentinel signal or touching edge so repeat until it'll move 10 steps hi didn't go to cap so go back to the captain america after when you're done throwing the shield so yeah um put a cap right there cap and there we go so we're gonna work on the captain america again so i'm gonna work on the throw up her cap so um zoom one out i think that's gonna be better uh so when i received throw a switch costing me cap five well it's always 14 cap not cap dash it's just cat five let's get five i thinks and then repeat ten next costume weight 0.05 the reason why we have to repeat 10 but i'm gonna finish this real quick switch costume back to cap one so finish this block so the reason why we have to do repeat 10 and be between 5 cap 5 to cap 20 cap 14 there's 10 costumes so one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven ten yeah ten just ten so that's why um and yeah so we have to do when i receive dash and demo this real quick to show you so the throw is with the bam bam with the the space key so um yeah i'm moving around and like okay yeah so let's work on the dash next um yeah i i noticed that the captain america shields only single target so the dash is all targets so then when i receive dash repeat until touching edge touching edge so keep on going until on the captain america touches the edge and then i'll move ten steps and go back to the position i already have a mat and then when i receive dash i receive dash let's switch costume to cap dash one cap dash not cat one cat dash so um a repeat ten so you can make it nine for y for if you want to do it on the center but i i already have them at this spot so why not um but we also have to change the this is negative six so you gotta match it together so that also has to be negative 16. uh or this can be negative 36 so let's make this negative 16 i mean 36. so get that now let's do when i receive switch cost me the cap dash repeat 10 times i already have that uh next costume and weight zero 0.05 seconds i um and switch costume to cap dash just cap one not cap dash switch costume to cat one and we also have to add the music and then we'll that'll be the done we'll be done with this so when the green flag is clicked so the reason why i decided to always use this set a volume to 25 is because i don't want it to that loud then you can hear me so um we also have to have a forever loop and ever and ever and i'll play sound this sound i have movie two i already memorized it i think at least i think it's movie one uh yeah so this is the cool music so please sound movie too until done oh um
