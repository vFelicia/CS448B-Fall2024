02:47 - i'll pick this one
02:51 - [Music]
03:03 - okay so now let's pick another issue
03:06 - so this is um so basically the point of
03:09 - the game is just to like
03:10 - answer questions present ideas and stuff
03:13 - like that um
03:14 - so i'm actually gonna like um skip this
03:17 - area i'm gonna finish

03:21 - house
03:21 - part so i'm done answering all the
03:24 - questions and i
03:25 - picked all my issues so i'm just gonna i
03:27 - just picked a random one
03:28 - okay a random slogan or whatever so
03:31 - let's just finish this
03:32 - so i just finished the profile and now
03:36 - uh yes i know how to do this so you're
03:38 - just gonna launch the campaign
03:41 - so this is the convention so um now i'm
03:44 - just gonna
03:44 - pick uh i'm just gonna select this one
03:46 - whatever my bike
03:48 - um and after this we're gonna have to go
03:51 - to the white house
03:53 - the voting area
03:56 - [Music]
03:58 - my butt so this is the republican party
04:01 - and i picked the
04:02 - democratic party so this is the other
04:04 - convention
04:04 - [Applause]
04:06 - [Music]
04:08 - okay so this is week one so what you're
04:10 - supposed to do is first get
04:12 - funding you're first supposed to get
04:15 - funding fundraiser
04:16 - so then for fundraiser you're supposed
04:18 - to pick the one with like high value or
04:20 - something like texas or something
04:22 - so you when you use fundraising you get
04:24 - these points right here
04:26 - and then you use the points to do these
04:28 - different things
04:30 - so the more points you have the more
04:32 - actions you can do
04:34 - so now i have three points that means i
04:36 - can do all of these
04:38 - so now the opponent will be trying to
04:40 - get funding as well
04:42 - so let's try doing media okay let's just
04:44 - pick
04:46 - a state like pennsylvania okay so now
04:49 - you have to answer questions so
04:50 - supported issues i'm gonna
04:51 - pick this one run the campaign and then
04:54 - you're supposed to answer questions
04:56 - um so i'm gonna pick this one because i
04:58 - think that's the right one
05:00 - as you can see you get it right so
05:01 - you're supposed to pick the right um
05:03 - answer and then it's a sad day for the
05:06 - rep
05:08 - so now i have control over here so now
05:10 - as you can see
05:12 - everything you use breaking news so now
05:15 - um let's try to appearance i guess so
05:17 - select
05:18 - uh new york um
05:21 - so you're supposed to select another one
05:23 - let's like usually supposed to
05:25 - select uh supporting issues so i'm gonna
05:28 - select this one because i also have this
05:30 - one so i'm
05:31 - gonna do this so
05:35 - federal funding for education so you
05:38 - want to do more
05:39 - educational stuff so let's find that
05:42 - so i'm pretty sure it's this one so
05:44 - let's give the speech
05:46 - as you can see i got it correct so
05:48 - [Music]
05:49 - the democrats are doing really well as
05:52 - you can see so
05:54 - the more you do it the more um like you
05:56 - can you're just trying to like control
05:58 - different states and stuff like that
05:59 - today's efforts on the campaign trail
06:01 - um what else so now we're polling so
06:03 - just to select a state that you have not
06:05 - pulled yet
06:11 - as you can see most of them in georgia
06:13 - are popular to democratic so
06:16 - that's the opponent's turn
06:23 - okay so we are losing right now as you
06:26 - can see they have more points than us
06:34 - okay so now we're winning because if
06:36 - your popularity is
06:38 - so the to win the white house you have
06:40 - to get 270 electoral
06:42 - votes like in real life so you always
06:45 - have to use
06:45 - fundraising first to get these points is
06:48 - fundraising california you need to be in
06:50 - the league
06:51 - um i have to
06:58 - fundraise here i guess you have to have
07:00 - like a state that's supporting you i
07:01 - guess
07:02 - in order to get the points
07:04 - [Music]
07:06 - you have to have a state that's
07:07 - supporting you to get more points so
07:10 - let's do a media
07:11 - on here so then we can take california
07:13 - back so there's a
07:15 - supporting issues or these um
07:19 - i have none of these so i'm just gonna
07:20 - do oh yeah i have one of them yeah let's
07:22 - do
07:23 - global cooperation so
07:26 - america is stronger than this one
07:29 - cooperate
07:29 - cooperation gets more back so as you can
07:32 - see televising the ad
07:35 - the democrats are doing really well at
07:37 - their latest
07:44 - the republic so now
