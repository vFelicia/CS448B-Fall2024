00:03 - [Music]
00:09 - hello guys welcome back to kids calling
00:11 - playground
00:12 - so today will be the first video of
00:15 - us introducing uh python so uh in python
00:19 - you can either use like a pycharm
00:23 - like a editor ide to do it or you can go
00:26 - to this
00:27 - website trinket.io uh basically it's
00:31 - like
00:31 - you know scratch you do it online where
00:34 - you know you can call everything on the
00:37 - browser so this is what uh trinket io is
00:40 - so it's a similar thing
00:42 - uh you can sign up for a free account
00:44 - just use your google account and connect
00:46 - to it
00:47 - and uh it's pretty easy all right so so
00:50 - once you get there to the
00:52 - to the site you can just click on sign
00:54 - in with google
00:55 - so after you click on that it will
00:57 - create an account for you and then you
00:59 - can
00:59 - edit your code there
01:03 - so uh let's go there for now
01:07 - okay this is a trinket.io
01:10 - if you go over here you can say uh login
01:15 - uh and then you can click on this like
01:17 - here they have like a
01:18 - google account that you have um you know
01:21 - your personal google account
01:22 - just click on this it'll create the
01:24 - account for you
01:31 - okay so once you get on to here you'll
01:34 - see
01:34 - like uh you know coding uh it has like a
01:37 - total in space this is like a
01:40 - example project they had and the bird
01:42 - box and some other snowflakes so
01:44 - basically you can use you can look into
01:47 - this
01:48 - cold and try to you know do the project
01:50 - it'll show you how it works
01:53 - these are using turtle so basically
01:55 - turtle is a graphic
01:56 - uh tool library that you can use with a
02:00 - python where you can create you know
02:03 - graphics
02:04 - uh putting like pictures and stuff like
02:07 - that like a pen
02:08 - kind of like in scratch you use pen to
02:10 - draw so in python you use the turtle
02:12 - library
02:14 - okay so once you get into here
02:16 - [Music]
02:18 - okay once you log in here you can click
02:21 - home
02:22 - here after you click home
02:25 - you can see this new trinket so you can
02:28 - click that down
02:29 - these ones are locked so you have to
02:31 - actually pay for them
02:34 - so for now we're going to use python the
02:37 - the basic one
02:38 - um you know maybe later we can go into
02:41 - like using pycharm ideas and
02:43 - i'll show you at the end of the video so
02:45 - uh for now we'll go to here
02:48 - okay once you go in here um you know all
02:51 - the
02:51 - uh project usually you start with is the
02:54 - hello world project
02:56 - uh so that's what we're going to do uh
02:58 - so this is our hello world project so in
03:01 - python um
03:03 - you can um you can just type in like
03:05 - print or something like let's say you
03:07 - want to print something on the screen
03:08 - right
03:09 - just say print and then you put
03:13 - hello world so let's say this is the uh
03:18 - this is your your code here on this side
03:21 - and this is
03:22 - kind of like the stage like imagine if
03:24 - you're doing scratch right this will be
03:26 - the left side
03:26 - will be the block right where you do the
03:28 - block and this is the stage on the right
03:30 - so you click on this run button so when
03:33 - you run it
03:33 - it will say hello world so whatever you
03:35 - type here the code here
03:37 - it will execute the code will be on this
03:39 - side
03:40 - okay so let's say we want to print you
03:43 - know
03:44 - let's say kids coding
03:49 - playground so we do that
03:52 - so the hello world will no longer be
03:54 - there right because we just replaced it
03:56 - right
03:56 - so if you run this again you'll see kids
03:58 - calling playground one here on the side
04:00 - here
04:01 - okay so let's say you know we want to
04:03 - try to learn
04:05 - like let's say we draw a little figure
04:07 - right
04:09 - so you can copy and paste right ctrl c
04:12 - ctrl v just highlighted
04:14 - let's say we draw the little dog okay
04:20 - okay so you can use a single quote or
04:23 - double quote
04:24 - in in here that's fine so we use single
04:26 - quote and you have to using
04:28 - code on this side okay and you can have
04:30 - a semicolon also at the end if you like
04:33 - um you know like java another one a
04:35 - little kind of language you always have
04:37 - semicolon in
04:38 - in python you know you might not need it
04:40 - that's fine but you can put it either
04:42 - way that's fine
04:43 - so in here let's say we want to make the
04:46 - little dog with the legs
04:48 - um we're going to put a space let's say
04:53 - oops i want to pipe down
04:56 - okay something like this right so if i
04:58 - run this
04:59 - i will see like kids calling playground
05:01 - and then like a little dog figure right
05:03 - so let's try that so as you can see you
05:06 - can
05:06 - draw the little dog figure let's say we
05:09 - want to draw something like
05:11 - you know let's say we want to print a
05:13 - space right
05:14 - let's see
05:16 - [Music]
05:17 - okay let's say we print this
05:21 - and then we do something else at the
05:23 - bottom
05:25 - right let's say testing
05:30 - and we'll run this you see you can put a
05:32 - gap here right if you want to put a gap
05:34 - in between
05:35 - you can do that okay so let's say we
05:38 - want to draw something else like a
05:40 - little man
05:41 - so for this one okay
05:44 - let's say put an o here right
05:48 - i'm still putting a double chord i guess
05:50 - that because i'm uh
05:51 - i work in java so that's my background
05:54 - so
05:54 - we usually use double quote so um but
05:57 - either way it will work
05:59 - so let's say you do the little man
06:03 - so for this since uh this
06:06 - on this one is this escape character so
06:08 - if you want to
06:10 - print something called escape character
06:12 - like a slash
06:13 - here it's forward slash you have to have
06:15 - actually two slash in the
06:17 - in the front okay and then let's say we
06:20 - do one
06:20 - and then we do a back slash here okay
06:24 - so this is like we're trying to make the
06:27 - hand right for the uh for the low man
06:30 - so we're gonna put one more here we'll
06:34 - put the feet
06:36 - okay i'm gonna delete this we'll put a
06:39 - space
06:40 - and then we have to use the slash again
06:44 - here okay so when we run this actually
06:47 - you will only see
06:48 - one okay and then here you only see one
06:50 - as well
06:51 - so let's say we run this right
06:55 - oh you see i haven't lined up my main
06:58 - the head
06:58 - let me do that one space one space
07:02 - okay and run it again so if you can see
07:05 - kind of like a little man
07:06 - right also uh it's pretty cool uh in
07:10 - scratch
07:11 - [Music]
07:14 - okay so uh let's say you want to do some
07:17 - kind of uh
07:18 - like numbers you can add numbers but
07:21 - also
07:21 - it's one cool thing in python you can
07:23 - actually uh like
07:24 - let's say you have a symbol and you want
07:26 - to like create a bunch of symbol
07:28 - you can actually do this like print and
07:31 - then let's say we want to put the uh
07:34 - the ascent right the send is all you
07:36 - remember then we did one of the video
07:38 - with the
07:38 - uh with the coin matching game so you
07:41 - say oh
07:42 - zero one six two so it actually creates
07:46 - a send symbol
07:47 - let's say we want the cent we want like
07:49 - five of these
07:50 - then you can say multiply
07:53 - with a star and then you say five so
07:56 - when you actually run this
07:58 - so the semicolon at the end is optional
08:00 - you can put it or not it doesn't matter
08:03 - uh so in python you just have to indent
08:06 - if you want to be like in the loop or
08:08 - something we'll go into that next time
08:10 - so let's let's run this so you see
08:12 - actually create five of the cents
08:15 - so actually pretty cool so uh even
08:17 - though it's like
08:18 - you thought it would be a multiplication
08:20 - but uh somehow he actually
08:21 - understand that so if you're using this
08:23 - symbol with this five you're actually
08:26 - trying to
08:26 - create five of these guys so let's say
08:29 - we want
08:30 - print
08:33 - let's do one right one let's say one
08:36 - plus
08:37 - four let's see what happened
08:41 - so you see you can add it up and if you
08:44 - actually do a
08:45 - multiply with the let's say five times
08:50 - two right let's make one here let's run
08:54 - this
08:55 - so we actually put 10 you see that so
08:57 - this is multiplication
08:58 - right addition and then
09:02 - this actually creates five of the
09:04 - symbols so this is like your little
09:07 - uh introduction to python
09:10 - but you can do a lot of stuff like like
09:12 - using the turtle
09:14 - library we can go into like you can put
09:16 - like a stem
09:18 - i like similar to scratch you can stamp
09:21 - icon
09:22 - on the screen and uh in pycharm
09:25 - also like i have a pycharm also loaded
09:27 - so this is like taichung
09:29 - i'll run this program for you this is
09:31 - like using turtle with the
09:32 - color and you can actually make some
09:37 - shapes here so you could run let's run
09:40 - the app
09:41 - i actually have it on the other side how
09:43 - to bring it over
09:45 - so as you can see uh actually uh i had
09:48 - to bring this uh
09:49 - window over it's actually on the other
09:51 - side so as you can see uh using this
09:53 - turtle
09:54 - library you can actually mix color
09:57 - and then you can look to this color um
10:00 - different color here and then you have
10:02 - uh keep on drawing
10:04 - this other little
10:07 - hexagon you know with the color so
10:10 - it's pretty cool i mean this is like one
10:12 - of the things that you could do and then
10:14 - you can draw some turtle
10:16 - and other little things all right so
10:18 - we'll stop here for now
10:21 - and um okay so we'll stop here for now
10:25 - and uh thanks for
10:26 - um you guys for watching and please like
10:29 - share and subscribe to our channel
10:31 - and i will create more uh you know a
10:33 - python video later on
10:35 - okay all right guys see you guys next
10:39 - [Music]
10:44 - time
10:47 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome back to kids calling playground so today will be the first video of us introducing uh python so uh in python you can either use like a pycharm like a editor ide to do it or you can go to this website trinket.io uh basically it's like you know scratch you do it online where you know you can call everything on the browser so this is what uh trinket io is so it's a similar thing uh you can sign up for a free account just use your google account and connect to it and uh it's pretty easy all right so so once you get there to the to the site you can just click on sign in with google so after you click on that it will create an account for you and then you can edit your code there so uh let's go there for now okay this is a trinket.io if you go over here you can say uh login uh and then you can click on this like here they have like a google account that you have um you know your personal google account just click on this it'll create the account for you okay so once you get on to here you'll see like uh you know coding uh it has like a total in space this is like a example project they had and the bird box and some other snowflakes so basically you can use you can look into this cold and try to you know do the project it'll show you how it works these are using turtle so basically turtle is a graphic uh tool library that you can use with a python where you can create you know graphics uh putting like pictures and stuff like that like a pen kind of like in scratch you use pen to draw so in python you use the turtle library okay so once you get into here okay once you log in here you can click home here after you click home you can see this new trinket so you can click that down these ones are locked so you have to actually pay for them so for now we're going to use python the the basic one um you know maybe later we can go into like using pycharm ideas and i'll show you at the end of the video so uh for now we'll go to here okay once you go in here um you know all the uh project usually you start with is the hello world project uh so that's what we're going to do uh so this is our hello world project so in python um you can um you can just type in like print or something like let's say you want to print something on the screen right just say print and then you put hello world so let's say this is the uh this is your your code here on this side and this is kind of like the stage like imagine if you're doing scratch right this will be the left side will be the block right where you do the block and this is the stage on the right so you click on this run button so when you run it it will say hello world so whatever you type here the code here it will execute the code will be on this side okay so let's say we want to print you know let's say kids coding playground so we do that so the hello world will no longer be there right because we just replaced it right so if you run this again you'll see kids calling playground one here on the side here okay so let's say you know we want to try to learn like let's say we draw a little figure right so you can copy and paste right ctrl c ctrl v just highlighted let's say we draw the little dog okay okay so you can use a single quote or double quote in in here that's fine so we use single quote and you have to using code on this side okay and you can have a semicolon also at the end if you like um you know like java another one a little kind of language you always have semicolon in in python you know you might not need it that's fine but you can put it either way that's fine so in here let's say we want to make the little dog with the legs um we're going to put a space let's say oops i want to pipe down okay something like this right so if i run this i will see like kids calling playground and then like a little dog figure right so let's try that so as you can see you can draw the little dog figure let's say we want to draw something like you know let's say we want to print a space right let's see okay let's say we print this and then we do something else at the bottom right let's say testing and we'll run this you see you can put a gap here right if you want to put a gap in between you can do that okay so let's say we want to draw something else like a little man so for this one okay let's say put an o here right i'm still putting a double chord i guess that because i'm uh i work in java so that's my background so we usually use double quote so um but either way it will work so let's say you do the little man so for this since uh this on this one is this escape character so if you want to print something called escape character like a slash here it's forward slash you have to have actually two slash in the in the front okay and then let's say we do one and then we do a back slash here okay so this is like we're trying to make the hand right for the uh for the low man so we're gonna put one more here we'll put the feet okay i'm gonna delete this we'll put a space and then we have to use the slash again here okay so when we run this actually you will only see one okay and then here you only see one as well so let's say we run this right oh you see i haven't lined up my main the head let me do that one space one space okay and run it again so if you can see kind of like a little man right also uh it's pretty cool uh in scratch okay so uh let's say you want to do some kind of uh like numbers you can add numbers but also it's one cool thing in python you can actually uh like let's say you have a symbol and you want to like create a bunch of symbol you can actually do this like print and then let's say we want to put the uh the ascent right the send is all you remember then we did one of the video with the uh with the coin matching game so you say oh zero one six two so it actually creates a send symbol let's say we want the cent we want like five of these then you can say multiply with a star and then you say five so when you actually run this so the semicolon at the end is optional you can put it or not it doesn't matter uh so in python you just have to indent if you want to be like in the loop or something we'll go into that next time so let's let's run this so you see actually create five of the cents so actually pretty cool so uh even though it's like you thought it would be a multiplication but uh somehow he actually understand that so if you're using this symbol with this five you're actually trying to create five of these guys so let's say we want print let's do one right one let's say one plus four let's see what happened so you see you can add it up and if you actually do a multiply with the let's say five times two right let's make one here let's run this so we actually put 10 you see that so this is multiplication right addition and then this actually creates five of the symbols so this is like your little uh introduction to python but you can do a lot of stuff like like using the turtle library we can go into like you can put like a stem i like similar to scratch you can stamp icon on the screen and uh in pycharm also like i have a pycharm also loaded so this is like

you can look to this color um different color here and then you have uh keep on drawing this other little hexagon you know with the color so it's pretty cool i mean this is like one of the things that you could do and then you can draw some turtle and other little things all right so we'll stop here for now and um okay so we'll stop here for now and uh thanks for um you guys for watching and please like share and subscribe to our channel and i will create more uh you know a python video later on okay all right guys see you guys next time you
