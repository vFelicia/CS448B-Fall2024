00:21 - for memorial day so let's
00:24 - see it
00:27 - [Music]
00:29 - to play some music there's cloud fighter
00:32 - jets and two
00:33 - little army soldiers and a flag
00:36 - [Music]
00:37 - this is
00:44 - at least i know i'm free
00:47 - and i won't forget the men
00:51 - who died who gave
00:54 - that right to me it doesn't happen
00:57 - memorial day
00:58 - and this is just a nice animation you
01:00 - can shoot if your grandfather or
01:02 - your father is a veteran so yeah um
01:06 - yeah thank you for all the uh troops and
01:10 - the things that saved america so um
01:13 - in my original project i actually had
01:18 - god bless america and
01:21 - amazing grace but i used god bless
01:24 - america on my original project
01:26 - but i'm pretty sure youtube will give me
01:28 - a copyright strike if i
01:30 - actually play it on the video because
01:33 - it's copyrighted and
01:35 - you can if you want these sounds instead
01:37 - of the scratch sound
01:38 - you can go to our project and export the
01:41 - sounds
01:44 - so yeah
01:49 - so yeah export there's the button yeah
01:52 - right click
01:54 - and export the sound
01:58 - so yeah anyways um let's get started
02:06 - okay
02:11 - so um let's get started we do not need
02:13 - the scratch cat so
02:15 - yeah with the paint some clouds
02:20 - so i did not upload the backpack so it's
02:23 - just white
02:25 - and we got to make an
02:30 - oval shape on
02:33 - one of the sides let's do that whatever
02:37 - so yeah so let's make up we have to make
02:40 - an oval shape on this
02:41 - side around that big
02:45 - i can't see a thing i should upload the
02:47 - backdrop to see if this is large enough
02:51 - and then make another oval
02:56 - about that big so here's cloud number
02:59 - one
03:01 - and you just move this one across to
03:05 - this side and
03:06 - you got cloud number two and then you
03:09 - can duplicate that again
03:11 - and ctrl c ctrl v the this one
03:15 - and you can put it over here so there we
03:17 - go three types of clouds and let's just
03:22 - get the backdrop blue sky
03:29 - so you can actually see it i'll decrease
03:32 - the size later
03:34 - or yeah let's decrease the size later so
03:37 - now
03:42 - i'm just going to make these smaller
03:44 - because i don't think of my original
03:45 - project i decreased them
03:47 - i'm just gonna make them just a little
03:49 - bit smaller
03:56 - so yeah uh i think there's the right
03:59 - size almost
04:01 - just gonna make this one a little bit
04:02 - smaller
04:05 - and there we go we got some clouds
04:09 - so now we're gonna work on the clouds so
04:11 - when the green slag is clicked
04:17 - go hide
04:22 - go forever create 0.9
04:27 - weight 0.5 seconds
04:32 - and create clone of myself
04:38 - so when you get to create when i start
04:39 - as a clone of scent size
04:43 - to um
04:46 - a pick random size because some clouds
04:49 - are larger than others if you didn't
04:50 - know
04:51 - you've probably seen the sky before so
04:52 - yeah you guys
04:54 - cassette size pick random
04:59 - 50 to a hundred percent
05:04 - some clouds are larger than others so
05:07 - now it'll said ghost effect because
05:08 - clouds have a faint color they're not
05:10 - colored to clear
05:12 - so it'll set ghost color set
05:16 - ghost
05:20 - effect to 50. so it'll be faded
05:24 - and it'll switch costume to pick random
05:27 - one to three so it depends which costume
05:30 - you're gonna put
05:36 - so and now we're going to put a go to
05:43 - go to x
05:47 - negative 200
05:50 - and pick random 75 to 100
05:55 - random 75
05:59 - to
06:04 - 150.
06:06 - so now we have the x and y like where
06:08 - it's gonna glide and everything so we're
06:10 - gonna finish this
06:12 - we're gonna have a show and we're gonna
06:14 - have a repeat until
06:23 - uh we have x position
06:26 - is greater than
06:32 - 250. which is right here
06:37 - if it's greater than 250 around here
06:40 - then it will change x by pick random
06:52 - five to ten
07:02 - and delete this club so let's see the
07:04 - clouds now
07:07 - oh then we got the clouds okay they're
07:10 - on the top and now we're going to work
07:11 - on
07:12 - the flag in the flagpole so this might
07:14 - take a whole while
07:16 - because of the fact that this has over
07:18 - 70 costumes and
07:20 - i'm recording right now and
07:23 - it just takes forever oh i actually went
07:25 - pretty quick it wasn't that bad
07:27 - sandwich costumes
07:31 - 75 so uh the flag we have to draw the
07:34 - flagpole
07:36 - for the flag of course because why would
07:38 - you just draw a random flag with no
07:40 - flagpole
07:41 - so the flagpole uses to paint a new
07:43 - sprite
07:47 - and you need to make a really really
07:50 - long
07:50 - long long long long uh
07:56 - pole
08:01 - so
08:05 - about that big
08:08 - and i'm gonna make the
08:13 - oopsies and then i'm gonna make
08:17 - the top of the flagpole
08:24 - yellow
08:26 - let's go for like that type of yellow
08:29 - cool
08:30 - oopsies
08:33 - no outline
08:39 - so shift and draw a perfect circle
08:43 - right on top and so now we put the
08:47 - flagpole
08:48 - on the ground and we put the flag
08:52 - on the flagpole so there we have it
08:57 - but first we have to do
09:00 - the flagpole and make looks and
09:04 - go to back layer front layer
09:08 - and then we click it so we'll go to the
09:10 - front and we delete it
09:11 - so that's how it is with the flagpole
09:13 - and now the flag
09:15 - all we need to do for this one is you
09:17 - know the flagpole
09:19 - and for the flag all we have to do is
09:22 - when the green flag is clicked
09:24 - it will go to negative 70s
09:28 - it doesn't matter it's fine and it will
09:30 - set ghost effect to 25.
09:36 - ghost effect to 20 now 25
09:40 - and it'll go forever
09:45 - and go next costume
09:50 - as you can see i'm going to code the
09:51 - flagpole real quick to make it stay at
09:53 - this spot
09:55 - so when the green flag is clicked it
09:57 - will go to this position so that's all
09:59 - we have been possible
10:01 - and so let's see so we got the flag
10:05 - we got the flagpole we got the clouds
10:07 - moving so
10:08 - we are probably halfway i mean like we
10:11 - don't have much
10:12 - so now we need the fighter jets
10:15 - number one and number two
10:20 - and yeah you can download from the
10:23 - google drive
10:24 - or export it so when the green plug is
10:27 - clicked
10:31 - it will hide
10:35 - go back a layer
10:41 - it will wait three seconds
10:46 - so the first plane the second plane
10:48 - around the same coat
10:49 - just slightly different and we need a
10:52 - forever loop and a show
10:54 - and we also need a go to x
10:58 - two negative 225
11:03 - and why a hundred
11:07 - oh yeah let's see yeah so
11:10 - it'll go to here yeah i already got the
11:13 - coordinates
11:14 - right here but then it will glide one
11:16 - second
11:18 - to negative 225
11:26 - uh oh positive 225 and positive 100
11:30 - so now we have that you know high
11:35 - and wait a pick random of seconds
11:41 - pick random one to five seconds
11:49 - as you can see the fighter jet is about
11:52 - see
11:52 - look we have the fighters and now this
11:56 - is around the same code so we're going
11:57 - to just going to drag this thing in
12:01 - and when the green file is placed
12:03 - instead we put it five seconds and then
12:05 - the planes come at different times
12:09 - negative 225
12:15 - so i'm going to change the y to zero
12:21 - and i'll glide one seconds to
12:26 - 225 zero i'll pick random and there we
12:29 - go we got fighter jet number two
12:31 - and now we just need the soldier
12:35 - now all now we need this soldier
12:39 - and so yeah let's save this you want to
12:41 - see it
12:44 - first military plane they're both coming
12:48 - at the same time so yeah
12:50 - basically get the point so let's just
12:52 - look at uh
12:53 - the soldier statue number one the one
12:56 - that's like
12:56 - kneeling down when the green flag is
13:00 - clicked
13:01 - it'll go to 100 negative 62
13:04 - and it will go to the front layer
13:09 - and it will show
13:14 - and the soldier standing will
13:18 - when the green flag is clicked it will
13:21 - go
13:21 - to and then it will go to
13:27 - this position and we'll go to the front
13:29 - layer
13:32 - and show so
13:36 - you don't really need the show but just
13:38 - in case if you're like uh playing with
13:40 - it
13:40 - and seeing the project that means uh
13:43 - i advise you to put the show just in
13:45 - case so now we have to work on the text
13:50 - it'll take me forever to type this so i
13:52 - decided to backpack this
13:53 - so it's just and i'm
13:57 - proud to be an american
14:01 - where so you basically get the point at
14:03 - least
14:04 - yeah so um you just have to type
14:08 - one segment at a time
14:12 - so just type them one by one like and on
14:16 - stuff like that so uh the best way is to
14:18 - cut
14:19 - write it all and then slowly delete it
14:21 - down so i'm going to show you
14:25 - some copy this real quick
14:32 - so i pasted it and look so to make the
14:35 - first one
14:41 - duplicate and
14:45 - uh well you can do that and then and
14:47 - then the first one you just
14:49 - do that and then you delete all of this
14:52 - and i'm
14:53 - i think i actually started as i'm and
14:56 - i'm
14:56 - proud to be american so
15:00 - all i have to do is duplicate that and
15:01 - then i'll go to here and then i'm proud
15:05 - so yeah you basically get the point and
15:07 - you slowly make it
15:08 - to a whole sentence and yeah uh
15:13 - to be
15:16 - i'm proud to be an american
15:21 - but i don't really remember the whole
15:22 - thing but like you know like
15:25 - yeah so you basically got the point so
15:27 - yeah uh
15:29 - or you can just export right uh sprite
15:31 - if you're
15:32 - if you just don't want to type it uh so
15:35 - now we're gonna do this when the green
15:37 - flag is clicked
15:38 - it'll go to 488
15:42 - already there it'll hide
15:46 - it'll switch costume to costume one
15:51 - it'll wait 10 seconds
15:58 - and it will start showing so we'll go to
16:00 - the front layer
16:03 - oh show and repeat 17 times
16:08 - through all the costumes starting from
16:11 - number two because number one
16:12 - 18 costumes so 17 times wait
16:16 - one second next costume
16:22 - so if you want to make like more
16:24 - costumes than 18 then you probably got
16:26 - to do repeat 18 times or something 19
16:28 - times
16:29 - and then next costume and then broadcast
16:31 - happy memorial day
16:37 - um happy memorial day
16:45 - and um i'll wait five seconds
16:51 - and it will hide
16:56 - the last thing we have to do is the no
16:59 - not the elastic but like
17:00 - we have to do the uh the spinning on the
17:03 - happy memorial day
17:05 - but right now i'm going to show you it
17:09 - so you got everything you got the planes
17:12 - you got the soldiers
17:13 - and it'll start saying it
17:18 - and i'm proud okay so yeah you get the
17:21 - point okay so
17:22 - uh now all we have to do is the spinny
17:25 - spin
17:26 - for the memorial day
17:36 - happy memorial day and then i'll go
17:39 - costumes
17:40 - and yeah you just have to write happy
17:42 - memorial day
17:43 - regular layer okay uh
17:47 - sorry uh you just have to write it and
17:49 - then
17:50 - yeah and just use text and you can use
17:53 - handwriting
17:54 - like what i did and then or you can just
17:57 - export the sprite if you just don't want
17:59 - to do it
18:00 - and when the green flag is clicked it
18:03 - will go to
18:04 - zero
18:08 - negative 100 it'll hide
18:15 - and when i receive happy memorial day
18:18 - i'll point in direction 90
18:23 - and it'll go to a
18:26 - front layer so then it will be in front
18:28 - of everything
18:31 - it will show
18:34 - set turn to zero so you have to make a
18:37 - vr variable
18:45 - turn zero i'll go forever
18:51 - and change turn by four so slowly go
18:54 - like
18:56 - so you get the point the change
18:59 - turn by four
19:03 - and then it'll turn there's a tricky
19:05 - part
19:06 - turn 15 degrees you get that but then
19:08 - you have to get
19:10 - this this block
19:13 - abs of abs and
19:17 - you have to put costs
19:22 - cos of
19:25 - divide
19:29 - turn
19:34 - divided by 2.
19:37 - that gives it the turn effect
19:41 - so this is more if you know it'll turn
19:44 - and make a positive number or a negative
19:46 - number
19:47 - and it will that makes it turn left and
19:49 - right
19:50 - so we have one last thing to do and it's
19:52 - the sun
19:53 - so yeah just put it
19:57 - drag it up there
20:00 - doesn't matter where you put it you can
20:02 - put it on the ground if you want to
20:03 - uh and then all you have to do is oh
20:05 - yeah we have one thing add the sound
20:07 - you know go to this
20:11 - and then i'm also going to make it go to
20:15 - the back layer
20:21 - so yeah uh and this backdrops
20:25 - so when the green flag is clicked it'll
20:28 - set volume
20:31 - to 20 percent
20:40 - and it will go forever and play a sound
20:48 - called dance slow-mo
20:56 - okay this one and it we'll play this
21:00 - until done
21:01 - so yeah you can download the other
21:02 - sounds like amazing grace and god bless
21:04 - america and
21:05 - i don't want to play this because that's
21:07 - copyright oh yeah we have to name it
21:09 - to memorial day
21:16 - let's look
21:17 - [Music]
21:23 - so yeah you basically get it
21:27 - so um i saw the sun was in front of the
21:30 - airplane so
21:33 - i'm gonna make sure the sun is always in
21:34 - the back layer by putting a small weight
21:36 - in front
21:37 - one second away and i
21:40 - found that i spelled happy memorial day
21:43 - wrong
21:46 - happy has two peas not three peas
21:49 - [Music]
21:54 - so as you can see the planes are in
21:57 - front of the sun now
21:58 - and the soldiers and the flag and
22:00 - everything so
22:06 - so yeah i skipped a little bit
22:08 - [Music]
22:10 - so yeah you yeah it's working so

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's kids counting playground here and today we're back for another video on memorial day as you know no memorial day is tomorrow on monday so happy memorial day and i'm gonna show you the project that i made for memorial day so let's see it to play some music there's cloud fighter jets and two little army soldiers and a flag this is at least i know i'm free and i won't forget the men who died who gave that right to me it doesn't happen memorial day and this is just a nice animation you can shoot if your grandfather or your father is a veteran so yeah um yeah thank you for all the uh troops and the things that saved america so um in my original project i actually had god bless america and amazing grace but i used god bless america on my original project but i'm pretty sure youtube will give me a copyright strike if i actually play it on the video because it's copyrighted and you can if you want these sounds instead of the scratch sound you can go to our project and export the sounds so yeah so yeah export there's the button yeah right click and export the sound so yeah anyways um let's get started okay so um let's get started we do not need the scratch cat so yeah with the paint some clouds so i did not upload the backpack so it's just white and we got to make an oval shape on one of the sides let's do that whatever so yeah so let's make up we have to make an oval shape on this side around that big i can't see a thing i should upload the backdrop to see if this is large enough and then make another oval about that big so here's cloud number one and you just move this one across to this side and you got cloud number two and then you can duplicate that again and ctrl c ctrl v the this one and you can put it over here so there we go three types of clouds and let's just get the backdrop blue sky so you can actually see it i'll decrease the size later or yeah let's decrease the size later so now i'm just going to make these smaller because i don't think of my original project i decreased them i'm just gonna make them just a little bit smaller so yeah uh i think there's the right size almost just gonna make this one a little bit smaller and there we go we got some clouds so now we're gonna work on the clouds so when the green slag is clicked go hide go forever create 0.9 weight 0.5 seconds and create clone of myself so when you get to create when i start as a clone of scent size to um a pick random size because some clouds are larger than others if you didn't know you've probably seen the sky before so yeah you guys cassette size pick random 50 to a hundred percent some clouds are larger than others so now it'll said ghost effect because clouds have a faint color they're not colored to clear so it'll set ghost color set ghost effect to 50. so it'll be faded and it'll switch costume to pick random one to three so it depends which costume you're gonna put so and now we're going to put a go to go to x negative 200 and pick random 75 to 100 random 75 to 150. so now we have the x and y like where it's gonna glide and everything so we're gonna finish this we're gonna have a show and we're gonna have a repeat until uh we have x position is greater than 250. which is right here if it's greater than 250 around here then it will change x by pick random five to ten and delete this club so let's see the clouds now oh then we got the clouds okay they're on the top and now we're going to work on the flag in the flagpole so this might take a whole while because of the fact that this has over 70 costumes and i'm recording right now and it just takes forever oh i actually went pretty quick it wasn't that bad sandwich costumes 75 so uh the flag we have to draw the flagpole for the flag of course because why would you just draw a random flag with no flagpole so the flagpole uses to paint a new sprite and you need to make a really really long long long long long uh pole so about that big and i'm gonna make the oopsies and then i'm gonna make the top of the flagpole yellow let's go for like that type of yellow cool oopsies no outline so shift and draw a perfect circle right on top and so now we put the flagpole on the ground and we put the flag on the flagpole so there we have it but first we have to do the flagpole and make looks and go to back layer front layer and then we click it so we'll go to the front and we delete it so that's how it is with the flagpole and now the flag all we need to do for this one is you know the flagpole and for the flag all we have to do is when the green flag is clicked it will go to negative 70s it doesn't matter it's fine and it will set ghost effect to 25. ghost effect to 20 now 25 and it'll go forever and go next costume as you can see i'm going to code the flagpole real quick to make it stay at this spot so when the green flag is clicked it will go to this position so that's all we have been possible and so let's see so we got the flag we got the flagpole we got the clouds moving so we are probably halfway i mean like we don't have much so now we need the fighter jets number one and number two and yeah you can download from the google drive or export it so when the green plug is clicked it will hide go back a layer it will wait three seconds so the first plane the second plane around the same coat just slightly different and we need a forever loop and a show and we also need a go to x two negative 225 and why a hundred oh yeah let's see yeah so it'll go to here yeah i already got the coordinates right here but then it will glide one second to negative 225 uh oh positive 225 and positive 100 so now we have that you know high and wait a pick random of seconds pick random one to five seconds as you can see the fighter jet is about see look we have the fighters and now this is around the same code so we're going to just going to drag this thing in and when the green file is placed instead we put it five seconds and then the planes come at different times negative 225 so i'm going to change the y to zero and i'll glide one seconds to 225 zero i'll pick random and there we go we got fighter jet number two and now we just need the soldier now all now we need this soldier and so yeah let's save this you want to see it first military plane they're both coming at the same time so yeah basically get the point so let's just look at uh the soldier statue number one the one that's like kneeling down when the green flag is clicked it'll go to 100 negative 62 and it will go to the front layer and it will show and the soldier standing will when the green flag is clicked it will go to and then it will go to this position and we'll go to the front layer and show so you don't really need the show but just in case if you're like uh playing with it and seeing the project that means uh i advise you to put the show just in case so now we have to work on the text it'll take me forever to type this so i decided to backpack this so it's just and i'm proud to be an american where so you basically get the point at least yeah so um you just have to type one segment at a time so just type them one by one like and on stuff like that so uh the best way is to cut write it all and then slowly delete it down so i'm going to show you some copy this real quick so i pasted it and look so to make the first one duplicate and uh well you can do that and then and then the first one you just do that and then you delete all of this and i'm i think i actually started as i'm and i'm proud to be american so all i have to do is duplicate that and then i'll go to here and then i'm proud so yeah you basically get the point and you slowly make it to a whole sentence and yeah uh to be i'm proud to be an american but i don't really remember the whole thing but like you know like yeah so you basically got the point so yeah uh or you can just export right uh sprite if you're if you just don't want to type it uh so now we're gonna do this when the green flag is clicked it'll go to 488 already there it'll hide it'll switch costume to costume one it'll wait 10 seconds and it will start showing so we'll go to the front layer oh show and repeat 17 times through all the costumes starting from number two because number one 18 costumes so 17 times wait one second next costume so if you want to make like more costumes than 18 then you probably got to do repeat 18 times or something 19 times and then next costume and then broadcast happy memorial day um happy memorial day and um i'll wait five seconds and it will hide the last thing we have to do is the no not the elastic but like we have to do the uh the spinning on the happy memorial day but right now i'm going to show you it so you got everything you got the planes you got the soldiers and it'll start saying it and i'm proud okay so yeah you get the point okay so uh now all we have to do is the spinny spin for the memorial day happy memorial day and then i'll go costumes and yeah you just have to write happy memorial day regular layer okay uh sorry uh you just have to write it and then yeah and just use text and you can use handwriting like what i did and then or you can just export the sprite if you just don't want to do it and when the green flag is clicked it will go to zero negative 100 it'll hide and when i receive happy memorial day i'll point in direction 90 and it'll go to a front layer so then it will be in front of everything it will show set turn to zero so you have to make a vr variable turn zero i'll go forever and change turn by four so slowly go like so you get the point the change turn by four and then it'll turn there's a tricky part turn 15 degrees you get that but then you have to get this this block abs of abs and you have to put costs cos of divide turn divided by 2. that gives it the turn effect so this is more if you know it'll turn and make a positive number or a negative number and it will that makes it turn left and right so we have one last thing to do and it's the sun so yeah just put it drag it up there doesn't matter where you put it you can put it on the ground if you want to uh and then all you have to do is oh yeah we have one thing add the sound you know go to this and then i'm also going to make it go to the back layer so yeah uh and this backdrops so when the green flag is clicked it'll set volume to 20 percent and it will go forever and play a sound called dance slowmo okay this one and it we'll play this until done so yeah you can download the other sounds like amazing grace and god bless america and i don't want to play this because that's copyright oh yeah we have to name it to memorial day let's look so yeah you basically get it so um i saw the sun was in front of the airplane so i'm gonna make sure the sun is always in the back layer by putting a small weight in front one second away and i found that i spelled happy memorial day wrong happy has two peas not three peas so as you can see the planes are in front of the sun now and the soldiers and the flag and everything so so yeah i skipped a little bit so yeah you yeah it's working so yeah please like share subscribe
