00:00 - [Music]
00:08 - hello everyone and welcome back to kids
00:10 - coding playgrounds
00:12 - today we'll be continuing our chain
00:14 - reaction game
00:16 - so so far here is what we have we have
00:19 - the cloning
00:20 - and the spawning of the
00:23 - dots and we have them moving across the
00:26 - screen
00:27 - and uh we have the
00:30 - starting dot so that it gets larger when
00:33 - you click
00:35 - so right now we have
00:39 - this
00:42 - okay so first we're
00:45 - going to go to other dots
00:49 - and so let's go into the other dot
00:54 - and when i receive start game
01:04 - forever
01:08 - if the game stop
01:13 - so let's make a new variable called game
01:18 - stop
01:24 - and if gamestop is equal to yes
01:32 - yes
01:35 - then we'll stop all other scripts
01:41 - so other descriptions
01:45 - in the sprite
01:48 - so now let's get a when i start as clone
01:52 - and repeat until it's touching the edge
02:00 - let's um if
02:06 - dots left
02:10 - is less than one
02:16 - then we'll delete this clone
02:23 - and if player dot down
02:27 - is equal to yes
02:37 - and then and
02:45 - and then let's get when i receive start
02:48 - counting
02:51 - forever
02:56 - if dots left
03:00 - so just duplicate this
03:03 - and then inside set gamestop to yes
03:13 - now in the repeat until touching edge
03:18 - if it's touching
03:23 - the color of the starting dot
03:27 - so let's press the green flag and then
03:30 - select the eyedropper and now you should
03:34 - select
03:34 - the color if
03:37 - the touching color this
03:40 - and the player dot down is yes
03:46 - so player.down is yes
03:52 - so if
03:58 - then let's upload a new sound
04:02 - and search crunch
04:10 - and let's start the sound crunch
04:17 - and switch the costume
04:21 - to the last one which
04:24 - should be the gray one
04:29 - now let's change dots left by one
04:36 - and let's make a new variable called
04:40 - score
04:42 - and also change score by one
04:49 - score now
04:53 - let's go into the starting dot and
04:57 - drag this part in
05:00 - here so now we should have copied it
05:03 - into here
05:04 - and drag it below
05:08 - into the if condition
05:11 - now right here let's set the score to
05:14 - zero
05:16 - and let's set gamestop
05:20 - to no
05:25 - and also set the size to 50 percent
05:34 - and let's hide
05:39 - so as you can see dots going around
05:43 - right here and if you click
05:48 - yours should get larger
05:51 - and then everything disappears
05:54 - when there are no more no more dots
05:59 - so let's try it again and if the dots
06:02 - touch your dot
06:18 - your score goes up
06:24 - okay it's good so now at the end
06:28 - it should display your score so let's
06:31 - change this to a large readout
06:35 - and drag it down here and let's
06:39 - hide the other ones
06:42 - so
06:46 - now let's make a new spray and let's
06:48 - call it score
06:52 - score and then
06:56 - let's just have it name
07:00 - them one and then
07:05 - it should be one
07:09 - and then let's center this
07:18 - now let's duplicate this and then change
07:22 - this to two
07:24 - and do this all the way to nine
07:27 - and then change this to zero
07:31 - so right now i'm making a new costume
07:35 - and naming it zero
07:38 - and typing zero
07:43 - good so now let's go into the code
07:46 - and let's make a new variable for this
07:49 - sprite only
07:51 - and name it clone
07:56 - so when the green flag is clicked
08:02 - let's set clone to zero
08:06 - and let's repeat 10
08:10 - change clone by one
08:14 - and then creating a clone
08:21 - so then after that we hide
08:27 - and then when i start as clone
08:32 - forever
08:38 - if else if the game stop
08:42 - equals no
08:46 - gamestop equals no
08:50 - then let's set the size
08:54 - to 100 and then
08:58 - let's go to x
09:04 - clone number
09:08 - clone times
09:14 - let's see 20.
09:24 - minus 150
09:35 - and then y is negative 160.
09:43 - and now if the length of
09:46 - score if
09:52 - if else
09:55 - the length of score
10:04 - is less than
10:09 - clone number clone
10:14 - then let's hide
10:19 - so hide
10:25 - else then let's show
10:29 - and then let's switch costume to
10:33 - letter
10:39 - clone of score
10:44 - so let's hide all the variables
10:50 - and as you can see it works
10:54 - oh change this to plus
10:58 - 150
11:12 - so as you can see the score right there
11:16 - and maybe we could sit set it a little
11:18 - bit larger
11:19 - 200 percent yes and now if you place the
11:23 - dot down
11:27 - the sound plays and your score goes up
11:33 - and now you have that so
11:38 - when you lose so i'll just set
11:44 - the dots left to zero
11:48 - so you've lost now and
11:52 - let's set the size now
11:57 - to 400 percent
12:07 - let's go to x
12:10 - clone times 55
12:14 - and let's go minus
12:22 - 55
12:27 - y 0 and
12:31 - it should show your score right here so
12:34 - if they're
12:35 - too far apart then you can just lower
12:38 - this
12:39 - 40
12:42 - 40. okay
12:47 - now let's duplicate this and then let's
12:50 - name it high score
12:55 - and now let's make a cloud variable
12:58 - and name it high score
13:07 - so let's drag high score
13:10 - in the to replace score
13:14 - and drag this into the if
13:18 - and let's replace this with hide
13:23 - and let's also go to 20
13:28 - minus
13:32 - 55.
13:43 - and y negative 155
13:48 - and let's make another backdrop
13:52 - and we'll have it saying that the high
13:55 - score
13:56 - is that high
14:00 - score
14:05 - so now that we start we should
14:10 - when i receive start game
14:14 - forever if else
14:21 - gamestop
14:25 - is yes
14:28 - then we'll switch the backdrop
14:31 - to the second one
14:34 - then else then we'll switch the backdrop
14:37 - to the
14:38 - first one so okay change this to
14:42 - yes so now
14:45 - it should work and if we lose
14:52 - the score and i high score should show
14:55 - and now
14:56 - when i when the game stop
14:59 - is no so
15:04 - when
15:07 - forever if
15:13 - the game stop
15:22 - um equals
15:25 - yes
15:30 - and
15:34 - the score is more than the high score
15:48 - then let's set the high score
15:52 - to the score
15:55 - okay so let's hide high score
15:59 - and should work now
16:02 - so if you place it in the corner
16:07 - and the high score is zero and now if we
16:11 - get a higher score than zero the high
16:14 - score should be set
16:16 - to that score so
16:19 - now it works
16:24 - okay i'm just going to stop it
16:28 - and see the score is now 55
16:31 - and the high score is now 55
16:35 - so make sure to love
16:39 - to like the video and subscribe to our
16:42 - channel
16:43 - and hit the bell thanks for watching
16:46 - and yeah
16:50 - okay and see you guys next time

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone and welcome back to kids coding playgrounds today we'll be continuing our chain reaction game so so far here is what we have we have the cloning and the spawning of the dots and we have them moving across the screen and uh we have the starting dot so that it gets larger when you click so right now we have this okay so first we're going to go to other dots and so let's go into the other dot and when i receive start game forever if the game stop so let's make a new variable called game stop and if gamestop is equal to yes yes then we'll stop all other scripts so other descriptions in the sprite so now let's get a when i start as clone and repeat until it's touching the edge let's um if dots left is less than one then we'll delete this clone and if player dot down is equal to yes and then and and then let's get when i receive start counting forever if dots left so just duplicate this and then inside set gamestop to yes now in the repeat until touching edge if it's touching the color of the starting dot so let's press the green flag and then select the eyedropper and now you should select the color if the touching color this and the player dot down is yes so player.down is yes so if then let's upload a new sound and search crunch and let's start the sound crunch and switch the costume to the last one which should be the gray one now let's change dots left by one and let's make a new variable called score and also change score by one score now let's go into the starting dot and drag this part in here so now we should have copied it into here and drag it below into the if condition now right here let's set the score to zero and let's set gamestop to no and also set the size to 50 percent and let's hide so as you can see dots going around right here and if you click yours should get larger and then everything disappears when there are no more no more dots so let's try it again and if the dots touch your dot your score goes up okay it's good so now at the end it should display your score so let's change this to a large readout and drag it down here and let's hide the other ones so now let's make a new spray and let's call it score score and then let's just have it name them one and then it should be one and then let's center this now let's duplicate this and then change this to two and do this all the way to nine and then change this to zero so right now i'm making a new costume and naming it zero and typing zero good so now let's go into the code and let's make a new variable for this sprite only and name it clone so when the green flag is clicked let's set clone to zero and let's repeat 10 change clone by one and then creating a clone so then after that we hide and then when i start as clone forever if else if the game stop equals no gamestop equals no then let's set the size to 100 and then let's go to x clone number clone times let's see 20. minus 150 and then y is negative 160. and now if the length of score if if else the length of score is less than clone number clone then let's hide so hide else then let's show and then let's switch costume to letter clone of score so let's hide all the variables and as you can see it works oh change this to plus 150 so as you can see the score right there and maybe we could sit set it a little bit larger 200 percent yes and now if you place the dot down the sound plays and your score goes up and now you have that so when you lose so i'll just set the dots left to zero so you've lost now and let's set the size now to 400 percent let's go to x clone times 55 and let's go minus 55 y 0 and it should show your score right here so if they're too far apart then you can just lower this 40 40. okay now let's duplicate this and then let's name it high score and now let's make a cloud variable and name it high score so let's drag high score in the to replace score and drag this into the if and let's replace this with hide and let's also go to 20 minus 55. and y negative 155 and let's make another backdrop and we'll have it saying that the high score is that high score so now that we start we should when i receive start game forever if else gamestop is yes then we'll switch the backdrop to the second one then else then we'll switch the backdrop to the first one so okay change this to yes so now it should work and if we lose the score and i high score should show and now when i when the game stop is no so when forever if the game stop um equals yes and the score is more than the high score then let's set the high score to the score okay so let's hide high score and should work now so if you place it in the corner and the high score is zero and now if we get a higher score than zero the high score should be set to that score so now it works okay i'm just going to stop it and see the score is now 55 and the high score is now 55 so make sure to love to like the video and subscribe to our channel and hit the bell thanks for watching and yeah okay and see you guys next time
