00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:09 - kids coding playground
00:10 - today we'll be working on a rock blaster
00:13 - 2.0
00:14 - the rock blaster 1.0 has got many views
00:17 - over the past month so we decided to
00:19 - make rock blaster 2.0
00:21 - it is a more enhanced version with a
00:23 - shot of
00:24 - of the rock blaster 1.0 game you can use
00:26 - the shop logic for other games as well
00:30 - and i will be uploading these sprites in
00:32 - the um
00:34 - description below so just click show
00:36 - more and then you can download it from
00:37 - our google drive
00:39 - and then we will be learning these
00:40 - following concepts in scratch
00:43 - we'll be learning variables repeat until
00:46 - loops broadcast messages
00:48 - touching other sprites controlling the
00:50 - sprites with keys
00:52 - custom blocks and a custom sprite
00:56 - and let's get in so i'm just gonna go
00:59 - into the
01:02 - so rock blaster i'm gonna um go full
01:05 - screen so i gave myself some extra money
01:09 - so i can show you
01:12 - [Music]
01:13 - so you just shoot i added some extra
01:15 - aliens and all that stuff
01:17 - and when you press p it pauses the game
01:20 - and there's a shop
01:21 - and you can click on the shop we just
01:22 - drew a shopping cart
01:24 - and they could buy different things like
01:26 - this is a scatter shot you can buy that
01:29 - force fields you buy 500 each
01:32 - like that you can buy different skins
01:34 - and then the force field will go up by
01:36 - the
01:36 - every time you buy it and you buy a
01:38 - different skin let's say i select the
01:39 - skin
01:40 - it's a blue spaceship and you can click
01:42 - f or force field so then
01:44 - it'll protect you
01:47 - for five seconds yeah and then you have
01:50 - the scatter shot
01:52 - shoots triple
01:53 - [Music]
01:56 - this will protect you for five seconds
01:57 - so it's pretty cool
01:59 - and then you can also get other other
02:02 - skins
02:03 - like this one that
02:06 - is pretty cool and then when you die
02:08 - let's just say game over
02:11 - so that's pretty much the game so
02:15 - i'll let's start a new project
02:21 - so first we'll make some variables we'll
02:24 - make some variables to our um
02:26 - game so we can delete the scratch cap
02:28 - for now we will not need that
02:30 - we'll delete the my variable we do not
02:32 - need that as well
02:33 - we won't just make the money for now
02:36 - money
02:37 - that's to buy stuff and we will get the
02:40 - um speed
02:46 - um we'll need some more variables later
02:48 - in the future
02:49 - for um like buying stuff we'll need
02:51 - variables
02:52 - so i have these all in my backpack
02:56 - so i have the two spaceships
03:01 - so i accidentally didn't put all of
03:03 - these i only got a couple of them so let
03:05 - me just drag all these
03:06 - in so for the rocks right i have some
03:09 - costumes along with it
03:10 - these uh i got this from the sprite
03:12 - library
03:13 - but these three are from online you can
03:15 - just get whichever uh
03:18 - cost costume or like alien you want and
03:20 - then you can just put it in here
03:22 - and then you can use the magic eraser
03:24 - tool from 2.0 to erase the white
03:26 - background
03:27 - so you can watch our video on that if
03:29 - you want to learn how to do that
03:31 - and then um for here we have we have we
03:34 - just have
03:34 - blue and red one and then we have this
03:38 - this skin and then uh we have the laser
03:44 - with triple shot and the single shot so
03:46 - for triple shot we just like duplicated
03:48 - two of them
03:49 - on each side and then next we have the
03:53 - game over one
03:54 - nothing too special about this one and
03:56 - the shopping cart this
03:58 - represents the shop i guess and we drew
04:01 - that
04:01 - by using by just drawing a line line
04:04 - line line and you can just draw your own
04:07 - shopping cart like we did or you can
04:09 - just get one from online
04:11 - like we did we just drew this yeah so
04:13 - you can draw one if you want
04:16 - and then we have the exit button just a
04:18 - circle and then we
04:19 - exit and then we have the nebula
04:23 - background so what we did was get the
04:26 - backdrop from here
04:28 - nebula so we got the nebula backdrop
04:32 - from here
04:33 - then we uh convert to vector
04:36 - copy ctrl c and then we paint a new
04:40 - thing and then ctrl v so that's how we
04:43 - uh put that as a sprite
04:45 - um and then after that we have the
04:49 - pause button so when you press p i was
04:52 - thinking that if you press p
04:53 - it will pause the game and the shop will
04:55 - open so
04:57 - um all what we did was just draw a
04:59 - circle with two lines
05:01 - to make look like a pause button then we
05:03 - have the
05:05 - this this is just like the button to buy
05:08 - the
05:09 - by the spaceship and each shot you hit
05:11 - an enemy
05:12 - is 100 points so this is not that much
05:15 - actually
05:16 - and then we have the force field um
05:19 - sprite
05:21 - and i taught you guys how to do that in
05:24 - the other video
05:25 - the uh uh two player uh
05:28 - space shooting game so if you want to
05:30 - learn how to do that
05:31 - then you can watch that video but what
05:34 - we did was
05:35 - just draw a circle without with with
05:37 - outline and then erase
05:39 - this part in this part to make it look
05:41 - like a force field
05:43 - and then you have this um this one is
05:45 - not really purchasing
05:47 - this is the default uh spaceship skin
05:49 - but if you want to switch back to the
05:51 - default spaceship skin then you can just
05:52 - click on this
05:53 - that's what we did and then this is the
05:57 - other cool spaceships again looks pretty
05:59 - good this one
06:01 - and then this is the purchasing the
06:04 - force field 500 each
06:06 - and the code for this one's a bit
06:08 - different because you have to you can
06:09 - buy multiple at a time
06:12 - and then get the scatter shot which is 5
06:14 - 000
06:15 - points okay so that's all of the sprites
06:18 - right here so let's start with the
06:21 - player
06:22 - so i'm just gonna go to the red costume
06:25 - because you
06:26 - always want to start with that one first
06:27 - so one flat clicked
06:30 - we want to set the money to zero since
06:32 - um
06:34 - in the in the beginning you don't want
06:35 - them to have some money left over so
06:38 - i'm going to set to zero and then we
06:39 - want to switch the costume to costume
06:41 - one
06:43 - red costume so this is red costume blue
06:46 - costume and cool costume okay
06:48 - so i set it to the first one because uh
06:50 - this is the default
06:51 - skin and then we will broadcast a
06:55 - message called start game
07:01 - start game and then when i receive start
07:04 - game
07:07 - then we could go to the front layer
07:10 - let's go to the front layer
07:12 - so this goes front and then we want it
07:14 - to go back a little bit so we want to go
07:16 - back backwards and zoom in a little
07:20 - so we want to go backwards back 10
07:22 - layers
07:24 - so it won't go it'll go back a little
07:27 - bit
07:29 - and then we want to set the size to 40
07:34 - um this is already 40 because i got it
07:36 - from my backpack
07:37 - but if it isn't for you then just set it
07:39 - to 40
07:40 - and i'm actually not sure if they still
07:42 - have the spaceship and 3.0 scratch
07:44 - but if they don't then uh you can just
07:46 - get one from online
07:48 - um but this is from 2.0 i'm pretty sure
07:52 - and then in the beginning i wanted to
07:54 - make it go to negative 180
07:56 - y 0 and they get a forever loop this is
08:00 - for the movement
08:02 - forever if
08:06 - we're only doing the up and down arrow
08:07 - keys so if up arrow key is pressed
08:10 - then we can change the y by 10
08:14 - we just duplicate this if the left arrow
08:18 - i mean down arrow is clicked
08:20 - then we'll go down by negative 10
08:24 - change the y by negative 10. and then
08:27 - uh we'll also need a uh and that's it
08:30 - for now
08:31 - so this is just the movement so as you
08:34 - can see you can move
08:35 - up and down now so that's what we have
08:39 - and then next we can work on the um
08:41 - aliens and the
08:42 - space rocks and whatever you want to
08:44 - call them so let's make a new block
08:46 - called create enemies
08:52 - create enemies click okay so we're going
08:54 - to have to define this real quick
08:57 - i want to make it go to the back layer
08:59 - because um
09:00 - i had this bug earlier where um the
09:03 - aliens would show up when you're in the
09:04 - store
09:05 - because it's not all the way in the back
09:07 - layer so you want to make it go to the
09:08 - back layer
09:10 - switch costume to the rocks
09:15 - that's just the first default costume
09:18 - and then
09:18 - you can show set size to 50
09:22 - so i'm pretty this is already 50 but if
09:25 - it isn't already then you can set it to
09:26 - 50
09:28 - and then i'm gonna repeat five times
09:31 - since there's five costumes as you can
09:33 - see
09:34 - five costumes and then i'll do next
09:36 - costume
09:38 - create a clone of myself
09:42 - so change the costume while creating
09:45 - clones
09:47 - and then hide down here and then i want
09:51 - to set the x
09:52 - to like 99999 so the original
09:55 - uh the original sprite
09:58 - will be off the screen and then we can
10:02 - when i start as a clone
10:05 - when i start as a clone we wanted to go
10:08 - to pick random so we're just doing this
10:12 - to give it a little bit more
10:14 - uh a variation to the game so
10:18 - pick random so i'm going to pick random
10:22 - 180
10:23 - to 240
10:27 - and then for the y i'm going to do
10:28 - negative 150
10:30 - to 150 so it's going to be like
10:34 - somewhere around here and here of spawn
10:37 - somewhere near
10:37 - the edge so then um remember the speed
10:41 - variable we want to set the speed
10:45 - speed to pick random negative four
10:48 - to negative seven we're doing negative
10:50 - because they're moving to the left
10:53 - i did negative four negative seven
10:54 - because i think that's the right speed
10:57 - it's pretty good so we're gonna repeat
10:59 - until
11:01 - repeat until touching the player
11:08 - touching player and then we'll change
11:11 - the x
11:12 - by the speed so it'll go whatever
11:16 - number it is so like if the speed is 4
11:18 - negative 4 then i'll go negative 4 steps
11:21 - so change x by the speed
11:26 - and then if
11:30 - the x position is less than negative uh
11:33 - 220 so like somewhere around here if
11:35 - it's less than that
11:36 - position so the x position
11:42 - is less than negative 220 then we'll
11:44 - make it go back
11:46 - go back to this position so i'm just
11:48 - going to duplicate this
11:50 - put that in here and
11:53 - um that's all we have for now
11:57 - and then we also want to do this when i
11:59 - receive start game
12:01 - we want to call the um
12:04 - this block right here this script right
12:07 - here i'll call this so then it will
12:08 - actually spawn some stuff
12:11 - so now i will play it so i'm going to
12:14 - show you guys now
12:15 - the demo but first i'm going to hide
12:17 - these because they're a bit distracting
12:20 - and so as you can see are uh
12:25 - moving around like that and they're
12:27 - spawning
12:28 - but if you touch it you'll stop them
12:30 - because uh we have not done anything to
12:32 - do
12:33 - take damage yet or lose so
12:37 - now we have the spawning and the
12:38 - movement down uh
12:40 - and the next video will probably work in
12:42 - the laser
12:43 - and maybe the shop so thank you guys for
12:46 - watching
12:46 - don't forget to like share and subscribe
12:49 - and ring the notification bell
12:51 - and i'll see you guys in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today we'll be working on a rock blaster 2.0 the rock blaster 1.0 has got many views over the past month so we decided to make rock blaster 2.0 it is a more enhanced version with a shot of of the rock blaster 1.0 game you can use the shop logic for other games as well and i will be uploading these sprites in the um description below so just click show more and then you can download it from our google drive and then we will be learning these following concepts in scratch we'll be learning variables repeat until loops broadcast messages touching other sprites controlling the sprites with keys custom blocks and a custom sprite and let's get in so i'm just gonna go into the so rock blaster i'm gonna um go full screen so i gave myself some extra money so i can show you so you just shoot i added some extra aliens and all that stuff and when you press p it pauses the game and there's a shop and you can click on the shop we just drew a shopping cart and they could buy different things like this is a scatter shot you can buy that force fields you buy 500 each like that you can buy different skins and then the force field will go up by the every time you buy it and you buy a different skin let's say i select the skin it's a blue spaceship and you can click f or force field so then it'll protect you for five seconds yeah and then you have the scatter shot shoots triple this will protect you for five seconds so it's pretty cool and then you can also get other other skins like this one that is pretty cool and then when you die let's just say game over so that's pretty much the game so i'll let's start a new project so first we'll make some variables we'll make some variables to our um game so we can delete the scratch cap for now we will not need that we'll delete the my variable we do not need that as well we won't just make the money for now money that's to buy stuff and we will get the um speed um we'll need some more variables later in the future for um like buying stuff we'll need variables so i have these all in my backpack so i have the two spaceships so i accidentally didn't put all of these i only got a couple of them so let me just drag all these in so for the rocks right i have some costumes along with it these uh i got this from the sprite library but these three are from online you can just get whichever uh cost costume or like alien you want and then you can just put it in here and then you can use the magic eraser tool from 2.0 to erase the white background so you can watch our video on that if you want to learn how to do that and then um for here we have we have we just have blue and red one and then we have this this skin and then uh we have the laser with triple shot and the single shot so for triple shot we just like duplicated two of them on each side and then next we have the game over one nothing too special about this one and the shopping cart this represents the shop i guess and we drew that by using by just drawing a line line line line and you can just draw your own shopping cart like we did or you can just get one from online like we did we just drew this yeah so you can draw one if you want and then we have the exit button just a circle and then we exit and then we have the nebula background so what we did was get the backdrop from here nebula so we got the nebula backdrop from here then we uh convert to vector copy ctrl c and then we paint a new thing and then ctrl v so that's how we uh put that as a sprite um and then after that we have the pause button so when you press p i was thinking that if you press p it will pause the game and the shop will open so um all what we did was just draw a circle with two lines to make look like a pause button then we have the this this is just like the button to buy the by the spaceship and each shot you hit an enemy is 100 points so this is not that much actually and then we have the force field um sprite and i taught you guys how to do that in the other video the uh uh two player uh space shooting game so if you want to learn how to do that then you can watch that video but what we did was just draw a circle without with with outline and then erase this part in this part to make it look like a force field and then you have this um this one is not really purchasing this is the default uh spaceship skin but if you want to switch back to the default spaceship skin then you can just click on this that's what we did and then this is the other cool spaceships again looks pretty good this one and then this is the purchasing the force field 500 each and the code for this one's a bit different because you have to you can buy multiple at a time and then get the scatter shot which is 5 000 points okay so that's all of the sprites right here so let's start with the player so i'm just gonna go to the red costume because you always want to start with that one first so one flat clicked we want to set the money to zero since um in the in the beginning you don't want them to have some money left over so i'm going to set to zero and then we want to switch the costume to costume one red costume so this is red costume blue costume and cool costume okay so i set it to the first one because uh this is the default skin and then we will broadcast a message called start game start game and then when i receive start game then we could go to the front layer let's go to the front layer so this goes front and then we want it to go back a little bit so we want to go back backwards and zoom in a little so we want to go backwards back 10 layers so it won't go it'll go back a little bit and then we want to set the size to 40 um this is already 40 because i got it from my backpack but if it isn't for you then just set it to 40 and i'm actually not sure if they still have the spaceship and 3.0 scratch but if they don't then uh you can just get one from online um but this is from 2.0 i'm pretty sure and then in the beginning i wanted to make it go to negative 180 y 0 and they get a forever loop this is for the movement forever if we're only doing the up and down arrow keys so if up arrow key is pressed then we can change the y by 10 we just duplicate this if the left arrow i mean down arrow is clicked then we'll go down by negative 10 change the y by negative 10. and then uh we'll also need a uh and that's it for now so this is just the movement so as you can see you can move up and down now so that's what we have and then next we can work on the um aliens and the space rocks and whatever you want to call them so let's make a new block called create enemies create enemies click okay so we're going to have to define this real quick i want to make it go to the back layer because um i had this bug earlier where um the aliens would show up when you're in the store because it's not all the way in the back layer so you want to make it go to the back layer switch costume to the rocks that's just the first default costume and then you can show set size to 50 so i'm pretty this is already 50 but if it isn't already then you can set it to 50 and then i'm gonna repeat five times since there's five costumes as you can see five costumes and then i'll do next costume create a clone of myself so change the costume while creating clones and then hide down here and then i want to set the x to like 99999 so the original uh the original sprite will be off the screen and then we can when i start as a clone when i start as a clone we wanted to go to pick random so we're just doing this to give it a little bit more uh a variation to the game so pick random so i'm going to pick random 180 to 240 and then for the y i'm going to do negative 150 to 150 so it's going to be like somewhere around here and here of spawn somewhere near the edge so then um remember the speed variable we want to set the speed speed to pick random negative four to negative seven we're doing negative because they're moving to the left i did negative four negative seven because i think that's the right speed it's pretty good so we're gonna repeat until repeat until touching the player touching player and then we'll change the x by the speed so it'll go whatever number it is so like if the speed is 4 negative 4 then i'll go negative 4 steps so change x by the speed and then if the x position is less than negative uh 220 so like somewhere around here if it's less than that position so the x position is less than negative 220 then we'll make it go back go back to this position so i'm just going to duplicate this put that in here and um that's all we have for now and then we also want to do this when i receive start game we want to call the um this block right here this script right here i'll call this so then it will actually spawn some stuff so now i will play it so i'm going to show you guys now the demo but first i'm going to hide these because they're a bit distracting and so as you can see are uh moving around like that and they're spawning but if you touch it you'll stop them because uh we have not done anything to do take damage yet or lose so now we have the spawning and the movement down uh and the next video will probably work in the laser and maybe the shop so thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe and ring the notification bell and i'll see you guys in the next video
