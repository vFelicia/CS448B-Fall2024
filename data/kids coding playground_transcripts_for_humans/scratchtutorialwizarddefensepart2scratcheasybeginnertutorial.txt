00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - hey guys it's kids coding playground
00:09 - again and today I will be doing it
00:11 - wizard defense part 2 this is part 2 oh
00:15 - yeah I forgot to name it so got it done
00:17 - that in part one bellows name it wizard
00:24 - wizard defense so if you didn't watch
00:31 - part 1 please watch part 1 or else you
00:33 - might not know everything right now so
00:35 - in part 1 we finish the wizard you
00:39 - finish the wizard the fireball and I
00:44 - think no not the news right and the
00:47 - backdrop so we're not done with the
00:50 - wizard completely but then let's move on
00:55 - to the crow so let's work on the crow on
01:03 - if flat clicked the flag clicked bill
01:10 - set rotation style left right so it
01:13 - won't flip over or you can use the
01:15 - direction things right under here but
01:18 - let's use um
01:20 - left right set rotation style left right
01:25 - point in direction 90 so I'll always
01:29 - point on the right side as you can see
01:32 - it could set sigh let's make it fifty a
01:37 - hundred so a little bit of show this
01:40 - yeah hundreds way too big let's make it
01:42 - 50 set size to 50 so you can make a show
01:51 - in the beginning you'll show and then
01:54 - I'll go to a position let's make it go
01:58 - to let's make the students and then
02:03 - let's see how big this is
02:05 - let's make it go around
02:11 - we're gonna make him go to the left and
02:13 - talk so let's make let's use some like
02:18 - friendly numbers let's say negative two
02:21 - hundred and 150 you should work I think
02:27 - we have to make it we have to set the
02:32 - bird count so the bird count is how much
02:34 - birds or crows so we got to make a new
02:36 - van call it bird so you set bird count
02:47 - to 21 even you can choose how much burbs
02:49 - you want but I'm gonna use 21 and then
02:53 - this is the tricky part
02:55 - you need a repeat okay you need to
02:58 - repeat but three and you need to repeat
03:03 - seven because three rows of seven three
03:07 - rows of seven so it's three rows of
03:10 - seven so it's seven like this in seven
03:13 - seven four three rows so that was your
03:17 - tricky part so let's create the clone of
03:19 - myself so seven times three equals 21 so
03:26 - that's why it's um like that so let's
03:29 - change X by 60 we have to use our change
03:39 - X by 60 because it'll go move six X by
03:44 - six co-create another bird it'll keep on
03:46 - going until it touches um
03:49 - and until it makes 21 so let's change Y
03:54 - by negative forty so keep on going down
04:04 - so let's do change Expo negative so
04:12 - thinking twice we have to change the X
04:15 - back to 60 and we have to move on to the
04:19 - next row and take a it's a set X and
04:25 - change it especially a set X to let's
04:36 - say negative 200 then let's just put the
04:41 - change Y by already in here and then we
04:48 - have to make a new on message and then
04:54 - let's broadcast the message let's name
05:00 - it start marching so it'll go this isn't
05:08 - the end of the code you also need a hide
05:10 - right here so this is the end of the
05:14 - code for for um The Crow let's move a
05:20 - little bit here this as you can see it
05:26 - will generate 20 rows 21 roses 21 crows
05:31 - and then when I receive start marching
05:34 - so he's receiving a message from
05:36 - yourself it'll go forever I'll keep on
05:41 - moving one step
05:46 - keep on moving one step and then you
05:49 - need to if then statement so this is one
05:52 - you're touching the fireball so if then
05:56 - touching fireball go change the score by
06:02 - a high tree
06:07 - you can use anything you want but I
06:09 - decided to use a hundred misuse a
06:11 - hundred um and then you can start
06:13 - sounding the bird sound cuz that's when
06:16 - it dies and it plays like the birds out
06:21 - and then I'll wait let's make a small
06:24 - wait
06:25 - let's make it wait 0.01 seconds so let's
06:29 - put this right here
06:31 - 0.01 and then you can change the bird
06:36 - count by negative one so that's what it
06:38 - dies and then if then you knit if then
06:46 - statement right here and then you need a
06:52 - equals equals because if the bird count
06:56 - equals zero you win so we need it equal
06:58 - so you got to do if the bird count
07:00 - equals zero then broadcast you in and
07:04 - then do you when the sprite will show up
07:06 - so let's make a new message called you
07:22 - and then in the next row you have to
07:27 - delete the clone because it was already
07:29 - made so you got a delete right here so
07:35 - we're not just done we've gotta have an
07:38 - if-then statement right here so then
07:41 - I'll keep on the exposition so you need
07:45 - this thing will go this way
07:49 - 210 exposition so if exposition is
07:54 - larger than 210 it will move down though
08:03 - change direction and move down
08:05 - that's what exposition means and then
08:07 - you can broadcast the message change
08:15 - died right so you can take another of
08:22 - this you can use it here but we have to
08:27 - change the equal sign right here let's
08:30 - take out the exposition and we need the
08:34 - other way and you gotta put that
08:38 - exposition of smaller than negative 210
08:42 - they don't change position change their
08:44 - action so we need the change direction
08:51 - when I receive change direction because
08:54 - a broadcast message can be capable of
08:58 - doing multiple things it'll turn 180
09:02 - degrees right
09:05 - and then it'll change Y by negative 20
09:17 - so basically it means to turn around and
09:20 - it'll go down so when I receive start
09:23 - marching it'll go so right now we're
09:32 - actually setting up from the knife so we
09:34 - need a forever right here wait no wait
09:39 - you can use any pick random you want but
09:42 - let's used I'm going to use 3 to 5 so
09:45 - then it won't be all the time won't come
09:48 - down all the time so 3 to 5 then you
09:52 - need a set X seconds
09:56 - as you can see 3 or 5 seconds set X and
09:59 - you'll make a new variable night tax and
10:08 - then you can let's set the knife X to x
10:12 - position so cuz it's knife X so we can
10:16 - set it to x position and then we also
10:21 - need a knife why
10:27 - and then set knife y2y position then we
10:40 - also have to create the clone of a knife
10:43 - so I'll create the knife repeatedly for
10:48 - pick random
10:49 - oh yeah wrong one create clone of sprite
10:57 - - it's raining this and it's bringing
11:05 - this so the crow is giving the x
11:09 - position in Y position to the knife
11:11 - let's also rename this to you when you
11:19 - so let's go to the crow so actually we
11:25 - have to work on the knife before I start
11:28 - on the knife I'm a demo it so the birds
11:31 - are slowly moving down as you can see
11:33 - you need to take them out so we're not
11:35 - they're just done with the coat yet so
11:38 - the knife you gotta make if flag clicked
11:41 - point in direction 180 so it's facing
11:46 - down so set set size you will hundred I
11:53 - don't know how big this is
11:55 - just make it show oh wow it's actually
11:58 - really big so probably fifty do you
12:01 - think fifty will work let's see you can
12:07 - click on this to make it yep that's the
12:11 - size I think 30 you would work 30 yeah
12:17 - that's the great size
12:19 - I'm hide so you'll make it hide and then
12:24 - most people are used to doing this and
12:27 - this but today I you will learn
12:32 - something new if you don't know this yet
12:34 - so you can hide the variable knife
12:39 - duplicate this hide variable knife why
12:42 - so it just hides the variable up here so
12:46 - set so yeah as you can see it's gone now
12:51 - and then you can set got hit to n B
12:58 - gonna make a new variable first got hit
13:03 - to n n means no it stands for no and set
13:09 - got hit to know so if the knife didn't
13:14 - hit him
13:14 - it's it won't hit him right now and then
13:18 - the knife also needs more code so when I
13:21 - start as a clone because you need a
13:23 - clone of this as well go to X go to you
13:30 - need this and then take the knife X for
13:33 - the exposition X and the knife Y for the
13:37 - Y position and then make it show let's
13:44 - repeat until cuz I'll repeat until the
13:49 - knife will keep on going until it's
13:51 - touching the edge or yeah I'll keep on
13:54 - going until it's touching the edge now
13:57 - move ten steps we're touching wizard you
14:03 - can use the or statement but the Wizards
14:05 - a little bit different so you need it if
14:08 - then for here and then touch in wizard
14:17 - set got hit to Y so if the so there's
14:24 - another way to do this it's more
14:26 - compatible so we can use or here an or
14:34 - touching edge or yes
14:42 - touching edge or touching wizard so you
14:48 - need to build the code if then touching
14:50 - wizard inside of it inside of it then it
15:01 - will set got hit too why because if the
15:04 - knife is touching the wizard that means
15:06 - ill set got hit too why so they lose
15:09 - health
15:18 - little broadcast hit wizard do not it we
15:24 - have to use another one just has to wait
15:26 - and have a little wait before it hit
15:32 - wizard so broadcast hit wizard and wait
15:38 - and it do not do not put the delete this
15:44 - clone inside or also keep on deleting
15:47 - the knife sprite you have to put it
15:48 - outside so let's move on we're still on
15:55 - the knife when I receive hit wizard if
16:00 - then got hit equals y so if you did get
16:10 - hit then as it is true you will lie then
16:15 - it would change one life out by negative
16:22 - 1 and then set got hit to know so um
16:31 - I'll reset each time we're also keep on
16:36 - telling that you died using the variable
16:41 - got hit makes it change lives by a
16:44 - negative one but if you use if then
16:47 - touching wizard and my touch it multiple
16:49 - times so I lose more health than normal
16:51 - so let's go back to the wizard um
16:54 - if flag clicked if the green flag
16:57 - clicked then over a P until you needle
17:03 - or statement lives because the lives
17:08 - have to be equal zero or if this goes
17:12 - into the negatives so we need or and
17:16 - this one so you'll die see you
17:21 - yeah so the live you need lives over
17:24 - here and lives over here and then switch
17:28 - costume a little bit switch costume to
17:36 - wizard a so I'll stay so put it right
17:46 - here so okay yes but right there I
17:54 - switch costume - wizard a so it won't
17:58 - change in any costumes and then it's
18:02 - then touching crow we're almost done
18:05 - guys
18:05 - if then touching crow then I'll start
18:12 - the sound crash sweet box you can take
18:15 - any sound you want but let's take crash
18:25 - beatbox start sound crashing beatbox and
18:32 - then you guys set the got hit
18:34 - - why so then if it's touching the crow
18:38 - you also lose lives
18:39 - - why and then broadcast hit wizard this
18:50 - house you take but just it was written
18:52 - wait and then broadcast when your new
19:01 - broadcast message let's name it game
19:05 - over
19:08 - and this is one that you lose you win
19:11 - sprite comes into action
19:12 - so if then fly clicked let's say let's
19:19 - make a show first let's say go right
19:22 - here let's make it go to here and then
19:26 - Oh hide this is simple enough and then
19:30 - when I receive you win that means it
19:36 - will switch costume to costume more I
19:40 - think that's one right yeah one switch
19:43 - costume to costume one and then you can
19:48 - show make it show and then stop
19:52 - everything let's duplicate that and two
20:00 - and then change this to game builder in
20:05 - the stuff ball so I hope you enjoyed it
20:07 - guys please like share subscribe and
20:11 - it's working frequently
20:14 - she lives so please like share and
20:16 - subscribe and don't forget to comment to
20:19 - see what you want to see you later and
20:21 - goodbye

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys it's kids coding playground again and today I will be doing it wizard defense part 2 this is part 2 oh yeah I forgot to name it so got it done that in part one bellows name it wizard wizard defense so if you didn't watch part 1 please watch part 1 or else you might not know everything right now so in part 1 we finish the wizard you finish the wizard the fireball and I think no not the news right and the backdrop so we're not done with the wizard completely but then let's move on to the crow so let's work on the crow on if flat clicked the flag clicked bill set rotation style left right so it won't flip over or you can use the direction things right under here but let's use um left right set rotation style left right point in direction 90 so I'll always point on the right side as you can see it could set sigh let's make it fifty a hundred so a little bit of show this yeah hundreds way too big let's make it 50 set size to 50 so you can make a show in the beginning you'll show and then I'll go to a position let's make it go to let's make the students and then let's see how big this is let's make it go around we're gonna make him go to the left and talk so let's make let's use some like friendly numbers let's say negative two hundred and 150 you should work I think we have to make it we have to set the bird count so the bird count is how much birds or crows so we got to make a new van call it bird so you set bird count to 21 even you can choose how much burbs you want but I'm gonna use 21 and then this is the tricky part you need a repeat okay you need to repeat but three and you need to repeat seven because three rows of seven three rows of seven so it's three rows of seven so it's seven like this in seven seven four three rows so that was your tricky part so let's create the clone of myself so seven times three equals 21 so that's why it's um like that so let's change X by 60 we have to use our change X by 60 because it'll go move six X by six cocreate another bird it'll keep on going until it touches um and until it makes 21 so let's change Y by negative forty so keep on going down so let's do change Expo negative so thinking twice we have to change the X back to 60 and we have to move on to the next row and take a it's a set X and change it especially a set X to let's say negative 200 then let's just put the change Y by already in here and then we have to make a new on message and then let's broadcast the message let's name it start marching so it'll go this isn't the end of the code you also need a hide right here so this is the end of the code for for um The Crow let's move a little bit here this as you can see it will generate 20 rows 21 roses 21 crows and then when I receive start marching so he's receiving a message from yourself it'll go forever I'll keep on moving one step keep on moving one step and then you need to if then statement so this is one you're touching the fireball so if then touching fireball go change the score by a high tree you can use anything you want but I decided to use a hundred misuse a hundred um and then you can start sounding the bird sound cuz that's when it dies and it plays like the birds out and then I'll wait let's make a small wait let's make it wait 0.01 seconds so let's put this right here 0.01 and then you can change the bird count by negative one so that's what it dies and then if then you knit if then statement right here and then you need a equals equals because if the bird count equals zero you win so we need it equal so you got to do if the bird count equals zero then broadcast you in and then do you when the sprite will show up so let's make a new message called you and then in the next row you have to delete the clone because it was already made so you got a delete right here so we're not just done we've gotta have an ifthen statement right here so then I'll keep on the exposition so you need this thing will go this way 210 exposition so if exposition is larger than 210 it will move down though change direction and move down that's what exposition means and then you can broadcast the message change died right so you can take another of this you can use it here but we have to change the equal sign right here let's take out the exposition and we need the other way and you gotta put that exposition of smaller than negative 210 they don't change position change their action so we need the change direction when I receive change direction because a broadcast message can be capable of doing multiple things it'll turn 180 degrees right and then it'll change Y by negative 20 so basically it means to turn around and it'll go down so when I receive start marching it'll go so right now we're actually setting up from the knife so we need a forever right here wait no wait you can use any pick random you want but let's used I'm going to use 3 to 5 so then it won't be all the time won't come down all the time so 3 to 5 then you need a set X seconds as you can see 3 or 5 seconds set X and you'll make a new variable night tax and then you can let's set the knife X to x position so cuz it's knife X so we can set it to x position and then we also need a knife why and then set knife y2y position then we also have to create the clone of a knife so I'll create the knife repeatedly for pick random oh yeah wrong one create clone of sprite it's raining this and it's bringing this so the crow is giving the x position in Y position to the knife let's also rename this to you when you so let's go to the crow so actually we have to work on the knife before I start on the knife I'm a demo it so the birds are slowly moving down as you can see you need to take them out so we're not they're just done with the coat yet so the knife you gotta make if flag clicked point in direction 180 so it's facing down so set set size you will hundred I don't know how big this is just make it show oh wow it's actually really big so probably fifty do you think fifty will work let's see you can click on this to make it yep that's the size I think 30 you would work 30 yeah that's the great size I'm hide so you'll make it hide and then most people are used to doing this and this but today I you will learn something new if you don't know this yet so you can hide the variable knife duplicate this hide variable knife why so it just hides the variable up here so set so yeah as you can see it's gone now and then you can set got hit to n B gonna make a new variable first got hit to n n means no it stands for no and set got hit to know so if the knife didn't hit him it's it won't hit him right now and then the knife also needs more code so when I start as a clone because you need a clone of this as well go to X go to you need this and then take the knife X for the exposition X and the knife Y for the Y position and then make it show let's repeat until cuz I'll repeat until the knife will keep on going until it's touching the edge or yeah I'll keep on going until it's touching the edge now move ten steps we're touching wizard you can use the or statement but the Wizards a little bit different so you need it if then for here and then touch in wizard set got hit to Y so if the so there's another way to do this it's more compatible so we can use or here an or touching edge or yes touching edge or touching wizard so you need to build the code if then touching wizard inside of it inside of it then it will set got hit too why because if the knife is touching the wizard that means ill set got hit too why so they lose health little broadcast hit wizard do not it we have to use another one just has to wait and have a little wait before it hit wizard so broadcast hit wizard and wait and it do not do not put the delete this clone inside or also keep on deleting the knife sprite you have to put it outside so let's move on we're still on the knife when I receive hit wizard if then got hit equals y so if you did get hit then as it is true you will lie then it would change one life out by negative 1 and then set got hit to know so um I'll reset each time we're also keep on telling that you died using the variable got hit makes it change lives by a negative one but if you use if then touching wizard and my touch it multiple times so I lose more health than normal so let's go back to the wizard um if flag clicked if the green flag clicked then over a P until you needle or statement lives because the lives have to be equal zero or if this goes into the negatives so we need or and this one so you'll die see you yeah so the live you need lives over here and lives over here and then switch costume a little bit switch costume to wizard a so I'll stay so put it right here so okay yes but right there I switch costume wizard a so it won't change in any costumes and then it's then touching crow we're almost done guys if then touching crow then I'll start the sound crash sweet box you can take any sound you want but let's take crash beatbox start sound crashing beatbox and then you guys set the got hit why so then if it's touching the crow you also lose lives why and then broadcast hit wizard this house you take but just it was written wait and then broadcast when your new broadcast message let's name it game over and this is one that you lose you win sprite comes into action so if then fly clicked let's say let's make a show first let's say go right here let's make it go to here and then Oh hide this is simple enough and then when I receive you win that means it will switch costume to costume more I think that's one right yeah one switch costume to costume one and then you can show make it show and then stop everything let's duplicate that and two and then change this to game builder in the stuff ball so I hope you enjoyed it guys please like share subscribe and it's working frequently she lives so please like share and subscribe and don't forget to comment to see what you want to see you later and goodbye
