00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - so welcome back guys in another video on
00:09 - kids code in playground and today we're
00:12 - learning something new we're gonna be
00:14 - working on this game basically the
00:16 - player controls the spaceship and
00:17 - fighters the lasers to bless the space
00:20 - rocks rock blaster so we will be
00:26 - learning these following concepts and
00:27 - scratch hi didn't show repeat until loop
00:30 - when key pressed touching sprite and
00:33 - broadcast messages before I start can
00:39 - you please like share and subscribe
00:41 - charge in and comment the Lotus you what
00:44 - content you want to see so I'm just
00:47 - gonna demo the game real quick you use
00:50 - arrow keys you should try to shoot down
00:51 - the rock so I'm going quick and the
00:54 - other you lose and then you can get
00:57 - those by shooting the rocks so let's
01:06 - start a new project okay so yeah we have
01:18 - to get the set up so we can get set up
01:22 - on the rocks so we can take the rocks
01:29 - you can also take the rocket ship since
01:33 - they don't have the spaceship anymore so
01:37 - now they only have the rocket ship need
01:42 - the button because it looks like a laser
01:44 - we can rename that later let's use this
01:49 - one because this one looks more like a
01:50 - laser we can also use get to draw the
01:55 - next break it's um I do lose sprite so
02:02 - we can use pixel because it looks more
02:05 - pixelated and a game so this right game
02:10 - I think that's big enough so we have to
02:27 - get our backdrop you had to get her back
02:30 - drop the shoots that he used moon if you
02:33 - want but let's you I'm gonna use stars
02:44 - this one can look a little better
02:48 - some stars so we got all our sprites
02:51 - here we have to make our variables now
02:56 - so our variables let's make the variable
03:00 - score we have two variables to make
03:04 - score in speed the speed controls how
03:10 - quick the rocks are come so we can hide
03:16 - the variable speed so first things first
03:20 - let's work on the rocket trip sprite
03:22 - when flat clip because we always have to
03:25 - start with that we always have to set
03:27 - the score 2-0 in the beginning cuz it
03:31 - restarts everything and then let's see
03:34 - what we can do let's say probably 40 50
03:42 - so we can do set size to let's tape out
03:50 - and then we can make it go to around
03:58 - maybe around here it's more closer to
04:01 - 180 so around here repeat until they'll
04:07 - repeat until um it's touching one of the
04:11 - rocks and that's when they lose so if
04:13 - it's touching the rocks and yeah so you
04:18 - got to put the repeat oh then you need
04:20 - to if then statements remember not to
04:23 - overlap them
04:24 - because if you overlap them we won't
04:25 - work so you gotta put them outside
04:27 - they're not in the side so in the top
04:32 - arrow if the up arrow is clicked it
04:35 - pressed up arrow then I'll change Y by
04:41 - 10 because it's more smooth so you can
04:44 - make that go up down arrow and then
04:52 - change Y by negative 10 so I'm gonna try
04:59 - this out if we also have to we're
05:07 - actually not before we go on we have to
05:11 - change this to 1 so we can so ya start
05:28 - this so you can see um you can move up
05:30 - and down so let's move on to the laser
05:37 - so the button so let's change this to
05:40 - laser when green flag clicked for the
05:47 - beginning costumes you you can pick any
05:57 - costume you want but I'm gonna see with
05:59 - this standard one so if the a green flag
06:03 - is clicked let's say about set size to
06:06 - about 10 so I should about 10 so then go
06:15 - hide in the beginning because we don't
06:16 - want to show up all the time and now
06:19 - when the space key is pressed or create
06:22 - a clone of itself myself because that's
06:26 - basically the laser and then when I
06:28 - start as a clone you need to go to let's
06:35 - say about negative
06:38 - 160 we go to sudden sake this is the
06:42 - tricky part so when we're using this we
06:45 - need to use the backdrop of stage so if
06:48 - you change the first one first it
06:50 - doesn't work you have to change the back
06:52 - one first so you go use rocket ship and
06:54 - then you put Y position of the rocket
06:57 - ship we have to make it show I'll repeat
07:03 - until it's touching the edge so keep on
07:05 - going until it'll touch the edge it'll
07:07 - move 10 steps you know repeat until
07:10 - those it's touching the edge and they'll
07:20 - delete the clone and then remember to
07:25 - put it outside not inside or also won't
07:27 - work so let's move on to the rock so so
07:39 - when the flag clicked those show will
07:45 - set size so let's say about 50 we don't
07:51 - want it to be that big or too small so
07:54 - let's make it repeat 5 times it'll
07:58 - create 5 clones of itself and then make
08:05 - it hide so then this is the big chunk of
08:10 - code so this is the big chunk of code so
08:17 - when I start us a clone zoom in a little
08:19 - bit it'll go to we need to go to let's
08:27 - say about 240 X so it's around this part
08:32 - so then we also need a pick random so it
08:35 - will be up to 240 s about you but if we
08:39 - pick random it will be like around here
08:41 - so pick random let's say negative 150 to
08:49 - 150
08:50 - why so the speed is really useful so
08:56 - some rocks are quicker than the other so
08:59 - a set speed to pick random negative 2
09:08 - and negative so it will repeat until
09:15 - it's touching the spaceship so if the is
09:20 - touching the spaceship or the rocketship
09:22 - held on so I'll change X by speed so it
09:27 - would change the X by speed you need the
09:33 - speed variable right here so it will
09:35 - keep on going by speed so how fast it is
09:37 - so we knif then inside we need this
09:46 - operator so if negative 220 is bigger
09:51 - than the x position that means it will
09:58 - go to let's say about 240 I notice we
10:09 - can just duplicate this you just put
10:17 - this inside here so if then touching but
10:28 - so that's when it's or the laser because
10:33 - we renamed it that means they'll change
10:36 - the score you can use any score you want
10:39 - but I'm gonna use by hundred so and then
10:47 - we can duplicate this again and put this
10:49 - under um and then it'll start the sound
10:55 - magic spell so we can use sounds let's
10:58 - go
11:02 - so magic spell I start the sound magic
11:10 - spell right here and then I'll broadcast
11:14 - a new message because we haven't even
11:16 - made a message yet I'll broadcast the
11:18 - message so we can work on the sprite 1 /
11:28 - the game over sprite so we can rename it
11:31 - click English pray want to start we can
11:40 - also rename this to say space it'll hide
11:53 - in the beginning and then when I receive
11:57 - game over then I'll show cuz that's when
12:00 - it comes out you know place down so we
12:04 - can take us out so that's what it is so
12:12 - play some lose until done and then I'll
12:18 - stop everything stop all so for the rest
12:26 - of the code the rocks the rocket ship is
12:29 - the laser you'll have to put if when I
12:35 - receive game over let me so stop the
12:39 - other scripts in this sprite let me just
12:47 - drag that inside there so let's see it's
12:53 - right here let me just demo the game so
13:00 - so some rocks are slower as you can see
13:05 - some rocks are slightly more quicker you
13:09 - probably can't really see the difference
13:11 - but some sir some rocks are really
13:13 - really quicker really faster really
13:16 - thicker way work with using the other
13:18 - rocks basically so let me show you when
13:24 - I die so thank you for watching guys
13:34 - please like share subscribe and comment
13:38 - in the comment section what you want to
13:40 - see next and see you next time

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys in another video on kids code in playground and today we're learning something new we're gonna be working on this game basically the player controls the spaceship and fighters the lasers to bless the space rocks rock blaster so we will be learning these following concepts and scratch hi didn't show repeat until loop when key pressed touching sprite and broadcast messages before I start can you please like share and subscribe charge in and comment the Lotus you what content you want to see so I'm just gonna demo the game real quick you use arrow keys you should try to shoot down the rock so I'm going quick and the other you lose and then you can get those by shooting the rocks so let's start a new project okay so yeah we have to get the set up so we can get set up on the rocks so we can take the rocks you can also take the rocket ship since they don't have the spaceship anymore so now they only have the rocket ship need the button because it looks like a laser we can rename that later let's use this one because this one looks more like a laser we can also use get to draw the next break it's um I do lose sprite so we can use pixel because it looks more pixelated and a game so this right game I think that's big enough so we have to get our backdrop you had to get her back drop the shoots that he used moon if you want but let's you I'm gonna use stars this one can look a little better some stars so we got all our sprites here we have to make our variables now so our variables let's make the variable score we have two variables to make score in speed the speed controls how quick the rocks are come so we can hide the variable speed so first things first let's work on the rocket trip sprite when flat clip because we always have to start with that we always have to set the score 20 in the beginning cuz it restarts everything and then let's see what we can do let's say probably 40 50 so we can do set size to let's tape out and then we can make it go to around maybe around here it's more closer to 180 so around here repeat until they'll repeat until um it's touching one of the rocks and that's when they lose so if it's touching the rocks and yeah so you got to put the repeat oh then you need to if then statements remember not to overlap them because if you overlap them we won't work so you gotta put them outside they're not in the side so in the top arrow if the up arrow is clicked it pressed up arrow then I'll change Y by 10 because it's more smooth so you can make that go up down arrow and then change Y by negative 10 so I'm gonna try this out if we also have to we're actually not before we go on we have to change this to 1 so we can so ya start this so you can see um you can move up and down so let's move on to the laser so the button so let's change this to laser when green flag clicked for the beginning costumes you you can pick any costume you want but I'm gonna see with this standard one so if the a green flag is clicked let's say about set size to about 10 so I should about 10 so then go hide in the beginning because we don't want to show up all the time and now when the space key is pressed or create a clone of itself myself because that's basically the laser and then when I start as a clone you need to go to let's say about negative 160 we go to sudden sake this is the tricky part so when we're using this we need to use the backdrop of stage so if you change the first one first it doesn't work you have to change the back one first so you go use rocket ship and then you put Y position of the rocket ship we have to make it show I'll repeat until it's touching the edge so keep on going until it'll touch the edge it'll move 10 steps you know repeat until those it's touching the edge and they'll delete the clone and then remember to put it outside not inside or also won't work so let's move on to the rock so so when the flag clicked those show will set size so let's say about 50 we don't want it to be that big or too small so let's make it repeat 5 times it'll create 5 clones of itself and then make it hide so then this is the big chunk of code so this is the big chunk of code so when I start us a clone zoom in a little bit it'll go to we need to go to let's say about 240 X so it's around this part so then we also need a pick random so it will be up to 240 s about you but if we pick random it will be like around here so pick random let's say negative 150 to 150 why so the speed is really useful so some rocks are quicker than the other so a set speed to pick random negative 2 and negative so it will repeat until it's touching the spaceship so if the is touching the spaceship or the rocketship held on so I'll change X by speed so it would change the X by speed you need the speed variable right here so it will keep on going by speed so how fast it is so we knif then inside we need this operator so if negative 220 is bigger than the x position that means it will go to let's say about 240 I notice we can just duplicate this you just put this inside here so if then touching but so that's when it's or the laser because we renamed it that means they'll change the score you can use any score you want but I'm gonna use by hundred so and then we can duplicate this again and put this under um and then it'll start the sound magic spell so we can use sounds let's go so magic spell I start the sound magic spell right here and then I'll broadcast a new message because we haven't even made a message yet I'll broadcast the message so we can work on the sprite 1 / the game over sprite so we can rename it click English pray want to start we can also rename this to say space it'll hide in the beginning and then when I receive game over then I'll show cuz that's when it comes out you know place down so we can take us out so that's what it is so play some lose until done and then I'll stop everything stop all so for the rest of the code the rocks the rocket ship is the laser you'll have to put if when I receive game over let me so stop the other scripts in this sprite let me just drag that inside there so let's see it's right here let me just demo the game so so some rocks are slower as you can see some rocks are slightly more quicker you probably can't really see the difference but some sir some rocks are really really quicker really faster really thicker way work with using the other rocks basically so let me show you when I die so thank you for watching guys please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section what you want to see next and see you next time
