00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:09 - kids coding playground
00:10 - today i'll be uh showcasing a animation
00:13 - we made
00:15 - this we spent many hours on this project
00:17 - it took us a very long time to make this
00:19 - because we had to like draw a lot of
00:21 - costumes and
00:22 - we had to like code a lot and
00:26 - the um animation is about two brothers
00:28 - spending their labor day weekend
00:30 - so in the comments below you can tell us
00:32 - what you did over labor day
00:34 - uh if you live in the u.s i know some
00:36 - other countries do not celebrate labor
00:38 - day
00:39 - but if you do not live in the u.s maybe
00:41 - you can tell us what you did over
00:43 - the weekend so without further ado
00:47 - we will start the animation so let's
00:50 - start the video
00:51 - i'm gonna go full screen so you guys can
00:53 - see it
00:54 - more clearly and yes there's music but
00:57 - it's very soft
00:59 - so at first the two brothers are at the
01:02 - bus stop
01:03 - thinking that they have school and labor
01:04 - day
01:07 - um and they're just like talking to each
01:09 - other you can read it
01:11 - uh where is everyone else they're
01:13 - confused why no one's at the bus stop
01:16 - um because it's labor day and they
01:18 - forgot it's labor day
01:23 - so they wait they wait for like 15
01:25 - minutes
01:26 - and the bus still does not come as you
01:28 - can see
01:30 - uh-oh looks like the bus isn't here
01:35 - and then after this they decide to walk
01:39 - to school
01:42 - they forgot that it wasn't labor day
01:44 - remember it was labor day
01:47 - we need to get to school before it gets
01:49 - too late
01:50 - as you can see we also did the type text
01:53 - um
01:54 - i think i taught you guys in the indie
01:55 - cat maze game
01:56 - [Music]
01:57 - it makes your animation much cooler
02:01 - so they walk off screen 30 minutes later
02:04 - they are at school
02:05 - so this scene they are finally at the
02:07 - school
02:09 - he says i hope we don't get detention
02:10 - because they are late
02:15 - so they go to the door they try to knock
02:18 - and ring on the doorbell but no one
02:20 - answers
02:25 - and he says the door is locked and his
02:27 - brother says let me try
02:30 - so the brother decides to knock on the
02:32 - door but there's nothing nothing happens
02:37 - [Music]
02:38 - the door won't budge
02:39 - [Music]
02:42 - the lights are all off and then they and
02:46 - then they finally remember today is
02:47 - labor day
02:49 - no school today
02:52 - and then they and then they head back
02:54 - home they walk back home after this
02:59 - and then the great brother says that all
03:02 - the time was wasted
03:06 - and then that's their mom okay their
03:07 - mom's just like working around the
03:09 - kitchen
03:11 - and their mom also forgets that labor
03:14 - day was today
03:17 - their mom also forgets
03:19 - [Music]
03:24 - in the description below i will also put
03:26 - all of these
03:27 - um cats and all these sprites
03:30 - so you guys can um download them and
03:32 - make your own animation
03:36 - and then their mom says if there's no
03:38 - school then they'll have a family clean
03:40 - up
03:40 - day first it tells them to clean the
03:43 - room then to mop
03:44 - the floors and finally if you guys do
03:47 - well then we will have a barbecue
03:52 - family barbecue yeah
03:55 - the two boys do not like that well
03:57 - that's just great sarcasm
03:59 - intensifies i just made it a little bit
04:01 - more funny
04:03 - and who doesn't work on labor day says
04:05 - the orange scratch cat
04:09 - [Music]
04:10 - our day was similar to their day we had
04:12 - to do a lot of chores
04:14 - today
04:14 - [Music]
04:17 - and their mom says the faster you get
04:19 - your chores done the faster you can play
04:21 - [Music]
04:25 - the grey cat does not like that either
04:29 - choking intensifies law it kind of made
04:31 - it a little more funnier
04:33 - i guess this is her dad cat the dad cat
04:35 - comes into the scene
04:37 - and their dad tells them to follow the
04:38 - instructions when their mom said
04:42 - and then the dad notices uh um thinks
04:45 - that i hope she doesn't tell me to do
04:47 - anything
04:47 - as you can see he's thinking yep now go
04:50 - through the chores
04:51 - telling the kids and then the mom
04:53 - remembers to tell the dad to do some
04:55 - stuff oh yeah i forgot dad please mow
04:57 - the lawn the grass is getting long
05:00 - and then the dad doesn't like it either
05:02 - [Music]
05:04 - and then the dad just walks off the
05:06 - scene to go mow the lawn
05:09 - and then while the dad is mowing the
05:10 - lawn the kids are cleaning the room a
05:12 - little
05:12 - cut scene as you can see there's bits of
05:15 - trash around
05:16 - and just to notice note this thing is
05:18 - not the takeout box we just like edited
05:21 - it
05:21 - it's a trash can in our thing
05:25 - so they just throw all the trash into
05:27 - the trash can
05:28 - [Music]
05:31 - i made a fish phone cause cats like to
05:33 - eat fish
05:35 - and at this part this cat throws the
05:37 - trash to this
05:38 - other brother and then they throw in the
05:40 - trash can and they say score
05:45 - [Music]
05:46 - now we are done cleaning our room
05:51 - and then they move they get out of the
05:53 - scene now
05:54 - and now that they mop the floor looks
05:57 - like our mom already left us
05:58 - the bucket so they go pick up the
06:01 - go to the bucket and pick up a broom i
06:03 - mean a mop
06:04 - and they begin to mock the floor
06:09 - as you can see they switch the costume i
06:11 - mean switch to another sprite
06:13 - and they mop okay we are finally done
06:15 - and then he says yeah at the same time
06:18 - and then finally their dad is happy that
06:20 - they finish all their chores
06:22 - so he's cooking a fish on the grill as
06:24 - you can see
06:25 - the food is almost ready
06:29 - and there's a side of cheese puffs right
06:31 - here and then they'll sit down
06:33 - or more like stand up and their mom
06:35 - comes to pick up the fish
06:37 - food is ready come in over and pick it
06:40 - up
06:40 - [Music]
06:43 - gets the fish and puts on the plate as
06:45 - you can see there's a plate right here
06:47 - the mom drops the fish right there
06:51 - the food looks great thanks mom and dad
06:56 - that orange cat says great food dad
06:59 - thanks mom what a great day at labor day
07:02 - and that's the end of the animation
07:04 - happy labor day
07:07 - okay so that's the animation the end
07:10 - thank you for watching please tell us
07:11 - what you did over the labor day in the
07:13 - comments down below
07:14 - like i said earlier and now i can show
07:16 - you some of the code inside
07:18 - so remember i said we had type text
07:21 - [Music]
07:23 - and there's actually three different
07:25 - cats so there's the cat with the mop
07:28 - the cats of the mob the cats with the
07:30 - book bags
07:32 - and then the cats with nothing on her
07:34 - and the mom and dad that's it
07:36 - and then we have a bunch of other
07:38 - sprites so the reason this took us so
07:40 - long so you have to like broadcast a lot
07:42 - of messages
07:43 - think of what to say think of a
07:45 - storyboard make them move around
07:47 - so it wasn't it was like
07:50 - i knew how to do it it's just that it's
07:53 - too tedious
07:54 - and then we had to like draw some of our
07:57 - own sprites
07:58 - and then we got some of these from
07:59 - online like this book bag
08:01 - and we had we had to edit it on the um
08:04 - scratch cat
08:05 - then we also have the mop we had to edit
08:06 - that onto the scratch cat
08:10 - and this plate we got from online these
08:12 - fish bone and all this stuff we got them
08:14 - online
08:15 - so overall this this was a pretty good
08:19 - animation i think
08:20 - and it was pretty long i think it was
08:21 - like five minutes
08:24 - took us a long time maybe like five
08:26 - hours
08:29 - um maybe even more since we had to um
08:33 - since we had to like draw all the
08:34 - sprites and clean up all the sprites
08:36 - because some of these were like
08:37 - jpgs to clean up the back background
08:41 - and if you wanna i said this earlier but
08:43 - if you want to um
08:45 - make your own animation and the link in
08:48 - the description below you can download
08:49 - all of these sprites
08:51 - like the all the cats the cat the book
08:54 - bad cat the mom dad and like the mob
08:56 - cats
08:57 - so yeah that pretty much concludes this
09:00 - video
09:01 - so thank you guys for watching don't
09:03 - forget to like
09:04 - share and subscribe and ring the
09:06 - notification bell and i'll see you guys
09:08 - in the next video
