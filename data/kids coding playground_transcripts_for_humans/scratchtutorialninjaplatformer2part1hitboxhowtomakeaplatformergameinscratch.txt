00:15 - [Music]
00:19 - hello welcome back guys to kids cooling
00:21 - playground so today we'll be working on
00:24 - the
00:24 - new ninja platformer i think i did that
00:27 - a while back maybe two years back so it
00:30 - wasn't really good
00:32 - they were having some bugs and stuff
00:34 - like that uh with the uh platform
00:36 - detection so
00:38 - we made a new one that is a lot better
00:41 - so
00:42 - so that's why i'm re recording the video
00:44 - to show you guys how to do that uh so if
00:46 - you want to uh start the project you can
00:49 - take look at this one called ninja
00:51 - platformer for class no code so this one
00:54 - has all the uh basic
00:58 - platform and stuff like that already
01:00 - there so you can go inside
01:03 - uh if you go inside you'll see like the
01:05 - uh the main character which is a black
01:08 - icon
01:09 - uh the
01:10 - ninja this is the main the boy ninja and
01:13 - then this is the girl ninja and then the
01:15 - ground so what let me explain a little
01:17 - bit so the black uh background i have uh
01:21 - both there's a taller one and there's a
01:23 - shorter one so the shorter one this is
01:25 - like a hitbox so we use that for the uh
01:28 - slide
01:29 - so um if you look at this right so let's
01:32 - say if i take this guy
01:33 - i take this i copy and i go to here
01:37 - and let me zoom out a little bit so if i
01:39 - paste it here you can see the hitbox and
01:41 - the ninja is about the same size right
01:43 - okay
01:44 - so similarly the uh the shorter one so
01:47 - i'm gonna take the short ninja uh the
01:49 - slide one so i'll go to the small one so
01:51 - you can see he's about the same size for
01:54 - the hitbox okay so that's why we can use
01:57 - like a ninja to slide under the spikes
02:00 - and stuff like that
02:01 - okay so hope you guys understand that
02:03 - part and then the next thing let's talk
02:05 - about the ground so basically the ground
02:08 - is like a design whatever you want to do
02:11 - so the design is the you can use it uh
02:14 - however you want and then the virtual
02:16 - ground is where we're gonna make the
02:18 - detection
02:19 - so so that way you know the ninja can
02:21 - jump on certain thing and not jump on
02:24 - other things so whatever you want to
02:25 - jump on to be able to jump on you have
02:27 - to put it in the virtual ground
02:29 - whatever decoration and stuff like that
02:31 - you don't want them to jump on then it
02:33 - can be in the
02:34 - ground sprite so for example let me take
02:37 - this
02:38 - so i take everything here
02:40 - so what you do is you let's say if you
02:41 - want to
02:43 - if you want to make a new one right so
02:44 - you can see if i post it here right you
02:46 - can see that
02:48 - my if i make everything go back layer
02:50 - you can see that the virtual ground is
02:52 - just the ground on top that way we can
02:55 - have the uh detection for the platform
02:57 - other than that everything
02:59 - you know you can jump on these so the
03:02 - spy cactus the break it you know
03:05 - the
03:06 - the
03:07 - the signs and all those are not a uh not
03:10 - something that the ninja can step on
03:12 - only the purple one this purple thing is
03:14 - where you can step up so let me go back
03:16 - you see that so so basically what you do
03:19 - is you can design your ground first
03:21 - after you design your ground however you
03:23 - want
03:24 - you take a copy copy everything
03:27 - and then in the virtual ground you
03:29 - create a new sprite
03:31 - and then you paste the uh
03:32 - the the thing that just copy on the
03:35 - ground and then you just make the make
03:37 - it look like you know however it is
03:39 - right
03:40 - so
03:41 - so let's say you see this is number
03:42 - three right so if you look at number
03:44 - three
03:45 - number three see this ground so what i
03:47 - did was i copied this and then i paste
03:50 - it here
03:51 - and then just adjust the uh the box so
03:54 - you can see right
03:56 - so if i take this
03:57 - do another copy
03:59 - go back over here you can see that see
04:02 - the the virtual ground and the uh
04:05 - and the ground is uh the same so you can
04:08 - see i have the
04:09 - the uh my
04:11 - purple box here that's where the ninja
04:13 - can stand on purple box here and purple
04:15 - boxes that's what the new skin stand on
04:17 - and then the tree stuff you can go
04:19 - behind all right
04:21 - so hopefully you guys understand that
04:24 - okay
04:26 - all right so that's about it so you can
04:29 - get this project and get this started so
04:32 - and then you have some more props here i
04:34 - added some props that you want to design
04:36 - your thing to be a little bit different
04:37 - you can add that and some objects here
04:40 - so you can use that for your game if you
04:42 - want to design different ground okay
04:45 - all right so i think let's get started
04:48 - all right so what you do is you can like
04:50 - make your copy of this project or you
04:52 - can remix it okay so for me i can say
04:55 - save as a copy
04:57 - okay so i'm gonna say
04:59 - i'm gonna change it to
05:03 - okay so it's gonna use this to teach you
05:05 - guys
05:07 - okay so let's go to our main character
05:10 - which is the black uh bar okay so uh the
05:14 - ninja girl gonna hide it i'm not using
05:16 - ninja go at the moment so we're gonna
05:18 - work on the main character so the main
05:20 - character basically is the uh the hitbox
05:22 - where we can do the control so let me go
05:25 - back to
05:26 - stage one go to the virtual ground stage
05:29 - one for now
05:30 - okay
05:31 - all right let's hide the medusa for now
05:33 - we don't need her okay
05:36 - okay
05:36 - and then this one let's select the
05:39 - standing up ninja for now okay all right
05:42 - so we'll work on on the black uh black
05:45 - black box all right
05:47 - all right so let's create some variable
05:50 - so here we'll create some variables so
05:52 - let's make a variable
05:54 - for offspring
05:57 - we'll call it level so this is like the
05:59 - show the level what level you're on okay
06:04 - and then let's make some uh more
06:06 - variable so uh right now i'm going to
06:08 - create all the variable in one go for
06:10 - this black uh icon
06:12 - character here okay so i can make uh
06:16 - for all the global variables basically
06:18 - all the variable can be seen by other
06:21 - sprite we're going to put g in the front
06:23 - okay so i'm going to say g
06:26 - gravity
06:28 - okay
06:29 - okay next
06:32 - i'm going to say g
06:34 - is
06:35 - player dead
06:37 - so this keep track the players dead or
06:39 - not
06:41 - make more variable so g
06:44 - um
06:46 - and then this is the mouse position what
06:47 - you can do is um
06:49 - you can use the uh
06:51 - use the mouse position to see where you
06:54 - want to put items so we can put that so
06:56 - let's have that
06:58 - and then next
07:00 - we'll go gee and let's go on ground
07:09 - okay
07:11 - all right let's continue
07:13 - go g
07:15 - speed
07:17 - takes
07:20 - another one g global variable underscore
07:25 - velocity
07:30 - okay
07:32 - okay so we have couple more variables uh
07:34 - this is the depth
07:38 - let's kind of keep track of how much
07:39 - that the ninja have
07:42 - uh so and then next one we'll
07:44 - do it for this sprite only
07:46 - and uh this is a deviation this is a
07:49 - basically a change in y
07:51 - all right so click that
07:53 - and then we'll make one more
07:55 - for the sprite only we'll call jumping
07:59 - so you can see all the one that with the
08:01 - global wearable doesn't have the main
08:03 - character and this one has a main
08:04 - character i use a long case okay
08:07 - all right so let's take out these things
08:09 - we don't really need them to show up
08:12 - on the screen
08:14 - okay except maybe level and death okay
08:17 - all right so we have
08:19 - our
08:21 - our basic uh variable so now let's try
08:24 - to work on it okay let's go back to the
08:26 - main character
08:27 - okay
08:28 - so
08:29 - when green flag is clicked
08:33 - okay
08:34 - i'm gonna set the size
08:38 - to 35
08:41 - and then we're gonna set the level
08:45 - to one so here we're gonna grab the
08:48 - variable
08:50 - so set
08:52 - level to one
08:54 - so that's our first level
08:56 - and we're going to make a
08:58 - custom block
08:59 - called reset
09:02 - um
09:03 - this one doesn't matter you can run well
09:04 - refresh or whatever it doesn't really
09:06 - matter this is just refreshing uh this
09:08 - is just resetting the variable
09:10 - but others other things like platform
09:12 - detection we do need it so this one we
09:15 - are going to say
09:17 - go to
09:19 - negative
09:20 - 200. and
09:22 - zero so that will go to somewhere like
09:25 - right here and then we'll make it drop
09:26 - down later okay all right so
09:30 - all right then now let's set our
09:31 - variable
09:32 - okay
09:34 - set
09:36 - let's play it dead
09:38 - i'm going to say false
09:40 - you can use true or false or yes and no
09:42 - doesn't matter
09:44 - okay next we're going to say
09:46 - set the gravity
09:48 - velocity i'm gonna put it zero
09:53 - and then we're gonna say um on ground
09:56 - we're gonna put that at zero
10:00 - and then we're gonna say uh gravity
10:06 - we're gonna put minus one
10:08 - okay
10:09 - and then we have one more
10:11 - jumping
10:13 - we're gonna go zero
10:14 - all right so this is like uh when the
10:17 - game will be set or when the player dies
10:18 - we're gonna try to recreate you know put
10:21 - the same location put the player back to
10:23 - the left and then reset this variable
10:27 - so now we're going to call this function
10:28 - reset
10:29 - okay and then we're gonna broadcast a
10:31 - couple of message
10:34 - i'll broadcast the first one i'm gonna
10:36 - call it start game
10:40 - all right broadcast a new one
10:44 - new message we're going to call it start
10:47 - new level
10:51 - okay so we have these two methods
10:54 - so for start game uh what we're going to
10:56 - do is let's scroll down over here a
10:58 - little bit
11:01 - so when i say start game
11:04 - um what i'm going to do is going to
11:06 - change the ghost effect
11:08 - for right now let's uh let's leave it
11:11 - but later we do need to set the ghost
11:13 - effect so that you don't see the uh
11:15 - the character
11:16 - right so so you want to only see the
11:19 - ninja but for now let's keep it right
11:21 - here
11:22 - okay we're gonna put the ghost effect in
11:23 - first and then we'll
11:25 - we'll do it we'll do it
11:26 - later okay set goes effect right now we
11:29 - keep it at zero so uh when the actual
11:32 - when we actually got it working we'll
11:33 - make it as 100 okay
11:35 - so for now we're gonna keep it at zero
11:38 - show
11:40 - okay
11:40 - and then we're gonna use a repeat until
11:45 - here we'll repeat until and then we'll
11:47 - use the
11:48 - equal operator
11:51 - uh take it take this player dead
11:55 - so the player that you go to true when
11:58 - the player die
11:59 - then repeat until that so when the
12:02 - player dies we're gonna restart
12:04 - everything but if his player is not dead
12:06 - yet so we're gonna broadcast whatever is
12:08 - inside so i'll broadcast
12:12 - a couple of things so we're gonna
12:13 - broadcast
12:15 - new message
12:17 - start all control
12:19 - [Music]
12:21 - message
12:28 - check
12:30 - platform
12:33 - detection
12:36 - okay
12:38 - broadcast a new message
12:41 - called
12:44 - check
12:46 - player
12:47 - position
12:48 - okay all right so we broadcast few of
12:51 - these
12:53 - okay so let's go to the my block
12:56 - make a new block
12:57 - called movement
13:00 - control
13:02 - make sure you select this run without
13:04 - refresh click ok
13:06 - so let's do our custom block all the way
13:09 - on top here so we have everything
13:11 - together
13:12 - we're going to do the
13:14 - if and else
13:16 - here
13:17 - okay so for the if and nails
13:21 - okay so what we're going to do is we're
13:22 - going to grab something here we're going
13:24 - to grab it in
13:26 - and then we're going to grab our oil and
13:27 - put it on the first block
13:29 - okay so what we're going to do is we're
13:31 - going to make the um
13:32 - key let's go to get
13:35 - one key press so what we're going to do
13:38 - is uh left left and right arrow keys so
13:41 - left arrow
13:44 - right arrow
13:44 - [Music]
13:46 - and then we'll make one more
13:48 - down arrow
13:50 - sorry down arrow
13:53 - so what we're going to do is we're going
13:55 - to make it go inside this if if it's a
13:57 - left arrow
13:58 - or a right arrow
14:02 - and oops
14:04 - grab it
14:06 - and let me zoom back out
14:10 - this one down arrow put this here okay
14:13 - so let's zoom out again so
14:17 - if it's left arrow or right arrow and
14:19 - down arrow we're gonna go in here we're
14:21 - gonna try to use the uh
14:25 - we're gonna use the custom number two
14:27 - which is the uh the shorter one
14:30 - otherwise we'll use the custom number
14:32 - one which is the taller black
14:34 - black icon right here okay
14:38 - okay
14:39 - and then we have
14:41 - another if and else
14:45 - control
14:46 - so put another if and else here
14:49 - and then inside here we put another if
14:51 - and else okay
14:53 - all right so now let's duplicate this
14:56 - it is right arrow
14:59 - we're going to set the uh
15:02 - the g speed x
15:05 - to 10
15:08 - okay and then we'll duplicate this
15:12 - and then duplicate that
15:15 - and then we'll put this as negative 10
15:19 - okay
15:20 - and then we'll
15:21 - okay one more we'll set this to zero
15:25 - okay
15:27 - all right so let's make the new block
15:31 - run without refresh
15:32 - uh this one the uh
15:34 - the name we're gonna say move
15:37 - hitbox
15:39 - okay
15:41 - and then we'll add a variable called
15:43 - speed x
15:45 - okay
15:46 - okay
15:48 - so here what we're going to do is
15:52 - we're gonna say change
15:56 - change this change x by
16:00 - speed x
16:02 - and then we're gonna set the
16:04 - variable called deviation which is the
16:07 - change of y
16:10 - we'll set it to zero
16:11 - let me zoom in a little bit more
16:17 - all right so next we're gonna say uh
16:22 - repeat until
16:24 - and then we're going to use the o
16:26 - operator
16:28 - then we're going to use the equal
16:31 - put in the deviation check here
16:34 - put in five so basically just like it's
16:37 - a change of why they're checking if it's
16:40 - equal to five or
16:42 - if it's touching
16:46 - the
16:47 - virtual ground
16:48 - which is this box here the the purple
16:50 - one okay
16:52 - uh not touching sorry
16:54 - not
16:57 - not touching okay
16:59 - so it was deviation equal to five or not
17:02 - touching the virtual ground
17:05 - we're gonna say
17:07 - change y
17:08 - by one
17:11 - and then change the
17:15 - change deviation by one
17:19 - and then we're gonna have an if
17:20 - condition here
17:23 - put it in the bottom
17:26 - if the deviation is equal to five
17:29 - we're gonna say
17:32 - change
17:34 - x by
17:36 - i'm going to use the up minus sign here
17:40 - put 0
17:41 - and then the speed x grab it from the
17:45 - and then
17:46 - you have to change y
17:52 - and you're going to get the operator
17:55 - again
17:57 - the subtract
17:58 - sign put
18:01 - zero
18:02 - and
18:03 - deviation here
18:05 - okay so this kind of move the hitbox and
18:08 - then uh
18:10 - making it
18:11 - go down
18:12 - within uh within certain
18:15 - points until it touches the virtual
18:18 - ground
18:20 - all right so what we're going to do is
18:21 - we're going to call the function so let
18:22 - me zoom back out a little bit
18:26 - so here where we have all these uh
18:28 - functions that we are calling right so
18:30 - um
18:31 - let's say
18:34 - when
18:36 - start all control
18:38 - we are going to call the movement
18:40 - control
18:42 - okay
18:44 - and then um
18:46 - event
18:48 - when i receive uh
18:50 - check platform detection
18:53 - um
18:54 - we have to call this moving um hitbox
19:02 - and then the g speed x
19:05 - i think i'm not sure it's gonna work
19:06 - exactly yet because i'm not completing
19:09 - all the code let me just test it out
19:12 - so let's try it out so what we had so
19:15 - far is kind of moving the box so it's
19:17 - not really detecting the platform so we
19:20 - do need to detect the platform
19:22 - so let's just try to finish this real
19:24 - quick it might be over 25 minutes but uh
19:26 - it will be a good stopping point after
19:28 - that
19:30 - okay
19:31 - all right so let's continue let's go
19:34 - back to my block
19:35 - create a new one
19:37 - we're going to call it check
19:39 - hit
19:40 - ground
19:41 - and we're going to use this on the
19:42 - boolean click the one in the middle is
19:45 - jumping
19:46 - okay
19:48 - make sure you have check without
19:49 - run while refresh okay so this is for
19:52 - the check move uh check the ground for
19:56 - the uh
19:58 - for the uh character jumping so let's go
20:02 - so we're gonna say repeat until
20:09 - repeat until
20:11 - okay let's zoom back in
20:14 - okay repeat until
20:16 - here inside here
20:19 - okay so now let's put in the operator
20:23 - knot
20:25 - and then we're gonna go to here i'm
20:27 - gonna grab that and say not touching the
20:29 - virtual ground
20:31 - and then we're gonna use some control
20:33 - here so if and else put this inside
20:37 - okay so we continue here so grab this
20:39 - one put this here
20:42 - uh go here say change y
20:46 - i minus one okay
20:49 - and then we're gonna say set
20:52 - uh the velocity
20:55 - to zero
20:57 - okay copy that
20:59 - and then this is plus one pushing the
21:01 - character back up
21:04 - and then we're gonna set the underground
21:07 - to one
21:10 - okay
21:11 - and then scroll down a little bit we'll
21:14 - get another if condition here
21:17 - put inside here
21:19 - we're going to use the operator equal
21:21 - sign
21:24 - using the jump
21:27 - if jumping equals to 1
21:31 - and then we're going to set it back to
21:36 - zero
21:37 - okay all right so this
21:40 - so this is to help to uh check if the
21:43 - player is touching the ground or not
21:46 - okay so that part is done
21:49 - okay so let's go to my block again so
21:51 - make a new block
21:53 - so make sure you have this on
21:56 - so the block this time we're gonna call
21:58 - jump control
22:01 - okay so
22:02 - after that
22:04 - we're almost done
22:06 - so use the if condition here
22:10 - and then
22:10 - check put another if condition inside
22:15 - so here let's go uh sensing
22:19 - uh key presses up arrow key
22:23 - okay
22:24 - and then we're going to use the n
22:26 - operator here
22:29 - use a greater than
22:32 - and then use the equal
22:35 - okay
22:36 - um
22:38 - you can use an equal also but i think i
22:40 - had earlier greater than
22:42 - uh for the on ground i think it's only
22:45 - once in zero it could be one equal to
22:47 - one is working as well so that's fine
22:50 - so
22:51 - we can put that here
22:53 - okay and then jumping we'll hit it zero
22:57 - so basically
22:59 - if it's on the ground and jumping is not
23:02 - jumping then we're gonna allow to jump
23:04 - so
23:04 - i'm gonna set
23:08 - so set the on ground
23:10 - to zero
23:12 - uh that means it's uh no longer on the
23:14 - ground when it's jumping up
23:16 - i'm gonna set the jumping to one
23:19 - i mean he's jumping
23:21 - and then we're going to set the
23:23 - g velocity to 15 that's how high you can
23:27 - jump
23:29 - okay
23:30 - all right so then we have the jump
23:31 - control
23:34 - okay all right so let's go back to uh
23:37 - our code here
23:39 - where we have all the broadcast messages
23:44 - so on here
23:47 - okay so we're gonna finish it up right
23:49 - now
23:51 - over here
23:52 - okay so we're going to call
23:56 - this one we'll put this on top of that
23:59 - and then we're going to use the operator
24:02 - copper zero here and then we're gonna
24:05 - check the g velocity
24:09 - okay so this will if it's greater than
24:12 - zero the g velocity then it will call
24:14 - this guy
24:16 - uh
24:20 - so we'll call this uh uh this function
24:23 - saying if it's jumping then it will do
24:25 - this logic here okay all right so we're
24:27 - done with that part so next we're gonna
24:30 - call the jump control here
24:34 - and then we're going to draw the if and
24:36 - else condition i think we're almost done
24:40 - and then we're going to use the sensing
24:43 - if it's the arrow here
24:47 - okay we're gonna change
24:52 - change the g velocity
24:55 - by the gravity
24:59 - okay the gravity is negative one
25:01 - okay
25:02 - and then otherwise
25:04 - we're gonna make it a little bit faster
25:06 - so we're gonna say
25:08 - you can't put negative two or something
25:09 - like that i think i haven't multiplied
25:11 - before so we're gonna continue use that
25:14 - multiply by two
25:17 - and then we're gonna have another one
25:19 - here say uh change
25:21 - change y
25:24 - change y by the g gravity
25:28 - i mean g velocity
25:30 - okay
25:31 - all right so i think should be good
25:33 - let's check it out
25:37 - okay so let's check it out so let's save
25:39 - it
25:40 - let's run it okay so we can move the
25:44 - black box you can see i can jump on the
25:46 - black box
25:48 - okay
25:50 - so you see i can slide so when i slide
25:52 - you see the black box change the smaller
25:54 - black box so seems like everything is
25:57 - fine
25:58 - so the next uh maybe uh the next uh
26:01 - video what we can do is we're gonna put
26:04 - the uh ninja overlaying on this black
26:06 - box and then we're gonna hide this black
26:09 - box make it the ghost effect 100 so
26:11 - you'll not see the black box you only
26:13 - see the ninja will make the ninja follow
26:15 - the uh
26:16 - the black box
26:17 - okay so that's the end of the video i
26:20 - hope you guys like the tutorial give us
26:22 - a thumbs up if you enjoyed the video so
26:24 - we'll probably cut uh continue with this
26:28 - with a couple more tutorials to finish
26:30 - out this game okay
26:32 - all right thank you guys
26:37 - [Music]
26:44 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hello welcome back guys to kids cooling playground so today we'll be working on the new ninja platformer i think i did that a while back maybe two years back so it wasn't really good they were having some bugs and stuff like that uh with the uh platform detection so we made a new one that is a lot better so so that's why i'm re recording the video to show you guys how to do that uh so if you want to uh start the project you can take look at this one called ninja platformer for class no code so this one has all the uh basic platform and stuff like that already there so you can go inside uh if you go inside you'll see like the uh the main character which is a black icon uh the ninja this is the main the boy ninja and then this is the girl ninja and then the ground so what let me explain a little bit so the black uh background i have uh both there's a taller one and there's a shorter one so the shorter one this is like a hitbox so we use that for the uh slide so um if you look at this right so let's say if i take this guy i take this i copy and i go to here and let me zoom out a little bit so if i paste it here you can see the hitbox and the ninja is about the same size right okay so similarly the uh the shorter one so i'm gonna take the short ninja uh the slide one so i'll go to the small one so you can see he's about the same size for the hitbox okay so that's why we can use like a ninja to slide under the spikes and stuff like that okay so hope you guys understand that part and then the next thing let's talk about the ground so basically the ground is like a design whatever you want to do so the design is the you can use it uh however you want and then the virtual ground is where we're gonna make the detection so so that way you know the ninja can jump on certain thing and not jump on other things so whatever you want to jump on to be able to jump on you have to put it in the virtual ground whatever decoration and stuff like that you don't want them to jump on then it can be in the ground sprite so for example let me take this so i take everything here so what you do is you let's say if you want to if you want to make a new one right so you can see if i post it here right you can see that my if i make everything go back layer you can see that the virtual ground is just the ground on top that way we can have the uh detection for the platform other than that everything you know you can jump on these so the spy cactus the break it you know the the the signs and all those are not a uh not something that the ninja can step on only the purple one this purple thing is where you can step up so let me go back you see that so so basically what you do is you can design your ground first after you design your ground however you want you take a copy copy everything and then in the virtual ground you create a new sprite and then you paste the uh the the thing that just copy on the ground and then you just make the make it look like you know however it is right so so let's say you see this is number three right so if you look at number three number three see this ground so what i did was i copied this and then i paste it here and then just adjust the uh the box so you can see right so if i take this do another copy go back over here you can see that see the the virtual ground and the uh and the ground is uh the same so you can see i have the the uh my purple box here that's where the ninja can stand on purple box here and purple boxes that's what the new skin stand on and then the tree stuff you can go behind all right so hopefully you guys understand that okay all right so that's about it so you can get this project and get this started so and then you have some more props here i added some props that you want to design your thing to be a little bit different you can add that and some objects here so you can use that for your game if you want to design different ground okay all right so i think let's get started all right so what you do is you can like make your copy of this project or you can remix it okay so for me i can say save as a copy okay so i'm gonna say i'm gonna change it to okay so it's gonna use this to teach you guys okay so let's go to our main character which is the black uh bar okay so uh the ninja girl gonna hide it i'm not using ninja go at the moment so we're gonna work on the main character so the main character basically is the uh the hitbox where we can do the control so let me go back to stage one go to the virtual ground stage one for now okay all right let's hide the medusa for now we don't need her okay okay and then this one let's select the standing up ninja for now okay all right so we'll work on on the black uh black black box all right all right so let's create some variable so here we'll create some variables so let's make a variable for offspring we'll call it level so this is like the show the level what level you're on okay and then let's make some uh more variable so uh right now i'm going to create all the variable in one go for this black uh icon character here okay so i can make uh for all the global variables basically all the variable can be seen by other sprite we're going to put g in the front okay so i'm going to say g gravity okay okay next i'm going to say g is player dead so this keep track the players dead or not make more variable so g um and then this is the mouse position what you can do is um you can use the uh use the mouse position to see where you want to put items so we can put that so let's have that and then next we'll go gee and let's go on ground okay all right let's continue go g speed takes another one g global variable underscore velocity okay okay so we have couple more variables uh this is the depth let's kind of keep track of how much that the ninja have uh so and then next one we'll do it for this sprite only and uh this is a deviation this is a basically a change in y all right so click that and then we'll make one more for the sprite only we'll call jumping so you can see all the one that with the global wearable doesn't have the main character and this one has a main character i use a long case okay all right so let's take out these things we don't really need them to show up on the screen okay except maybe level and death okay all right so we have our our basic uh variable so now let's try to work on it okay let's go back to the main character okay so when green flag is clicked okay i'm gonna set the size to 35 and then we're gonna set the level to one so here we're gonna grab the variable so set level to one so that's our first level and we're going to make a custom block called reset um this one doesn't matter you can run well refresh or whatever it doesn't really matter this is just refreshing uh this is just resetting the variable but others other things like platform detection we do need it so this one we are going to say go to negative 200. and zero so that will go to somewhere like right here and then we'll make it drop down later okay all right so all right then now let's set our variable okay set let's play it dead i'm going to say false you can use true or false or yes and no doesn't matter okay next we're going to say set the gravity velocity i'm gonna put it zero and then we're gonna say um on ground we're gonna put that at zero and then we're gonna say uh gravity we're gonna put minus one okay and then we have one more jumping we're gonna go zero all right so this is like uh when the game will be set or when the player dies we're gonna try to recreate you know put the same location put the player back to the left and then reset this variable so now we're going to call this function reset okay and then we're gonna broadcast a couple of message i'll broadcast the first one i'm gonna call it start game all right broadcast a new one new message we're going to call it start new level okay so we have these two methods so for start game uh what we're going to do is let's scroll down over here a little bit so when i say start game um what i'm going to do is going to change the ghost effect for right now let's uh let's leave it but later we do need to set the ghost effect so that you don't see the uh the character right so so you want to only see the ninja but for now let's keep it right here okay we're gonna put the ghost effect in first and then we'll we'll do it we'll do it later okay set goes effect right now we keep it at zero so uh when the actual when we actually got it working we'll make it as 100 okay so for now we're gonna keep it at zero show okay and then we're gonna use a repeat until here we'll repeat until and then we'll use the equal operator uh take it take this player dead so the player that you go to true when the player die then repeat until that so when the player dies we're gonna restart everything but if his player is not dead yet so we're gonna broadcast whatever is inside so i'll broadcast a couple of things so we're gonna broadcast new message start all control message check platform detection okay broadcast a new message called check player position okay all right so we broadcast few of these okay so let's go to the my block make a new block called movement control make sure you select this run without refresh click ok so let's do our custom block all the way on top here so we have everything together we're going to do the if and else here okay so for the if and nails okay so what we're going to do is we're going to grab something here we're going to grab it in and then we're going to grab our oil and put it on the first block okay so what we're going to do is we're going to make the um key let's go to get one key press so what we're going to do is uh left left and right arrow keys so left arrow right arrow and then we'll make one more down arrow sorry down arrow so what we're going to do is we're going to make it go inside this if if it's a left arrow or a right arrow and oops grab it and let me zoom back out this one down arrow put this here okay so let's zoom out again so if it's left arrow or right arrow and down arrow we're gonna go in here we're gonna try to use the uh we're gonna use the custom number two which is the uh the shorter one otherwise we'll use the custom number one which is the taller black black icon right here okay okay and then we have another if and else control so put another if and else here and then inside here we put another if and else okay all right so now let's duplicate this it is right arrow we're going to set the uh the g speed x to 10 okay and then we'll duplicate this and then duplicate that and then we'll put this as negative 10 okay and then we'll okay one more we'll set this to zero okay all right so let's make the new block run without refresh uh this one the uh the name we're gonna say move hitbox okay and then we'll add a variable called speed x okay okay so here what we're going to do is we're gonna say change change this change x by speed x and then we're gonna set the variable called deviation which is the change of y we'll set it to zero let me zoom in a little bit more all right so next we're gonna say uh repeat until and then we're going to use the o operator then we're going to use the equal put in the deviation check here put in five so basically just like it's a change of why they're checking if it's equal to five or if it's touching the virtual ground which is this box here the the purple one okay uh not touching sorry not not touching okay so it was deviation equal to five or not touching the virtual ground we're gonna say change y by one and then change the change deviation by one and then we're gonna have an if condition here put it in the bottom if the deviation is equal to five we're gonna say change x by i'm going to use the up minus sign here put 0 and then the speed x grab it from the and then you have to change y and you're going to get the operator again the subtract sign put zero and deviation here okay so this kind of move the hitbox and then uh making it go down within uh within certain points until it touches the virtual ground all right so what we're going to do is we're going to call the function so let me zoom back out a little bit so here where we have all these uh functions that we are calling right so um let's say when start all control we are going to call the movement control okay and then um event when i receive uh check platform detection um we have to call this moving um hitbox and then the g speed x i think i'm not sure it's gonna work exactly yet because i'm not completing all the code let me just test it out so let's try it out so what we had so far is kind of moving the box so it's not really detecting the platform so we do need to detect the platform so let's just try to finish this real quick it might be over 25 minutes but uh it will be a good stopping point after that okay all right so let's continue let's go back to my block create a new one we're going to call it check hit ground and we're going to use this on the boolean click the one in the middle is jumping okay make sure you have check without run while refresh okay so this is for the check move uh check the ground for the uh for the uh character jumping so let's go so we're gonna say repeat until repeat until okay let's zoom back in okay repeat until here inside here okay so now let's put in the operator knot and then we're gonna go to here i'm gonna grab that and say not touching the virtual ground and then we're gonna use some control here so if and else put this inside okay so we continue here so grab this one put this here uh go here say change y i minus one okay and then we're gonna say set uh the velocity to zero okay copy that and then this is plus one pushing the character back up and then we're gonna set the underground to one okay and then scroll down a little bit we'll get another if condition here put inside here we're going to use the operator equal sign using the jump if jumping equals to 1 and then we're going to set it back to zero okay all right so this so this is to help to uh check if the player is touching the ground or not okay so that part is done okay so let's go to my block again so make a new block so make sure you have this on so the block this time we're gonna call jump control okay so after that we're almost done so use the if condition here and then check put another if condition inside so here let's go uh sensing uh key presses up arrow key okay and then we're going to use the n operator here use a greater than and then use the equal okay um you can use an equal also but i think i had earlier greater than uh for the on ground i think it's only once in zero it could be one equal to one is working as well so that's fine so we can put that here okay and then jumping we'll hit it zero so basically if it's on the ground and jumping is not jumping then we're gonna allow to jump so i'm gonna set so set the on ground to zero uh that means it's uh no longer on the ground when it's jumping up i'm gonna set the jumping to one i mean he's jumping and then we're going to set the g velocity to 15 that's how high you can jump okay all right so then we have the jump control okay all right so let's go back to uh our code here where we have all the broadcast messages so on here okay so we're gonna finish it up right now over here okay so we're going to call this one we'll put this on top of that and then we're going to use the operator copper zero here and then we're gonna check the g velocity okay so this will if it's greater than zero the g velocity then it will call this guy uh so we'll call this uh uh this function saying if it's jumping then it will do this logic here okay all right so we're done with that part so next we're gonna call the jump control here and then we're going to draw the if and else condition i think we're almost done and then we're going to use the sensing if it's the arrow here okay we're gonna change change the g velocity by the gravity okay the gravity is negative one okay and then otherwise we're gonna make it a little bit faster so we're gonna say you can't put negative two or something like that i think i haven't multiplied before so we're gonna continue use that multiply by two and then we're gonna have another one here say uh change change y change y by the g gravity i mean g velocity okay all right so i think should be good let's check it out okay so let's check it out so let's save it let's run it okay so we can move the black box you can see i can jump on the black box okay so you see i can slide so when i slide you see the black box change the smaller black box so seems like everything is fine so the next uh maybe uh the next uh video what we can do is we're gonna put the uh ninja overlaying on this black box and then we're gonna hide this black box make it the ghost effect 100 so you'll not see the black box you only see the ninja will make the ninja follow the uh the black box okay so that's the end of the video i hope you guys like the tutorial give us a thumbs up if you enjoyed the video so we'll probably cut uh continue with this with a couple more tutorials to finish out this game okay all right thank you guys you
