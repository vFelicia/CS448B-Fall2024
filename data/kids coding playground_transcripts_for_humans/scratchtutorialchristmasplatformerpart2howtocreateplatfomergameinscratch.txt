00:03 - [Music]
00:10 - so welcome back guys it's kids coding
00:12 - flickround here
00:13 - today we'll be finishing the second part
00:15 - of the christmas platformer
00:17 - so from yesterday we had this code so
00:20 - like all this
00:21 - i'm gonna slowly go through it so if you
00:23 - did not finish anything
00:25 - you can do it right now you can pause
00:26 - the video
00:28 - and then we have the animated character
00:30 - that's it
00:31 - and then yesterday from yesterday we
00:33 - were able to make the player move around
00:35 - with friction
00:37 - so yeah that was what we did from
00:39 - yesterday
00:40 - so uh we're going to
00:44 - work on the pla main character now so
00:48 - let's go here so remember from the move
00:51 - player x speed x we're going to work on
00:54 - this
00:55 - so we have a variable called deviation
00:57 - so
00:58 - the variables without g in front of it
01:00 - are for this sprite only
01:02 - you have to make deviation for this
01:03 - sprite only it's a variable so you're
01:06 - just going to do this set the deviation
01:07 - to zero
01:08 - so what deviation is for is for the
01:10 - collision with walls and stuff like that
01:12 - so we're going to repeat until repeat
01:15 - until
01:17 - uh deviation is equal to 8 or
01:20 - not touching ground so before i had
01:23 - deviation equals
01:24 - 5 which does not work out very well
01:26 - because like you can glitch through the
01:28 - candy canes on one of my levels
01:30 - so you want to do eight so it depends on
01:32 - what your levels look like so i'm just
01:34 - doing
01:34 - i'm gonna do eight then we're gonna get
01:36 - a knot
01:37 - touching ground so if it's not touching
01:39 - the ground
01:41 - touching ground
01:45 - okay and then we're gonna change the y
01:47 - by one
01:48 - change y by one
01:51 - and then we're gonna change the
01:52 - deviation by 1.
01:55 - and after that we're going to get an if
01:57 - then statement so um if else statement
01:59 - so let's go control
02:01 - and if else statement put it under this
02:03 - thing so we're going to get if
02:05 - if it's touching the ground if touching
02:08 - ground
02:10 - uh and so this is for the wall jumping
02:12 - so we're going to put in if else in the
02:13 - first if then statement
02:15 - if then slot and then if the key
02:18 - up or the w is being pressed so
02:22 - i'm gonna do if key up
02:25 - up or w so duplicate that w
02:31 - uh right there so this is for wall
02:34 - jumping
02:35 - and and then we're going to get another
02:37 - if else statement so go to control
02:40 - and we're going to put that in the first
02:41 - slot
02:44 - um and i actually think this is not
02:46 - supposed to be an if else sorry about
02:47 - that
02:48 - it's supposed to be an if then not an if
02:49 - else so the first
02:51 - this if touching ground should be an if
02:53 - then so put that right there
02:55 - ground and then put this in like that so
02:58 - if
02:59 - key up or key w is being pressed then
03:02 - we are going to in this fl statement
03:04 - we're going to do
03:05 - if that whatever that speed x is right
03:08 - here
03:09 - is greater than zero
03:12 - so zero is greater so we're going to get
03:15 - speed x than zero
03:18 - then we're going to set the speed x and
03:20 - negative 16. so this is the wall jumping
03:22 - script
03:23 - set g speed x to negative 16.
03:28 - else we're going to set g speed x to 16
03:34 - and then we're gonna set in here right
03:37 - here we're going to set the
03:39 - on ground to zero set
03:42 - on ground to zero
03:45 - so when uh on ground is equal to zero
03:48 - that means
03:49 - the player is inside the air and then
03:52 - next we're going to use the jumping
03:53 - variable we made i think so jumping it's
03:56 - for the sprite only
03:57 - we're gonna set jumping to one jumping
03:59 - to one means
04:01 - it's jumping in progress so we're gonna
04:02 - set jumping to one
04:04 - and then we're gonna set the g velocity
04:09 - to ten so that's gonna be the velocity
04:11 - and then we're gonna change the x by
04:14 - the g speed x change x
04:18 - by g speed x
04:21 - we're here and after that we're going to
04:23 - get uh
04:24 - else right here we're going to set the g
04:26 - speed x to zero
04:28 - okay and then after this we're going to
04:30 - get an if that statement
04:31 - if
04:34 - deviation is equal to eight
04:38 - if deviation is equal to eight
04:44 - deviation right here then we're going to
04:47 - do
04:47 - a change x change
04:51 - x by zero minus sx
04:55 - so that's going to be speed x the zero
04:57 - minus whatever
04:58 - the value speed x is so i'm going to get
05:01 - a subtraction symbol
05:03 - 0 minus the speed x
05:09 - so after that we're going to duplicate
05:11 - this i mean not duplicate it we're going
05:12 - to get change
05:13 - y instead to change the y
05:16 - by zero we duplicate this though instead
05:19 - of speed x we're going to
05:20 - minus it by the deviation
05:25 - okay so after that this is the code for
05:28 - the wall jumping
05:30 - and like collision script
05:33 - okay so next we want to make another
05:36 - custom block
05:37 - so we're going to call it jumping
05:42 - and we want to click the run screen
05:44 - without refresh
05:46 - right here so we have the jumping now
05:48 - let's define it
05:50 - okay so we're gonna get if then
05:52 - statement
05:53 - we're gonna just duplicate this if he
05:56 - up arrow or w is being pressed put that
05:59 - in here
06:02 - now we're gonna get another if then
06:03 - statement
06:05 - if the g on ground is greater than zero
06:08 - this means
06:09 - it is on the ground if it's greater than
06:11 - zero so
06:12 - if the g on ground is greater than zero
06:15 - that means it is on the ground
06:16 - if it's equal to zero then it's in the
06:19 - air so
06:20 - it's greater than zero it's on the
06:22 - ground
06:23 - okay so we're only going to allow the
06:26 - person to
06:27 - jump if it's on the ground so we're
06:29 - gonna have to set
06:31 - the g on ground
06:35 - g on ground to zero so if the player is
06:38 - on the ground
06:39 - that means we're gonna set it g on
06:40 - ground to zero that means you can jump
06:42 - and we're gonna set jump into one so
06:45 - then you can actually jump
06:47 - jumping a one and then we're going to
06:49 - set the g velocity to 15.
06:56 - okay so now we're finished with the
06:57 - jumping custom block
06:59 - remember what we did right here in start
07:01 - all control we're gonna have to
07:03 - um call up some more functions right
07:06 - here
07:06 - so right here we're gonna call jumping
07:08 - as well along with the movement control
07:12 - okay so this is we're gonna get an if
07:14 - else statement so this is like
07:15 - jumping gravity and all that stuff so
07:17 - when you're falling down
07:19 - you'll fall quicker and when you're
07:21 - jumping up you'll
07:22 - uh fall slower so when you're jumping
07:26 - falling down from like right here you're
07:27 - gonna fall faster so we're going to get
07:29 - an if-else statement
07:30 - duplicate this code up arrow or key w
07:34 - and put that right here and then after
07:37 - that
07:38 - we're going to go to the variables and
07:41 - then we're going to change
07:43 - the g velocity
07:46 - velocity by the g gravity
07:49 - g gravity and then
07:52 - else we're going to change the g
07:55 - velocity by g gravity
07:56 - by times two so g gravity
08:00 - we define right here as negative one
08:03 - right here so that means if you multiply
08:06 - it
08:06 - by two that means it'll be negative two
08:09 - so you're going to fall faster
08:12 - if you're falling down from the high
08:13 - area so like that
08:16 - and then after that we're going to
08:17 - change the y by the g
08:19 - velocity so the g velocity is going to
08:22 - be
08:23 - the y so we can change y by the g
08:25 - velocity
08:28 - g velocity okay
08:32 - so now we've done all of that so as you
08:35 - can see right now
08:36 - when you click the play they'll just
08:38 - fall down
08:39 - immediately because we have not done the
08:42 - ground detection
08:43 - so that's why the ground is not working
08:45 - right now
08:46 - so you have to um just we're gonna add
08:49 - the code later
08:51 - after this so like when you click play
08:53 - the ground is not detecting it's not
08:54 - blocking him
08:55 - so now let's work on the script for that
08:59 - so we're gonna define a new custom block
09:03 - let's make a new block so we're gonna
09:05 - click the run screen
09:06 - without refresh and then we're going to
09:08 - name this block
09:10 - check hit ground so we're going to name
09:13 - it
09:14 - check hit ground
09:17 - so to detect if it's hitting the ground
09:19 - and we're going to add a boolean
09:20 - input we're going to call it is jump
09:25 - so is jumping fun screen that refresh
09:28 - okay and then we're going to click ok
09:32 - right here and now we can define this
09:34 - thing
09:36 - so we're going to repeat until control
09:40 - repeat until repeat until not touching
09:43 - ground
09:46 - touching ground uh
09:51 - and then if we're going to get an if
09:52 - else statement
09:55 - so we're going to put this right here so
09:57 - later we will define
09:58 - we'll call this function so you don't
10:00 - have to worry about it right now
10:02 - we'll call it later so then if it's not
10:04 - touching the ground
10:05 - then so like you you spawn right here
10:08 - right
10:08 - so we're gonna keep on decreasing the y
10:10 - by negative one
10:12 - so change y by negative one and then
10:15 - we're going to set the g
10:16 - velocity to zero
10:20 - g velocity to zero
10:24 - and after that else we're gonna change
10:26 - the y by one so then it will constantly
10:29 - push the player up on the ground so then
10:30 - it won't fall through
10:32 - that's why we did the run screen without
10:33 - refresh so then it's always refreshing
10:36 - so then
10:37 - it's always updating so the player will
10:38 - never fall through so we're gonna change
10:41 - the y by one
10:42 - the run screen that refresh just makes
10:44 - it immediate so then it won't
10:46 - fall through so that's what it does so
10:49 - then we're gonna do change y by one
10:52 - change y by one so then it'll keep on
10:55 - pushing it up
10:56 - we're gonna set the g velocity to zero
11:00 - and then set on ground to one
11:04 - set on the ground to one
11:09 - okay so on ground is greater than one so
11:13 - right here okay so we set the uh
11:16 - g on ground to one because it's on the
11:18 - ground because right here
11:20 - we defined it right here as if
11:23 - the g on ground is greater than one that
11:26 - means it's on the ground
11:28 - okay so now we have to add another if
11:30 - then statement let's go to control
11:32 - if jumping is equal to one
11:37 - if jumping is equal to one
11:41 - uh then we're gonna set jumping back to
11:43 - zero
11:45 - set jumping to zero
11:49 - okay and then now we're gonna have to
11:51 - define what this boolean input is
11:53 - so next we're gonna get a check
11:56 - platform detections from up here we
11:59 - broadcasted check
12:00 - platform detection right here so now
12:02 - we're gonna receive it
12:04 - so we're here when i receive
12:08 - check platform detection we're gonna get
12:10 - this boolean input
12:12 - so if the g velocity is greater than
12:15 - zero this is what
12:17 - this is is jumping is g velocity
12:20 - greater than zero the velocity
12:25 - is greater than zero
12:29 - okay so that's what we're gonna put
12:30 - there
12:32 - okay so now let's try it out
12:36 - okay now let's try it out so as you can
12:39 - see
12:40 - now it is uh blocking the player from
12:43 - falling down
12:45 - so now you can um move on the ground
12:48 - pretty fine and you have a little bit of
12:51 - friction
12:53 - okay now i think we can work
12:56 - on maybe the spikes and we can create
12:58 - one level
12:59 - okay also
13:02 - since we coded the jumping now you can
13:04 - actually jump so let's play it
13:06 - you can move around you can jump so
13:08 - that's what we can do right now
13:10 - jump and move around
13:14 - so yeah we will work on the other levels
13:16 - now so let's go
13:18 - so for the ground we have uh
13:23 - a bunch of costumes i'm just gonna use
13:24 - the first costume right now
13:26 - we're just gonna do one level for
13:27 - testing so let's go
13:30 - let's start out on the spikes so we're
13:33 - going to be using
13:34 - columns so in the spikes i'm going to
13:36 - get it when green fly clicked
13:39 - it's too big uh when green flag is
13:42 - clicked
13:43 - point direction of 90 because in one
13:45 - level i made it flip upside down so if
13:47 - you are going to make
13:48 - spikes flip upside down you have to make
13:49 - it point direction of 90 in the
13:51 - beginning
13:51 - and we're going to make it go to the
13:53 - front layer and hide in the beginning
13:56 - we're going to make a new my block
13:59 - place clone at so we're going to be
14:02 - using clones like i said
14:04 - put two inputs one has to be at x and
14:06 - one
14:07 - is y okay so then click okay
14:09 - [Music]
14:11 - and then we're going to set the x and y
14:14 - so we're going to make its
14:15 - other new variables so i think we
14:18 - already have them right here
14:19 - as you can see we have x and y so
14:22 - for the x and y we have to make them for
14:24 - this sprite only so
14:26 - make the x and y variable for just the
14:28 - spikes only so we're going to set the x
14:32 - to this x and we're going to set the y
14:36 - to this y and after that we're going to
14:40 - show
14:41 - and create a clone of myself
14:47 - okay after creating a clone when i start
14:49 - as a clone
14:51 - we want to go to the x and y so
14:55 - go to whatever the x and y value is
14:59 - which is this
15:04 - okay and then next we want to um
15:09 - we want to receive a message called
15:11 - reset okay so now
15:13 - let's go to the main character so before
15:15 - we can finish the spikes
15:16 - we have to broadcast a message from the
15:18 - main character so remember we had this
15:20 - check player position so we're gonna
15:22 - need it
15:23 - check player position player position
15:27 - so and then we're going to get forever
15:28 - loop forever loop
15:31 - um if you don't have to worry about the
15:34 - top right now
15:35 - yet but we'll need it later so we're
15:37 - just going to add it right now
15:38 - so if touching green flag and level is
15:41 - less than 11 um i did 10 levels that's
15:45 - why
15:45 - um 11 levels um so we're just gonna do
15:48 - like three levels right now so i'm just
15:50 - going to do it less than three
15:52 - so then we're going to do touching green
15:54 - flag
15:56 - green flag and then we're gonna
16:00 - um less than
16:04 - i'm just gonna do three for now um level
16:09 - the variable level then we're gonna
16:11 - change the level by one
16:14 - so like when you touch the green flag
16:15 - change the level by one
16:18 - change level by one and then we're gonna
16:20 - broadcast a message
16:22 - then we're going to name it start new
16:24 - level
16:27 - start new level
16:31 - okay and then start new level we're
16:32 - going to broadcast it into here so
16:35 - let's broadcast start new level right
16:37 - here in the main character so
16:39 - start new level we're going to
16:44 - we're going to broadcast reset and wait
16:50 - um we're gonna broadcast reset a new
16:53 - message
16:56 - reset and we're gonna broadcast setup so
16:59 - these are for like the other sprites
17:01 - setup is when you
17:02 - need multiple and yeah that's these are
17:05 - for the
17:06 - basically those obstacles and then we're
17:09 - gonna broadcast
17:10 - another start new level so when i
17:11 - receive start new level
17:15 - uh then we're gonna reset the player
17:19 - reset player and we're gonna broadcast
17:21 - start game
17:24 - start game
17:28 - okay okay so now
17:31 - after this we're going to go to the
17:32 - spikes so let's go to the spike code
17:36 - okay so now in the spikes we're going to
17:39 - get
17:40 - a reset so like this is when you reset
17:43 - you're gonna have to delete all the
17:44 - clones so when i receive reset
17:47 - delete this clone
17:51 - and then down here in setup this is
17:52 - setting up all of these
17:54 - spikes so setup we are going to set the
17:57 - x and y to zero
17:59 - in the beginning set
18:02 - x and set y to zero
18:05 - x and y
18:10 - and then we're going to get a if level
18:12 - is equal to one we only have one level
18:14 - right now
18:15 - so if level is equal to one
18:20 - so level one level
18:23 - and then we're going to use the place to
18:25 - clone block so you can just show
18:27 - the spikes like you can move this out of
18:30 - the way
18:31 - you can like drag it maybe like right
18:33 - here and then i'll show the x and y
18:35 - let's go back to the spikes and then we
18:38 - just write the x
18:39 - which is uh 17. and the y
18:43 - is negative 150 okay so spikes obviously
18:47 - don't kill you right now
18:48 - but as you can see they will place the
18:50 - spikes there
18:52 - and you can jump around there's a little
18:53 - bit friction
18:55 - so yeah that's basically it for this
18:58 - tutorial
18:59 - and actually one last thing before we
19:00 - end the video we actually want to add a
19:02 - little bit more code
19:04 - so right here we're going to go to the
19:05 - ground when green fly clicked go to zero
19:07 - zero let's go to the center
19:10 - go to zero zero and then we're gonna get
19:13 - a forever loop
19:15 - forever if level is
19:19 - less than four okay so if the level is
19:21 - less than four
19:23 - we're just gonna do four for now level
19:26 - and we're gonna switch the costume to
19:28 - whatever level it is
19:30 - switch costume to level
19:33 - put that in here okay so now when you
19:36 - touch the green flag as you can see
19:37 - let's play
19:38 - it when you touch the green flag it will
19:40 - switch to the next level
19:43 - you can see wall jumping is working as
19:45 - well
19:46 - so yeah as you can see it's going to the
19:49 - next level but it's not fully
19:50 - functioning yet
19:52 - so yeah that's basically it for this
19:53 - tutorial um
19:55 - if you enjoyed this video be sure to
19:56 - leave a like and subscribe
19:58 - and ring the notification bell as well
20:00 - see you guys in the next video
20:04 - bye
20:06 - [Music]
20:11 - you

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys it's kids coding flickround here today we'll be finishing the second part of the christmas platformer so from yesterday we had this code so like all this i'm gonna slowly go through it so if you did not finish anything you can do it right now you can pause the video and then we have the animated character that's it and then yesterday from yesterday we were able to make the player move around with friction so yeah that was what we did from yesterday so uh we're going to work on the pla main character now so let's go here so remember from the move player x speed x we're going to work on this so we have a variable called deviation so the variables without g in front of it are for this sprite only you have to make deviation for this sprite only it's a variable so you're just going to do this set the deviation to zero so what deviation is for is for the collision with walls and stuff like that so we're going to repeat until repeat until uh deviation is equal to 8 or not touching ground so before i had deviation equals 5 which does not work out very well because like you can glitch through the candy canes on one of my levels so you want to do eight so it depends on what your levels look like so i'm just doing i'm gonna do eight then we're gonna get a knot touching ground so if it's not touching the ground touching ground okay and then we're gonna change the y by one change y by one and then we're gonna change the deviation by 1. and after that we're going to get an if then statement so um if else statement so let's go control and if else statement put it under this thing so we're going to get if if it's touching the ground if touching ground uh and so this is for the wall jumping so we're going to put in if else in the first if then statement if then slot and then if the key up or the w is being pressed so i'm gonna do if key up up or w so duplicate that w uh right there so this is for wall jumping and and then we're going to get another if else statement so go to control and we're going to put that in the first slot um and i actually think this is not supposed to be an if else sorry about that it's supposed to be an if then not an if else so the first this if touching ground should be an if then so put that right there ground and then put this in like that so if key up or key w is being pressed then we are going to in this fl statement we're going to do if that whatever that speed x is right here is greater than zero so zero is greater so we're going to get speed x than zero then we're going to set the speed x and negative 16. so this is the wall jumping script set g speed x to negative 16. else we're going to set g speed x to 16 and then we're gonna set in here right here we're going to set the on ground to zero set on ground to zero so when uh on ground is equal to zero that means the player is inside the air and then next we're going to use the jumping variable we made i think so jumping it's for the sprite only we're gonna set jumping to one jumping to one means it's jumping in progress so we're gonna set jumping to one and then we're gonna set the g velocity to ten so that's gonna be the velocity and then we're gonna change the x by the g speed x change x by g speed x we're here and after that we're going to get uh else right here we're going to set the g speed x to zero okay and then after this we're going to get an if that statement if deviation is equal to eight if deviation is equal to eight deviation right here then we're going to do a change x change x by zero minus sx so that's going to be speed x the zero minus whatever the value speed x is so i'm going to get a subtraction symbol 0 minus the speed x so after that we're going to duplicate this i mean not duplicate it we're going to get change y instead to change the y by zero we duplicate this though instead of speed x we're going to minus it by the deviation okay so after that this is the code for the wall jumping and like collision script okay so next we want to make another custom block so we're going to call it jumping and we want to click the run screen without refresh right here so we have the jumping now let's define it okay so we're gonna get if then statement we're gonna just duplicate this if he up arrow or w is being pressed put that in here now we're gonna get another if then statement if the g on ground is greater than zero this means it is on the ground if it's greater than zero so if the g on ground is greater than zero that means it is on the ground if it's equal to zero then it's in the air so it's greater than zero it's on the ground okay so we're only going to allow the person to jump if it's on the ground so we're gonna have to set the g on ground g on ground to zero so if the player is on the ground that means we're gonna set it g on ground to zero that means you can jump and we're gonna set jump into one so then you can actually jump jumping a one and then we're going to set the g velocity to 15. okay so now we're finished with the jumping custom block remember what we did right here in start all control we're gonna have to um call up some more functions right here so right here we're gonna call jumping as well along with the movement control okay so this is we're gonna get an if else statement so this is like jumping gravity and all that stuff so when you're falling down you'll fall quicker and when you're jumping up you'll uh fall slower so when you're jumping falling down from like right here you're gonna fall faster so we're going to get an ifelse statement duplicate this code up arrow or key w and put that right here and then after that we're going to go to the variables and then we're going to change the g velocity velocity by the g gravity g gravity and then else we're going to change the g velocity by g gravity by times two so g gravity we define right here as negative one right here so that means if you multiply it by two that means it'll be negative two so you're going to fall faster if you're falling down from the high area so like that and then after that we're going to change the y by the g velocity so the g velocity is going to be the y so we can change y by the g velocity g velocity okay so now we've done all of that so as you can see right now when you click the play they'll just fall down immediately because we have not done the ground detection so that's why the ground is not working right now so you have to um just we're gonna add the code later after this so like when you click play the ground is not detecting it's not blocking him so now let's work on the script for that so we're gonna define a new custom block let's make a new block so we're gonna click the run screen without refresh and then we're going to name this block check hit ground so we're going to name it check hit ground so to detect if it's hitting the ground and we're going to add a boolean input we're going to call it is jump so is jumping fun screen that refresh okay and then we're going to click ok right here and now we can define this thing so we're going to repeat until control repeat until repeat until not touching ground touching ground uh and then if we're going to get an if else statement so we're going to put this right here so later we will define we'll call this function so you don't have to worry about it right now we'll call it later so then if it's not touching the ground then so like you you spawn right here right so we're gonna keep on decreasing the y by negative one so change y by negative one and then we're going to set the g velocity to zero g velocity to zero and after that else we're gonna change the y by one so then it will constantly push the player up on the ground so then it won't fall through that's why we did the run screen without refresh so then it's always refreshing so then it's always updating so the player will never fall through so we're gonna change the y by one the run screen that refresh just makes it immediate so then it won't fall through so that's what it does so then we're gonna do change y by one change y by one so then it'll keep on pushing it up we're gonna set the g velocity to zero and then set on ground to one set on the ground to one okay so on ground is greater than one so right here okay so we set the uh g on ground to one because it's on the ground because right here we defined it right here as if the g on ground is greater than one that means it's on the ground okay so now we have to add another if then statement let's go to control if jumping is equal to one if jumping is equal to one uh then we're gonna set jumping back to zero set jumping to zero okay and then now we're gonna have to define what this boolean input is so next we're gonna get a check platform detections from up here we broadcasted check platform detection right here so now we're gonna receive it so we're here when i receive check platform detection we're gonna get this boolean input so if the g velocity is greater than zero this is what this is is jumping is g velocity greater than zero the velocity is greater than zero okay so that's what we're gonna put there okay so now let's try it out okay now let's try it out so as you can see now it is uh blocking the player from falling down so now you can um move on the ground pretty fine and you have a little bit of friction okay now i think we can work on maybe the spikes and we can create one level okay also since we coded the jumping now you can actually jump so let's play it you can move around you can jump so that's what we can do right now jump and move around so yeah we will work on the other levels now so let's go so for the ground we have uh a bunch of costumes i'm just gonna use the first costume right now we're just gonna do one level for testing so let's go let's start out on the spikes so we're going to be using columns so in the spikes i'm going to get it when green fly clicked it's too big uh when green flag is clicked point direction of 90 because in one level i made it flip upside down so if you are going to make spikes flip upside down you have to make it point direction of 90 in the beginning and we're going to make it go to the front layer and hide in the beginning we're going to make a new my block place clone at so we're going to be using clones like i said put two inputs one has to be at x and one is y okay so then click okay and then we're going to set the x and y so we're going to make its other new variables so i think we already have them right here as you can see we have x and y so for the x and y we have to make them for this sprite only so make the x and y variable for just the spikes only so we're going to set the x to this x and we're going to set the y to this y and after that we're going to show and create a clone of myself okay after creating a clone when i start as a clone we want to go to the x and y so go to whatever the x and y value is which is this okay and then next we want to um we want to receive a message called reset okay so now let's go to the main character so before we can finish the spikes we have to broadcast a message from the main character so remember we had this check player position so we're gonna need it check player position player position so and then we're going to get forever loop forever loop um if you don't have to worry about the top right now yet but we'll need it later so we're just going to add it right now so if touching green flag and level is less than 11 um i did 10 levels that's why um 11 levels um so we're just gonna do like three levels right now so i'm just going to do it less than three so then we're going to do touching green flag green flag and then we're gonna um less than i'm just gonna do three for now um level the variable level then we're gonna change the level by one so like when you touch the green flag change the level by one change level by one and then we're gonna broadcast a message then we're going to name it start new level start new level okay and then start new level we're going to broadcast it into here so let's broadcast start new level right here in the main character so start new level we're going to we're going to broadcast reset and wait um we're gonna broadcast reset a new message reset and we're gonna broadcast setup so these are for like the other sprites setup is when you need multiple and yeah that's these are for the basically those obstacles and then we're gonna broadcast another start new level so when i receive start new level uh then we're gonna reset the player reset player and we're gonna broadcast start game start game okay okay so now after this we're going to go to the spikes so let's go to the spike code okay so now in the spikes we're going to get a reset so like this is when you reset you're gonna have to delete all the clones so when i receive reset delete this clone and then down here in setup this is setting up all of these spikes so setup we are going to set the x and y to zero in the beginning set x and set y to zero x and y and then we're going to get a if level is equal to one we only have one level right now so if level is equal to one so level one level and then we're going to use the place to clone block so you can just show the spikes like you can move this out of the way you can like drag it maybe like right here and then i'll show the x and y let's go back to the spikes and then we just write the x which is uh 17. and the y is negative 150 okay so spikes obviously don't kill you right now but as you can see they will place the spikes there and you can jump around there's a little bit friction so yeah that's basically it for this tutorial and actually one last thing before we end the video we actually want to add a little bit more code so right here we're going to go to the ground when green fly clicked go to zero zero let's go to the center go to zero zero and then we're gonna get a forever loop forever if level is less than four okay so if the level is less than four we're just gonna do four for now level and we're gonna switch the costume to whatever level it is switch costume to level put that in here okay so now when you touch the green flag as you can see let's play it when you touch the green flag it will switch to the next level you can see wall jumping is working as well so yeah as you can see it's going to the next level but it's not fully functioning yet so yeah that's basically it for this tutorial um if you enjoyed this
