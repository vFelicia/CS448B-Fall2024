00:00 - thank you
00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - welcome back guys it's kids from
00:08 - playground here and today we're back
00:09 - with another video on Scratch and today
00:11 - someone asked us to make a clicker game
00:13 - on scratch so that's exactly what we did
00:15 - here and we made a farm clicker game uh
00:18 - it's just a really cool idea so we made
00:20 - a fun clicker game and let's just start
00:23 - so this is just a demo for the game by
00:26 - the way the tutorial will be coming out
00:27 - next week
00:29 - so we started the game we have our
00:31 - dancing chicken moving back and around a
00:34 - little flash over here to click and then
00:36 - you get one score this is your CPS
00:39 - basically how much score you get for
00:41 - each click which is one here so we're
00:44 - gonna try to get 50 here to get to like
00:46 - the sound is really annoying
00:49 - but yeah we're gonna try to get to maybe
00:52 - lower this out a little bit
00:53 - [Music]
00:55 - because I'm gonna try to get to 50 and
00:58 - once we get that we can buy chicken and
00:59 - then chickens uh you see the increased
01:02 - variable here so that's that's how much
01:05 - chickens you have and these are the
01:07 - default units these are the mega units
01:08 - and then after when you get that a
01:11 - chicken will probably give you one every
01:12 - two I think and then after that these
01:15 - are down here are tools to help you get
01:17 - this is a times two multiplier this is a
01:19 - times ten this is a times uh 100.
01:23 - so this is times 10.
01:26 - let's get this so objective of this game
01:30 - is to try to get really rich you see
01:31 - there's a world record thing over here
01:33 - that shows how much you get oh that's
01:36 - the world record
01:37 - so our goal is sure probably can't try
01:40 - to get the whole so I'm gonna do some
01:43 - off camera so
01:44 - so I did some clicking off camera and
01:47 - then I got the hoe and now I got the
01:50 - wheelbarrow but and now my CPS you see
01:53 - it increases so this is at times 10 and
01:55 - this one's Attack 100 so I hit 100
01:58 - and off camera I also got some llamas I
02:01 - got a horse a dog and a few dogs and a
02:05 - few chickens so there is gonna be a cap
02:07 - for each animal so
02:11 - um Captain chickens is 150 dog is uh I'm
02:14 - not mistaken 100 and of course is 75
02:19 - um llama is
02:21 - 50 and uh rainbow llama is actually
02:26 - going to be I think it's actually
02:29 - 25 yeah and then the Griffin is
02:35 - three yeah three and then the uh the
02:39 - king is the King Dragon is one so you
02:43 - see I'm just gonna spam the default ones
02:44 - right now and I'm gonna try to get one
02:47 - of these good characters off camera
02:48 - Maybe
02:49 - so yeah let's see
02:52 - so I maxed out the chickens the dogs the
02:55 - horses and now I'm gonna Max up the
02:57 - llamas so we Max them all out and we'll
03:00 - try to get one of these God units see if
03:04 - if you do not
03:05 - um if you this is the max cap so if you
03:08 - you can't go higher than that it'll give
03:09 - you a little text Max maximum units
03:11 - reached and if you try to get these it
03:14 - says you do not have enough money to buy
03:16 - this item if you do not have enough
03:18 - money to buy this item so basically the
03:21 - pens will give wonder if there's like
03:22 - three seconds this one will give one to
03:25 - ten
03:27 - yeah one no one to five every second and
03:30 - this will give 35 every three seconds
03:33 - and this will give
03:35 - if I'm not sticking 60
03:37 - every two seconds maybe I don't know and
03:40 - these God units are really good so we're
03:44 - gonna try to get one and see
03:46 - and I'll try to show you how they
03:48 - basically do
03:50 - so off camera I got some more so I have
03:53 - enough to buy two God llamas maximum is
03:56 - 25 so let's just buy two and you see
03:59 - they'll give you only 60k
04:01 - uh 60k every I think like three-ish
04:07 - seconds and we're gonna try to get a
04:09 - Griffin and experience around you see
04:13 - I'm about to get
04:15 - um I maxed out the llamas the Griffins
04:17 - and all the default ones as well as I
04:21 - bought all of these and I'm about to get
04:22 - King Dragon so
04:25 - spot King Dragon it has its own custom
04:27 - little buying effect
04:30 - and as you can see if I'm not mistaken
04:32 - it'll give like
04:34 - uh
04:36 - uh something like 60 million every
04:39 - second every two seconds or issue so
04:42 - it's basically a game I maxed out the
04:45 - game it's pretty fun not gonna lie and
04:48 - tutorial is coming out next week so you
