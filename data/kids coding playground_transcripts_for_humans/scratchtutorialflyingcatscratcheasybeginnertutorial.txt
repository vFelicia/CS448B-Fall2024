00:01 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys today and another
00:10 - kids coding playground episode and today
00:13 - we will be making a new game called the
00:15 - flying cat
00:16 - so the point of the game is for the cat
00:19 - to get the balloons and the yeah and to
00:22 - get the balloons to get points so and
00:27 - the flying cat game we will be learning
00:31 - these concepts in scratch understanding
00:34 - broadcasting messages using the
00:37 - variables when key pressed hoops pick
00:40 - random in the next costume so these are
00:43 - some things we'll be learning so this is
00:46 - the demo for the game so I'm just gonna
00:49 - make it larger
00:49 - there is music so and you might not be
00:52 - able to hear me as well but so I won't
00:55 - talk that so so you can move around and
00:59 - then catch the balloons in the clouds in
01:04 - and the points are going up in the
01:06 - clouds and buildings or decorations as
01:09 - you can see so I'm gonna make a new
01:13 - project and I'll be teaching you how to
01:17 - make this game before it start can you
01:22 - please like share and subscribe to
01:25 - support our channel please um so yes
01:30 - okay so first let's go to the let's
01:33 - delete the straight one the the regular
01:36 - so let's go to the background get the if
01:40 - the flag clicked then get the forever
01:43 - because we want the music to play
01:45 - forever we're letting the background
01:46 - play it so you go to the sounds you can
01:48 - use any music you want but I'm using um
01:52 - it's gonna loop so see I'm gonna use
01:55 - dance celebration yep this one so I'll
02:00 - be using this one and then you take
02:03 - place ound dance celebration until done
02:06 - so we got to get our sprites now so we
02:11 - can get the flying cats
02:14 - so let's get the flying scat sprite
02:16 - right there we need the buildings bright
02:22 - right there
02:24 - we need the cloud sprite let's see if I
02:28 - can search this oh it's right I think
02:29 - it's ready yes right there you can also
02:34 - get the balloon sprite so I search this
02:38 - up there we go so oh yes I forgot about
02:44 - the background so let's go to the
02:45 - backdrop let's see what we can get like
02:47 - sky theme related so let's go a blue sky
02:51 - so let's get straight to the thing and
02:56 - let's start at the buildings so if a
03:01 - flag click the zoom out a little bit as
03:04 - if flag click we always start out with
03:06 - this one control forever always set yeah
03:13 - yeah I think I can go one bigger set x2
03:20 - 250 so I'll stay there next costume so
03:29 - we keep on changing costumes like it's a
03:31 - different building and repeat a hundred
03:34 - times people punch it and then put
03:39 - change X by minus five so pause the
03:44 - video when you need it and if I'm going
03:47 - a little bit too quick so this is a code
03:50 - for the building now
03:51 - let's move on to the clouds the clouds
03:56 - you always have to start out with the
03:59 - green flag clicked forever because it
04:03 - has to do it forever set Y to pick
04:09 - random one one to 180 so I'll pick a
04:15 - random Y from 1 to 180 set X to 250
04:27 - 250 next costume so yeah it will keep on
04:34 - because the clouds has costumes as well
04:37 - so repeat 50 times change X by negative
04:51 - 10 so that's the cloud sprite so if I'm
04:57 - going to click again you can pause the
04:59 - video if you need it so we're moving
05:04 - onto the balloon spray this is what the
05:07 - scratch cat the flying cat collects so
05:10 - if green flag clicked that will show go
05:19 - forever goes always forever next costume
05:26 - go to random position because it's going
05:29 - to the random position set X to 250 so
05:34 - go set X to 250 repeat 32 times so we'll
05:41 - keep on going for 32 times change X by
05:46 - negative 15 so we're not done with the
05:51 - balloon right yet but then you will be
05:56 - going back to here later cause it has
06:01 - broadcasting inside and we want to do
06:03 - the receiving messages later so it's not
06:05 - that confusing so let's go to the cat
06:07 - now so always start out if the green
06:11 - flag is clicked go to the front layer
06:16 - say Oscar zoom a little bit 1 I think
06:20 - that's enough say time to flop in time
06:26 - to say anything you won but I because
06:33 - he's flying I would write time to fly so
06:36 - and then you
06:38 - need up-arrow let's go here like you so
06:41 - you can move it with the arrow keys so
06:43 - we can use WASD if you want but let's do
06:47 - up here I'll change Y by 10 so we can
06:55 - duplicate that and change this to the
06:58 - down arrow and change it to negative 10
07:00 - because the down arrow is the opposite
07:02 - of the up arrow so let's go the right
07:06 - arrow and left arrow so the right arrow
07:10 - just put a little bit here the right
07:13 - arrow is X because it's right and left
07:16 - is X so change X by 10 you can duplicate
07:21 - it that again and change it negatively
07:23 - and change it to a negative 10 so we're
07:28 - not done with the code here yet we have
07:30 - to do if then green flag clicked no if
07:35 - green flag clicked again and then we
07:37 - have to make a variable called points so
07:46 - the points will be like a score but
07:50 - today I decided to use points so set
07:53 - points to zero always in the beginning a
07:57 - forever loop but if then loop so two
08:02 - loops if then it's touching balloon
08:05 - because that's how how the cat gets
08:09 - points so it's been touching the balloon
08:12 - broadcast touch building let's make the
08:16 - message so you go to the balloon and
08:29 - we're not done as I said earlier because
08:31 - it's broadcasting messages when I
08:34 - receive touch balloon will change the
08:36 - points because that's how it gets bonds
08:37 - so change points by one so it's gonna
08:42 - hide after when you get it and it's
08:45 - going to wait two seconds and show again
08:48 - wait Tuesday
08:50 - and show again and I suppose that's all
08:56 - the code so let's always have to click
09:00 - the Save button and then let's rename
09:03 - this to flying cat flying hat so now we
09:17 - can click the music if you look the
09:21 - clouds and buildings thank you for
09:35 - watching and have a good day
09:40 - [Music]

but so I won't talk that so so you can move around and then catch the balloons in the clouds in and the points are going up in the clouds and buildings or decorations as you can see so I'm gonna make a new project and I'll be teaching you how to make this game before it start can you please like share and subscribe to support our channel please um so yes okay so first let's go to the let's delete the straight one the the regular so let's go to the background get the if the flag clicked then get the forever because we want the music to play forever we're letting the background play it so you go to the sounds you can use any music you want but I'm using um it's gonna loop so see I'm gonna use dance celebration yep this one so I'll be using this one and then you take place ound dance celebration until done so we got to get our sprites now so we can get the flying cats so let's get the flying scat sprite right there we need the buildings bright right there we need the cloud sprite let's see if I can search this oh it's right I think it's ready yes right there you can also get the balloon sprite so I search this up there we go so oh yes I forgot about the background so let's go

I'm going to click again you can pause the video if you need it so we're moving onto the balloon spray this is what the scratch cat the flying cat collects so if green flag clicked that will show go forever goes always forever next costume go to random position because it's going to the random position set X to 250 so go set X to 250 repeat 32 times so we'll keep on going for 32 times change X by negative 15 so we're not done with the balloon right yet but then you will be going back to here later cause it has broadcasting inside and we want to do the receiving messages later so it's not that
