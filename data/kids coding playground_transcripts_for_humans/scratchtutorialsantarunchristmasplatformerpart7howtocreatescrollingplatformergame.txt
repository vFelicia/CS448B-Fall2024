00:03 - [Music]
00:08 - hello scratcher
00:09 - welcome back to our kids calling
00:11 - playground so today we are doing the
00:13 - santa run part seven
00:17 - i think we probably have a couple more
00:19 - parts to go before we finish
00:21 - the enemy is kind of hard so today we're
00:23 - gonna plan to work on the spike
00:25 - and then the uh maybe the um
00:29 - the next level okay with the igloo
00:32 - so um we're gonna do that
00:35 - so for now let's pick up the igloo
00:38 - sprite
00:39 - from my backdrop i think you guys have
00:42 - this already
00:43 - in your i might have uploaded if not
00:45 - i'll check later
00:46 - so uh this is pretty simple you have
00:49 - that i just got added some
00:50 - ice block put it in here in the igloo
00:53 - okay
00:54 - i believe you guys have that if not i'll
00:57 - update later
00:58 - to the drive to boot right so um
01:01 - okay let's get started so last time we
01:03 - did the uh
01:04 - the sound so this is all for the sound
01:08 - make sure you get the correct uh list
01:11 - okay the soundless
01:13 - if it's one then we play the sound after
01:15 - we play the sound we'll make it back to
01:17 - zero
01:17 - okay so that way you know you will not
01:19 - play this down multiple time
01:22 - uh same thing in the other one
01:25 - and then last time we also work on the
01:28 - background scrolling
01:29 - so uh this is the code for that so you
01:32 - miss that
01:33 - you can add it in okay uh so
01:36 - today we're gonna work on the include to
01:38 - after you hit the igloo the
01:40 - center will jump up and then we can move
01:42 - on to the next level
01:43 - so when we move on to the next level we
01:45 - need to call the uh
01:46 - level two here okay so now we're gonna
01:48 - do the spike
01:49 - first okay okay let's move on to the
01:53 - spike
01:54 - so the spike is uh really similar to um
01:58 - you know other other thing that we had
02:00 - like the virtual ground you know
02:02 - uh what we can do is uh we can copy some
02:05 - of the code from
02:06 - from the virtual ground or what not and
02:08 - then we're gonna
02:10 - change it okay so for now let's grab
02:12 - this
02:13 - grab the reset grab the setup
02:17 - [Music]
02:18 - grab the movement
02:22 - grab the clone
02:26 - and position
02:30 - okay i hope we have all of that let's
02:33 - just kind of space it out a bit
02:37 - okay move ground
02:40 - setup reset
02:43 - and then start okay so we are going to
02:47 - change a bit for the spike
02:49 - okay in the beginning we want to
02:51 - actually hide it
02:53 - okay let's drop all that uh we actually
02:56 - don't need to set
02:57 - any position because it's gonna be move
02:59 - around with the spike
03:01 - so uh placing the cone myself we don't
03:04 - need this
03:04 - okay delete that because we're actually
03:07 - putting at the wherever the position is
03:09 - we're not moving
03:10 - 480 like like the other one we're not
03:13 - going to use one we're going to use
03:14 - number here
03:16 - um so what we're gonna do
03:19 - is okay so this one will be a little bit
03:24 - different we will not put the x here
03:26 - okay what we're going to do is we're
03:29 - going to say
03:30 - clear clone myself
03:34 - and then we can put the show here
03:37 - okay and then um
03:41 - when i create that when i create a clone
03:43 - myself so what we're going to do
03:45 - is we're going to move them to the
03:47 - position
03:50 - when i start as a clone okay
03:54 - so um i'm going to move this to this x
03:57 - and y we have set it up here right the x
03:59 - and y
04:00 - we're going to change all this later
04:01 - okay don't worry about that so for now
04:03 - let's just continue with this one
04:06 - um what we can do is
04:10 - we're going to use this forever loop
04:15 - and then we are going to get a if
04:17 - condition
04:18 - here
04:21 - okay and then we are saying
04:26 - sensing with
04:30 - touching the main character okay
04:33 - basically this character here
04:35 - and then we'll use another control here
04:41 - inside this if i'm gonna check the
04:43 - animated type
04:44 - so what happened is uh when you
04:48 - um this animated type is like when it's
04:51 - like
04:52 - dying or something like that we don't
04:53 - want it to die again right so what we're
04:55 - going to
04:56 - check for zero so zero meaning uh
04:59 - the uh center is still alive nothing had
05:02 - happened to him
05:03 - he's well and good okay
05:06 - and then we are going to use the another
05:09 - if statement here
05:12 - okay here we are going to check
05:15 - uh you remember like when the center
05:17 - died right um the sound
05:20 - i recorded myself uh here ouch in
05:24 - like whatever you like so that's my
05:26 - sound recorded
05:27 - so we're gonna play that sound so the
05:29 - ouch is the
05:30 - second one right so what we're going to
05:33 - do is we'll go back here
05:36 - and then we say um let's get the
05:38 - operator here
05:41 - uh go to the uh the list
05:47 - now we make sure you select the sound
05:49 - one okay
05:50 - number two so basically if it's item
05:53 - number two is equal to zero
05:57 - then we'll replace it
05:59 - [Music]
06:03 - okay replace item number two
06:06 - with one so that way it will it will
06:09 - play
06:09 - okay so when let's say easy this one
06:12 - when it's one then it will play and then
06:14 - we'll set it back to zero
06:15 - so when we wanna play we wanna make sure
06:17 - we set it to one
06:19 - so we when the spike hits the
06:22 - center we want to play the sound right
06:24 - also we want to
06:25 - set something here called hit
06:31 - so this is right here one is touching it
06:35 - okay okay sorry
06:38 - about that um this is actually inside
06:41 - here
06:42 - when it's actually uh animated type is
06:44 - zero so we don't wanna
06:45 - keep on broadcasting when they touch the
06:48 - character
06:49 - only if it's not dead we want to
06:51 - broadcast one time
06:54 - i mean set this one time so that way you
06:56 - know it will
06:58 - know that it's get hit and then we'll
06:59 - deduct one life on it
07:01 - okay so put it inside the um
07:04 - this condition here the animation type
07:06 - equal to zero
07:07 - okay so i'll explain
07:10 - i'll explain how we actually use this
07:13 - head so this hit is actually go to here
07:16 - you see this right then
07:19 - somewhere here
07:26 - so the hit is actually here in the
07:28 - animated sprite
07:30 - here so when it gets hit we'll make make
07:32 - it dead and then we'll do this uh
07:34 - that animation okay all right so it's
07:37 - right here
07:38 - okay now let's go back to the this one
07:41 - here
07:43 - so we want to make sure that when it's
07:46 - uh
07:47 - when it's reset we're gonna delete all
07:49 - the clone
07:51 - when it's set up we're gonna change this
07:54 - out a little bit
07:55 - okay so exactly the back layer will make
07:58 - it go to the front layer
08:00 - okay so we want the spike to show up
08:02 - okay
08:03 - uh what i'm going to do is i'm going to
08:06 - make it
08:06 - point in direction 90 and also make sure
08:09 - your spike is uh
08:12 - so so we should use this one um
08:15 - this not this one because we're gonna
08:17 - flip them upside down
08:19 - so uh that's why you wanna use put the
08:21 - spike on this one all around okay
08:26 - so um when you play this
08:29 - we are going to put the clone at
08:32 - i have some coordinate already done but
08:35 - i'll show you why
08:36 - what you can do okay uh negative
08:43 - negative 95
08:46 - okay so so as you can see um
08:50 - later i'll run there and then you can
08:52 - see it but uh not yet this is not ready
08:54 - yet
08:54 - so um we have to fix something else
08:57 - let's see if everything is good we have
09:00 - the g
09:00 - scrolling done this is should be good
09:05 - the position one um
09:09 - clone that that's fine uh the clone one
09:13 - that looks
09:13 - fine let's throw this away
09:17 - and then the position one
09:21 - that looks like it's fine and
09:25 - yeah that looks fine now let's just try
09:27 - it out so let's save it
09:31 - okay so let's see we have any uh yep
09:34 - there's a that's the spike is here
09:40 - okay so as you can see this spike is
09:43 - here so uh what you can do is
09:45 - um you want to know the direction right
09:48 - you can put it anywhere i mean you can
09:50 - put it anywhere
09:51 - for me i put in the background but it
09:53 - doesn't matter
09:54 - uh you can put it like in the main
09:56 - character but main character and all
09:57 - this is too many things there
09:59 - so we don't want to put it there so what
10:01 - you can do is this
10:05 - when the m key is pressed basically the
10:08 - mouse or whatever
10:09 - i'm in position so we're gonna say let
10:12 - me see if i have those variable
10:14 - um yeah i have a mouse position so we're
10:16 - going to set this
10:19 - so set global
10:23 - mouth position okay i'm going to use
10:26 - some join here
10:30 - and then we're going to use another
10:31 - joint
10:32 - [Music]
10:35 - and then we are going to use a plus sign
10:38 - as a plus sign
10:44 - okay uh we're gonna use the mouse button
10:47 - i think it's in sensing mouse
10:50 - x and then we're gonna say plus
10:56 - the scroll x okay
10:59 - put that into the first join
11:02 - now we can put a comma here and a space
11:07 - and then we can take this duplicate
11:10 - we're gonna use mouse
11:11 - y uh this one we can right click and say
11:15 - scroll why or you can just delete it and
11:19 - drag one here
11:20 - okay go back to sensing so
11:23 - almost y then we'll put it here
11:28 - so you can see so it's joining this
11:30 - comma
11:31 - and then this put that here
11:34 - and then you can call this thing called
11:38 - show variable
11:42 - mouse position okay all right so let's
11:45 - just check it out
11:46 - so let's run it so let's say i want to
11:49 - put a um
11:50 - put the spike here you can click click
11:53 - the m
11:53 - key you see this is 40 80 whatever
11:56 - negative 80.
11:58 - so if you put here you can put one
12:02 - like let's say duplicate this 40
12:06 - negative 95 whatever so because i'm
12:08 - using 95 right so
12:10 - it will be correct so you see so if you
12:13 - if you have it at negative 80 or
12:15 - whatever it might be too high you can
12:17 - just adjust that so let's run this you
12:19 - see every 8 is too high because
12:22 - even though i push the m key here right
12:25 - so you see i push the m key here because
12:27 - you have to put in the middle right so
12:28 - you see this is too high
12:30 - so yeah you know it should be somewhere
12:32 - here so i have negative 95 so
12:35 - you can just adjust it okay adjust it
12:37 - any way you want
12:39 - okay so i have it like this then i have
12:41 - two
12:42 - right so you see i have two
12:45 - [Music]
12:46 - okay so that's how you put multiple of
12:49 - these uh
12:50 - little uh red spikes so
12:53 - let's go back to my coat i still have a
12:57 - little bit more to do
12:58 - so um i have some um some of the spike
13:02 - let's say i wanted to uh
13:04 - flip him upside down i'll delete this i
13:05 - don't need the first one
13:07 - uh so if i want to flip it upside down
13:10 - you can change this direction
13:12 - right uh to negative 90.
13:16 - okay and then we're gonna create some
13:19 - chrome here actually
13:21 - uh i'm gonna create a rows of spike
13:24 - i already have coordinates for it so if
13:26 - you don't have it you can have to move
13:28 - it to that location and put it
13:30 - so for me you know i have it as 184
13:35 - negative 26
13:40 - 1902
13:44 - negative 26 i should have duplicate
13:48 - from this one so i have less typing but
13:50 - anyway
13:51 - let's just finish that uh
13:55 - this is one nine nine five
13:59 - and two zero seven zero
14:02 - okay so this is the row of spike where
14:06 - center can slide through so i turn it
14:08 - upside down
14:10 - and then you wanna turn it back up then
14:12 - you have to say
14:13 - point direction 90. i'll do one more
14:17 - clone i think i have one more spike at
14:18 - the end and my original game
14:21 - i'll put one more here uh two
14:24 - two four five zero and then
14:28 - that's negative 95. okay so that's my
14:32 - spike so let's run that real quick
14:36 - so you can see you have the
14:40 - center here and then you have the row of
14:42 - spikes coming up
14:44 - see there you go so i have to slide
14:47 - through
14:48 - if i don't slide through and get stuck
14:50 - hit that and i'm gonna die
14:51 - so see so this is the last one so this
14:54 - is that row of spike and i flip it back
14:56 - upside down i'm gonna flip my right side
14:59 - up and then i put this last one
15:00 - so you can click the mouse here you see
15:02 - it's 240
15:04 - 50 you see that 249.95 so
15:07 - somewhere like that okay so that's how
15:10 - it
15:10 - is so for the spike
15:13 - okay so what we're going to do is we're
15:15 - going to add this include the in that
15:17 - the center jump on it goes to the next
15:19 - level
15:20 - so right now i don't have any code so
15:21 - just grab the code from here
15:23 - let's move it from the spike
15:26 - one the reset to
15:30 - set up three
15:33 - so this one
15:36 - four five
15:40 - six and seven okay
15:44 - i think we have all the coal the clones
15:47 - down here
15:49 - movement here you can place them any way
15:51 - you like
15:52 - but i'm trying to put them the same as
15:55 - the other one
15:56 - so kind of easy to see
15:59 - okay all right so we have the igloo
16:03 - so the include i'm trying to put at the
16:05 - end so we actually don't need all this
16:08 - too many things here so let's throw that
16:11 - away oops we'll leave one of the clone
16:16 - okay let's go from the top first make
16:18 - sure that is correct so we want to high
16:20 - in the beginning
16:23 - the position plays the clone position
16:27 - that is the same so show
16:30 - okay the other one the position
16:34 - that should be the same okay things
16:37 - change there
16:39 - the clone here is we have to that is not
16:42 - gonna die
16:42 - right so when i touch the main character
16:45 - what we want to do
16:46 - is we want to podcast
16:51 - broadcast events
16:54 - saying new message
16:59 - next level okay
17:02 - and then what we want to do is we also
17:05 - want to stop this
17:06 - uh script so we don't want to go forever
17:10 - okay stop the script
17:14 - and we can trash all this
17:18 - okay so we have the scrolling i think
17:20 - the scrolling is fine the x and y
17:23 - is scrolling very good uh so this one we
17:26 - want to put it at
17:29 - i have it cornered down but if you don't
17:31 - you have to go to the end
17:32 - and try to get it so you remember we
17:35 - were like
17:35 - really close like two thousand five
17:37 - hundred i mean four hundred fifty so
17:39 - somewhere down we go three thousand
17:41 - three hundred so we're gonna put it at
17:44 - negative sixty
17:47 - okay all right so now let's check it out
17:50 - so um oh this will still not work yet
17:52 - because the next level we haven't coded
17:54 - yet
17:55 - so let's call that first okay so let's
17:58 - go back to
17:58 - our main character okay
18:02 - let's call it here
18:05 - when i receive a next level
18:09 - okay uh what i want to do is i'm going
18:12 - to stop everything else
18:17 - stop other script in the sprite
18:21 - okay i want to stop everything
18:26 - we'll broadcast a message
18:28 - [Music]
18:30 - now we're broadcasting wait sorry
18:35 - new message called
18:38 - victory okay whatever you like so that
18:42 - means
18:42 - he got to the end and then we're gonna
18:44 - broadcast a new message
18:47 - call stop new level
18:50 - okay that's already there okay so we're
18:52 - gonna do this victory dance and then
18:54 - we'll podcast a new level
18:56 - and then this is a next level broadcast
18:58 - when you touch that igloo
18:59 - okay so you glue will touch and call
19:01 - that
19:02 - okay all right okay so now let's go back
19:06 - to the center so we need to fix the uh
19:10 - because we broadcast victory right we
19:11 - want to make him dance a little bit
19:14 - so um center here uh when i receive
19:20 - uh victory so let's zoom in a little bit
19:25 - uh what we want to do we want to stop
19:27 - out of script in the sprite as well
19:30 - okay and then we're going to change this
19:34 - level
19:35 - so we're from level 1 we're going to
19:36 - change it to level two
19:38 - change level by one okay
19:42 - and then what i'm going to do is i'm
19:44 - gonna switch the cost to
19:50 - uh jump okay i'm gonna switch the jump
19:52 - custom
19:54 - and then i say uh repeat
19:58 - 15 times
20:01 - and then i will say change y
20:04 - by five
20:07 - okay and then look
20:10 - next costume
20:14 - uh and then uh switch it back to the
20:17 - first costume actually
20:20 - oops sorry i don't mean him to jump up
20:23 - so now we're going to change it back to
20:25 - negative 5
20:28 - okay and then after that we want to stop
20:31 - the spoon
20:37 - stop this grip okay so when i get to the
20:41 - igloo it'll jump up
20:43 - i just repeat 15 times i think that's i
20:45 - have 15 costume of jump costume or
20:47 - something
20:48 - let's just take a look so let's look at
20:51 - jump you see
20:52 - i have a jump one two
20:54 - [Music]
20:55 - jump yeah 15 you see even 16.
20:59 - so yeah so doesn't matter so i actually
21:02 - have 16 but anyway
21:04 - so i repeated 15 you can repeat 16 if
21:07 - you like
21:08 - doesn't matter uh okay yeah i repeat 15
21:12 - because we already switched it to the
21:13 - first costume so second
21:15 - let's go into the next costume right so
21:17 - that's why it's 15. okay
21:18 - got it so 15 is correct uh because we
21:21 - have 16 custom and we already switch it
21:23 - to the first one
21:25 - so now that this will go to the next
21:27 - custom right so what you had to do is uh
21:29 - for the next level you have to make your
21:31 - clone if not
21:32 - there was nothing for the centers to
21:34 - stand on right he'll fall
21:36 - okay so let's go to the ground i will do
21:39 - real quick
21:41 - um same thing here we'll do
21:45 - duplicate we'll say two
21:49 - and we are going to use the uh switch to
21:52 - costume
21:53 - number two one and we will place
21:58 - the clone
22:01 - at zero zero
22:05 - zero one i'm just gonna do two for now
22:07 - uh but
22:09 - but whatever it is you know depending on
22:11 - how many custom you have for number two
22:14 - so for me i have what what seven right
22:16 - so zero
22:17 - two one two two seven two eight see
22:21 - two eight so actually it will be it's
22:23 - starting on zero so it will be
22:25 - until seven so you can
22:29 - duplicate this this is two
22:32 - let's duplicate this again so three
22:36 - four five
22:41 - let's duplicate two more six
22:45 - and then seven and then put this back in
22:49 - okay so now we have the level two done
22:52 - for this so same thing here so
22:55 - you want to
22:58 - put this here and call that level two
23:04 - and select two will be one two three
23:07 - four
23:08 - so seven right okay so we got all the
23:12 - background and this guy done so you need
23:15 - to put more spike
23:16 - of course level two you're gonna have to
23:17 - add spike
23:19 - right and then for the igloo same thing
23:21 - if you want to go to level three you're
23:23 - gonna have to add that
23:24 - so for now let's just test it
23:28 - okay let me take out the mouse position
23:32 - let's see if it works let's make it
23:35 - bigger screen
23:37 - okay all right santa's jumping around we
23:40 - don't have the
23:41 - any enemy at the moment pretty easy
23:44 - [Music]
23:48 - so
23:50 - okay so you can see they have a include
23:53 - here
23:54 - yep so if i jump on it so you see
23:57 - center jump now he's on level two okay
24:01 - so this is level two
24:05 - so i had yeah built you can build it any
24:07 - way you want so
24:08 - i built it like this so this is my level
24:11 - two
24:12 - a little bridge and uh this is a little
24:16 - slide
24:18 - so so this is for me for my original
24:20 - game i put the uh
24:22 - another um we call it the
24:25 - include here so it goes to level three
24:27 - okay all right so
24:29 - this is fine working fine so as you can
24:33 - see we can go backward as well
24:35 - right so okay all right
24:38 - so i think we'll stop the uh stop the
24:42 - tutorial until here so next time we can
24:45 - work on the
24:46 - items the snowflake and then the enemy i
24:49 - think we're almost done
24:50 - maybe two more uh video i think the
24:53 - enemy is a little
24:54 - complicated and explain that pretty well
24:56 - also the item
24:58 - okay all right guys thank you for
25:00 - sticking around and be sure to give us a
25:02 - like and thumbs up and share with your
25:04 - friends about channel
25:06 - and i'll see you guys next time bye
25:17 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hello scratcher welcome back to our kids calling playground so today we are doing the santa run part seven i think we probably have a couple more parts to go before we finish the enemy is kind of hard so today we're gonna plan to work on the spike and then the uh maybe the um the next level okay with the igloo so um we're gonna do that so for now let's pick up the igloo sprite from my backdrop i think you guys have this already in your i might have uploaded if not i'll check later so uh this is pretty simple you have that i just got added some ice block put it in here in the igloo okay i believe you guys have that if not i'll update later to the drive to boot right so um okay let's get started so last time we did the uh the sound so this is all for the sound make sure you get the correct uh list okay the soundless if it's one then we play the sound after we play the sound we'll make it back to zero okay so that way you know you will not play this down multiple time uh same thing in the other one and then last time we also work on the background scrolling so uh this is the code for that so you miss that you can add it in okay uh so today we're gonna work on the include to after you hit the igloo the center will jump up and then we can move on to the next level so when we move on to the next level we need to call the uh level two here okay so now we're gonna do the spike first okay okay let's move on to the spike so the spike is uh really similar to um you know other other thing that we had like the virtual ground you know uh what we can do is uh we can copy some of the code from from the virtual ground or what not and then we're gonna change it okay so for now let's grab this grab the reset grab the setup grab the movement grab the clone and position okay i hope we have all of that let's just kind of space it out a bit okay move ground setup reset and then start okay so we are going to change a bit for the spike okay in the beginning we want to actually hide it okay let's drop all that uh we actually don't need to set any position because it's gonna be move around with the spike so uh placing the cone myself we don't need this okay delete that because we're actually putting at the wherever the position is we're not moving 480 like like the other one we're not going to use one we're going to use number here um so what we're gonna do is okay so this one will be a little bit different we will not put the x here okay what we're going to do is we're going to say clear clone myself and then we can put the show here okay and then um when i create that when i create a clone myself so what we're going to do is we're going to move them to the position when i start as a clone okay so um i'm going to move this to this x and y we have set it up here right the x and y we're going to change all this later okay don't worry about that so for now let's just continue with this one um what we can do is we're going to use this forever loop and then we are going to get a if condition here okay and then we are saying sensing with touching the main character okay basically this character here and then we'll use another control here inside this if i'm gonna check the animated type so what happened is uh when you um this animated type is like when it's like dying or something like that we don't want it to die again right so what we're going to check for zero so zero meaning uh the uh center is still alive nothing had happened to him he's well and good okay and then we are going to use the another if statement here okay here we are going to check uh you remember like when the center died right um the sound i recorded myself uh here ouch in like whatever you like so that's my sound recorded so we're gonna play that sound so the ouch is the second one right so what we're going to do is we'll go back here and then we say um let's get the operator here uh go to the uh the list now we make sure you select the sound one okay number two so basically if it's item number two is equal to zero then we'll replace it okay replace item number two with one so that way it will it will play okay so when let's say easy this one when it's one then it will play and then we'll set it back to zero so when we wanna play we wanna make sure we set it to one so we when the spike hits the center we want to play the sound right also we want to set something here called hit so this is right here one is touching it okay okay sorry about that um this is actually inside here when it's actually uh animated type is zero so we don't wanna keep on broadcasting when they touch the character only if it's not dead we want to broadcast one time i mean set this one time so that way you know it will know that it's get hit and then we'll deduct one life on it okay so put it inside the um this condition here the animation type equal to zero okay so i'll explain i'll explain how we actually use this head so this hit is actually go to here you see this right then somewhere here so the hit is actually here in the animated sprite here so when it gets hit we'll make make it dead and then we'll do this uh that animation okay all right so it's right here okay now let's go back to the this one here so we want to make sure that when it's uh when it's reset we're gonna delete all the clone when it's set up we're gonna change this out a little bit okay so exactly the back layer will make it go to the front layer okay so we want the spike to show up okay uh what i'm going to do is i'm going to make it point in direction 90 and also make sure your spike is uh so so we should use this one um this not this one because we're gonna flip them upside down so uh that's why you wanna use put the spike on this one all around okay so um when you play this we are going to put the clone at i have some coordinate already done but i'll show you why what you can do okay uh negative negative 95 okay so so as you can see um later i'll run there and then you can see it but uh not yet this is not ready yet so um we have to fix something else let's see if everything is good we have the g scrolling done this is should be good the position one um clone that that's fine uh the clone one that looks fine let's throw this away and then the position one that looks like it's fine and yeah that looks fine now let's just try it out so let's save it okay so let's see we have any uh yep there's a that's the spike is here okay so as you can see this spike is here so uh what you can do is um you want to know the direction right you can put it anywhere i mean you can put it anywhere for me i put in the background but it doesn't matter uh you can put it like in the main character but main character and all this is too many things there so we don't want to put it there so what you can do is this when the m key is pressed basically the mouse or whatever i'm in position so we're gonna say let me see if i have those variable um yeah i have a mouse position so we're going to set this so set global mouth position okay i'm going to use some join here and then we're going to use another joint and then we are going to use a plus sign as a plus sign okay uh we're gonna use the mouse button i think it's in sensing mouse x and then we're gonna say plus the scroll x okay put that into the first join now we can put a comma here and a space and then we can take this duplicate we're gonna use mouse y uh this one we can right click and say scroll why or you can just delete it and drag one here okay go back to sensing so almost y then we'll put it here so you can see so it's joining this comma and then this put that here and then you can call this thing called show variable mouse position okay all right so let's just check it out so let's run it so let's say i want to put a um put the spike here you can click click the m key you see this is 40 80 whatever negative 80. so if you put here you can put one like let's say duplicate this 40 negative 95 whatever so because i'm using 95 right so it will be correct so you see so if you if you have it at negative 80 or whatever it might be too high you can just adjust that so let's run this you see every 8 is too high because even though i push the m key here right so you see i push the m key here because you have to put in the middle right so you see this is too high so yeah you know it should be somewhere here so i have negative 95 so you can just adjust it okay adjust it any way you want okay so i have it like this then i have two right so you see i have two okay so that's how you put multiple of these uh little uh red spikes so let's go back to my coat i still have a little bit more to do so um i have some um some of the spike let's say i wanted to uh flip him upside down i'll delete this i don't need the first one uh so if i want to flip it upside down you can change this direction right uh to negative 90. okay and then we're gonna create some chrome here actually uh i'm gonna create a rows of spike i already have coordinates for it so if you don't have it you can have to move it to that location and put it so for me you know i have it as 184 negative 26 1902 negative 26 i should have duplicate from this one so i have less typing but anyway let's just finish that uh this is one nine nine five and two zero seven zero okay so this is the row of spike where center can slide through so i turn it upside down and then you wanna turn it back up then you have to say point direction 90. i'll do one more clone i think i have one more spike at the end and my original game i'll put one more here uh two two four five zero and then that's negative 95. okay so that's my spike so let's run that real quick so you can see you have the center here and then you have the row of spikes coming up see there you go so i have to slide through if i don't slide through and get stuck hit that and i'm gonna die so see so this is the last one so this is that row of spike and i flip it back upside down i'm gonna flip my right side up and then i put this last one so you can click the mouse here you see it's 240 50 you see that 249.95 so somewhere like that okay so that's how it is so for the spike okay so what we're going to do is we're going to add this include the in that the center jump on it goes to the next level so right now i don't have any code so just grab the code from here let's move it from the spike one the reset to set up three so this one four five six and seven okay i think we have all the coal the clones down here movement here you can place them any way you like but i'm trying to put them the same as the other one so kind of easy to see okay all right so we have the igloo so the include i'm trying to put at the end so we actually don't need all this too many things here so let's throw that away oops we'll leave one of the clone okay let's go from the top first make sure that is correct so we want to high in the beginning the position plays the clone position that is the same so show okay the other one the position that should be the same okay things change there the clone here is we have to that is not gonna die right so when i touch the main character what we want to do is we want to podcast broadcast events saying new message next level okay and then what we want to do is we also want to stop this uh script so we don't want to go forever okay stop the script and we can trash all this okay so we have the scrolling i think the scrolling is fine the x and y is scrolling very good uh so this one we want to put it at i have it cornered down but if you don't you have to go to the end and try to get it so you remember we were like really close like two thousand five hundred i mean four hundred fifty so somewhere down we go three thousand three hundred so we're gonna put it at negative sixty okay all right so now let's check it out so um oh this will still not work yet because the next level we haven't coded yet so let's call that first okay so let's go back to our main character okay let's call it here when i receive a next level okay uh what i want to do is i'm going to stop everything else stop other script in the sprite okay i want to stop everything we'll broadcast a message now we're broadcasting wait sorry new message called victory okay whatever you like so that means he got to the end and then we're gonna broadcast a new message call stop new level okay that's already there okay so we're gonna do this victory dance and then we'll podcast a new level and then this is a next level broadcast when you touch that igloo okay so you glue will touch and call that okay all right okay so now let's go back to the center so we need to fix the uh because we broadcast victory right we want to make him dance a little bit so um center here uh when i receive uh victory so let's zoom in a little bit uh what we want to do we want to stop out of script in the sprite as well okay and then we're going to change this level so we're from level 1 we're going to change it to level two change level by one okay and then what i'm going to do is i'm gonna switch the cost to uh jump okay i'm gonna switch the jump custom and then i say uh repeat 15 times and then i will say change y by five okay and then look next costume uh and then uh switch it back to the first costume actually oops sorry i don't mean him to jump up so now we're going to change it back to negative 5 okay and then after that we want to stop the spoon stop this grip okay so when i get to the igloo it'll jump up i just repeat 15 times i think that's i have 15 costume of jump costume or something let's just take a look so let's look at jump you see i have a jump one two jump yeah 15 you see even 16. so yeah so doesn't matter so i actually have 16 but anyway so i repeated 15 you can repeat 16 if you like doesn't matter uh okay yeah i repeat 15 because we already switched it to the first costume so second let's go into the next costume right so that's why it's 15. okay got it so 15 is correct uh because we have 16 custom and we already switch it to the first one so now that this will go to the next custom right so what you had to do is uh for the next level you have to make your clone if not there was nothing for the centers to stand on right he'll fall okay so let's go to the ground i will do real quick um same thing here we'll do duplicate we'll say two and we are going to use the uh switch to costume number two one and we will place the clone at zero zero zero one i'm just gonna do two for now uh but but whatever it is you know depending on how many custom you have for number two so for me i have what what seven right so zero two one two two seven two eight see two eight so actually it will be it's starting on zero so it will be until seven so you can duplicate this this is two let's duplicate this again so three four five let's duplicate two more six and then seven and then put this back in okay so now we have the level two done for this so same thing here so you want to put this here and call that level two and select two will be one two three four so seven right okay so we got all the background and this guy done so you need to put more spike of course level two you're gonna have to add spike right and then for the igloo same thing if you want to go to level three you're gonna have to add that so for now let's just test it okay let me take out the mouse position let's see if it works let's make it bigger screen okay all right santa's jumping around we don't have the any enemy at the moment pretty easy so okay so you can see they have a include here yep so if i jump on it so you see center jump now he's on level two okay so this is level two so i had yeah built you can build it any way you want so i built it like this so this is my level two a little bridge and uh this is a little slide so so this is for me for my original game i put the uh another um we call it the include here so it goes to level three okay all right so this is fine working fine so as you can see we can go backward as well right so okay all right so i think we'll stop the uh stop the tutorial until here so next time we can work on the items the snowflake and then the enemy i think we're almost done maybe two more uh video i think the enemy is a little complicated and explain that pretty well also the item okay all right guys thank you for sticking around and be sure to give us a like and thumbs up and share with your friends about channel and i'll see you guys next time bye you
