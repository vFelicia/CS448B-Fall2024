00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids coding
00:08 - playground we're back with another
00:10 - python tutorial
00:11 - it's been a while so we're gonna make a
00:13 - turtle racing game today
00:14 - not really a game so like um the turtle
00:18 - can like
00:18 - move around and when it gets to the
00:20 - finish line you can guess
00:22 - which one wins and stuff like that so
00:24 - yeah so we're gonna start a new trinket
00:26 - python we're gonna rename this trinket
00:30 - first let's name it um turtle race
00:35 - so turtle race and then we'll go i'm
00:38 - gonna
00:39 - zoom into the code a little bit more so
00:41 - you guys can see it better
00:43 - so first we're going to import the
00:44 - turtle library so we're going to do it
00:46 - by
00:46 - import oops click in here
00:49 - import turtle
00:52 - so import turtle and then we're also
00:54 - going to import the time library which
00:56 - is like the wait
00:57 - pluck and scratch import time so we're
01:00 - going to do that as well
01:02 - and let's go down two lines and then
01:04 - we're going to import the actual
01:06 - object turtle so we're going to import
01:08 - the turtle object from the turtle iber
01:10 - library so we're going to do this
01:12 - from tur turtle
01:15 - um import turtle
01:19 - with a capital t okay from turtle
01:22 - library we're going to import the object
01:24 - so and then we're gonna also
01:26 - import random we're gonna from random
01:29 - we're gonna import the random int okay
01:31 - so
01:32 - from random
01:35 - uh library we're gonna import
01:44 - [Music]
01:49 - and after that we're going to get the
01:51 - screen so we're going to
01:52 - backdrop screen is equal to
01:56 - turtle turtle
02:00 - dot screen and click parentheses
02:05 - and then we're going to do turtle
02:09 - is equal so this um library turtle is
02:12 - equal
02:12 - to the object turtle
02:14 - [Music]
02:16 - like that okay so after this we're going
02:20 - to set up the grass for the background
02:21 - so we're gonna have some grass
02:22 - as the background so right here we have
02:25 - all the colors for the turtle
02:27 - so you can pause the video and use
02:29 - whatever color you want when we get
02:30 - there
02:31 - so we have um
02:34 - we're going to set the backdrop to force
02:37 - green like the
02:38 - color the grass so we're going to do
02:41 - screen
02:42 - dot bg color
02:46 - screen dot bg color and we're going to
02:47 - set it before a screen
02:52 - and some of these colors might not work
02:53 - but because this is for css
02:55 - colors but some of them do work so like
02:57 - you can pick some right here
02:59 - as you can see you can pause the video
03:01 - if you'd like
03:03 - okay after that we're going to set the
03:05 - turtle color
03:07 - to white so this turtle we're using to
03:08 - draw is the turtle library
03:11 - not the actual turtle we're going to be
03:12 - using to race so we'll show you the end
03:15 - product that
03:15 - we'll show you the product at the end
03:18 - the result of this game so then after
03:20 - this we're going to set the turtle color
03:22 - to white because we want to write turtle
03:23 - rays
03:24 - up here we're going to write turtle
03:29 - dot color and then we're going to do
03:33 - parentheses um uh
03:36 - quotation marks once so like that
03:41 - you can add a semicolon if you would
03:43 - like and then after that we're going to
03:45 - do
03:46 - turtle dot
03:49 - speed is equal to zero
03:52 - and zero like that and after that we're
03:56 - going to make the turtle pen up so then
03:57 - it won't draw
03:58 - so we're going to make it draw once we
04:00 - do pen down
04:02 - so we're going to do turtle dot
04:05 - pen up and up so like if you don't
04:09 - do pan up it'll already start drawing
04:12 - and then we're going to make the turtle
04:13 - go to this position negative 250
04:16 - 150 somewhere right here so then we're
04:18 - going to write turtle race somewhere
04:20 - right here
04:21 - okay so we're gonna write turtle
04:26 - goat oops dot go to
04:31 - dot go to and then we're gonna do
04:33 - negative 120
04:35 - and the other position is 150.
04:38 - so you guys can pick whatever coordinate
04:40 - you think is best for you
04:41 - then we're going to do turtle dot right
04:45 - and we're going to write turtle race
04:48 - quotation marks turtle let's make it all
04:52 - caps
04:54 - turtle race and then we're going to put
04:57 - a comma
04:59 - and we're going to set the font to ariel
05:00 - you guys can set whatever font i don't
05:02 - know what the fonts are but i just need
05:04 - arial
05:05 - font is equal to put another parenthesis
05:08 - quotation mark ariel ariel
05:12 - and we want it to be 20 size so that
05:15 - one's 20 size
05:16 - and we want it to be bold so you can do
05:19 - this
05:20 - you guys can do anything you want you
05:21 - don't have to make it bold i just made
05:22 - it bold so it looks better
05:25 - except for this we're going to make it
05:28 - pen up
05:28 - so after it's done writing it we're
05:30 - going to make it pin up turtle
05:32 - dot pen up
05:36 - oops i still put this pen
05:40 - up and then do this
05:43 - and add something right here
05:46 - okay and after this we're gonna set up
05:48 - the dirt
05:49 - so we're gonna have some dirt over here
05:52 - like we're gonna add like some brown
05:54 - dirt so we're gonna make the turtle go
05:57 - to negative 200 negative 150 first
05:59 - so somewhere about like right here so
06:01 - start drawing from here
06:02 - so what we want to do is make it draw
06:04 - from here all the way to here
06:07 - and then come down and then draw with
06:09 - this then all this area will be brown
06:12 - so we're going to do turtle dot go to
06:16 - negative 200 negative 200 and
06:20 - we're gonna do negative 150 for the y um
06:23 - and then after that we're going to do
06:26 - actually
06:27 - uh yeah so negative 200 negative 150 you
06:30 - guys can do whatever coordinate you
06:31 - would like
06:32 - and then we're going to set the color to
06:34 - chocolate remember we still have a
06:35 - python color
06:36 - so we're going to make like a brown
06:37 - color i'm going to pick chocolate you
06:39 - guys can pick whatever color you would
06:41 - like
06:41 - and she did chocolate and then we're
06:44 - going to do
06:45 - [Music]
06:46 - turtle dot color
06:49 - is chocolate so we're gonna do this
06:55 - chocolate and then after this
06:59 - we want to get let the turtle begin to
07:03 - fill this area with brown
07:04 - so we're going to do turtle
07:08 - dot begin underscore
07:11 - fill and then we can put this
07:14 - in semifinal okay
07:18 - and then after this we're going to get
07:21 - uh the pen down so we're going to make a
07:22 - pen down so it'll start drawing so
07:25 - turtle dot pen down
07:28 - and then we're going to put this so it's
07:30 - going to begin drawing the brown
07:33 - so we're going to make a move 400
07:34 - forward so from here we made it go to
07:36 - negative 200 negative 150
07:38 - so move 400 it'll move all the way to
07:40 - the other side so 400 is like about
07:42 - right here
07:43 - and then we're gonna make it uh so let's
07:46 - enter
07:48 - so let's write so we're gonna make it
07:51 - move
07:52 - forward by um 400 so we're going to
07:59 - dot forward
08:03 - forward and then we're gonna put the
08:05 - parentheses
08:09 - and after that we're going to make it
08:11 - turn right so as you can see when i run
08:12 - it right now
08:13 - it says turtle race and has the green so
08:15 - as you can see the turtle moved all the
08:16 - way right here
08:18 - so we wanted to make it turn right it's
08:20 - kind of hard to see but if you can see
08:21 - over here
08:22 - right here um so we want to make it turn
08:25 - right so then it will move down here
08:26 - and then go back all the way back so
08:29 - we're going to make it turn right
08:30 - 90 degrees 90 degrees because um the 90
08:34 - degrees turn right here
08:35 - so if you were in this position you
08:37 - would be turning right
08:39 - okay so after this we're going to
08:43 - enter so i kind of need to scroll down
08:46 - right here
08:48 - i don't think it's letting me scroll
08:49 - down so you guys have to look down here
08:51 - and then we're going to have to make it
08:53 - turn right by 90 degrees so
08:55 - turtle dot right by 90 degrees
09:00 - and after that we're going to get uh
09:02 - turtle forward by 60 so
09:04 - 60 is like about from here to here so
09:06 - we're going to make him move 60 degrees
09:08 - and then move back so
09:09 - we're going to turtle turtle
09:14 - dot forward by
09:17 - 60. so we can move 60 steps
09:22 - and then we're gonna make it turn right
09:24 - again so if you're down here
09:26 - you're facing down so turn right you
09:28 - move this way again so we're gonna do
09:29 - turtle
09:32 - dot right 90 degrees
09:36 - oops so we have the turtle turning 90
09:40 - degrees
09:41 - okay so after that we want to make it
09:44 - move back 400
09:46 - and then we're gonna end the fill so
09:48 - we're going to turn forward 400.4
09:54 - for word 400
09:58 - and we'll do that and then we're going
10:01 - to turtle.end
10:02 - the field so we're going to finish the
10:03 - fill
10:06 - end underscore fill
10:12 - okay so now let's play it as you can see
10:16 - it says turtle race the background is
10:18 - green and the dirt right here has been
10:20 - filled
10:21 - okay so now we're gonna work on the
10:24 - turtles we're gonna work on the turtle
10:27 - and the finish line next
10:28 - but uh before we continue i'm pretty
10:30 - sure in some previous python tutorials
10:33 - we mentioned that um you can comment out
10:35 - stuff
10:36 - so that's what i'm going to do right now
10:38 - so i will show you guys how to do it
10:39 - i'll
10:40 - i'll comment it so it's easier guys for
10:42 - you to understand so right here this is
10:44 - importing
10:46 - the turtle object
10:50 - i'm just trying to make it easier for
10:52 - you guys to understand from
10:53 - the turtle library
10:59 - the library and we're importing
11:02 - the rand int from
11:05 - the random library
11:10 - okay so now this is what we have right
11:12 - here importing the turtle so i just
11:14 - commented it out so you guys can
11:16 - see what it's about and then right here
11:18 - we are drawing the background we're
11:20 - setting up
11:21 - set up the
11:25 - grass green background and then right
11:27 - here
11:28 - in this area we're going to set up the
11:30 - dirt or
11:32 - set set up
11:35 - the dirt which is the brown stuff right
11:38 - here
11:39 - okay so that's what we have right now we
11:42 - will
11:44 - i will add more comments as we continue
11:47 - so i don't know why it's not letting me
11:50 - scroll down
11:50 - but i guess i can make a couple more
11:53 - answers and then you can see right here
11:55 - okay so next we are going to be working
11:58 - on the finish line so
12:00 - i'm gonna make a comment real quick set
12:04 - up finish line so we're gonna set up the
12:08 - finish line and then we want to make the
12:10 - square size 15 we don't want to make it
12:12 - any more or less because
12:13 - 15 is just the right size if it's 20 it
12:16 - might be
12:17 - spaced out a little bit more and might
12:19 - go off the screen
12:20 - so we do not want that to happen so
12:22 - we're going to set a variable
12:24 - square size underscore size
12:28 - and then we're going to make it uh 15
12:31 - equals
12:31 - to 15. okay so next we're gonna define
12:35 - another variable
12:36 - okay so actually the square is the
12:39 - square size
12:41 - um it's the default square size for the
12:43 - turtle so
12:44 - it's 15 by 15 but you can change it but
12:46 - if you do 20s it'll get spaced out so
12:49 - it'll not fit on the screen so it
12:50 - doesn't look great so we're going to do
12:51 - 15
12:52 - as the one we want so next we want to
12:56 - get
12:56 - a finish line so we're going to make the
12:59 - finish line
13:00 - underscore line another variable finish
13:03 - line at
13:04 - 170 so that's going to be like somewhere
13:06 - right here
13:08 - on the x position and then
13:11 - we're going to make the color of the
13:13 - squares black so we're going to do
13:17 - turtle dot color
13:20 - turtle.color and then we're gonna do
13:22 - black
13:24 - so you guys can do whatever color you
13:26 - want i just picked the black color
13:28 - um and then next we can get
13:31 - a turtle.shape we want it to be a square
13:34 - the finish line
13:35 - you can make it any shape you want
13:37 - pretty much
13:38 - shape and then square so square
13:43 - and add a second column here and then
13:46 - down here we're going to add a couple
13:48 - more enters so you guys can see
13:50 - and after this we are going to work on
13:53 - the repeat loops but before i show that
13:55 - oh yeah and we need the pen up i forgot
13:57 - about that we have to do turtle dot
13:59 - pen up and then we're going to work on
14:01 - some repeat loops to make
14:03 - this process of stamping black squares
14:05 - much quicker than it is
14:07 - so i'm not going to use it right now i'm
14:10 - going to show you guys
14:11 - how how much code you need to do it
14:14 - without the stamping
14:15 - it takes a lot so i'm going to show a
14:17 - section
14:18 - okay so start here so we're going to do
14:21 - turtle
14:22 - dot go to you will see that it's not
14:26 - very efficient
14:27 - go to and then we're going to do 170
14:30 - 140 140
14:35 - oops and then next we're going to do
14:39 - and then we're going okay so next you
14:42 - wanna
14:43 - let's go to another position so we're
14:45 - gonna keep on stamping down we're gonna
14:47 - add a little section
14:48 - in the middle that's not shaded so first
14:51 - we're gonna stamp this one
14:55 - turtle.stamp and then we're going to do
14:58 - turtle
15:00 - dot go to and then we're going to do 170
15:03 - 110 so we're going to make a little gap
15:05 - for like a like some space
15:09 - and then we're going to stamp again
15:16 - okay so when you run it as you can see
15:19 - there's a little space we want to make
15:20 - two layers of them
15:22 - as you can see it's not very efficient
15:23 - you have to do it for the whole line and
15:25 - we're gonna have to do another line of
15:26 - those
15:27 - so i'll show you an another part of it
15:29 - another little section
15:30 - of it so this is like the second line of
15:33 - this
15:34 - so we're gonna do turtle dot
15:37 - go to oh yeah and i can comment this out
15:40 - before i show
15:41 - and then um i'm gonna comment this out
15:43 - real quick so you can do control slash
15:45 - to come and add the whole line
15:46 - let's highlight it in control slash so
15:49 - i'm going to be
15:50 - um showing you the other line so turtle
15:53 - dot
15:54 - go to and then we're going to go to 185
15:58 - 125 and these are just some coordinates
16:02 - you can
16:02 - get whatever you want you know you
16:04 - actually should not you don't have to
16:05 - code this part
16:06 - we'll be working on a loop to make it
16:08 - more efficient
16:10 - and then after that we're going to do
16:11 - program dot stamp
16:14 - and then we're going to do this
16:17 - and after that we're going to get turtle
16:21 - dot go to as you can see it's not very
16:23 - efficient you have to keep on typing or
16:25 - copy pasting it
16:26 - and there's a much quicker way to do it
16:28 - and we will show you
16:29 - later and then we have
16:33 - turtle dot stamp
16:36 - again that so as you can see
16:39 - i commented this out so now you see
16:41 - there's two lanes
16:43 - so let's uncomment this real quick so
16:46 - you can do control slash again
16:48 - so as you can see we want like a lane
16:50 - right here and a lane right here it's
16:51 - going to take a long time to do
16:54 - so this code is not very necessary so we
16:56 - can take this out
16:57 - and i'll show you guys how to do a loop
16:58 - on how to make it way more efficient
17:01 - so let's start on the loop
17:05 - so on the loop we're going to make two
17:07 - repeat loops
17:08 - so for i in range you can basically pick
17:12 - any letter you'd like i'm just going to
17:13 - do i
17:15 - so for index in range
17:19 - for i in range and then we're going to
17:22 - do 10 that means repeat it 10 times
17:26 - um has to be colon not a semicolon this
17:28 - one has to be a colon because it's a
17:29 - loop
17:30 - and then you tap enter and then we're
17:32 - going to do turtle
17:33 - dot go to so this part requires a little
17:36 - bit math
17:37 - and then we have to finish line
17:40 - so right now we defend define finish
17:42 - line as 170 so that's the value of
17:44 - finish line you can think of this as a
17:46 - variable like x or y
17:48 - so infinite x is equal to 170 let's say
17:51 - that
17:51 - and then we're going to put a comma
17:54 - and then we're going to make another one
17:57 - of these
17:58 - another uh parentheses and then we're
18:00 - gonna add space actually
18:02 - i'm gonna do 140 minus
18:06 - and then we can put another one in here
18:09 - so um
18:12 - put one in here sorry so you put one in
18:15 - here and then
18:16 - i we're going to do i multiply
18:21 - multiply by square size so square size
18:24 - we have defined it as 15 up here
18:28 - as you can see square size and then
18:29 - we're going to multiply
18:31 - it by two okay
18:35 - okay so right here we have the
18:36 - turtle.go2 finish line is 170. so this
18:39 - is finding the coordinates
18:40 - 170. so let's say all right i always
18:43 - starts out as zero in python
18:44 - so we can substitute the i as zero so
18:48 - zero multiplied by fifteen is zero
18:50 - fifteen multiple zero multiplied by two
18:52 - is zero so one forty minus zero is zero
18:55 - so i mean for 140 sorry 140 minus zero
18:57 - is 140.
18:58 - so this becomes 170 and 140 that's the
19:01 - coordinate so let's say i was
19:03 - one so the next index would be one it
19:06 - would just keep on going up
19:07 - so then it'll be 170 finish line is 170
19:10 - so 140
19:11 - minus 1 times 15 is 15 15 times 2 is
19:15 - 30 so 140 minus 30 is 110 so the next
19:18 - coordinate would be 170
19:20 - and 110 and then so on so you see the
19:22 - pattern it goes down by
19:24 - 30 every time so let's what if this is 2
19:27 - so if i is 2 2 multiplied by the square
19:30 - size is 15
19:31 - so 30 30 multiplied by 2 is 60 and then
19:34 - 170
19:35 - is the finish line so 140 minus 60 is
19:38 - 80. so
19:39 - the coordinate will be 170 and 80. so
19:42 - i hope you guys understand what that is
19:45 - so
19:46 - and this is the subtract so 140 is
19:49 - subtracting of whatever this value
19:51 - is i'm actually going to put a space
19:54 - between here so it's more easier to see
19:56 - like that okay so next we're going to
20:00 - write
20:00 - turtle.stamp so it can actually stamp
20:06 - and then we're going to make another
20:08 - loop for
20:09 - the second row as you can see it already
20:11 - created one row we're going to make a
20:12 - second row
20:13 - we're repeating 10 times for the first
20:16 - line but for the second line we can
20:17 - repeat nine times
20:18 - and then for the second one you can call
20:20 - it anything you want again
20:22 - you can even do i could do j you can do
20:24 - z so i'm just going to do j
20:26 - for the sake so you guys can understand
20:28 - it better for
20:29 - j in range what you're going to do nine
20:32 - times
20:34 - instead so in the back we're only gonna
20:35 - do nine
20:37 - oh yeah and not a semicolon sorry keep
20:38 - on putting a semicolon or hit the shift
20:40 - key
20:41 - so you have to hold down the shift to
20:42 - get the colon so this because this is a
20:44 - repeat loop and then this is going to be
20:46 - different than the first one so we're
20:48 - going to turtle
20:48 - dot go to and then of course there's a
20:52 - finish line
20:53 - defined as 170 and then we want to add
20:56 - the square size which is 15
20:58 - to the finish line and then we're going
21:02 - to i'm sorry not 15 square size not
21:06 - because we already have the variable
21:07 - defined you guys can just use the
21:09 - variable
21:10 - i'm going to put another parentheses so
21:14 - uh 140 we're gonna put two actually 140
21:18 - minus
21:20 - minus the square size
21:23 - and then we're going to add a
21:25 - subtraction sign
21:26 - in the middle actually take out one of
21:28 - these so we have
21:30 - this we have the 140 minus square size
21:34 - we'll add the other parentheses later
21:36 - sorry about that
21:37 - so we have the 140 square size and then
21:39 - we're going to subtract
21:40 - it by j
21:44 - which is the right here j in range
21:48 - j multiply whatever the j value is
21:51 - like zero because it starts at zero
21:53 - square size
21:56 - times two okay
21:59 - so right here i think we need to add
22:01 - some more parentheses
22:03 - let me add a couple more parentheses i
22:05 - think you have to add i accidentally
22:06 - deleted them sorry about that
22:08 - i wanted to let you guys see it better
22:10 - so we have to add the parentheses back
22:12 - now
22:13 - that and one more okay so
22:16 - we have three on this side and two on
22:18 - this side okay
22:20 - so what this is is basically kind of
22:23 - similar
22:23 - so finish line is 170 square size is 15
22:26 - like i said
22:27 - so 170 plus 15 is 185 and then we have
22:31 - the 140 minus the square size so this is
22:33 - going to be a little bit different this
22:34 - is the back lane
22:36 - so 140 minus square size is going to be
22:38 - 125
22:40 - so and then j is 0 first so 0 times
22:43 - 15 0 15 times i mean 0 times 2
22:46 - is also 0. so 1 125 minus a 0 is 125
22:52 - so that's the first coordinate is going
22:54 - to be 185
22:55 - 125. okay let's say j was one
22:58 - we're going to substitute j with one
23:01 - then
23:01 - the x position would be 185 because you
23:04 - have
23:04 - the finish line and plus the square size
23:07 - and then right here we have
23:09 - 95 because 140 minus the square size
23:12 - and then you minus whatever this value
23:14 - is and then finally
23:16 - it just goes on for nine different times
23:19 - and let's just say j was two
23:21 - finish line 170 plus square size would
23:24 - be the same would be 185
23:26 - 140 minus 15 would be 125 and then 125
23:30 - minus 2 times square size is 30 30 times
23:34 - 2 is 60
23:35 - and you minus then it'll be 65 125 minus
23:38 - that
23:39 - is going to be 65 as you can see
23:43 - so that there's a bit math there's some
23:45 - math into this coding
23:47 - and then we're going to do turtle dot
23:49 - stamp
23:51 - and then we're gonna do this so let's
23:53 - run
23:54 - as you can see there's two lanes and
23:56 - turtle race and that so this is all the
23:58 - code we have so far
23:59 - so i'm going to i guess i can make a
24:03 - comment right here
24:06 - so let's make a comment let's say set up
24:08 - the finish line
24:09 - let's start up here actually i already
24:11 - have the setup finish line this is just
24:13 - stamping the finish line let's name it
24:15 - stamp
24:16 - the line like that
24:20 - okay so for you guys to understand it
24:22 - more easier
24:23 - and you should save your project as
24:25 - always
24:26 - when you have a lot of stuff you should
24:28 - always save your project
24:30 - okay let's make it back bigger okay
24:33 - okay next we want to do turtle.hi turtle
24:37 - so after it's done stamping all this we
24:39 - want to hide the turtle library so we're
24:41 - going to turtle
24:42 - dot hide turtle i'm gonna do that
24:49 - okay and let me add a semicolon right
24:53 - here it's optional
24:54 - remember that and then um right here
24:57 - we're gonna set up the turtles
24:59 - to the color so we're going to do
25:02 - setup i'm going to give you like a
25:06 - little
25:07 - comment set up
25:10 - somewhere here and then we're going to
25:12 - my turtle one
25:15 - one equals turtle
25:19 - turtle which is the turtle object
25:23 - okay and next
25:27 - this is defining the variable and then
25:29 - we're going to do my
25:32 - turtle dot speed
25:38 - uh one sorry my turtle one so we're
25:40 - dividing these as one two three and four
25:42 - we're gonna put
25:42 - four turtles and then um
25:46 - dot speed to figure out the speed equals
25:49 - two zero speed
25:53 - and then we're gonna do zero with that
25:57 - and then we're going to add
26:01 - my turtle color red so we're going to
26:02 - make the first turtle right so by
26:04 - turtle one and then
26:07 - dot color it's going to be
26:10 - red
26:14 - and then i'm going to add more spaces so
26:16 - you guys can see
26:17 - and then my turtle
26:21 - dot one oops one dot
26:24 - next we can do the shape so we want the
26:27 - shape to be
26:28 - the shape of a turtle obviously like
26:31 - that
26:34 - and then we're gonna do um pen up my
26:38 - turtle
26:40 - dot pen one dot pen up
26:45 - okay so that is going to draw the turtle
26:48 - and then we're going to make it go to
26:49 - this position one
26:52 - dot go to i'll make it go to negative
26:56 - 170
26:58 - 100 and space
27:01 - and then you can pen down after this i
27:04 - can do my total one dot pen down
27:10 - okay so now i can just uh copy paste
27:13 - all of this um to make
27:16 - the different uh ones so as you can see
27:19 - it draws the first turtle the red one
27:22 - so i can just copy paste this to make
27:24 - all the different turtles i'm gonna put
27:25 - four turtles
27:26 - if you guys can put as much as you would
27:28 - like i'm just gonna do four for the sake
27:30 - of time
27:31 - and then we're gonna copy paste this and
27:34 - we're gonna have to change
27:35 - the number of the total so we're gonna a
27:37 - couple lines
27:38 - and then right here we're gonna do my
27:40 - turtle two is equal to turtle object
27:43 - two and this should be two as well
27:47 - to to just change all this to two and
27:50 - then we're going to change the
27:51 - coordinates and the color
27:55 - to and remember you guys can change it
27:57 - to whatever color you
27:58 - want i'm just going to change it to what
28:00 - colors i had
28:02 - and then right here we're gonna i'm
28:03 - gonna put the second one as a yellow
28:05 - turtle
28:07 - and then we're also going to change the
28:10 - x and y position so right here i'm doing
28:11 - 50 as the i'm going down by 50 for each
28:16 - turtle
28:16 - as you can see so this is my second
28:18 - turtle let's copy paste this
28:20 - we're gonna make the third turtle okay
28:23 - we're almost done and then
28:26 - my turtle three so we can change all
28:29 - this to three
28:33 - three three three
28:36 - oh yeah let's do that three
28:42 - three there's
28:45 - three and three so we got all the
28:48 - turtles
28:49 - and then we're gonna change the x uh y
28:52 - position so we're gonna make it zero
28:53 - we're going down by fifty and we're
28:54 - gonna change the color
28:56 - to cyan any color you'd like i didn't
28:58 - want to pick green color because the
29:00 - background is already green
29:02 - so just pick a cyan color and then my
29:05 - turtle for
29:08 - ctrl c
29:12 - ctrl v okay so we have the my turtle 4.
29:14 - now we can just
29:15 - use the down key if you want to go
29:17 - faster
29:24 - okay so it changes all to four and then
29:27 - we're gonna
29:28 - um change the color to purple so this is
29:31 - the fourth
29:32 - this is gonna be the fourth turtle and
29:35 - then we're going to make it negative 50.
29:39 - okay and then it's okay so we have all
29:41 - the turtles let's play
29:42 - as you can see they're not racing yet
29:44 - because we did not
29:46 - make the move yet so we will now so
29:49 - right now we're gonna do time
29:50 - we're gonna add this at least waiting
29:52 - one second before the game starts
29:54 - so time dot sleep and then
29:57 - we're gonna put parentheses one second
29:59 - so it's gonna wait one second before
30:01 - starting up the race
30:04 - and then i'm gonna put another comment
30:05 - right here let's go move turtles
30:10 - let's move to turtles for i in range so
30:13 - we're going to make another loop
30:14 - for i in range so we're going to make
30:17 - this repeat 110 times do this
30:22 - 110 times and colon because it's a loop
30:26 - so my turtle one
30:29 - my turtle one dot forward
30:32 - and then we're gonna make it a random
30:34 - one to five steps pick random so rand
30:37 - ins one to five put this one
30:41 - to five and you just copy paste this a
30:45 - couple times
30:49 - let's tap to tab
30:52 - and tap okay so now we have them we're
30:55 - going to have to change
30:56 - the numbers two three
30:59 - and four so now we have all the
31:03 - different ones
31:04 - so my turtle one two three and four
31:08 - okay it looks like we're finished now
31:10 - let's play
31:12 - as you can see the turtles are moving so
31:14 - you can bet with your friends which
31:16 - turtle you want to win and stuff like
31:17 - that
31:18 - so as you can see the yellow turtle won
31:19 - right now
31:21 - so before we end the video we would like
31:23 - to tell you that we have a second
31:24 - channel now it's a gaming channel

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's kids coding playground we're back with another python tutorial it's been a while so we're gonna make a turtle racing game today not really a game so like um the turtle can like move around and when it gets to the finish line you can guess which one wins and stuff like that so yeah so we're gonna start a new trinket python we're gonna rename this trinket first let's name it um turtle race so turtle race and then we'll go i'm gonna zoom into the code a little bit more so you guys can see it better so first we're going to import the turtle library so we're going to do it by import oops click in here import turtle so import turtle and then we're also going to import the time library which is like the wait pluck and scratch import time so we're going to do that as well and let's go down two lines and then we're going to import the actual object turtle so we're going to import the turtle object from the turtle iber library so we're going to do this from tur turtle um import turtle with a capital t okay from turtle library we're going to import the object so and then we're gonna also import random we're gonna from random we're gonna import the random int okay so from random uh library we're gonna import and after that we're going to get the screen so we're going to backdrop screen is equal to turtle turtle dot screen and click parentheses and then we're going to do turtle is equal so this um library turtle is equal to the object turtle like that okay so after this we're going to set up the grass for the background so we're gonna have some grass as the background so right here we have all the colors for the turtle so you can pause the video and use whatever color you want when we get there so we have um we're going to set the backdrop to force green like the color the grass so we're going to do screen dot bg color screen dot bg color and we're going to set it before a screen and some of these colors might not work but because this is for css colors but some of them do work so like you can pick some right here as you can see you can pause the video if you'd like okay after that we're going to set the turtle color to white so this turtle we're using to draw is the turtle library not the actual turtle we're going to be using to race so we'll show you the end product that we'll show you the product at the end the result of this game so then after this we're going to set the turtle color to white because we want to write turtle rays up here we're going to write turtle dot color and then we're going to do parentheses um uh quotation marks once so like that you can add a semicolon if you would like and then after that we're going to do turtle dot speed is equal to zero and zero like that and after that we're going to make the turtle pen up so then it won't draw so we're going to make it draw once we do pen down so we're going to do turtle dot pen up and up so like if you don't do pan up it'll already start drawing and then we're going to make the turtle go to this position negative 250 150 somewhere right here so then we're going to write turtle race somewhere right here okay so we're gonna write turtle goat oops dot go to dot go to and then we're gonna do negative 120 and the other position is 150. so you guys can pick whatever coordinate you think is best for you then we're going to do turtle dot right and we're going to write turtle race quotation marks turtle let's make it all caps turtle race and then we're going to put a comma and we're going to set the font to ariel you guys can set whatever font i don't know what the fonts are but i just need arial font is equal to put another parenthesis quotation mark ariel ariel and we want it to be 20 size so that one's 20 size and we want it to be bold so you can do this you guys can do anything you want you don't have to make it bold i just made it bold so it looks better except for this we're going to make it pen up so after it's done writing it we're going to make it pin up turtle dot pen up oops i still put this pen up and then do this and add something right here okay and after this we're gonna set up the dirt so we're gonna have some dirt over here like we're gonna add like some brown dirt so we're gonna make the turtle go to negative 200 negative 150 first so somewhere about like right here so start drawing from here so what we want to do is make it draw from here all the way to here and then come down and then draw with this then all this area will be brown so we're going to do turtle dot go to negative 200 negative 200 and we're gonna do negative 150 for the y um and then after that we're going to do actually uh yeah so negative 200 negative 150 you guys can do whatever coordinate you would like and then we're going to set the color to chocolate remember we still have a python color so we're going to make like a brown color i'm going to pick chocolate you guys can pick whatever color you would like and she did chocolate and then we're going to do turtle dot color is chocolate so we're gonna do this chocolate and then after this we want to get let the turtle begin to fill this area with brown so we're going to do turtle dot begin underscore fill and then we can put this in semifinal okay and then after this we're going to get uh the pen down so we're going to make a pen down so it'll start drawing so turtle dot pen down and then we're going to put this so it's going to begin drawing the brown so we're going to make a move 400 forward so from here we made it go to negative 200 negative 150 so move 400 it'll move all the way to the other side so 400 is like about right here and then we're gonna make it uh so let's enter so let's write so we're gonna make it move forward by um 400 so we're going to dot forward forward and then we're gonna put the parentheses and after that we're going to make it turn right so as you can see when i run it right now it says turtle race and has the green so as you can see the turtle moved all the way right here so we wanted to make it turn right it's kind of hard to see but if you can see over here right here um so we want to make it turn right so then it will move down here and then go back all the way back so we're going to make it turn right 90 degrees 90 degrees because um the 90 degrees turn right here so if you were in this position you would be turning right okay so after this we're going to enter so i kind of need to scroll down right here i don't think it's letting me scroll down so you guys have to look down here and then we're going to have to make it turn right by 90 degrees so turtle dot right by 90 degrees and after that we're going to get uh turtle forward by 60 so 60 is like about from here to here so we're going to make him move 60 degrees and then move back so we're going to turtle turtle dot forward by 60. so we can move 60 steps and then we're gonna make it turn right again so if you're down here you're facing down so turn right you move this way again so we're gonna do turtle dot right 90 degrees oops so we have the turtle turning 90 degrees okay so after that we want to make it move back 400 and then we're gonna end the fill so we're going to turn forward 400.4 for word 400 and we'll do that and then we're going to turtle.end the field so we're going to finish the fill end underscore fill okay so now let's play it as you can see it says turtle race the background is green and the dirt right here has been filled okay so now we're gonna work on the turtles we're gonna work on the turtle and the finish line next but uh before we continue i'm pretty sure in some previous python tutorials we mentioned that um you can comment out stuff so that's what i'm going to do right now so i will show you guys how to do it i'll i'll comment it so it's easier guys for you to understand so right here this is importing the turtle object i'm just trying to make it easier for you guys to understand from the turtle library the library and we're importing the rand int from the random library okay so now this is what we have right here importing the turtle so i just commented it out so you guys can see what it's about and then right here we are drawing the background we're setting up set up the grass green background and then right here in this area we're going to set up the dirt or set set up the dirt which is the brown stuff right here okay so that's what we have right now we will i will add more comments as we continue so i don't know why it's not letting me scroll down but i guess i can make a couple more answers and then you can see right here okay so next we are going to be working on the finish line so i'm gonna make a comment real quick set up finish line so we're gonna set up the finish line and then we want to make the square size 15 we don't want to make it any more or less because 15 is just the right size if it's 20 it might be spaced out a little bit more and might go off the screen so we do not want that to happen so we're going to set a variable square size underscore size and then we're going to make it uh 15 equals to 15. okay so next we're gonna define another variable okay so actually the square is the square size um it's the default square size for the turtle so it's 15 by 15 but you can change it but if you do 20s it'll get spaced out so it'll not fit on the screen so it doesn't look great so we're going to do 15 as the one we want so next we want to get a finish line so we're going to make the finish line underscore line another variable finish line at 170 so that's going to be like somewhere right here on the x position and then we're going to make the color of the squares black so we're going to do turtle dot color turtle.color and then we're gonna do black so you guys can do whatever color you want i just picked the black color um and then next we can get a turtle.shape we want it to be a square the finish line you can make it any shape you want pretty much shape and then square so square and add a second column here and then down here we're going to add a couple more enters so you guys can see and after this we are going to work on the repeat loops but before i show that oh yeah and we need the pen up i forgot about that we have to do turtle dot pen up and then we're going to work on some repeat loops to make this process of stamping black squares much quicker than it is so i'm not going to use it right now i'm going to show you guys how how much code you need to do it without the stamping it takes a lot so i'm going to show a section okay so start here so we're going to do turtle dot go to you will see that it's not very efficient go to and then we're going to do 170 140 140 oops and then next we're going to do and then we're going okay so next you wanna let's go to another position so we're gonna keep on stamping down we're gonna add a little section in the middle that's not shaded so first we're gonna stamp this one turtle.stamp and then we're going to do turtle dot go to and then we're going to do 170 110 so we're going to make a little gap for like a like some space and then we're going to stamp again okay so when you run it as you can see there's a little space we want to make two layers of them as you can see it's not very efficient you have to do it for the whole line and we're gonna have to do another line of those so i'll show you an another part of it another little section of it so this is like the second line of this so we're gonna do turtle dot go to oh yeah and i can comment this out before i show and then um i'm gonna comment this out real quick so you can do control slash to come and add the whole line let's highlight it in control slash so i'm going to be um showing you the other line so turtle dot go to and then we're going to go to 185 125 and these are just some coordinates you can get whatever you want you know you actually should not you don't have to code this part we'll be working on a loop to make it more efficient and then after that we're going to do program dot stamp and then we're going to do this and after that we're going to get turtle dot go to as you can see it's not very efficient you have to keep on typing or copy pasting it and there's a much quicker way to do it and we will show you later and then we have turtle dot stamp again that so as you can see i commented this out so now you see there's two lanes so let's uncomment this real quick so you can do control slash again so as you can see we want like a lane right here and a lane right here it's going to take a long time to do so this code is not very necessary so we can take this out and i'll show you guys how to do a loop on how to make it way more efficient so let's start on the loop so on the loop we're going to make two repeat loops so for i in range you can basically pick any letter you'd like i'm just going to do i so for index in range for i in range and then we're going to do 10 that means repeat it 10 times um has to be colon not a semicolon this one has to be a colon because it's a loop and then you tap enter and then we're going to do turtle dot go to so this part requires a little bit math and then we have to finish line so right now we defend define finish line as 170 so that's the value of finish line you can think of this as a variable like x or y so infinite x is equal to 170 let's say that and then we're going to put a comma and then we're going to make another one of these another uh parentheses and then we're gonna add space actually i'm gonna do 140 minus and then we can put another one in here so um put one in here sorry so you put one in here and then i we're going to do i multiply multiply by square size so square size we have defined it as 15 up here as you can see square size and then we're going to multiply it by two okay okay so right here we have the turtle.go2 finish line is 170. so this is finding the coordinates 170. so let's say all right i always starts out as zero in python so we can substitute the i as zero so zero multiplied by fifteen is zero fifteen multiple zero multiplied by two is zero so one forty minus zero is zero so i mean for 140 sorry 140 minus zero is 140. so this becomes 170 and 140 that's the coordinate so let's say i was one so the next index would be one it would just keep on going up so then it'll be 170 finish line is 170 so 140 minus 1 times 15 is 15 15 times 2 is 30 so 140 minus 30 is 110 so the next coordinate would be 170 and 110 and then so on so you see the pattern it goes down by 30 every time so let's what if this is 2 so if i is 2 2 multiplied by the square size is 15 so 30 30 multiplied by 2 is 60 and then 170 is the finish line so 140 minus 60 is 80. so the coordinate will be 170 and 80. so i hope you guys understand what that is so and this is the subtract so 140 is subtracting of whatever this value is i'm actually going to put a space between here so it's more easier to see like that okay so next we're going to write turtle.stamp so it can actually stamp and then we're going to make another loop for the second row as you can see it already created one row we're going to make a second row we're repeating 10 times for the first line but for the second line we can repeat nine times and then for the second one you can call it anything you want again you can even do i could do j you can do z so i'm just going to do j for the sake so you guys can understand it better for j in range what you're going to do nine times instead so in the back we're only gonna do nine oh yeah and not a semicolon sorry keep on putting a semicolon or hit the shift key so you have to hold down the shift to get the colon so this because this is a repeat loop and then this is going to be different than the first one so we're going to turtle dot go to and then of course there's a finish line defined as 170 and then we want to add the square size which is 15 to the finish line and then we're going to i'm sorry not 15 square size not because we already have the variable defined you guys can just use the variable i'm going to put another parentheses so uh 140 we're gonna put two actually 140 minus minus the square size and then we're going to add a subtraction sign in the middle actually take out one of these so we have this we have the 140 minus square size we'll add the other parentheses later sorry about that so we have the 140 square size and then we're going to subtract it by j which is the right here j in range j multiply whatever the j value is like zero because it starts at zero square size times two okay so right here i think we need to add some more parentheses let me add a couple more parentheses i think you have to add i accidentally deleted them sorry about that i wanted to let you guys see it better so we have to add the parentheses back now that and one more okay so we have three on this side and two on this side okay so what this is is basically kind of similar so finish line is 170 square size is 15 like i said so 170 plus 15 is 185 and then we have the 140 minus the square size so this is going to be a little bit different this is the back lane so 140 minus square size is going to be 125 so and then j is 0 first so 0 times 15 0 15 times i mean 0 times 2 is also 0. so 1 125 minus a 0 is 125 so that's the first coordinate is going to be 185 125. okay let's say j was one we're going to substitute j with one then the x position would be 185 because you have the finish line and plus the square size and then right here we have 95 because 140 minus the square size and then you minus whatever this value is and then finally it just goes on for nine different times and let's just say j was two finish line 170 plus square size would be the same would be 185 140 minus 15 would be 125 and then 125 minus 2 times square size is 30 30 times 2 is 60 and you minus then it'll be 65 125 minus that is going to be 65 as you can see so that there's a bit math there's some math into this coding and then we're going to do turtle dot stamp and then we're gonna do this so let's run as you can see there's two lanes and turtle race and that so this is all the code we have so far so i'm going to i guess i can make a comment right here so let's make a comment let's say set up the finish line let's start up here actually i already have the setup finish line this is just stamping the finish line let's name it stamp the line like that okay so for you guys to understand it more easier and you should save your project as always when you have a lot of stuff you should always save your project okay let's make it back bigger okay okay next we want to do turtle.hi turtle so after it's done stamping all this we want to hide the turtle library so we're going to turtle dot hide turtle i'm gonna do that okay and let me add a semicolon right here it's optional remember that and then um right here we're gonna set up the turtles to the color so we're going to do setup i'm going to give you like a little comment set up somewhere here and then we're going to my turtle one one equals turtle turtle which is the turtle object okay and next this is defining the variable and then we're going to do my turtle dot speed uh one sorry my turtle one so we're dividing these as one two three and four we're gonna put four turtles and then um dot speed to figure out the speed equals two zero speed and then we're gonna do zero with that and then we're going to add my turtle color red so we're going to make the first turtle right so by turtle one and then dot color it's going to be red and then i'm going to add more spaces so you guys can see and then my turtle dot one oops one dot next we can do the shape so we want the shape to be the shape of a turtle obviously like that and then we're gonna do um pen up my turtle dot pen one dot pen up okay so that is going to draw the turtle and then we're going to make it go to this position one dot go to i'll make it go to negative 170 100 and space and then you can pen down after this i can do my total one dot pen down okay so now i can just uh copy paste all of this um to make the different uh ones so as you can see it draws the first turtle the red one so i can just copy paste this to make all the different turtles i'm gonna put four turtles if you guys can put as much as you would like i'm just gonna do four for the sake of time and then we're gonna copy paste this and we're gonna have to change the number of the total so we're gonna a couple lines and then right here we're gonna do my turtle two is equal to turtle object two and this should be two as well to to just change all this to two and then we're going to change the coordinates and the color to and remember you guys can change it to whatever color you want i'm just going to change it to what colors i had and then right here we're gonna i'm gonna put the second one as a yellow turtle and then we're also going to change the x and y position so right here i'm doing 50 as the i'm going down by 50 for each turtle as you can see so this is my second turtle let's copy paste this we're gonna make the third turtle okay we're almost done and then my turtle three so we can change all this to three three three three oh yeah let's do that three three there's three and three so we got all the turtles and then we're gonna change the x uh y position so we're gonna make it zero we're going down by fifty and we're gonna change the color to cyan any color you'd like i didn't want to pick green color because the background is already green so just pick a cyan color and then my turtle for ctrl c ctrl v okay so we have the my turtle 4. now we can just use the down key if you want to go faster okay so it changes all to four and then we're gonna um change the color to purple so this is the fourth this is gonna be the fourth turtle and then we're going to make it negative 50. okay and then it's okay so we have all the turtles let's play as you can see they're not racing yet because we did not make the move yet so we will now so right now we're gonna do time we're gonna add this at least waiting one second before the game starts so time dot sleep and then we're gonna put parentheses one second so it's gonna wait one second before starting up the race and then i'm gonna put another comment right here let's go move turtles let's move to turtles for i in range so we're going to make another loop for i in range so we're going to make this repeat 110 times do this 110 times and colon because it's a loop so my turtle one my turtle one dot forward and then we're gonna make it a random one to five steps pick random so rand ins one to five put this one to five and you just copy paste this a couple times let's tap to tab and tap okay so now we have them we're going to have to change the numbers two three and four so now we have all the different ones so my turtle one two three and four okay it looks like we're finished now let's play as you can see the turtles are moving so you can bet with your friends which turtle you want to win and stuff like that so as you can see the yellow turtle won right now so before we end the video we would like to tell you that we have a second channel now it's a gaming channel so my brother started it and he has like one video on
