00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys the kids coding
00:08 - playground here today we'll be doing a
00:10 - scrolling sonic game in scratch
00:13 - so the point of the game is the longer
00:15 - you survive the more points you'll get
00:17 - and then you use the up arrow keys to
00:19 - jump over
00:20 - obstacles and try to dodge obstacles and
00:23 - then you can use the down arrow key to
00:24 - duck under obstacles
00:26 - so before we start our project i would
00:28 - like to give a few shout outs to people
00:30 - that requested for a sonic game so
00:33 - here on our channel you can see a lot of
00:35 - people
00:36 - um well some people have suggested us to
00:38 - make a sonic game so
00:40 - this person suggested us to get the
00:41 - sprites i'm pretty sure we used this
00:43 - website to get the sonic sprites we'll
00:46 - also put the
00:47 - google drive in our comments or the
00:50 - description below so you guys can
00:52 - download your sprites or you can export
00:54 - it straight from our video
00:55 - so yeah as you can see we have quite a
00:57 - few comments
00:59 - um of sonic hedgehog games so without
01:02 - further ado let's start on our project
01:04 - so let's first
01:06 - demonstrate the game so i'm going to go
01:08 - full screen
01:09 - so basically you're running you can jump
01:11 - over the obstacles you see that gear
01:12 - right there you have to jump over it
01:14 - when you roll when you press the down
01:15 - arrow key you roll
01:17 - and jump over that
01:19 - and bullet bill you can use the duck
01:21 - under as you can see i hit the gear so
01:23 - it died so i can restart
01:25 - you duck under the bullet bill and if
01:26 - you hit the rings you get 500 points
01:28 - like in sonic you know how he collects
01:30 - rings
01:31 - you get points for that
01:33 - yeah so it's pretty much it pretty
01:34 - simple
01:35 - um
01:37 - so it's kind of a simple runner game
01:39 - alright so now let's start on your
01:40 - project by
01:42 - clicking the new button
01:45 - okay
01:46 - so next we are going to
01:48 - get onto our
01:50 - game so let's delete our scratch cat
01:52 - let's go into our backpack i backpacked
01:55 - a few sprites so we have the sonics
01:57 - right
01:58 - we have
01:59 - the scrolling backgrounds
02:01 - one and two
02:03 - and
02:04 - we use the scratch tutorial from the
02:06 - scratch team channel to make the
02:08 - scrolling backdrop so huge thanks to
02:10 - them for showing us how to do it it's
02:11 - really simple i can show you guys here
02:13 - as well
02:14 - we have the traps we have three costumes
02:16 - for the traps the saw spikehead and the
02:18 - spikes
02:20 - we drew the spikes but these are from
02:23 - we got these from some website
02:25 - and then right here we have bullet bill
02:26 - for mario we just decided to put him in
02:28 - anyways
02:29 - so yeah there he is and then we have the
02:31 - rings
02:32 - and inside the rings we also have hearts
02:34 - because the heart is also from scratch
02:36 - we just put a heart because it's almost
02:38 - valentine's day so we just decided to
02:39 - put it in there as well if you collect
02:41 - it it also gives you 500 points
02:44 - okay so now we have all our sprites
02:46 - so let's get on to our backdrop so we'll
02:48 - just draw a really simple backdrop so
02:50 - like we're gonna get a light blue color
02:52 - i guess like that color
02:54 - no outline
02:57 - and just draw a rectangle or maybe this
02:59 - needs to be a little bit like
03:02 - like this maybe yeah maybe a little
03:04 - darker actually
03:09 - there you go what's that no it's too
03:12 - maybe like this yeah
03:13 - that's a pretty good color
03:15 - maybe actually a little lighter because
03:17 - that now it looks kind of dark
03:20 - there you go that's better
03:22 - uh and we drew a sun in the top right
03:24 - corner so let's get a circle tool
03:27 - remember just hold shift
03:29 - if you want a perfect circle so we're
03:31 - going to get the yellows color that
03:34 - yellow
03:35 - hold down shift and boom you got a
03:37 - perfect circle
03:38 - put that in the top right corner
03:40 - and there we have it we have our
03:41 - backdrop really simple to make
03:44 - and then here we enter sonic sprite we
03:46 - have a ton of costumes
03:47 - here are all the ducking costumes like
03:49 - the rolling we won't be using this one
03:51 - but we'll be using these four
03:53 - and the running animation so that's our
03:56 - sonic sprite
03:58 - okay so inside our scrolling backdrop
04:01 - i'll show you guys how to draw it and
04:02 - stuff so basically
04:04 - what we did right here is we
04:06 - drew a rectangle green and then we used
04:09 - the reshape tool to reshape it to look
04:10 - like mountains
04:12 - and then these trees is from the sprite
04:14 - library and here we have just a green
04:16 - strip as the grass i guess
04:19 - and then rocks are really easy to make
04:21 - i'll demonstrate how to make one so
04:23 - basically just get the circle tool
04:25 - draw a kind of oval shaped kind of like
04:27 - an egg shape use the reshape tool
04:29 - and then move this up a little bit and
04:32 - boom you got yourself a simple rock
04:34 - really easy to make
04:35 - so that's how you make a rock
04:38 - and then right here we have more so we
04:39 - just made two costumes for the first
04:41 - sprite and two for the second sprite so
04:44 - what we're gonna do is make the next
04:46 - costume so that alternate so there's
04:47 - more variety to the background so we
04:50 - have two right here and then right here
04:51 - we have another two
04:52 - and then right here we have a little
04:53 - pond all we did just get some green
04:55 - patch
04:56 - and just drew our oval so yeah here's
04:59 - our second costume
05:01 - and you always want to make these guys
05:03 - like
05:04 - kind of like touching the edge because
05:05 - you want it to be smooth
05:07 - so as you can see
05:09 - make them kind of like similar in the
05:11 - same position
05:13 - so then it'll be kind of smooth when
05:14 - you're doing the scrolling background
05:17 - so there's like no empty spaces in here
05:19 - so it's all filled up
05:21 - okay
05:22 - so now let's hop into our sonic sprite
05:24 - and first we didn't make him go to the
05:26 - front layer because like you see he's in
05:28 - the back so we're going to get a one
05:30 - green flag flicked
05:31 - zoom in a little
05:33 - go to front layer
05:35 - and go to the front
05:37 - and then we're going to broadcast a
05:39 - message named reset we'll need this
05:41 - later so first let's broadcast message
05:43 - oops
05:45 - broadcast message name it reset
05:48 - and then next
05:50 - we're going to see let's make it here to
05:52 - the front okay and then when i receive
05:54 - reset
05:55 - when you receive the message reset we
05:56 - are going to
05:57 - make a new variable we're going to name
05:59 - it score so
06:00 - score for all sprites that's fine
06:03 - so we're going to set the score to zero
06:05 - in the beginning and then we're going to
06:06 - go to this position so the position
06:08 - right here i have is negative 150
06:10 - negative 85 so it's kind of near the
06:12 - bottom left of the screen so it's a
06:14 - pretty good position i guess so you can
06:17 - do that
06:18 - and then next we're going to define a
06:20 - block so this is simulating the gravity
06:21 - so then
06:22 - sonic will jump up and you'll come down
06:24 - we'll come back right back down so we're
06:26 - going to make a new block so we're going
06:28 - to name it
06:29 - simulate gravity
06:32 - simulate gravity and then we're going to
06:34 - run screen without refresh um this is
06:36 - optional but since like we don't have
06:38 - the animations inside or simulate
06:40 - gravity block this is not necessary but
06:43 - what it does is just make sonic
06:45 - run smoother so then the game will act a
06:47 - little smoother
06:48 - so you can do this run on screen.refresh
06:52 - so we have our simulate gravity block we
06:54 - are going to get an if else statement so
06:56 - if
06:58 - else so if the up arrow key is pressed
07:02 - if key up is pressed
07:06 - you can also do w or whatever key you
07:07 - want and then we're going to switch the
07:10 - costume to jump
07:12 - so the first costume to jump is
07:15 - this one let me find it
07:20 - right here sorry my bad uh it's all the
07:21 - way at the bottom
07:23 - jump
07:24 - so it's kind of like a jumping animation
07:28 - and then we have another if-else
07:30 - statement so we're going to put it
07:31 - inside the first if-then area so this
07:34 - part is to simulate the gravity so
07:36 - basically you know how his
07:38 - y position is negative 85. so we're
07:40 - gonna
07:41 - make sure if it's equal so if the y
07:43 - position is equal to negative 85
07:46 - y position equals to negative 85 we are
07:49 - going to set the fall speed which is a
07:51 - new variable so basically if it's at 85
07:55 - we will negative 85 we will allow sonic
07:57 - to jump up but if it's not like let's
08:00 - say it's in in the air then we'll make
08:02 - it fall right back down by making it
08:04 - minus one so we're gonna make a new fall
08:06 - speed a new variable we're gonna get
08:08 - false speed
08:09 - full speed
08:11 - for all sprites
08:13 - so here with our full speed we're going
08:14 - to set it
08:15 - we're going to set full speed
08:17 - to fall speed plus 16 so if it's
08:21 - right here if it's on negative 85 y
08:23 - position we will allow the player to
08:25 - jump so we're going to
08:26 - get the plus
08:27 - so we're going to hit the full speed
08:28 - plus 16
08:32 - full speed plus 16
08:35 - and then next if it's in the air else
08:37 - then we're going to set the fall speed
08:39 - to fall speed minus one so it's going to
08:41 - come back down
08:44 - full speed minus one so down here we're
08:46 - also gonna do a set fall speed minus one
08:49 - because
08:50 - if you were to jump sonic would get
08:52 - stuck if you don't have an extra one
08:53 - down here so you always want to make
08:54 - sure sonic is coming right back down
08:58 - okay
08:59 - and then this is just defining the
09:01 - variables this is not actually going to
09:02 - make it fall back down and allowed to
09:04 - jump
09:05 - so we're going to have to do change y so
09:08 - we're going to change the y by full
09:10 - speed down here
09:12 - full speed and
09:14 - and then we're going to get if then
09:16 - statement if
09:19 - uh y position is less than negative 85
09:22 - so sometimes you know um like when
09:24 - you're doing a platform or something
09:25 - they can like fall through the platform
09:27 - and stuff like that so we don't want
09:29 - that to happen so we're going to make it
09:30 - we're going to push him right back up
09:32 - if he somehow falls under negative 85 so
09:35 - we're going to do a if y position is
09:38 - less than
09:40 - y position is less than negative 85 so
09:42 - there's less than that then we're going
09:43 - to set his uh y position back to
09:46 - negative 85
09:47 - so he'll get pushed back up and we're
09:49 - gonna set the fall speed to zero so we
09:51 - won't fall anymore
09:53 - when he's on the platform so then next
09:55 - we're gonna get an if then statement one
09:57 - more
09:58 - if
09:59 - it's touching the trap or bullet bill so
10:01 - this is for later but like let's say
10:03 - it's touching the trap or bullet bill
10:05 - touching
10:06 - trap
10:09 - or bullet bill
10:10 - which are the enemies
10:12 - then it will broadcast reset
10:15 - right so here we have our simulink
10:17 - gravity
10:19 - so of course it won't work unless if we
10:21 - define the um
10:23 - if we
10:24 - call the function so we're gonna have to
10:25 - call it
10:26 - so up here inside the reset block you're
10:29 - going to get a forever loop
10:32 - and we're going to simulate gravity
10:35 - okay so now you can save the project and
10:37 - i'll show you guys
10:39 - so now you jump you see it it jumps
10:42 - yeah so well there's no animation yet
10:44 - so when you click the up arrow it jumps
10:46 - and it won't fall under as you can see
10:49 - so the jumping mechanic is working it's
10:50 - jumping up and right back down
10:53 - so i'll show you guys if you take out
10:55 - this part what will happen so let's take
10:56 - it out
10:58 - jump see it'll just get stuck to the top
11:00 - so it is mandatory to put this part in
11:03 - so
11:04 - there you go so now
11:06 - we have the jumping mechanic done we can
11:08 - work on the walk animation and the
11:10 - docking animation so
11:12 - let's zoom in again
11:14 - let's
11:16 - uh broadcast right receive the message
11:18 - reset again so when i receive the
11:20 - message reset this is we're gonna do the
11:22 - walking animation now
11:23 - so
11:25 - forever
11:29 - if okay so we're gonna get an if then
11:31 - statement so if
11:33 - not
11:35 - up arrow or down arrow key so basically
11:37 - if neither arrow key is being pressed
11:40 - then we are going to allow sonic to be
11:42 - able to walk so we're going to do
11:44 - knots so if it's not
11:46 - up or down so not up arrow key
11:51 - key up
11:54 - arrow or down arrow
11:58 - then we're going to next costume
12:02 - and then we're going to if then
12:03 - statement if
12:07 - if it's greater than
12:09 - um the costume number is greater than
12:11 - eight so here you see we have eight
12:12 - costumes for the running
12:14 - so you see we have the ducking animation
12:15 - right here so basically um
12:19 - we have eight which is running and then
12:22 - a few that are ducking and then one for
12:24 - jumping so basically if it's greater
12:25 - than eight which is the walking
12:27 - animation then we're gonna set the uh
12:29 - walk animation back to the first one so
12:31 - then it won't go to the next ducking
12:33 - animation so we're gonna go if
12:37 - costume number is greater than eight
12:41 - greater than eight then we're going to
12:43 - set the
12:44 - block animation back to the first one
12:47 - switch costume back to run one
12:49 - and then we're gonna wait point 0.05
12:51 - seconds
12:52 - right here just so it looks a little
12:54 - better
12:55 - so it won't look like
12:56 - it's lagging so it looks a little bit
12:58 - better when you do that
13:00 - so let's play our project
13:02 - as you can see
13:04 - sonic is able to walk see the walk
13:07 - animation you jump
13:08 - see that yeah so we've got a simple walk
13:11 - animation
13:13 - and next let's do the docking animations
13:15 - over here we have the
13:16 - walk and down here go to the dock
13:18 - so when i receive the reset
13:21 - uh
13:22 - message then we're going to get a
13:23 - forever loop
13:24 - and then if we're in if then statement
13:28 - so if the uh down arrow key is pressed
13:31 - key down is pressed
13:34 - down here then we're going to start
13:36 - a sound so let's get the sound i think i
13:38 - have it yeah toys r here
13:40 - see that so we're going to get the toys
13:43 - start the sound toys
13:45 - and then we're going to switch the
13:46 - costume to duck one
13:52 - so when you press down
13:54 - you'll switch the costume right here so
13:55 - it starts right here for the first
13:57 - ducking costume
14:01 - okay
14:02 - so next we're going to repeat three
14:04 - times
14:08 - repeat three times and then we're gonna
14:09 - wait 0.05 seconds so it looks a little
14:12 - bit better and then we're going to next
14:13 - costume
14:15 - costume
14:17 - so basically we're just gonna make it
14:19 - switch costume to this we're not
14:21 - repeating four times even those four
14:22 - costumes because we're starting on this
14:24 - one so it's going to repeat three times
14:26 - and then go back to here repeat three
14:28 - times go back to here so it just keeps
14:30 - on going until the player lets go of the
14:32 - down arrow key
14:34 - so here we have all of our code for our
14:36 - sonic so let me just move it all down
14:39 - so it looks a little bit better
14:40 - okay so there we have it
14:42 - so if you have anything with it if you
14:44 - have anything that you want to add to it
14:47 - that you didn't add before that you you
14:48 - should add it now
14:51 - okay and then next uh we can make the
14:54 - score thing so we can make it like game
14:57 - score as you keep on going so we're
14:59 - gonna forever change score by one
15:02 - change the score by one
15:04 - this is one of those games where like
15:06 - the longer you survive the more score
15:07 - you get so the background isn't
15:09 - scrolling yet so it doesn't really look
15:10 - like anything yet
15:12 - uh so you jump you duck see that yeah so
15:15 - you can roll yeah
15:17 - so there we have all the walking jumping
15:19 - and ducking animation for sonic
15:22 - so that's it for our first part of the
15:24 - series so this is the first part for the
15:26 - sonic
15:28 - scrolling game so
15:30 - in the next part we're going to be
15:31 - working on the scrolling background
15:32 - traps and
15:34 - the rings so that's it for this tutorial
15:37 - thank you guys for watching
15:38 - stay tuned uh for the next video we'll
15:41 - probably release this shortly after this
15:43 - one gets released
15:44 - so don't forget to like share and
15:47 - subscribe and i'll see you guys in the
15:48 - next video
15:53 - [Music]
16:03 - you

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys the kids coding playground here today we'll be doing a scrolling sonic game in scratch so the point of the game is the longer you survive the more points you'll get and then you use the up arrow keys to jump over obstacles and try to dodge obstacles and then you can use the down arrow key to duck under obstacles so before we start our project i would like to give a few shout outs to people that requested for a sonic game so here on our channel you can see a lot of people um well some people have suggested us to make a sonic game so this person suggested us to get the sprites i'm pretty sure we used this website to get the sonic sprites we'll also put the google drive in our comments or the description below so you guys can download your sprites or you can export it straight from our video so yeah as you can see we have quite a few comments um of sonic hedgehog games so without further ado let's start on our project so let's first demonstrate the game so i'm going to go full screen so basically you're running you can jump over the obstacles you see that gear right there you have to jump over it when you roll when you press the down arrow key you roll and jump over that and bullet bill you can use the duck under as you can see i hit the gear so it died so i can restart you duck under the bullet bill and if you hit the rings you get 500 points like in sonic you know how he collects rings you get points for that yeah so it's pretty much it pretty simple um so it's kind of a simple runner game alright so now let's start on your project by clicking the new button okay so next we are going to get onto our game so let's delete our scratch cat let's go into our backpack i backpacked a few sprites so we have the sonics right we have the scrolling backgrounds one and two and we use the scratch tutorial from the scratch team channel to make the scrolling backdrop so huge thanks to them for showing us how to do it it's really simple i can show you guys here as well we have the traps we have three costumes for the traps the saw spikehead and the spikes we drew the spikes but these are from we got these from some website and then right here we have bullet bill for mario we just decided to put him in anyways so yeah there he is and then we have the rings and inside the rings we also have hearts because the heart is also from scratch we just put a heart because it's almost valentine's day so we just decided to put it in there as well if you collect it it also gives you 500 points okay so now we have all our sprites so let's get on to our backdrop so we'll just draw a really simple backdrop so like we're gonna get a light blue color i guess like that color no outline and just draw a rectangle or maybe this needs to be a little bit like like this maybe yeah maybe a little darker actually there you go what's that no it's too maybe like this yeah that's a pretty good color maybe actually a little lighter because that now it looks kind of dark there you go that's better uh and we drew a sun in the top right corner so let's get a circle tool remember just hold shift if you want a perfect circle so we're going to get the yellows color that yellow hold down shift and boom you got a perfect circle put that in the top right corner and there we have it we have our backdrop really simple to make and then here we enter sonic sprite we have a ton of costumes here are all the ducking costumes like the rolling we won't be using this one but we'll be using these four and the running animation so that's our sonic sprite okay so inside our scrolling backdrop i'll show you guys how to draw it and stuff so basically what we did right here is we drew a rectangle green and then we used the reshape tool to reshape it to look like mountains and then these trees is from the sprite library and here we have just a green strip as the grass i guess and then rocks are really easy to make i'll demonstrate how to make one so basically just get the circle tool draw a kind of oval shaped kind of like an egg shape use the reshape tool and then move this up a little bit and boom you got yourself a simple rock really easy to make so that's how you make a rock and then right here we have more so we just made two costumes for the first sprite and two for the second sprite so what we're gonna do is make the next costume so that alternate so there's more variety to the background so we have two right here and then right here we have another two and then right here we have a little pond all we did just get some green patch and just drew our oval so yeah here's our second costume and you always want to make these guys like kind of like touching the edge because you want it to be smooth so as you can see make them kind of like similar in the same position so then it'll be kind of smooth when you're doing the scrolling background so there's like no empty spaces in here so it's all filled up okay so now let's hop into our sonic sprite and first we didn't make him go to the front layer because like you see he's in the back so we're going to get a one green flag flicked zoom in a little go to front layer and go to the front and then we're going to broadcast a message named reset we'll need this later so first let's broadcast message oops broadcast message name it reset and then next we're going to see let's make it here to the front okay and then when i receive reset when you receive the message reset we are going to make a new variable we're going to name it score so score for all sprites that's fine so we're going to set the score to zero in the beginning and then we're going to go to this position so the position right here i have is negative 150 negative 85 so it's kind of near the bottom left of the screen so it's a pretty good position i guess so you can do that and then next we're going to define a block so this is simulating the gravity so then sonic will jump up and you'll come down we'll come back right back down so we're going to make a new block so we're going to name it simulate gravity simulate gravity and then we're going to run screen without refresh um this is optional but since like we don't have the animations inside or simulate gravity block this is not necessary but what it does is just make sonic run smoother so then the game will act a little smoother so you can do this run on screen.refresh so we have our simulate gravity block we are going to get an if else statement so if else so if the up arrow key is pressed if key up is pressed you can also do w or whatever key you want and then we're going to switch the costume to jump so the first costume to jump is this one let me find it right here sorry my bad uh it's all the way at the bottom jump so it's kind of like a jumping animation and then we have another ifelse statement so we're going to put it inside the first ifthen area so this part is to simulate the gravity so basically you know how his y position is negative 85. so we're gonna make sure if it's equal so if the y position is equal to negative 85 y position equals to negative 85 we are going to set the fall speed which is a new variable so basically if it's at 85 we will negative 85 we will allow sonic to jump up but if it's not like let's say it's in in the air then we'll make it fall right back down by making it minus one so we're gonna make a new fall speed a new variable we're gonna get false speed full speed for all sprites so here with our full speed we're going to set it we're going to set full speed to fall speed plus 16 so if it's right here if it's on negative 85 y position we will allow the player to jump so we're going to get the plus so we're going to hit the full speed plus 16 full speed plus 16 and then next if it's in the air else then we're going to set the fall speed to fall speed minus one so it's going to come back down full speed minus one so down here we're also gonna do a set fall speed minus one because if you were to jump sonic would get stuck if you don't have an extra one down here so you always want to make sure sonic is coming right back down okay and then this is just defining the variables this is not actually going to make it fall back down and allowed to jump so we're going to have to do change y so we're going to change the y by full speed down here full speed and and then we're going to get if then statement if uh y position is less than negative 85 so sometimes you know um like when you're doing a platform or something they can like fall through the platform and stuff like that so we don't want that to happen so we're going to make it we're going to push him right back up if he somehow falls under negative 85 so we're going to do a if y position is less than y position is less than negative 85 so there's less than that then we're going to set his uh y position back to negative 85 so he'll get pushed back up and we're gonna set the fall speed to zero so we won't fall anymore when he's on the platform so then next we're gonna get an if then statement one more if it's touching the trap or bullet bill so this is for later but like let's say it's touching the trap or bullet bill touching trap or bullet bill which are the enemies then it will broadcast reset right so here we have our simulink gravity so of course it won't work unless if we define the um if we call the function so we're gonna have to call it so up here inside the reset block you're going to get a forever loop and we're going to simulate gravity okay so now you can save the project and i'll show you guys so now you jump you see it it jumps yeah so well there's no animation yet so when you click the up arrow it jumps and it won't fall under as you can see so the jumping mechanic is working it's jumping up and right back down so i'll show you guys if you take out this part what will happen so let's take it out jump see it'll just get stuck to the top so it is mandatory to put this part in so there you go so now we have the jumping mechanic done we can work on the walk animation and the docking animation so let's zoom in again let's uh broadcast right receive the message reset again so when i receive the message reset this is we're gonna do the walking animation now so forever if okay so we're gonna get an if then statement so if not up arrow or down arrow key so basically if neither arrow key is being pressed then we are going to allow sonic to be able to walk so we're going to do knots so if it's not up or down so not up arrow key key up arrow or down arrow then we're going to next costume and then we're going to if then statement if if it's greater than um the costume number is greater than eight so here you see we have eight costumes for the running so you see we have the ducking animation right here so basically um we have eight which is running and then a few that are ducking and then one for jumping so basically if it's greater than eight which is the walking animation then we're gonna set the uh walk animation back to the first one so then it won't go to the next ducking animation so we're gonna go if costume number is greater than eight greater than eight then we're going to set the block animation back to the first one switch costume back to run one and then we're gonna wait point 0.05 seconds right here just so it looks a little better so it won't look like it's lagging so it looks a little bit better when you do that so let's play our project as you can see sonic is able to walk see the walk animation you jump see that yeah so we've got a simple walk animation and next let's do the docking animations over here we have the walk and down here go to the dock so when i receive the reset uh message then we're going to get a forever loop and then if we're in if then statement so if the uh down arrow key is pressed key down is pressed down here then we're going to start a sound so let's get the sound i think i have it yeah toys r here see that so we're going to get the toys start the sound toys and then we're going to switch the costume to duck one so when you press down you'll switch the costume right here so it starts right here for the first ducking costume okay so next we're going to repeat three times repeat three times and then we're gonna wait 0.05 seconds so it looks a little bit better and then we're going to next costume costume so basically we're just gonna make it switch costume to this we're not repeating four times even those four costumes because we're starting on this one so it's going to repeat three times and then go back to here repeat three times go back to here so it just keeps on going until the player lets go of the down arrow key so here we have all of our code for our sonic so let me just move it all down so it looks a little bit better okay so there we have it so if you have anything with it if you have anything that you want to add to it that you didn't add before that you you should add it now okay and then next uh we can make the score thing so we can make it like game score as you keep on going so we're gonna forever change score by one change the score by one this is one of those games where like the longer you survive the more score you get so the background isn't scrolling yet so it doesn't really look like anything yet uh so you jump you duck see that yeah so you can roll yeah so there we have all the walking jumping and ducking animation for sonic so that's it for our first part of the series so this is the first part for the sonic scrolling game so in the next part we're going to be working on the scrolling background traps and the rings so that's it for this tutorial thank you guys for watching stay tuned uh for the next video we'll probably release this shortly after this one gets released so don't forget to like share and subscribe and i'll see you guys in the next video you
