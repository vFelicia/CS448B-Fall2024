00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:09 - kids coding program today we'll be doing
00:11 - a video on how to make a project that
00:15 - grows flowers when you click so when the
00:17 - user clicks on the mouse it will create
00:19 - a flower at the location where the mouse
00:21 - is clicked so today this tutorial are
00:26 - you learning these concepts and scratch
00:28 - custom blocks 10 and change color
00:32 - effects so I'll show you guys how the
00:36 - game works
00:37 - first so I'm beginning is clear so when
00:41 - you click it will make a flower you'll
00:45 - make a lot of flowers and once you want
00:48 - to clear all your stuff you press the
00:50 - spacebar and you'll all be cleared up so
00:54 - yeah that's pretty much the project so
00:58 - let's start a new project so first we
01:03 - will need the scratched at we already
01:05 - have the pend extension so to get the
01:07 - extension you want to go here and add
01:09 - the pend extension so you have to pend
01:12 - right here and you want to get the ball
01:15 - sprite this one will need the ball you
01:20 - can select the backdrop I'm gonna take
01:23 - the blue sky this one so next we're
01:26 - gonna need to make some custom blocks
01:28 - just make a custom block called draw
01:32 - stock trial stock we'll need to add two
01:38 - inputs one input is the blend the length
01:43 - of it the length of the stop and the
01:52 - thickness of it
01:58 - so we have length and thickness
02:01 - okay so length and thickness press okay
02:04 - so we have to live a custom function so
02:07 - at first we want to set the pen size set
02:13 - the pen size to the thickness so as you
02:16 - can see if you just drag it from here so
02:19 - it set the pen size to the thickness and
02:22 - we're going to set the pen color to like
02:24 - a greenish color so I'm gonna just take
02:28 - a dark greenish color for the stock this
02:31 - is for the stock so just take that color
02:34 - you can do any color of course you want
02:38 - to pin down to draw the stock change Y
02:41 - about the length of the stock so that
02:44 - make they'll change the Y position by
02:47 - the length of the stock it will let go
02:49 - up and down they'll go up and make the
02:51 - stock so just drag the length or here so
02:54 - just put it here and pen up so stop
02:57 - trying so that's it for the stock and
03:03 - now we have to do the what it clicks it
03:07 - will make the stock and grow the flower
03:10 - so need what first we'll want to clear
03:14 - everything with the spacebar so you can
03:16 - just do this of course when space key is
03:19 - pressed erase all it's pretty simple so
03:21 - next we'll wanna drag in that one
03:23 - o'clock flag click block in the
03:26 - beginning we want to erase all so when
03:29 - you start the project though all the
03:32 - artwork will be erased
03:34 - get it forever loop and inside you want
03:40 - to if that statement if then Mouse down
03:42 - that means if they're clicking the mouse
03:44 - so if the mouse is down right here then
03:50 - go to the mouse pointer so it'll go to
03:52 - follow mouse go to the mouse pointer go
03:57 - to Mouse yeah just lock toss pointer and
04:03 - we want to draw stock 105 that's the
04:07 - length
04:09 - that the stock will be 100 and the
04:11 - thickness will be 5 so it will be 100
04:15 - tall and 5 watt so as you can see when
04:19 - you click it out those draw stocks draw
04:23 - stocks everywhere but we haven't got the
04:25 - flower yet
04:25 - so now we'll need another custom block
04:29 - called draw flower let me zoom out a
04:31 - little cuz it's gonna be a big block so
04:36 - wrong flower
04:39 - so draw flower we'll need 3 inputs so
04:44 - just add the text then we'll need petal
04:57 - color this is just the color of the
05:00 - petal and this is the center color which
05:03 - is like the ball color it's upper case
05:09 - center color so that's our blocks this
05:13 - is our custom block right here so when
05:17 - you click you want to when to define
05:19 - this we want to first set the size of
05:22 - 100 so the ball will always be at 100%
05:25 - size set the color effect in the
05:29 - beginning to the petal color so that
05:33 - would be the color of the petal and if
05:37 - it repeats will repeat take the repeat
05:41 - number of petal times then move 25 so
05:45 - that's to troll the petal move 25 steps
05:48 - in like the circular motion move 25
05:53 - steps stamp so those stamp multiple
05:58 - circles so make like a flower I guess
06:02 - stamp and move negative 25 steps also
06:07 - for drawing the flower so what this code
06:14 - means is ill
06:16 - so put this in negative 25 is the ball
06:19 - go out draw stamp right here go back to
06:22 - the center and move here and draw so
06:25 - next we'll need the turn so it will turn
06:29 - 360 360 divided by the number of petals
06:34 - we do 360 because the circle is 300
06:37 - degrees 360 degrees and we'll take the
06:41 - number of petals the more the more
06:43 - degrees you turn the more petals and
06:46 - makes the less degree ill turn and the
06:49 - more and the less pedals they'll make
06:50 - the more degrees it will turn so less
06:54 - petals equals more turn and more petals
06:59 - is luster so we'll change the color set
07:04 - the colors or set the color effect to
07:07 - the center color go here so the center
07:11 - watch you have color and stamp and stamp
07:17 - and finally we'll need to go back up
07:20 - here and go here into this code this
07:25 - chunk of code get this function Patrol
07:29 - flower and function under here so what
07:33 - this is calling is this function so
07:35 - we'll need a pick random 5 to 10 which
07:39 - is um basically pick random pick random
07:44 - 5 to 10 number of petals so it'll kick a
07:47 - random number of petals between 505 to
07:51 - 10 so next we'll want to pick a random
07:54 - negative 100 to 100 that's the gonna
07:57 - beat the petal color then 100 - 100 so
08:01 - this will determine the petals color and
08:04 - finally the center color will also do
08:07 - pick random negative 100 in other
08:09 - countries so that's all we have right
08:17 - now that's it so let's play so as you
08:25 - can see it's making flowers
08:30 - and when you press space it clears so
08:35 - thank you guys for watching please call
08:38 - me down in the below if you like this
08:41 - video please like this video share this
08:43 - video and subscribe to your channel for
08:46 - more content thank you guys for watching
08:48 - and we'll see you guys next time

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding program today we'll be doing a video on how to make a project that grows flowers when you click so when the user clicks on the mouse it will create a flower at the location where the mouse is clicked so today this tutorial are you learning these concepts and scratch custom blocks 10 and change color effects so I'll show you guys how the game works first so I'm beginning is clear so when you click it will make a flower you'll make a lot of flowers and once you want to clear all your stuff you press the spacebar and you'll all be cleared up so yeah that's pretty much the project so let's start a new project so first we will need the scratched at we already have the pend extension so to get the extension you want to go here and add the pend extension so you have to pend right here and you want to get the ball sprite this one will need the ball you can select the backdrop I'm gonna take the blue sky this one so next we're gonna need to make some custom blocks just make a custom block called draw stock trial stock we'll need to add two inputs one input is the blend the length of it the length of the stop and the thickness of it so we have length and thickness okay so length and thickness press okay so we have to live a custom function so at first we want to set the pen size set the pen size to the thickness so as you can see if you just drag it from here so it set the pen size to the thickness and we're going to set the pen color to like a greenish color so I'm gonna just take a dark greenish color for the stock this is for the stock so just take that color you can do any color of course you want to pin down to draw the stock change Y about the length of the stock so that make they'll change the Y position by the length of the stock it will let go up and down they'll go up and make the stock so just drag the length or here so just put it here and pen up so stop trying so that's it for the stock and now we have to do the what it clicks it will make the stock and grow the flower so need what first we'll want to clear everything with the spacebar so you can just do this of course when space key is pressed erase all it's pretty simple so next we'll wanna drag in that one o'clock flag click block in the beginning we want to erase all so when you start the project though all the artwork will be erased get it forever loop and inside you want to if that statement if then Mouse down that means if they're clicking the mouse so if the mouse is down right here then go to the mouse pointer so it'll go to follow mouse go to the mouse pointer go to Mouse yeah just lock toss pointer and we want to draw stock 105 that's the length that the stock will be 100 and the thickness will be 5 so it will be 100 tall and 5 watt so as you can see when you click it out those draw stocks draw stocks everywhere but we haven't got the flower yet so now we'll need another custom block called draw flower let me zoom out a little cuz it's gonna be a big block so wrong flower so draw flower we'll need 3 inputs so just add the text then we'll need petal color this is just the color of the petal and this is the center color which is like the ball color it's upper case center color so that's our blocks this is our custom block right here so when you click you want to when to define this we want to first set the size of 100 so the ball will always be at 100% size set the color effect in the beginning to the petal color so that would be the color of the petal and if it repeats will repeat take the repeat number of petal times then move 25 so that's to troll the petal move 25 steps in like the circular motion move 25 steps stamp so those stamp multiple circles so make like a flower I guess stamp and move negative 25 steps also for drawing the flower so what this code means is ill so put this in negative 25 is the ball go out draw stamp right here go back to the center and move here and draw so next we'll need the turn so it will turn 360 360 divided by the number of petals we do 360 because the circle is 300 degrees 360 degrees and we'll take the number of petals the more the more degrees you turn the more petals and makes the less degree ill turn and the more and the less pedals they'll make the more degrees it will turn so less petals equals more turn and more petals is luster so we'll change the color set the colors or set the color effect to the center color go here so the center watch you have color and stamp and stamp and finally we'll need to go back up here and go here into this code this chunk of code get this function Patrol flower and function under here so what this is calling is this function so we'll need a pick random 5 to 10 which is um basically pick random pick random 5 to 10 number of petals so it'll kick a random number of petals between 505 to 10 so next we'll want to pick a random negative 100 to 100 that's the gonna beat the petal color then 100 100 so this will determine the petals color and finally the center color will also do pick random negative 100 in other countries so that's all we have right now that's it so let's play so as you can see it's making flowers and when you press space it clears so thank you guys for watching please call me down in the below if you like this video please like this video share this video and subscribe to
