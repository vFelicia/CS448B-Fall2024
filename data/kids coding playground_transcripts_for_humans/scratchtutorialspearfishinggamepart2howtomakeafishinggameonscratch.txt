00:00 - [Music]
00:08 - so anyways
00:09 - we're back guys and um this is part two
00:12 - of
00:12 - the spear fishing game so if you haven't
00:14 - seen part one please look at part one
00:16 - so anyways let's get started so first
00:19 - on our diver we have the we have
00:23 - all all this code that's it for the
00:25 - diver right now
00:27 - we have the spear code this is it for
00:29 - the spear
00:30 - code and let's just review the diver
00:33 - code
00:35 - and this is if green flag clicked set hp
00:38 - to 100
00:38 - set rotation style left right and all
00:40 - the moving
00:42 - and spear oh whenever
00:45 - one green flag is clicked he'll set fish
00:47 - to zero forever go to diver
00:50 - if a key space is pressed broadcast fire
00:52 - in the spirit and wait
00:53 - when i receive fire the spear show
00:54 - repeat until touching edge move ten
00:56 - steps go to diaper
00:58 - and let's go to the fish so when the
01:00 - green flag is clicked go to front layer
01:02 - set rotation style left right
01:04 - move fish and then define move fish go
01:06 - to a random position
01:08 - set a costume name to join fish pick
01:09 - random one to four switch costumes a
01:11 - costume name
01:12 - show forever if then touching spear then
01:14 - broadcast got fish and all of this
01:16 - so right here okay
01:19 - and then let's get started what we have
01:23 - so fish so we'll be working on the fish
01:25 - again because there's more code for the
01:27 - fish
01:28 - and when i receive got fish
01:33 - it will stop other scripts in the sprite
01:38 - so that's when you get the fish not stop
01:40 - all because there's
01:42 - it's top other strips in the sprite and
01:45 - change
01:45 - fish by one so that's when you know that
01:48 - you cotton
01:52 - and switch costume to join
01:55 - this costume right here
01:59 - to join
02:03 - the costume name so it's either costume
02:06 - to dead one
02:11 - dead dead
02:14 - one
02:18 - so and then they'll start sam bobble so
02:20 - explain this code afterwards
02:22 - so i'm gonna go to the sound and then
02:24 - bubbles
02:30 - this already bubbles yeah and start
02:33 - sound
02:34 - bubbles
02:36 - and wait one second
02:42 - hide
02:47 - and wait three seconds
02:53 - and i'll move fish so
02:56 - as you can see i'm gonna demo it and as
02:58 - you can see it's not working that well
03:00 - whenever you throw the fish it's always
03:06 - [Music]
03:11 - so as you can see it goes to the head
03:13 - right there when i just
03:14 - hit it hit him in the tail it just went
03:17 - to the head
03:18 - it went through a fish one head but that
03:20 - does not work as well
03:21 - so you also have to make one for the
03:23 - tail so this is not the right coat
03:29 - i'm gonna demo a woman's
03:33 - [Music]
03:38 - so this is not the right code i'm just
03:41 - gonna stop this
03:42 - and then we're gonna work on the correct
03:44 - code
03:45 - so when i receive got fish stop by the
03:48 - description fight
03:49 - change um fishes by one fish by one
03:53 - and then instead of this you have to
03:56 - replace it
03:57 - so i'm gonna continue working on the
03:59 - code so you
04:01 - if then statement we're going to change
04:03 - this all up later
04:05 - so if then um
04:15 - if then the direction of the spear
04:20 - so it's this tricky thing again you
04:23 - could change the back first
04:25 - of the spear the direction of the spear
04:29 - is over than zero
04:34 - that means the sphere is pointing to the
04:35 - right and
04:37 - um you need it again we need actually
04:40 - this one
04:42 - and the direction the direction
04:47 - is greater than zero
04:51 - that means it's pointing to the point to
04:54 - the right
04:54 - so you know switch costume
04:57 - to join let's just take this one right
04:59 - here
05:00 - join instead across instead dead two
05:04 - so i'll be in the back
05:10 - did two yep that's in the back see
05:14 - and then um we're gonna keep on going
05:17 - with the other one so
05:21 - just put it right there okay so
05:24 - let's do that and switch costs you
05:27 - incent you need direction of spear
05:30 - but the direction is the other way
05:37 - is this way instead
05:41 - is less than zero
05:45 - the spear is pointing to the right and
05:47 - the fish is pointing to the left
05:48 - so we're gonna switch the costume name
05:51 - to
05:52 - dead one so there
05:55 - and we also need the other ones
05:58 - to duplicate this again
06:02 - wait wait a second just so we just
06:04 - duplicate this
06:06 - and it's if the
06:09 - oopsies have to
06:12 - i think let's move this a little bit off
06:15 - there
06:16 - let's move this down
06:19 - okay all right so
06:22 - this is if the spear is pointing to the
06:26 - left so we got to get the left one
06:30 - and then so the spear is pointing to the
06:33 - left
06:34 - two and the
06:37 - fish is pointing to the
06:41 - right so
06:44 - we can duplicate the last one
06:48 - so let's just duplicate that
06:51 - again and then instead the direction of
06:54 - the spear
06:56 - and then the direction of the fish is
06:59 - left instead so there and then we can
07:03 - put this for death 2
07:07 - and put this under it there you have it
07:12 - so it's just a code for the fish
07:16 - so you just look at the arrows so if
07:19 - it's pointing here
07:20 - if the spear is pointing to the right
07:21 - and the fish is pointing the right
07:23 - you'll hit him in the back
07:24 - if the spear is pointing to the right
07:26 - and the fish is pointing to the left
07:27 - it'll hit him in the head
07:29 - if the spear is pointing to the left and
07:32 - the
07:32 - fish is pointing to the right they'll
07:34 - hit him in the head
07:35 - and if the spear is pointing to the left
07:38 - and the
07:39 - fish is pointing to the left it'll hit
07:41 - him in the back so
07:42 - there we go and we still have some code
07:45 - to do
07:47 - like we still have some spears to do so
07:49 - when i receive
07:53 - got fish then go hide
08:03 - so i'm just gonna take out this variable
08:05 - right here
08:06 - um i think yes in the fish so take out
08:09 - the costume name variable
08:11 - and then move the fish right here let's
08:15 - actually put the hp on this side
08:18 - and the fish on this side so here we go
08:20 - i'm going to show you
08:22 - so as you can see there's one fish right
08:23 - now so we want it to be more
08:25 - [Music]
08:36 - and then as you can see i got him in the
08:38 - back that's basically how it works so
08:40 - we're not done yet
08:42 - so we want more fish because there's two
08:44 - little fish
08:46 - so we can just duplicate fish
08:50 - and duplicate another fish so i'm gonna
08:54 - go to
08:54 - a fish too but instead you gotta make a
08:57 - new message
08:58 - called got fish
09:02 - two and change that to catfish two and
09:05 - change this to codfish too
09:07 - and you also go to go fish three and say
09:09 - you guys you got fish three
09:11 - so got fish
09:14 - three and got fish three
09:18 - so i'm going to show you how it works
09:20 - it's not completely done yet
09:23 - let me go to the spear and you just have
09:25 - to duplicate it
09:26 - and then instead change it to got fish
09:28 - two
09:30 - and duplicate this again and change this
09:32 - to catfish three
09:33 - let me show you how it works so as you
09:35 - can see there's three fish instead
09:37 - and i'm gonna try to catch one right
09:39 - here so i caught one
09:41 - it's a head shot i mean this is a head
09:43 - shot you can see there's three fish and
09:45 - there's more
09:45 - i got two points that's good
09:50 - that's basically it and we also have to
09:51 - add the puffer fish
09:53 - so it's easy to find
09:56 - puffer fish and we're going to work on
09:59 - it
10:00 - it's not that easy the puffer fish
10:03 - but let's make it so let's define
10:06 - let's make it move fish
10:14 - fish and
10:17 - define new fish we'll go to a random
10:19 - position
10:21 - switch costume to puffer fish a
10:27 - it'll show
10:31 - and i'll go forever move it'll always
10:34 - move five steps
10:38 - and if then it's touching if then
10:43 - touching edge
10:47 - then if it's on the edge you'll bounce
10:50 - so there's no way you can kill the
10:51 - puffer fish
10:52 - unless if it hits you so and then you
10:54 - can just duplicate this
10:58 - if you want more challenge you can just
10:59 - duplicate the popular fish and change it
11:01 - a little bit
11:02 - yeah so diver too and i'll broadcast hit
11:05 - diver instead
11:13 - hit diver
11:19 - so i'm just going to take this out
11:20 - because that can be more complicated
11:22 - complicated so we can just put this
11:24 - right here put it right here
11:26 - put it like this and then it'll define
11:29 - and
11:29 - animate fish so you gotta make a new
11:31 - thing animate fish
11:38 - and make fish
11:42 - and then it'll go forever
11:47 - the next costume
11:50 - and i'll wait one second
11:57 - so you have to do this just because you
11:59 - don't want to block the fish from moving
12:01 - this limit and then so when the green
12:03 - flag is clicked
12:05 - it will hide and go to the front layer
12:11 - i'll set rotation style left right so it
12:13 - won't flip over
12:18 - um i'll wait three seconds
12:24 - and oh define move fish
12:31 - i'll call new fish and then when the
12:33 - green flag is clicked
12:36 - call animate fish
12:40 - and then when i hit diver when you hit
12:42 - the diver
12:44 - so i gotta get a sound so i have to get
12:47 - the sound
12:49 - bonk
12:55 - and when i receive fire this beer no
12:59 - i mean hit diver um it'll start some
13:02 - bomb
13:05 - go hide
13:08 - wait three seconds so that that's when
13:10 - it hits the diver
13:12 - i'll go to a random position again
13:16 - and show there's almost all the code
13:22 - it's almost all the code but i you can
13:25 - it's optional if you want to make it
13:27 - color effect but let's go to the diver
13:30 - and you gotta add if then
13:34 - this is um you need this if then
13:37 - or if it if
13:40 - the health is
13:43 - hp is greater hp is less than zero
13:48 - you can hit right copper fish twice that
13:51 - that might be needed
13:53 - or equal to zero
13:56 - then hp equals zero
13:59 - then it'll broadcast game over
14:15 - so when i receive hit diver
14:20 - i'll change hp
14:28 - by
14:30 - 10 and i'll repeat 10 times
14:36 - i change color effect by 25.
14:43 - and then you want to stop the graphic
14:45 - effects in the end so it changed back to
14:46 - a normal color
14:49 - and there we almost have all the code we
14:51 - also have to
14:52 - get the game over so we can make and
14:55 - paint a sprite
14:57 - and you gotta go text and make it red
15:01 - because
15:01 - whenever you lose you always have to do
15:02 - red and then let's use marker
15:06 - so i'm gonna write this right
15:09 - game oh
15:15 - and let's make this bigger
15:19 - and center it
15:23 - that's around the thing and then
15:26 - when i when the green flag is clicked
15:29 - it'll go to the front layer
15:34 - um go to x zero zero so that's just the
15:38 - middle
15:40 - y0 i'll hide
15:44 - and when i receive game over
15:51 - oh show
15:55 - and it'll stop everything
15:58 - so that's all the code came over so i'm
16:01 - just gonna demonstrate
16:14 - [Music]
16:20 - [Music]
16:24 - and fish and you can't kill the buffer
16:28 - fish as you can see
16:30 - [Music]
16:34 - oh
16:35 - [Music]
16:45 - so it says game over so there that's
16:48 - basically it

Cleaned transcript:

so anyways we're back guys and um this is part two of the spear fishing game so if you haven't seen part one please look at part one so anyways let's get started so first on our diver we have the we have all all this code that's it for the diver right now we have the spear code this is it for the spear code and let's just review the diver code and this is if green flag clicked set hp to 100 set rotation style left right and all the moving and spear oh whenever one green flag is clicked he'll set fish to zero forever go to diver if a key space is pressed broadcast fire in the spirit and wait when i receive fire the spear show repeat until touching edge move ten steps go to diaper and let's go to the fish so when the green flag is clicked go to front layer set rotation style left right move fish and then define move fish go to a random position set a costume name to join fish pick random one to four switch costumes a costume name show forever if then touching spear then broadcast got fish and all of this so right here okay and then let's get started what we have so fish so we'll be working on the fish again because there's more code for the fish and when i receive got fish it will stop other scripts in the sprite so that's when you get the fish not stop all because there's it's top other strips in the sprite and change fish by one so that's when you know that you cotton and switch costume to join this costume right here to join the costume name so it's either costume to dead one dead dead one so and then they'll start sam bobble so explain this code afterwards so i'm gonna go to the sound and then bubbles this already bubbles yeah and start sound bubbles and wait one second hide and wait three seconds and i'll move fish so as you can see i'm gonna demo it and as you can see it's not working that well whenever you throw the fish it's always so as you can see it goes to the head right there when i just hit it hit him in the tail it just went to the head it went through a fish one head but that does not work as well so you also have to make one for the tail so this is not the right coat i'm gonna demo a woman's so this is not the right code i'm just gonna stop this and then we're gonna work on the correct code so when i receive got fish stop by the description fight change um fishes by one fish by one and then instead of this you have to replace it so i'm gonna continue working on the code so you if then statement we're going to change this all up later so if then um if then the direction of the spear so it's this tricky thing again you could change the back first of the spear the direction of the spear is over than zero that means the sphere is pointing to the right and um you need it again we need actually this one and the direction the direction is greater than zero that means it's pointing to the point to the right so you know switch costume to join let's just take this one right here join instead across instead dead two so i'll be in the back did two yep that's in the back see and then um we're gonna keep on going with the other one so just put it right there okay so let's do that and switch costs you incent you need direction of spear but the direction is the other way is this way instead is less than zero the spear is pointing to the right and the fish is pointing to the left so we're gonna switch the costume name to dead one so there and we also need the other ones to duplicate this again wait wait a second just so we just duplicate this and it's if the oopsies have to i think let's move this a little bit off there let's move this down okay all right so this is if the spear is pointing to the left so we got to get the left one and then so the spear is pointing to the left two and the fish is pointing to the right so we can duplicate the last one so let's just duplicate that again and then instead the direction of the spear and then the direction of the fish is left instead so there and then we can put this for death 2 and put this under it there you have it so it's just a code for the fish so you just look at the arrows so if it's pointing here if the spear is pointing to the right and the fish is pointing the right you'll hit him in the back if the spear is pointing to the right and the fish is pointing to the left it'll hit him in the head if the spear is pointing to the left and the fish is pointing to the right they'll hit him in the head and if the spear is pointing to the left and the fish is pointing to the left it'll hit him in the back so there we go and we still have some code to do like we still have some spears to do so when i receive got fish then go hide so i'm just gonna take out this variable right here um i think yes in the fish so take out the costume name variable and then move the fish right here let's actually put the hp on this side and the fish on this side so here we go i'm going to show you so as you can see there's one fish right now so we want it to be more and then as you can see i got him in the back that's basically how it works so we're not done yet so we want more fish because there's two little fish so we can just duplicate fish and duplicate another fish so i'm gonna go to a fish too but instead you gotta make a new message called got fish two and change that to catfish two and change this to codfish too and you also go to go fish three and say you guys you got fish three so got fish three and got fish three so i'm going to show you how it works it's not completely done yet let me go to the spear and you just have to duplicate it and then instead change it to got fish two and duplicate this again and change this to catfish three let me show you how it works so as you can see there's three fish instead and i'm gonna try to catch one right here so i caught one it's a head shot i mean this is a head shot you can see there's three fish and there's more i got two points that's good that's basically it and we also have to add the puffer fish so it's easy to find puffer fish and we're going to work on it it's not that easy the puffer fish but let's make it so let's define let's make it move fish fish and define new fish we'll go to a random position switch costume to puffer fish a it'll show and i'll go forever move it'll always move five steps and if then it's touching if then touching edge then if it's on the edge you'll bounce so there's no way you can kill the puffer fish unless if it hits you so and then you can just duplicate this if you want more challenge you can just duplicate the popular fish and change it a little bit yeah so diver too and i'll broadcast hit diver instead hit diver so i'm just going to take this out because that can be more complicated complicated so we can just put this right here put it right here put it like this and then it'll define and animate fish so you gotta make a new thing animate fish and make fish and then it'll go forever the next costume and i'll wait one second so you have to do this just because you don't want to block the fish from moving this limit and then so when the green flag is clicked it will hide and go to the front layer i'll set rotation style left right so it won't flip over um i'll wait three seconds and oh define move fish i'll call new fish and then when the green flag is clicked call animate fish and then when i hit diver when you hit the diver so i gotta get a sound so i have to get the sound bonk and when i receive fire this beer no i mean hit diver um it'll start some bomb go hide wait three seconds so that that's when it hits the diver i'll go to a random position again and show there's almost all the code it's almost all the code but i you can it's optional if you want to make it color effect but let's go to the diver and you gotta add if then this is um you need this if then or if it if the health is hp is greater hp is less than zero you can hit right copper fish twice that that might be needed or equal to zero then hp equals zero then it'll broadcast game over so when i receive hit diver i'll change hp by 10 and i'll repeat 10 times i change color effect by 25. and then you want to stop the graphic effects in the end so it changed back to a normal color and there we almost have all the code we also have to get the game over so we can make and paint a sprite and you gotta go text and make it red because whenever you lose you always have to do red and then let's use marker so i'm gonna write this right game oh and let's make this bigger and center it that's around the thing and then when i when the green flag is clicked it'll go to the front layer um go to x zero zero so that's just the middle y0 i'll hide and when i receive game over oh show and it'll stop everything so that's all the code came over so i'm just gonna demonstrate and fish and you can't kill the buffer fish as you can see oh so it says game over so there that's basically it thank you for watching please like share subscribe
