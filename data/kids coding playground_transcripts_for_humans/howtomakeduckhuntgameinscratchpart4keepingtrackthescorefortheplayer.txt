00:00 - [Music]
00:10 - hey guys welcome back to the channel so
00:12 - today we are making part four of this
00:15 - duck hunt game we might be able to
00:16 - finish it today
00:18 - uh for this part so
00:20 - let's get on to it so last time we got
00:23 - the duck flying and we will shoot the
00:25 - duck
00:26 - and if you miss the duck flies away let
00:28 - me just demo it once here
00:30 - let me take this
00:32 - list off we'll need it in a bit
00:34 - so let's see let me put my volume down a
00:37 - little bit not too loud
00:40 - okay let's start
00:41 - so you can see
00:42 - the duck is flying
00:44 - so you if you shoot the duck the dogs
00:46 - comes out
00:48 - and uh if you if you miss
00:50 - the dog
00:52 - and then it flies away and then the dog
00:54 - laugh at you that's what we had last
00:56 - time so without further ado let's jump
00:58 - right in so we'll fix some issues so i
01:01 - forgot to make the duck uh
01:03 - like i'm making the duck sound so let's
01:05 - work on that for right now so where we
01:08 - had this
01:09 - so here we broadcast next stock so
01:11 - basically every time we the ducks fly
01:13 - calls this and broadcast next stock so
01:15 - we can use that method
01:17 - use that broadcast method so let's do
01:19 - that real quick
01:21 - so you say when i receive
01:24 - next stock okay
01:26 - uh what i'm going to do is go do a
01:28 - little bit of weight
01:30 - 0.5
01:33 - and then i will get this forever loop
01:38 - and then i will get the operator and the
01:40 - if condition
01:42 - here
01:45 - let me zoom in a little bit sorry about
01:47 - that
01:49 - okay so let's get the operator
01:53 - same thing that we were using the tux
01:55 - shot right the variable to see if the
01:57 - top gets shot or not
01:59 - so zeroes mean no the duck is still
02:01 - alive
02:02 - then what we do is we're gonna play the
02:04 - sound
02:06 - i will pick this one duck sound okay
02:10 - after that we'll wait two seconds so we
02:12 - don't want to be too noisy on the duck
02:15 - okay so let's try it out real quick save
02:18 - this
02:19 - let's run it
02:21 - so you can hear the duck sound
02:24 - see
02:26 - see the duck mix
02:29 - okay
02:30 - so
02:31 - when you start it you see the duck sound
02:34 - right okay cool so that's done
02:38 - okay so what we're going to do is we're
02:39 - going to
02:40 - work on the duck uh after you know you
02:43 - shut the duck the duck died and then we
02:45 - want to restart it right so what we're
02:47 - going to do is we're going to go back to
02:48 - the doc you can see that the doc has
02:50 - something say start broadcast start
02:52 - again okay so after you caught the duck
02:56 - or you know the duck laugh at you
02:57 - they've called it start again
02:59 - right
03:00 - so using this start again we can start
03:02 - the the duck flying again
03:06 - okay so let's move on to the duck
03:08 - so what we're going to do is we're going
03:09 - to grab this
03:11 - say start again
03:14 - we're going to check get the operator
03:17 - here
03:19 - okay if condition
03:22 - so if
03:24 - the uh operator we're gonna use a
03:26 - greater than
03:28 - and we're gonna use this variable called
03:30 - dot count so basically if we have more
03:32 - than one duck
03:34 - i mean all the ducks are not dead yet
03:36 - right the account is greater than zero
03:39 - and we are going to allow them to
03:41 - call this block say fly duck fly okay
03:45 - so same thing we'll duplicate here
03:48 - and here we are going to do
03:51 - a weight so basically we don't want to
03:53 - duck immediately come up after it got
03:55 - shot
03:56 - we're gonna wait a little bit you can do
03:58 - whatever you like but uh for now we're
04:00 - gonna use like one two three second
04:02 - weight
04:03 - and then what we're going to do is going
04:05 - to reset this variable for the duck duck
04:07 - shot okay
04:09 - not the count but the duck shot so we're
04:11 - gonna reset this variable
04:14 - um sorry i forgot is if an else
04:17 - statement sorry guys
04:19 - sometime
04:21 - do it too fast i made a mistake
04:24 - let's drag this in here throw this away
04:27 - okay all right so the infinite statement
04:29 - so what we will use it for next level
04:31 - later so we'll use this
04:33 - count make sure that we have enough
04:35 - ducts we still haven't finished all the
04:37 - ducts so we'll after that then we'll
04:40 - wait and then we are going to reset
04:43 - the duct shot to zero meaning the duct
04:45 - is not dead yet and then we're gonna
04:47 - animate ducts so we're gonna call this
04:49 - enemy duct
04:51 - okay so basically these two will call
04:53 - the same block these two blocks here
04:55 - okay
04:58 - all right and then
04:59 - if actually when we finish all the duct
05:02 - test no motors then we can broadcast a
05:05 - new message
05:07 - uh something like
05:09 - next level
05:11 - so that is after you get all the ducks
05:13 - so right now if the duck is dead
05:17 - um you know uh the new duck will come
05:19 - out after three seconds
05:21 - okay so let's try it out real quick
05:24 - so you can see
05:26 - so after we shot the duck
05:28 - after you wait for
05:30 - three second one to three seconds we'll
05:32 - see a new taxi
05:36 - but we haven't fixed these yet so we
05:38 - will fix that but uh you can see right
05:40 - there's new duck coming out after
05:43 - the duck you know even if we let's say
05:45 - we miss the shot and it flies away i
05:48 - want to fix the shot here the shot is
05:50 - still not working so whether we set the
05:52 - shot right after the
05:54 - start again
05:55 - so let's do that
05:58 - okay so first let's go to the target
06:01 - so target what we're going to do is
06:06 - let me zoom in a little bit
06:08 - so i'm going to say start again
06:11 - so start again what we're going to do is
06:13 - we are going to call
06:17 - um
06:18 - stop
06:19 - add a script in the sprite
06:22 - and we are going to kind of duplicate
06:24 - this part here
06:28 - and we're going to call this
06:30 - so what we're going to do is we're going
06:32 - to stop out of script here stop the
06:34 - control when when you start again so and
06:37 - then
06:38 - we reset the dot
06:40 - uh shot to zero and then pull it and
06:43 - then control i guess if i did it here
06:45 - then i don't actually need to do it here
06:48 - yeah so
06:50 - here we already reset it right so
06:52 - actually i don't really need to do it
06:55 - here actually
06:56 - okay so i think that was a copy so it
06:59 - doesn't matter if you have this or not
07:01 - it doesn't really matter so we have the
07:03 - duck getting reset here so the enemy
07:06 - ducts or the duct will fly
07:08 - so you can take this out and just have
07:10 - the uh enemy ducts here
07:13 - and then leave this over here on this
07:15 - side
07:18 - okay
07:19 - all right how about like that okay we'll
07:21 - keep it consistent
07:23 - okay all right and then
07:27 - in the shot here let's go back here so
07:29 - we might need to make some changes here
07:33 - in the shot
07:35 - but before we go to that one let's
07:37 - finish this target then we have one more
07:39 - broadcast right we have the broadcast
07:41 - for the
07:43 - next level right
07:45 - so we broadcast next level
07:48 - we also want to start the script so we
07:49 - don't want the people be shooting you
07:51 - know when we are changing the next level
07:53 - or something like that
07:55 - so let's do that stop out of scripting
07:59 - sprite so i think we're pretty much done
08:01 - with this target
08:03 - so let's go back to
08:05 - shot here
08:07 - so in the shot here
08:09 - when we uh just like this one right when
08:11 - we receive
08:14 - um
08:15 - start again
08:17 - what we want to do is we're gonna switch
08:18 - the first costume all right back to the
08:21 - shot
08:22 - so switch costume to
08:25 - which is has the full wallet okay so
08:28 - this one right here
08:29 - okay
08:33 - all right so let's just test it out real
08:35 - quick
08:36 - okay all right so the stop spline so we
08:40 - shot him so you see i used up one bullet
08:42 - so he can reset it you see
08:46 - all right so you see dirt ducks come out
08:49 - reset
08:54 - so if i reset all my only bullet you see
08:57 - ducks flies away
08:59 - the dog laughed at me and then you know
09:01 - the bullets come back and then you see
09:03 - the duck
09:06 - okay so that is working so what we need
09:08 - to do is we have to fill out these ducts
09:10 - here okay
09:12 - all right
09:15 - okay so what we're going to do is we're
09:16 - going to duplicate this one
09:19 - so
09:20 - the duck two is similar to duck one this
09:23 - second duck here we'll put it here we'll
09:25 - move this guy somewhere here like this
09:28 - uh what we're going to do i already have
09:29 - to coordinate them
09:31 - so uh it is
09:33 - negative 20
09:35 - and 150
09:37 - okay and this one is a little bit
09:39 - different we're not going to do it here
09:42 - uh for the flashings
09:44 - one because since the uh the ducks will
09:47 - be a little bit different so we only
09:48 - want to flash it when it's actually that
09:50 - ducks
09:51 - being uh fly okay so we have to check
09:54 - something else so we don't want to do
09:56 - that there so what we're going to do is
10:01 - um also we'll change this piece here so
10:04 - we're looking at the second duck so
10:05 - we're gonna be using item number two
10:07 - from the list
10:08 - so basically this list
10:10 - item number two okay so we're gonna use
10:13 - this one okay
10:14 - so if it is one then we'll knock it as
10:17 - red otherwise it'll be white right if it
10:20 - got shot
10:21 - and then we are going to
10:23 - have another message here
10:25 - say um
10:28 - when i
10:30 - receive our next stuck
10:34 - okay so you remember the ducks here it
10:37 - broadcasts this message here next up
10:39 - when the duck fly
10:40 - so for the second one we'll have to use
10:43 - that okay so what we're going to do is
10:45 - we're going to wait for 0.5 of a second
10:47 - so they let the other stuff get set
10:49 - first
10:50 - and then what we're going to do is
10:53 - we are going to use the if condition
10:55 - here
10:58 - so we're gonna surround it like this
11:01 - so if
11:03 - the item so let's take this
11:07 - i will say zero so basically when the
11:09 - item number two is actually zero meaning
11:12 - the duck is starting to fly then we're
11:14 - gonna mop this guy and make it
11:17 - flash okay
11:19 - so this is marking zero that's happening
11:21 - here
11:22 - you see this when the duck fly
11:25 - every time it takes that index and
11:26 - replaces zero so they know which duck is
11:29 - is is the one that is active okay
11:32 - so similarly let's make just make
11:34 - another copy of this so we'll just show
11:37 - you how it looks like okay let's
11:38 - duplicate this this is number three
11:41 - so for number three i put in a different
11:43 - position it will be a negative
11:46 - five okay
11:48 - and then here we'll change it to three
11:51 - and then we'll change this also to three
11:53 - okay
11:54 - so i think that is pretty much it let's
11:57 - just test it out real quick
11:59 - okay so let's start you see i have three
12:02 - ducks all of them are white you can see
12:04 - zero let's flash in the first one right
12:06 - these are negative so i mean they
12:08 - haven't used yet so let's say i take out
12:11 - this guy so you can see this becomes
12:13 - zero
12:14 - and this starts flashing you see that so
12:16 - now this is the duct that's flashing so
12:19 - let's say i miss this
12:21 - so i miss this
12:22 - okay it becomes negative one and then
12:24 - mark the guy zero so this guy flash so
12:27 - now i hit this button
12:30 - so it will become red see that red
12:32 - because this is one so now this is
12:34 - number four duck says you can see it
12:35 - keep moving up
12:37 - keep moving keep moving right
12:39 - so if i shot it say number four becomes
12:42 - it and now number five right very simple
12:44 - so we use a list to keep track of that
12:47 - so very easy to understand so next
12:51 - we're just going to duplicate this okay
12:53 - one
12:55 - two keep going three
12:57 - [Music]
12:58 - four
13:00 - five
13:02 - six i think one more ten right so one to
13:05 - 10 so 10 ducks okay
13:07 - so we did number three right so number
13:09 - four
13:10 - so number four i have a coordinate as
13:12 - well number four i have it as 10
13:15 - so that 10 we'll change this to number
13:18 - four let me put more together i guess
13:21 - you can see
13:23 - let me do this
13:25 - okay so change this to four
13:28 - change this also to four okay
13:32 - number five we'll change it to five
13:36 - five
13:37 - okay
13:38 - and the position for number five is
13:40 - let's see why i have it 25
13:43 - okay
13:45 - oops
13:46 - 25.
13:48 - okay let's call number six
13:52 - six
13:53 - six and then
13:56 - what did i have
13:58 - 40
13:59 - okay
14:00 - 40. okay so number seven
14:05 - seven
14:07 - seven
14:08 - okay
14:10 - and then
14:14 - 55
14:17 - okay
14:18 - number eight
14:20 - go eight and eight
14:23 - and then what is number eight
14:25 - seventy
14:27 - okay
14:30 - number nine
14:32 - nine
14:33 - and nine number nine so basically this
14:35 - is number nine
14:37 - and then we are going to use
14:40 - um
14:41 - 85
14:46 - number 10
14:48 - 10
14:49 - and 10 here
14:52 - and number 10 is
14:56 - 100
14:59 - okay so let's check it out so
15:03 - let's start you can see all the dots are
15:05 - lined up all these are negative ones
15:08 - if i shot one it becomes one so now it's
15:11 - zero then marking the zero one
15:16 - so you can see the third one marked at
15:18 - zero i missed
15:21 - so that flies away marks at negative one
15:23 - so now it's number four
15:28 - so as you can see right pretty easy to
15:30 - understand number five now is zero
15:33 - so you you get the point so
15:36 - let me just remove this
15:38 - for now
15:39 - you guys you guys understand now
15:41 - so let's remove
15:44 - so at the end you know just
15:49 - okay come on
15:52 - all right
15:55 - so at the very end after we finish
15:57 - everything what we want to do we can
15:59 - start a new level
16:01 - so i missed that
16:03 - not a good shooter i am not a very good
16:06 - shooter okay
16:12 - okay so i made a mistake here we need to
16:15 - fix it so we cannot put the weight here
16:17 - actually
16:18 - we put a weight here or actually messed
16:20 - up the last duck
16:23 - when it broadcasts the next level
16:25 - because what happened this duck fly here
16:28 - it has a count with the duck minus one
16:31 - so
16:32 - if if it starts again if it's subtracted
16:35 - the minus one would happen it will
16:37 - broadcast next level and that will stop
16:38 - the game so what we want to do we cannot
16:41 - use the weight here we're gonna have to
16:42 - move it somewhere else so what we're
16:44 - going to do is we're gonna look like
16:45 - this we're gonna move this
16:48 - so this one we actually going to move it
16:51 - to here
16:52 - you see here i put it actually here i
16:54 - added the code here so basically i added
16:57 - this weight here so before the duct
17:00 - shows up
17:01 - uh before
17:03 - earlier before it looks like this it
17:04 - doesn't have like this it looks like
17:06 - this exactly like this i added the
17:09 - weight here instead okay so don't put
17:11 - the weight on the uh start again they're
17:13 - actually going to mess it up so move
17:15 - that over over there and also at this
17:17 - point five of a second here so make sure
17:19 - that this block
17:21 - execute before this block because what
17:23 - happened is stuck fly
17:25 - it has the uh counter here so what
17:28 - happens if it does the counter
17:30 - it will try to if it runs really quick
17:34 - it might execute the next level which
17:36 - will stop the uh the target so in the
17:38 - last stock we couldn't shoot it so make
17:40 - sure you change that okay
17:42 - so it should look something like this so
17:45 - all right so make sure you have the 0.5
17:47 - a second weight make sure this guy runs
17:50 - first
17:51 - then go to this guy this guy will do the
17:53 - subtraction of the duck count okay
17:56 - all right
17:57 - else it will not work correctly okay
18:01 - okay so that we got that out of the way
18:04 - and the weight is over here in anime
18:07 - ducks
18:08 - so now let's try it out so
18:12 - so same thing here
18:14 - we just shoot and then we get to the end
18:17 - the last stop so what we want to do is
18:20 - at the last stop uh we want to broadcast
18:23 - start a new level
18:24 - so that way you know we can restart
18:26 - again okay
18:29 - so what i'm going to do is going to
18:31 - paint a little sprite here
18:33 - it's going to put the text in
18:37 - we can choose any color
18:39 - we can use a gold or yellow
18:43 - and let's just use handwriting
18:47 - saying good job
18:49 - [Music]
18:50 - well done
18:59 - okay
19:01 - all right so what we're going to do is
19:04 - uh put it in the middle
19:06 - so we're going to duplicate this
19:09 - and then we're going to change the color
19:11 - for this one
19:12 - and then we'll the next one say
19:15 - not that
19:16 - not bad
19:18 - maybe you can say
19:19 - try again
19:21 - something like
19:22 - that i think that's why i had
19:25 - not too bad okay not too bad
19:28 - okay something like that doesn't matter
19:31 - so we're gonna put this in red or
19:33 - something
19:35 - so
19:36 - okay
19:37 - okay so what we want to do is um
19:39 - if the player makes more than seven
19:42 - ducks they get up seven out of ten then
19:44 - you know we can display the uh good job
19:47 - otherwise we can display the not too bad
19:49 - try again okay
19:51 - so let's go back to the code
19:55 - okay so when green flag is clicked
19:58 - i'm going to hide this
20:01 - okay so
20:03 - you remember we broadcast the thing say
20:06 - next level right
20:09 - uh from here
20:12 - right we have the ducks
20:15 - we broadcast and then say next level
20:17 - right when there's no more ducks
20:19 - so in here we say it is next level
20:24 - um
20:24 - [Music]
20:26 - what we want to do is we're going to
20:27 - create a new
20:29 - variable
20:30 - called index
20:32 - so this is for the loop
20:34 - we'll use it for the sprite only
20:37 - now what we're going to do is kind of
20:38 - look through it and see
20:41 - how many uh ducts the player have shot
20:44 - okay
20:46 - and then we're going to check the number
20:48 - of duck hit okay
20:50 - okay and then we will have another one
20:52 - here
20:53 - another variable
20:55 - says
20:57 - number
21:04 - so it doesn't matter for this prior or
21:06 - sprite doesn't really matter i think we
21:08 - can just use for this one
21:12 - um
21:13 - so here
21:14 - what we can do is um we'll set this to
21:16 - zero
21:20 - so
21:21 - now we're gonna try to see how many
21:22 - ducks this player had
21:24 - done you know
21:26 - shoot down
21:28 - so we use the forever
21:31 - foreign repeat
21:35 - repeat until
21:38 - now let's use this one
21:40 - repeat the number of times i will use
21:42 - the length
21:45 - the link of the duck shot list so
21:47 - basically we'll repeat 10 times we have
21:49 - 10 ducks right
21:51 - so
21:53 - here's a if condition here
21:57 - if
21:59 - we use operator
22:03 - and we're going to get the
22:06 - item
22:10 - item might item
22:12 - and then we're going to use the index
22:17 - so what we're doing is uh we're going to
22:19 - loop through the list and we're going to
22:20 - check
22:22 - if it's one so basically when we shoot
22:24 - the ducts we got the duck down then we
22:26 - mark it as one right remember this
22:29 - here right
22:31 - we shot we marked as one if we missed
22:34 - negative zero negative one and then zero
22:36 - is the one that's uh running
22:38 - so it is one that means the duck is dead
22:42 - um
22:43 - what we do is we're gonna count it okay
22:48 - and change
22:50 - by one okay
22:52 - and then make sure you when you use loop
22:54 - you have to increase the index okay
22:58 - change the index by one okay
23:01 - so that will go on and pick up the next
23:03 - next thing on the list i will go down
23:05 - and pick up each one of them okay and
23:07 - then calculate how many ducks this
23:09 - player hit
23:15 - and then we'll use the
23:18 - fnls here
23:24 - and then we use operator
23:28 - and put number of ducks here greater
23:30 - than seven so we have more than seven
23:32 - ducks
23:34 - you know we'll switch to custom number
23:36 - one
23:39 - else we'll switch to custom number two
23:42 - so number two is the uh no not too bad
23:45 - you know but try again kind of thing
23:48 - and then we'll do a show
23:51 - and then what we can do is i'll do a
23:52 - little wait here
23:55 - maybe three seconds or something before
23:57 - the next next game
24:00 - i'm gonna broadcast
24:03 - a new message called restart
24:05 - [Music]
24:07 - okay
24:09 - so this is what we have so far
24:12 - so what we're going to do is we're going
24:13 - to
24:14 - put the restart here
24:18 - in the restart we can we're going to do
24:21 - a little bit of weight
24:23 - because we have to set up something else
24:26 - to
24:27 - do away for one second
24:31 - and then we're going to hide this
24:34 - and then we're going to reset the duck
24:36 - count okay
24:39 - so the duck will have 10 ducks again
24:44 - and then we'll broadcast a message
24:50 - say
24:51 - start game
24:54 - so start game will have a brand new game
24:58 - and then we'll run this code again and
25:00 - then we'll run the docs code you know
25:02 - for
25:03 - start game
25:06 - um
25:07 - then it's like right here
25:09 - now we have to start game right
25:12 - broadcast.gaming english the same thing
25:14 - as where the dog after the dog
25:16 - kind of like looking for the ducks here
25:18 - broadcast stock game so the reset also
25:20 - does the same okay
25:23 - okay so stock game will you know do the
25:25 - stuff
25:26 - up here let me swear this
25:30 - let me zoom out a little bit
25:34 - okay
25:35 - let's see right here i guess
25:40 - right here start game so we'll do these
25:42 - kill okay and then start cleaning up the
25:44 - list remove the list add everything to
25:47 - negative one and then start the you know
25:49 - the game
25:51 - okay
25:52 - okay so what we need is um we have to go
25:56 - back to our little ducks here
25:58 - we're gonna have to reset all the ducks
26:00 - to white
26:01 - so we have the message of reset right
26:05 - so when we say
26:06 - restart
26:11 - um what i want to do is uh
26:15 - switch the costume
26:18 - to the white dots okay
26:21 - so we're gonna use we're gonna need this
26:23 - to all for all of them so just drag and
26:26 - kind of put them here
26:29 - three
26:31 - four
26:32 - and so on okay
26:37 - seven
26:39 - eight
26:43 - and ten okay
26:45 - so we have all of them
26:48 - so you can kind of move them here you
26:49 - like
26:52 - okay
26:55 - so that's why we need a one second delay
26:58 - on the restart we want to reset all the
26:59 - white ducts
27:02 - okay
27:04 - let's do that
27:08 - okay almost done
27:12 - start
27:16 - and restart okay so i think we're pretty
27:20 - much done
27:21 - let's see if it works okay let's try it
27:24 - out
27:25 - so
27:25 - let's make it a huge screen we'll take
27:28 - out this thing
27:32 - here my throat is killing me
27:36 - having a sore throat talking too much
27:39 - okay so let me
27:41 - take out these variable
27:44 - index number ducts okay
27:46 - all right let's start again so you have
27:48 - the ducks
27:50 - so i'll go through real quick here
27:54 - so let me just pause this i guess
27:58 - okay with the last stop
28:03 - so
28:05 - not too bad try again you see that
28:07 - and then it restarts
28:10 - and then you have the little dots again
28:13 - so
28:14 - i guess i can put this in the center
28:16 - right
28:17 - we can do like um
28:19 - center
28:21 - make it look go to center zero zero
28:28 - okay all right so let's try to win this
28:32 - time
28:34 - okay let me try to win this time okay
28:36 - let me pause this
28:38 - okay so we're at the last duck here
28:42 - so let's do this
28:44 - yes
28:46 - so i have more than you know seven ducks
28:48 - you see it says good job well done
28:50 - and then it starts over again okay i
28:53 - hope you guys like this tutorial so
28:55 - that's pretty much it that's the dirt
28:58 - we're done with the duck hunt and then
29:00 - you can do your own
29:02 - i guess the the thumbnail if you like
29:06 - okay so for the thumbnail i'm just going
29:08 - to just backpack this pretty easy
29:11 - just show you i'm gonna drag it over
29:13 - here
29:14 - so the thumbnail basically it's pretty
29:16 - easy this is the code for the thumbnail
29:19 - so uh in the beginning we just reset the
29:21 - timer
29:22 - and then if the timer is greater than
29:24 - 01.1 that means that when you stop then
29:26 - they'll show the thumbnail and then
29:28 - we'll hide the score we'll put this to
29:31 - the top and then we'll glide it down
29:34 - and then when this game is start we'll
29:36 - show the variable so
29:38 - when when you stop we should hide the
29:40 - score okay
29:41 - so that's pretty much it
29:45 - um
29:47 - i think that is everything
29:49 - okay yeah that's pretty much everything
29:51 - i believe
29:52 - okay so let's try this so yeah that
29:56 - looks good
29:57 - and then when we stop it
29:59 - the thumbnail comes down okay there we
30:02 - go
30:03 - so we're done with this tutorial it's
30:04 - kind of long
30:06 - so oh yeah so one more thing make sure
30:10 - you reconnect the dogs
30:12 - okay for the couple here remove this put
30:15 - this back
30:16 - trash this
30:17 - okay
30:18 - so now the uh when you play it you have
30:21 - the dog
30:22 - moving in the beginning
30:24 - and then they'll jump in the back and
30:26 - then i'll start the uh you know the game
30:29 - okay
30:31 - all right
30:33 - okay that's it
30:34 - all right guys thank you
30:36 - bye
30:38 - anyway
30:39 - i hope you guys enjoyed it and uh yeah
30:41 - give us a like and comment below okay
30:44 - and forward to your friend if they like
30:46 - to learn about scratch for our channel
30:49 - thank you very much and see you guys
30:50 - next time bye
30:56 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys welcome back to the channel so today we are making part four of this duck hunt game we might be able to finish it today uh for this part so let's get on to it so last time we got the duck flying and we will shoot the duck and if you miss the duck flies away let me just demo it once here let me take this list off we'll need it in a bit so let's see let me put my volume down a little bit not too loud okay let's start so you can see the duck is flying so you if you shoot the duck the dogs comes out and uh if you if you miss the dog and then it flies away and then the dog laugh at you that's what we had last time so without further ado let's jump right in so we'll fix some issues so i forgot to make the duck uh like i'm making the duck sound so let's work on that for right now so where we had this so here we broadcast next stock so basically every time we the ducks fly calls this and broadcast next stock so we can use that method use that broadcast method so let's do that real quick so you say when i receive next stock okay uh what i'm going to do is go do a little bit of weight 0.5 and then i will get this forever loop and then i will get the operator and the if condition here let me zoom in a little bit sorry about that okay so let's get the operator same thing that we were using the tux shot right the variable to see if the top gets shot or not so zeroes mean no the duck is still alive then what we do is we're gonna play the sound i will pick this one duck sound okay after that we'll wait two seconds so we don't want to be too noisy on the duck okay so let's try it out real quick save this let's run it so you can hear the duck sound see see the duck mix okay so when you start it you see the duck sound right okay cool so that's done okay so what we're going to do is we're going to work on the duck uh after you know you shut the duck the duck died and then we want to restart it right so what we're going to do is we're going to go back to the doc you can see that the doc has something say start broadcast start again okay so after you caught the duck or you know the duck laugh at you they've called it start again right so using this start again we can start the the duck flying again okay so let's move on to the duck so what we're going to do is we're going to grab this say start again we're going to check get the operator here okay if condition so if the uh operator we're gonna use a greater than and we're gonna use this variable called dot count so basically if we have more than one duck i mean all the ducks are not dead yet right the account is greater than zero and we are going to allow them to call this block say fly duck fly okay so same thing we'll duplicate here and here we are going to do a weight so basically we don't want to duck immediately come up after it got shot we're gonna wait a little bit you can do whatever you like but uh for now we're gonna use like one two three second weight and then what we're going to do is going to reset this variable for the duck duck shot okay not the count but the duck shot so we're gonna reset this variable um sorry i forgot is if an else statement sorry guys sometime do it too fast i made a mistake let's drag this in here throw this away okay all right so the infinite statement so what we will use it for next level later so we'll use this count make sure that we have enough ducts we still haven't finished all the ducts so we'll after that then we'll wait and then we are going to reset the duct shot to zero meaning the duct is not dead yet and then we're gonna animate ducts so we're gonna call this enemy duct okay so basically these two will call the same block these two blocks here okay all right and then if actually when we finish all the duct test no motors then we can broadcast a new message uh something like next level so that is after you get all the ducks so right now if the duck is dead um you know uh the new duck will come out after three seconds okay so let's try it out real quick so you can see so after we shot the duck after you wait for three second one to three seconds we'll see a new taxi but we haven't fixed these yet so we will fix that but uh you can see right there's new duck coming out after the duck you know even if we let's say we miss the shot and it flies away i want to fix the shot here the shot is still not working so whether we set the shot right after the start again so let's do that okay so first let's go to the target so target what we're going to do is let me zoom in a little bit so i'm going to say start again so start again what we're going to do is we are going to call um stop add a script in the sprite and we are going to kind of duplicate this part here and we're going to call this so what we're going to do is we're going to stop out of script here stop the control when when you start again so and then we reset the dot uh shot to zero and then pull it and then control i guess if i did it here then i don't actually need to do it here yeah so here we already reset it right so actually i don't really need to do it here actually okay so i think that was a copy so it doesn't matter if you have this or not it doesn't really matter so we have the duck getting reset here so the enemy ducts or the duct will fly so you can take this out and just have the uh enemy ducts here and then leave this over here on this side okay all right how about like that okay we'll keep it consistent okay all right and then in the shot here let's go back here so we might need to make some changes here in the shot but before we go to that one let's finish this target then we have one more broadcast right we have the broadcast for the next level right so we broadcast next level we also want to start the script so we don't want the people be shooting you know when we are changing the next level or something like that so let's do that stop out of scripting sprite so i think we're pretty much done with this target so let's go back to shot here so in the shot here when we uh just like this one right when we receive um start again what we want to do is we're gonna switch the first costume all right back to the shot so switch costume to which is has the full wallet okay so this one right here okay all right so let's just test it out real quick okay all right so the stop spline so we shot him so you see i used up one bullet so he can reset it you see all right so you see dirt ducks come out reset so if i reset all my only bullet you see ducks flies away the dog laughed at me and then you know the bullets come back and then you see the duck okay so that is working so what we need to do is we have to fill out these ducts here okay all right okay so what we're going to do is we're going to duplicate this one so the duck two is similar to duck one this second duck here we'll put it here we'll move this guy somewhere here like this uh what we're going to do i already have to coordinate them so uh it is negative 20 and 150 okay and this one is a little bit different we're not going to do it here uh for the flashings one because since the uh the ducks will be a little bit different so we only want to flash it when it's actually that ducks being uh fly okay so we have to check something else so we don't want to do that there so what we're going to do is um also we'll change this piece here so we're looking at the second duck so we're gonna be using item number two from the list so basically this list item number two okay so we're gonna use this one okay so if it is one then we'll knock it as red otherwise it'll be white right if it got shot and then we are going to have another message here say um when i receive our next stuck okay so you remember the ducks here it broadcasts this message here next up when the duck fly so for the second one we'll have to use that okay so what we're going to do is we're going to wait for 0.5 of a second so they let the other stuff get set first and then what we're going to do is we are going to use the if condition here so we're gonna surround it like this so if the item so let's take this i will say zero so basically when the item number two is actually zero meaning the duck is starting to fly then we're gonna mop this guy and make it flash okay so this is marking zero that's happening here you see this when the duck fly every time it takes that index and replaces zero so they know which duck is is is the one that is active okay so similarly let's make just make another copy of this so we'll just show you how it looks like okay let's duplicate this this is number three so for number three i put in a different position it will be a negative five okay and then here we'll change it to three and then we'll change this also to three okay so i think that is pretty much it let's just test it out real quick okay so let's start you see i have three ducks all of them are white you can see zero let's flash in the first one right these are negative so i mean they haven't used yet so let's say i take out this guy so you can see this becomes zero and this starts flashing you see that so now this is the duct that's flashing so let's say i miss this so i miss this okay it becomes negative one and then mark the guy zero so this guy flash so now i hit this button so it will become red see that red because this is one so now this is number four duck says you can see it keep moving up keep moving keep moving right so if i shot it say number four becomes it and now number five right very simple so we use a list to keep track of that so very easy to understand so next we're just going to duplicate this okay one two keep going three four five six i think one more ten right so one to 10 so 10 ducks okay so we did number three right so number four so number four i have a coordinate as well number four i have it as 10 so that 10 we'll change this to number four let me put more together i guess you can see let me do this okay so change this to four change this also to four okay number five we'll change it to five five okay and the position for number five is let's see why i have it 25 okay oops 25. okay let's call number six six six and then what did i have 40 okay 40. okay so number seven seven seven okay and then 55 okay number eight go eight and eight and then what is number eight seventy okay number nine nine and nine number nine so basically this is number nine and then we are going to use um 85 number 10 10 and 10 here and number 10 is 100 okay so let's check it out so let's start you can see all the dots are lined up all these are negative ones if i shot one it becomes one so now it's zero then marking the zero one so you can see the third one marked at zero i missed so that flies away marks at negative one so now it's number four so as you can see right pretty easy to understand number five now is zero so you you get the point so let me just remove this for now you guys you guys understand now so let's remove so at the end you know just okay come on all right so at the very end after we finish everything what we want to do we can start a new level so i missed that not a good shooter i am not a very good shooter okay okay so i made a mistake here we need to fix it so we cannot put the weight here actually we put a weight here or actually messed up the last duck when it broadcasts the next level because what happened this duck fly here it has a count with the duck minus one so if if it starts again if it's subtracted the minus one would happen it will broadcast next level and that will stop the game so what we want to do we cannot use the weight here we're gonna have to move it somewhere else so what we're going to do is we're gonna look like this we're gonna move this so this one we actually going to move it to here you see here i put it actually here i added the code here so basically i added this weight here so before the duct shows up uh before earlier before it looks like this it doesn't have like this it looks like this exactly like this i added the weight here instead okay so don't put the weight on the uh start again they're actually going to mess it up so move that over over there and also at this point five of a second here so make sure that this block execute before this block because what happened is stuck fly it has the uh counter here so what happens if it does the counter it will try to if it runs really quick it might execute the next level which will stop the uh the target so in the last stock we couldn't shoot it so make sure you change that okay so it should look something like this so all right so make sure you have the 0.5 a second weight make sure this guy runs first then go to this guy this guy will do the subtraction of the duck count okay all right else it will not work correctly okay okay so that we got that out of the way and the weight is over here in anime ducks so now let's try it out so so same thing here we just shoot and then we get to the end the last stop so what we want to do is at the last stop uh we want to broadcast start a new level so that way you know we can restart again okay so what i'm going to do is going to paint a little sprite here it's going to put the text in we can choose any color we can use a gold or yellow and let's just use handwriting saying good job well done okay all right so what we're going to do is uh put it in the middle so we're going to duplicate this and then we're going to change the color for this one and then we'll the next one say not that not bad maybe you can say try again something like that i think that's why i had not too bad okay not too bad okay something like that doesn't matter so we're gonna put this in red or something so okay okay so what we want to do is um if the player makes more than seven ducks they get up seven out of ten then you know we can display the uh good job otherwise we can display the not too bad try again okay so let's go back to the code okay so when green flag is clicked i'm going to hide this okay so you remember we broadcast the thing say next level right uh from here right we have the ducks we broadcast and then say next level right when there's no more ducks so in here we say it is next level um what we want to do is we're going to create a new variable called index so this is for the loop we'll use it for the sprite only now what we're going to do is kind of look through it and see how many uh ducts the player have shot okay and then we're going to check the number of duck hit okay okay and then we will have another one here another variable says number so it doesn't matter for this prior or sprite doesn't really matter i think we can just use for this one um so here what we can do is um we'll set this to zero so now we're gonna try to see how many ducks this player had done you know shoot down so we use the forever foreign repeat repeat until now let's use this one repeat the number of times i will use the length the link of the duck shot list so basically we'll repeat 10 times we have 10 ducks right so here's a if condition here if we use operator and we're going to get the item item might item and then we're going to use the index so what we're doing is uh we're going to loop through the list and we're going to check if it's one so basically when we shoot the ducts we got the duck down then we mark it as one right remember this here right we shot we marked as one if we missed negative zero negative one and then zero is the one that's uh running so it is one that means the duck is dead um what we do is we're gonna count it okay and change by one okay and then make sure you when you use loop you have to increase the index okay change the index by one okay so that will go on and pick up the next next thing on the list i will go down and pick up each one of them okay and then calculate how many ducks this player hit and then we'll use the fnls here and then we use operator and put number of ducks here greater than seven so we have more than seven ducks you know we'll switch to custom number one else we'll switch to custom number two so number two is the uh no not too bad you know but try again kind of thing and then we'll do a show and then what we can do is i'll do a little wait here maybe three seconds or something before the next next game i'm gonna broadcast a new message called restart okay so this is what we have so far so what we're going to do is we're going to put the restart here in the restart we can we're going to do a little bit of weight because we have to set up something else to do away for one second and then we're going to hide this and then we're going to reset the duck count okay so the duck will have 10 ducks again and then we'll broadcast a message say start game so start game will have a brand new game and then we'll run this code again and then we'll run the docs code you know for start game um then it's like right here now we have to start game right broadcast.gaming english the same thing as where the dog after the dog kind of like looking for the ducks here broadcast stock game so the reset also does the same okay okay so stock game will you know do the stuff up here let me swear this let me zoom out a little bit okay let's see right here i guess right here start game so we'll do these kill okay and then start cleaning up the list remove the list add everything to negative one and then start the you know the game okay okay so what we need is um we have to go back to our little ducks here we're gonna have to reset all the ducks to white so we have the message of reset right so when we say restart um what i want to do is uh switch the costume to the white dots okay so we're gonna use we're gonna need this to all for all of them so just drag and kind of put them here three four and so on okay seven eight and ten okay so we have all of them so you can kind of move them here you like okay so that's why we need a one second delay on the restart we want to reset all the white ducts okay let's do that okay almost done start and restart okay so i think we're pretty much done let's see if it works okay let's try it out so let's make it a huge screen we'll take out this thing here my throat is killing me having a sore throat talking too much okay so let me take out these variable index number ducts okay all right let's start again so you have the ducks so i'll go through real quick here so let me just pause this i guess okay with the last stop so not too bad try again you see that and then it restarts and then you have the little dots again so i guess i can put this in the center right we can do like um center make it look go to center zero zero okay all right so let's try to win this time okay let me try to win this time okay let me pause this okay so we're at the last duck here so let's do this yes so i have more than you know seven ducks you see it says good job well done and then it starts over again okay i hope you guys like this tutorial so that's pretty much it that's the dirt we're done with the duck hunt and then you can do your own i guess the the thumbnail if you like okay so for the thumbnail i'm just going to just backpack this pretty easy just show you i'm gonna drag it over here so the thumbnail basically it's pretty easy this is the code for the thumbnail so uh in the beginning we just reset the timer and then if the timer is greater than 01.1 that means that when you stop then they'll show the thumbnail and then we'll hide the score we'll put this to the top and then we'll glide it down and then when this game is start we'll show the variable so when when you stop we should hide the score okay so that's pretty much it um i think that is everything okay yeah that's pretty much everything i believe okay so let's try this so yeah that looks good and then when we stop it the thumbnail comes down okay there we go so we're done with this tutorial it's kind of long so oh yeah so one more thing make sure you reconnect the dogs okay for the couple here remove this put this back trash this okay so now the uh when you play it you have the dog moving in the beginning and then they'll jump in the back and then i'll start the uh you know the game okay all right okay that's it all right guys thank you bye anyway i hope you guys enjoyed
