00:07 - welcome back guys this play here today
00:09 - back another video in scratch and today
00:11 - we'll be making a Lunar New Year themed
00:14 - game for of a scratch and if you do not
00:18 - know today is Lunar New Year um it might
00:21 - be Sunday for you guys or another day
00:24 - but for me today is Lunar New Year and
00:28 - basically if you do not know what Lunar
00:29 - New Year year is it's basically a
00:31 - holiday where a family and friends
00:34 - gather up and they just give them uh
00:37 - exchange money in red envelopes so they
00:41 - have this red envelope and they have
00:44 - money inside and they give it to kids
00:46 - and other people to uh for good luck and
00:50 - it's just basically a holiday for us for
00:53 - a new year so this year is the year of
00:55 - the dragon so there's many different
00:56 - years um and it's all different like
00:59 - animal or Spirit but this year is a
01:02 - dragon so we'll be making a dragon
01:04 - themed Lunar New Year game today so I'm
01:07 - I'm going to show you how it works so
01:09 - first some Chinese music I mean lunar NE
01:12 - music is going to play and then the
01:15 - dragon is going to follow the ball
01:17 - basically and you have to gather all the
01:19 - money so it's a pretty simple game and
01:22 - it's just like you know you're Gathering
01:25 - money like uh in real life they'll have
01:28 - these red envelopes and stuff for luck
01:31 - and yeah you see the
01:34 - dragon okay so we're GNA make that game
01:38 - today all right so I have I already put
01:41 - all my Sprites in here but it's really
01:44 - simple the backdrop you can just get
01:45 - from online just download a backdrop and
01:48 - then the
01:49 - ball as you can see we can get a ball
01:51 - from
01:53 - here it's pretty simple and you can just
01:56 - delete all these and change the color so
02:00 - you
02:01 - can as you can see it's over here and
02:04 - it's just a two color variation so
02:07 - something like that or you can make this
02:08 - one you know
02:11 - orange or yeah so that's how we made the
02:14 - ball pretty
02:15 - simple and this is our just original
02:17 - ball the dragon we actually got from
02:19 - online and you can use remove BG as I
02:23 - see over here you can upload an image
02:25 - over here and or drop a file and you can
02:28 - remove the backdrop of you know um a
02:31 - Sprite that you can download from online
02:34 - and the Red Envelope uh we have many
02:37 - variations as you can
02:41 - see okay and these um images we got from
02:44 - Amazon and we just got the picture and
02:46 - use remove PG to remove the backdrop and
02:49 - if you need any help with the backdrop
02:51 - you can just comment down below for uh
02:54 - us to help you on how to remove
02:55 - backdrops and we can make a tutorial if
02:57 - you guys do ask for it so so let's start
03:01 - with the
03:02 - ball so when the green flag is
03:05 - clicked
03:06 - forever it will go to Mouse
03:11 - pointer so just follow the mouse as you
03:14 - drag it along there and we're using
03:16 - clones today so we're going to create a
03:18 - clone of
03:19 - myself to add the visual effect of the
03:22 - ball and then now when I start as a
03:27 - clone it will set size to 100
03:31 - % repeat 10
03:34 - times change
03:37 - size by
03:42 - minus5 and delete this clone so
03:44 - basically it'll make a whole trail of
03:46 - clones that are descending in size so
03:49 - I'm going to show you right here uh it
03:51 - gives that cool visual effect see look
03:54 - um the Clones are descending in size and
03:56 - are behind one another so that's the the
04:01 - ball now let's work on the
04:04 - dragon so the dragon's fairly simple as
04:06 - well so when the green flag is
04:09 - clicked
04:12 - forever also Point towards Mouse
04:15 - pointer it'll move five
04:18 - steps so now we have the ball and the
04:22 - dragon and it looks like the dragons
04:23 - following the ball and yeah as you can
04:26 - see over there now we're going to code
04:28 - the Red Envelope which is the hardest
04:30 - part of the tutorial so stick with me so
04:33 - when the green flag is
04:36 - clicked it will we have to make a new
04:39 - variable which going to name
04:41 - money it'll set money to
04:44 - zero and it will go to random
04:49 - position after that it'll set y to 180
04:53 - so it's going to be up
04:56 - here and
04:58 - forever
05:00 - you need to change y by minus5 so it'll
05:04 - just descend towards the
05:10 - ground you need a if then statement so
05:14 - if
05:15 - then you need a less than
05:18 - sign if then y
05:23 - position it's less than - 170 which is
05:27 - down here so if it's less than
05:31 - 170 then it'll go to random
05:34 - position and it'll set y to 80 180 so it
05:37 - just be back back at the top at a random
05:40 - position and it'll just continue falling
05:43 - down so we need to if then if then
05:48 - touching
05:50 - Dragon then it'll start S
05:54 - pop and then it will
05:57 - change money
06:00 - buy and we did use pick random 1 to 10
06:03 - we can obviously alter that to more or
06:05 - less
06:06 - money and then after that we're going to
06:09 - have next
06:11 - costume it'll go to random
06:15 - position so as you can see when it falls
06:17 - down if it touches the dragon it'll
06:19 - switch the costume it'll go to a random
06:22 - position and as you can see we have all
06:24 - these costumes so we have six different
06:26 - variations in the envelope and it'll set
06:29 - y back to 180
06:31 - so let's do that and I do have a song um
06:35 - you can just take some songs from online
06:38 - does it really matter so when the green
06:41 - flag is clicked so I got this um sound
06:43 - from online and it's on copyright so you
06:46 - can get this uh song you can just find a
06:49 - song online download it and uh when you
06:52 - click the sounds you can do choose a
06:54 - sound and then click upload sound and
06:57 - then you'll have uh your downloaded s in
06:59 - there so when the green flag is clicked
07:03 - so you can hear me I put set volume to
07:05 - 50% but that's optional forever and
07:09 - it'll Play the
07:10 - song so there we have our Chinese New
07:13 - Year I mean Lunar New Year
07:16 - game other countries just to celebrate
07:18 - um the new year uh the Lunar New Year so
07:22 - uh yeah that's why it's Lunar New Year
07:26 - so when the green FL is clicked as you
07:27 - can see I have the Lunar New Year music
07:29 - play playing and the dragon which is the
07:31 - year of the dragon and the ball as you
07:34 - can see as well as the money falling
07:37 - down and I'm going to try to get all the
07:39 - money and that's the objective of the
07:41 - game so it's a pretty easy simple game
07:45 - that you can make and yeah just
07:49 - collecting money for the Lunar New
07:54 - Year's so so we in the description below

need any help with the backdrop you can just comment down below for uh us to help you on how to remove backdrops and we can make a tutorial if you guys do ask for it so so let's start with the ball so when the green flag is clicked forever it will go to Mouse pointer so just follow the mouse as you drag it along there and we're using clones today so we're going to create a clone of myself to add the visual effect of the ball and then now when I start as a clone it will set size to 100 % repeat 10 times change size by minus5 and delete this clone so basically it'll make a whole trail of clones that are descending in size so I'm going to show you right here uh it gives that cool visual effect see look um the Clones are descending in size and are behind one another so that's the the ball now let's work on the dragon so the dragon's fairly simple as well so when the green flag is clicked forever also Point towards Mouse pointer it'll move five steps so now we have the ball and the dragon and it looks like the dragons following the ball and yeah as you can see over there now we're going to code the Red Envelope which is the hardest part of the tutorial so stick with me so when the green flag is clicked it will we have to make a new variable which going to name money it'll set money to zero and it will go to random position after that it'll set y to 180 so it's going to be up here and forever you need to change y by minus5 so it'll just descend towards the ground you need a if then statement so if then you need a less than sign if then y position it's less than 170 which is down here so if it's less than 170 then it'll go to random position and it'll set y to 80 180 so it just be back back at the top at a random position and it'll just continue falling down so we need to if then if then touching Dragon then it'll start S pop and then it will change money buy and we did use pick random 1 to 10 we can obviously alter that to more or less money and then after that we're going to have next costume it'll go to random position so as you can see when it falls down if it touches the dragon it'll switch the costume it'll go to a random position and as you can see we have all these costumes so we have six different variations in the envelope and it'll set y back to 180 so let's do that and I do have a song um you can just take some songs from online does it really
