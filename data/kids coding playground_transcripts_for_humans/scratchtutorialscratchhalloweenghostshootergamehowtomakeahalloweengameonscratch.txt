00:44 - and subscribe
00:45 - we get plenty of um
00:48 - questions on how if if you have like
00:50 - what uh oh do you have a halloween game
00:52 - do you have a money simulator game do
00:54 - you have blah blah blah do you blah blah
00:56 - blah blah blah so you can search this up
00:59 - search what halloween
01:03 - enter
01:04 - uh so you'll see all our halloween games
01:06 - from last year we have the memory card
01:08 - game and the feed the ghost part two we
01:12 - have the halloween game so we have a
01:14 - bunch of things for you to do so people
01:16 - are asking us a bunch of those questions
01:18 - so
01:18 - do that uh before you comment
01:22 - so this is the project i'll be making
01:24 - today called ghost shooter
01:26 - so ghost shooter is a
01:28 - fun game that we made like a few
01:31 - minutes ago
01:32 - so you just
01:34 - start this thing and as you see there's
01:36 - uh some music playing in the background
01:39 - or inside a hut
01:40 - and um
01:42 - you click to shoot and you can shoot the
01:44 - ghost down
01:45 - by shooting them you get score and look
01:47 - at the top left
01:49 - and as you can see whenever a ghost hits
01:51 - me my health decreases
01:54 - and then when it gets a certain amount
01:56 - of health it will um actually uh start
01:59 - flashing so
02:01 - uh and once you get
02:03 - you die more
02:05 - and
02:06 - yeah just to look a bottom right please
02:08 - look at the bottom right we have 10
02:10 - health
02:11 - whenever you get hit by a ghost hit me
02:13 - ghost yep if you lose one you lose two i
02:15 - lost three
02:17 - and yeah this is basically the concept
02:19 - of getting hit
02:22 - so
02:22 - i'm gonna start a new project
02:25 - okay so the first thing we're gonna do
02:26 - you already know delete the scratch can
02:29 - and um
02:31 - um
02:32 - now we have to get our pumpkin our ghost
02:34 - our laser the hp bar and the game over
02:37 - but luckily most of the things are in
02:38 - the backpack for me to use but first we
02:40 - have to get the ghost
02:44 - and then we have to get the laser which
02:46 - is just the button so a bunch of people
02:49 - are asking me
02:51 - from different projects they're like
02:53 - where's the laser uh where's the laser
02:56 - it's just a button but then we just
02:57 - renamed it so
02:59 - if you actually
03:00 - look this part just rename it laser so
03:03 - um
03:04 - and then yeah that's all we need and
03:06 - then we're gonna make the game over and
03:07 - stuff later but we're gonna get the
03:08 - pumpkin we actually drew this from our
03:10 - last year's halloween game
03:12 - so
03:13 - put this in
03:15 - yeah from our smash the pumpkins game
03:17 - from halloween and
03:19 - we have to take the health bar which is
03:22 - actually really easy to make so if you
03:24 - don't know how to make it's just a bunch
03:26 - of squares and then you connect them
03:28 - together and duplicate them
03:30 - we're going to show you how to draw this
03:32 - um
03:33 - health part partially real quick so
03:36 - let's do this so uh we have this look we
03:38 - have the green we have the yellow we
03:41 - have orange so you get a fairly decent
03:44 - sized box and um let me get a box so you
03:48 - get green
03:50 - fairly decent
03:52 - and then you use the mouse ctrl c ctrl v
03:55 - and now you have your other box you
03:57 - connect them together
04:00 - and then you can do that again
04:04 - just say control v now you have four
04:06 - boxes
04:08 - and basically so on you get eight
04:10 - and then you ungroup them and get two
04:13 - and then you know it's real easy
04:17 - yeah we got two yep there we go so this
04:19 - is basically how you do it and then we
04:21 - wanted to be extra fancy by adding the
04:22 - little pumpkin on the
04:25 - uh
04:26 - side of the health bar
04:28 - so we just take this ctrl c ctrl v
04:34 - and it's really large but you know we'll
04:36 - just shrink it
04:39 - yeah so that's basically how you become
04:41 - fancy fancy and um
04:45 - and the coloring is you can like color
04:48 - it like any way you want but you know we
04:50 - advise green and then whenever you lose
04:52 - a life it turns gray so and one more
04:54 - thing yeah the death bar is all gray so
05:00 - i mean like you can make this orange if
05:02 - you wanted to but
05:03 - you know just how it is
05:09 - i'm going to show you the coloring
05:10 - method we have so the first three
05:12 - squares or green
05:14 - and then starting right here they become
05:18 - yellow
05:23 - yellow yellow
05:24 - and then we have the orange and then
05:26 - yeah so on and yeah
05:29 - so you just duplicate it like so
05:32 - oh
05:34 - you get the thing and then you change it
05:37 - it changes one gray square and then
05:39 - you're basically set and
05:42 - that's basically how we made the health
05:44 - bar
05:45 - so i'm gonna delete that real quick
05:50 - uh
05:53 - okay so uh-oh what's that a little all
05:56 - right so um
05:57 - and now let's get everything set up so
06:00 - we have the witch's hut so that's our
06:01 - backdrop you use any other backdrop like
06:04 - woods i would also advise woods but i
06:06 - use witch's house because we barely use
06:08 - witch house only these woods and then
06:10 - ghost i think this is 50 if i'm not
06:12 - mistaken
06:15 - i'm pretty sure this is the size
06:18 - 75 actually i'm pretty sure it's 75
06:21 - 75 and then um
06:24 - the laser is 20
06:28 - and then the pumpkin is regular sized
06:31 - and now we just have to color the laser
06:35 - we decided to make it green so um
06:40 - just a type of green
06:42 - so first you have to ungroup it
06:47 - and then you get this
06:50 - and then you like you can make it any
06:52 - color you want but just green is just
06:55 - good
06:56 - and yeah just like basically
07:00 - find some green shades that you like
07:03 - like brightness
07:05 - not the brightness yeah so that's
07:07 - basically what we did to make the lasers
07:09 - delete this one
07:10 - and now um
07:12 - let's get this started so the laser's
07:15 - finished everything's finished let's
07:16 - start with the pumpkin
07:18 - or the jack-o-lantern
07:20 - so
07:22 - we have to make
07:24 - a variable
07:26 - but we'll actually do that later first
07:28 - because we haven't got the debt but just
07:30 - put the green flag and we're gonna make
07:31 - a variable right after that
07:35 - so uh score
07:37 - like always we always do score and set
07:39 - score to zero always score to zero
07:44 - and we'll go to x
07:47 - well i'm gonna find a good position x
07:50 - zero
07:52 - i was doing this on the laser so sorry
07:54 - about that i'm gonna
07:58 - do it on the pumpkin pumpkin mushroom
08:00 - first
08:01 - uh so green flag that's pretty easy to
08:04 - not sure if you can see that but uh
08:06 - set score to zero
08:09 - and um
08:11 - now we're gonna get the position
08:14 - so go to x of the pumpkin i'm pretty
08:16 - sure in the pocket right now go to x0
08:20 - negative 136.
08:23 - so it will be like over here and then
08:26 - we'll go forever
08:30 - um it'll go to x
08:33 - go to mouse so we get the go to
08:35 - and then we go here mouse x because we
08:37 - don't want if we didn't mouse why you'll
08:39 - start floating in the air and we don't
08:41 - want that to happen because if you put
08:42 - your mouse here just go
08:44 - all over the place
08:47 - and then we have um if then
08:52 - if then the mouse is down then we will
08:56 - wait until it's not mouse down so you
08:58 - cannot spam the command
09:00 - so where's the wait uh here we go wait
09:03 - until
09:04 - not mouse down
09:10 - and we'll broadcast
09:13 - fire
09:14 - pew
09:15 - so yeah fire oops
09:19 - fire
09:21 - and when the green
09:23 - flag is oh we haven't done that so let's
09:26 - just go to the uh place where it gets
09:28 - fire
09:31 - so we're gonna do the laser and we'll
09:34 - come back to the pumpkin later so when
09:36 - the green flag is clicked
09:39 - we will point in direction zero which is
09:41 - pointing up so uh
09:44 - the laser won't go sideways around wonky
09:46 - or anything point direction zero and
09:48 - then we will go hide
09:52 - and then when i receive fire
09:56 - it will create a clone of myself
10:01 - and when i start as a clone oh my gosh
10:03 - where is it when i start as a clone uh
10:06 - it'll go to x
10:12 - so it'll go to x x position of pumpkin
10:15 - so this is the tricky block
10:19 - this one backdrop stage so
10:22 - uh
10:23 - um pumpkin
10:26 - let's actually rename this real quick oh
10:28 - we'll do that later but yeah anyways
10:31 - let's just
10:33 - that was kind of cringe seeing the one
10:36 - uh and um we have
10:39 - plot okay so this is what we've been
10:41 - doing for a while now so we have the
10:43 - plus sign here we have a 50
10:47 - and we have the
10:50 - y position of pumpkin the reason we need
10:53 - this is the plus 50 is because
10:57 - we don't actually want the bullet to
10:59 - come out of its nose because it's going
11:01 - to be like here and it's going to shoot
11:03 - up through the nose
11:04 - so we want it to start at the stem and
11:07 - all the way up so we have this done
11:10 - and then it will show
11:14 - repeat until
11:18 - you need a or
11:20 - repeat until touching edge
11:26 - or
11:28 - touching ghost so that's the ghost so
11:31 - it'll stop when it's touching a ghost
11:34 - or a uh edge so
11:36 - it'll move ten steps so keep on going
11:38 - until it touches that edge or ghost
11:41 - it'll delete this clone
11:44 - terminate the clone
11:47 - and yep let's
11:48 - i'll try this so let's see what if this
11:51 - works or not so pew pew pew yep
11:53 - definitely works let me shoot the ghost
11:55 - yep works so
11:57 - next we're gonna go back to the ghost i
12:00 - mean just go to the ghost
12:02 - and let's do this so the ghost
12:06 - uh
12:07 - so when the green flag is clicked
12:12 - it will
12:13 - oh wow this thing has decent amount of
12:16 - code so hang in there
12:18 - repeat five clones so there'll be five
12:20 - ghosts at a time it'll create
12:22 - clone of myself
12:25 - and i'll hide
12:29 - so
12:30 - when i start as a clone
12:34 - it will
12:36 - switch costume to ghost a
12:41 - which is this costume
12:42 - and then it'll show
12:45 - and then it'll go to
12:51 - x we'll go to the pick random
12:55 - negative 180 to positive 180
12:58 - for the y i mean the x so then it'll be
13:02 - like around
13:03 - here
13:04 - to here
13:07 - here
13:08 - is like
13:09 - so just pick a number like that like you
13:12 - know from here
13:13 - like here something like that yeah like
13:15 - 180 here and we have like over here yeah
13:18 - so just like do that and we're going to
13:19 - do the y real quick so if you want to
13:21 - use my coordinates that's fine as well
13:24 - so pick random for the y it's negative
13:27 - 20
13:28 - to 120
13:30 - so here we have like
13:33 - like negative 20 yeah up here we have
13:36 - like 120 yeah maybe up more but yeah
13:39 - that that that's the deal here so um
13:42 - now let's put the forever loop
13:46 - uh if then
13:49 - else
13:50 - always forget the else if then else the
13:54 - uh
13:56 - else the
13:58 - pick random is greater than five so
14:02 - we're gonna get the greater sign
14:05 - the pick random one to ten is greater
14:07 - than five so it's a fifty percent chance
14:10 - it will come down and swoop at you so
14:13 - if you want it lower you can make it
14:15 - lower but we just did 50
14:17 - chance it'll come down and try to sweep
14:18 - you out so it'll glide
14:23 - uh where's the glide there uh glide two
14:25 - seconds to random position we actually
14:27 - have to get the this slide and
14:31 - now
14:32 - we're going down here and we'll glide
14:35 - two seconds of oops say
14:37 - glide two seconds i'll pick random of
14:40 - this and pick random of this so
14:44 - there we have that
14:45 - and now we have to move on to the next
14:47 - part
14:51 - so
14:52 - when i start as a clone
14:54 - it will go forever
14:57 - um if then touching laser laser
15:01 - then it will die so if then touching
15:06 - laser then it'll switch costume to go
15:08 - see
15:09 - what's the switch
15:10 - costume so it will turn into ghosts
15:13 - screaming like ah so switch costume the
15:16 - costume c
15:18 - and yeah
15:21 - and now we're gonna wait 0.5 seconds
15:27 - and hide
15:31 - and then wait
15:33 - 0.2 seconds
15:36 - i mean not 0.2 and wait two seconds and
15:39 - now it'll switch costume to back to
15:41 - ghost a so it won't act like it's
15:43 - screaming anymore so switch costume back
15:45 - to ghost day and it will show
15:48 - and now we have one last code for the
15:49 - ghost and we are basically done with the
15:52 - ghost here so
15:54 - when i start as a clunk
15:58 - where's that
16:00 - uh then it will
16:02 - go forever and if it's touching the
16:05 - laser
16:07 - then touching
16:09 - laser
16:13 - then
16:16 - then it will broadcast delete laser
16:20 - because we don't want them to phase
16:22 - through them uh
16:23 - like
16:25 - like uh piercing
16:27 - so we want to make it go bam but if you
16:29 - do want to do phasing you don't really
16:31 - have to really have to do this so
16:33 - delete
16:34 - laser
16:37 - and then they'll change score by one
16:42 - yeah change
16:45 - score by one so you get one score so
16:48 - i'll give you a second to absorb this
16:51 - feel free to pause if you need it and
16:55 - yeah we're gonna go back
16:57 - we're gonna go to the
16:59 - uh
16:59 - hp bar
17:01 - so we're gonna show you if it works or
17:03 - not we
17:05 - we
17:06 - so basically it works right now so we're
17:08 - good to go
17:09 - so
17:12 - we have to make the hp bar
17:14 - [Music]
17:15 - so let's do the hp bar
17:19 - uh so actually the hp bar leads back to
17:22 - the pumpkin so
17:23 - let's do the hp bar so when the green
17:25 - flag is clicked
17:29 - it will switch costume to costume one
17:34 - which is our first beautiful costume
17:36 - with all your lives in it
17:39 - and
17:41 - the pumpkin
17:43 - so we have to do the got hit first sorry
17:45 - guys because we have to make the get it
17:47 - hit i think that's how you lose hp so
17:49 - when i res when the green bag is clicked
17:52 - it will go forever
17:54 - and then if it's touching the ghost
18:00 - then it will
18:02 - broadcast got hit which is a new
18:05 - broadcast message
18:10 - uh
18:15 - so i'm going to make a new message drag
18:17 - this
18:18 - so broadcast got hit
18:20 - and white you have to put that weight
18:24 - go ahead and wait
18:27 - add the weight and then wait 0.5 seconds
18:34 - and now
18:35 - let's go to the hp bar because after the
18:37 - pumpkin it leads back to the hp bar so
18:40 - we already got this set up so let's do
18:42 - the big script of code not really big
18:45 - but still when i receive got hit it will
18:48 - go next costume which is the
18:50 - lost one life costume so
18:53 - and then
18:54 - if then
18:57 - the costume number equals 11.
19:01 - so i have to get an equal sign if the
19:03 - costume number
19:06 - equals to 11.
19:10 - which is the last costume
19:12 - when we'll have to broadcast game over
19:14 - and wait
19:19 - game over
19:22 - see a costume number is 11 that's the
19:25 - last costume
19:26 - everything's gray
19:28 - that's the costume so and then um you
19:31 - need a if then statement now
19:34 - if then
19:36 - uh under if then uh the costume number
19:39 - is greater than six
19:45 - it'll start blinking
19:47 - so pew pew start that
19:49 - uh
19:51 - blinking spree and uh whenever it gets
19:54 - hit and then it will hide
19:56 - okay so this is how you do the blinking
19:59 - hide
20:01 - wait 0.2 seconds
20:04 - show
20:07 - and then we duplicate this
20:10 - duplicate this and then we have another
20:12 - weight 0.2 seconds
20:15 - and then hide and then wait 0.2 seconds
20:18 - and show so i'll give you a second to
20:20 - absorb this code feel free to pause and
20:27 - so now let's um
20:30 - go
20:34 - make the game over
20:38 - so i told you earlier that i'll come
20:39 - back to the laser and finish the script
20:41 - of code so
20:42 - when i receive
20:44 - senior when i receive
20:46 - delete laser then it'll delete this
20:49 - clone
20:50 - and now we're done with the laser
20:54 - and now we have to work on
20:57 - the game over sprite so we just have to
20:59 - paint a new sprite so we just need a
21:03 - dark
21:05 - red
21:06 - and then we have hand
21:08 - handwriting as always and we write game
21:11 - over
21:14 - make it pretty big and put it in the
21:15 - middle and
21:17 - now we have to
21:19 - go to the game over when the green flag
21:22 - is clicked
21:23 - and go to zero zero
21:28 - hide
21:32 - and then when i receive
21:37 - game over
21:39 - and it will show
21:41 - and
21:42 - stumble and now we're gonna go to the
21:44 - backdrop and finish off the music
21:47 - so when the green flag is clicked
21:51 - we're gonna use a sound you can use any
21:54 - sound you want but we use
21:56 - cave so
21:59 - then it will set volume well you don't
22:01 - really have to do this but
22:03 - optional
22:05 - set volume to 25
22:07 - and then go forever
22:11 - and then place down cave until done
22:15 - so we're done let's test this out
22:19 - get hit oh i just lost a life oh no i
22:21 - lost another two lives because he was
22:23 - gliding around i shot
22:26 - [Music]
22:35 - [Music]
22:42 - [Music]
22:48 - so this is pretty much the game and
22:53 - so no need to uh so just go to my

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's casey on playground here today we're back for another video in scratch uh so today we're i'm back for another video but first i have to mention that look at this box here watch time from subscribers not subscribe 93.9 subscribe 6.9 look how much people are not subscribed to the people that are actually subscribed so would you do me a favor click that like button subscribe button uh share button uh comment comment yeah just comment and yeah so do me a favor and subscribe we get plenty of um questions on how if if you have like what uh oh do you have a halloween game do you have a money simulator game do you have blah blah blah do you blah blah blah blah blah so you can search this up search what halloween enter uh so you'll see all our halloween games from last year we have the memory card game and the feed the ghost part two we have the halloween game so we have a bunch of things for you to do so people are asking us a bunch of those questions so do that uh before you comment so this is the project i'll be making today called ghost shooter so ghost shooter is a fun game that we made like a few minutes ago so you just start this thing and as you see there's uh some music playing in the background or inside a hut and um you click to shoot and you can shoot the ghost down by shooting them you get score and look at the top left and as you can see whenever a ghost hits me my health decreases and then when it gets a certain amount of health it will um actually uh start flashing so uh and once you get you die more and yeah just to look a bottom right please look at the bottom right we have 10 health whenever you get hit by a ghost hit me ghost yep if you lose one you lose two i lost three and yeah this is basically the concept of getting hit so i'm gonna start a new project okay so the first thing we're gonna do you already know delete the scratch can and um um now we have to get our pumpkin our ghost our laser the hp bar and the game over but luckily most of the things are in the backpack for me to use but first we have to get the ghost and then we have to get the laser which is just the button so a bunch of people are asking me from different projects they're like where's the laser uh where's the laser it's just a button but then we just renamed it so if you actually look this part just rename it laser so um and then yeah that's all we need and then we're gonna make the game over and stuff later but we're gonna get the pumpkin we actually drew this from our last year's halloween game so put this in yeah from our smash the pumpkins game from halloween and we have to take the health bar which is actually really easy to make so if you don't know how to make it's just a bunch of squares and then you connect them together and duplicate them we're going to show you how to draw this um health part partially real quick so let's do this so uh we have this look we have the green we have the yellow we have orange so you get a fairly decent sized box and um let me get a box so you get green fairly decent and then you use the mouse ctrl c ctrl v and now you have your other box you connect them together and then you can do that again just say control v now you have four boxes and basically so on you get eight and then you ungroup them and get two and then you know it's real easy yeah we got two yep there we go so this is basically how you do it and then we wanted to be extra fancy by adding the little pumpkin on the uh side of the health bar so we just take this ctrl c ctrl v and it's really large but you know we'll just shrink it yeah so that's basically how you become fancy fancy and um and the coloring is you can like color it like any way you want but you know we advise green and then whenever you lose a life it turns gray so and one more thing yeah the death bar is all gray so i mean like you can make this orange if you wanted to but you know just how it is i'm going to show you the coloring method we have so the first three squares or green and then starting right here they become yellow yellow yellow and then we have the orange and then yeah so on and yeah so you just duplicate it like so oh you get the thing and then you change it it changes one gray square and then you're basically set and that's basically how we made the health bar so i'm gonna delete that real quick uh okay so uhoh what's that a little all right so um and now let's get everything set up so we have the witch's hut so that's our backdrop you use any other backdrop like woods i would also advise woods but i use witch's house because we barely use witch house only these woods and then ghost i think this is 50 if i'm not mistaken i'm pretty sure this is the size 75 actually i'm pretty sure it's 75 75 and then um the laser is 20 and then the pumpkin is regular sized and now we just have to color the laser we decided to make it green so um just a type of green so first you have to ungroup it and then you get this and then you like you can make it any color you want but just green is just good and yeah just like basically find some green shades that you like like brightness not the brightness yeah so that's basically what we did to make the lasers delete this one and now um let's get this started so the laser's finished everything's finished let's start with the pumpkin or the jackolantern so we have to make a variable but we'll actually do that later first because we haven't got the debt but just put the green flag and we're gonna make a variable right after that so uh score like always we always do score and set score to zero always score to zero and we'll go to x well i'm gonna find a good position x zero i was doing this on the laser so sorry about that i'm gonna do it on the pumpkin pumpkin mushroom first uh so green flag that's pretty easy to not sure if you can see that but uh set score to zero and um now we're gonna get the position so go to x of the pumpkin i'm pretty sure in the pocket right now go to x0 negative 136. so it will be like over here and then we'll go forever um it'll go to x go to mouse so we get the go to and then we go here mouse x because we don't want if we didn't mouse why you'll start floating in the air and we don't want that to happen because if you put your mouse here just go all over the place and then we have um if then if then the mouse is down then we will wait until it's not mouse down so you cannot spam the command so where's the wait uh here we go wait until not mouse down and we'll broadcast fire pew so yeah fire oops fire and when the green flag is oh we haven't done that so let's just go to the uh place where it gets fire so we're gonna do the laser and we'll come back to the pumpkin later so when the green flag is clicked we will point in direction zero which is pointing up so uh the laser won't go sideways around wonky or anything point direction zero and then we will go hide and then when i receive fire it will create a clone of myself and when i start as a clone oh my gosh where is it when i start as a clone uh it'll go to x so it'll go to x x position of pumpkin so this is the tricky block this one backdrop stage so uh um pumpkin let's actually rename this real quick oh we'll do that later but yeah anyways let's just that was kind of cringe seeing the one uh and um we have plot okay so this is what we've been doing for a while now so we have the plus sign here we have a 50 and we have the y position of pumpkin the reason we need this is the plus 50 is because we don't actually want the bullet to come out of its nose because it's going to be like here and it's going to shoot up through the nose so we want it to start at the stem and all the way up so we have this done and then it will show repeat until you need a or repeat until touching edge or touching ghost so that's the ghost so it'll stop when it's touching a ghost or a uh edge so it'll move ten steps so keep on going until it touches that edge or ghost it'll delete this clone terminate the clone and yep let's i'll try this so let's see what if this works or not so pew pew pew yep definitely works let me shoot the ghost yep works so next we're gonna go back to the ghost i mean just go to the ghost and let's do this so the ghost uh so when the green flag is clicked it will oh wow this thing has decent amount of code so hang in there repeat five clones so there'll be five ghosts at a time it'll create clone of myself and i'll hide so when i start as a clone it will switch costume to ghost a which is this costume and then it'll show and then it'll go to x we'll go to the pick random negative 180 to positive 180 for the y i mean the x so then it'll be like around here to here here is like so just pick a number like that like you know from here like here something like that yeah like 180 here and we have like over here yeah so just like do that and we're going to do the y real quick so if you want to use my coordinates that's fine as well so pick random for the y it's negative 20 to 120 so here we have like like negative 20 yeah up here we have like 120 yeah maybe up more but yeah that that that's the deal here so um now let's put the forever loop uh if then else always forget the else if then else the uh else the pick random is greater than five so we're gonna get the greater sign the pick random one to ten is greater than five so it's a fifty percent chance it will come down and swoop at you so if you want it lower you can make it lower but we just did 50 chance it'll come down and try to sweep you out so it'll glide uh where's the glide there uh glide two seconds to random position we actually have to get the this slide and now we're going down here and we'll glide two seconds of oops say glide two seconds i'll pick random of this and pick random of this so there we have that and now we have to move on to the next part so when i start as a clone it will go forever um if then touching laser laser then it will die so if then touching laser then it'll switch costume to go see what's the switch costume so it will turn into ghosts screaming like ah so switch costume the costume c and yeah and now we're gonna wait 0.5 seconds and hide and then wait 0.2 seconds i mean not 0.2 and wait two seconds and now it'll switch costume to back to ghost a so it won't act like it's screaming anymore so switch costume back to ghost day and it will show and now we have one last code for the ghost and we are basically done with the ghost here so when i start as a clunk where's that uh then it will go forever and if it's touching the laser then touching laser then then it will broadcast delete laser because we don't want them to phase through them uh like like uh piercing so we want to make it go bam but if you do want to do phasing you don't really have to really have to do this so delete laser and then they'll change score by one yeah change score by one so you get one score so i'll give you a second to absorb this feel free to pause if you need it and yeah we're gonna go back we're gonna go to the uh hp bar so we're gonna show you if it works or not we we so basically it works right now so we're good to go so we have to make the hp bar so let's do the hp bar uh so actually the hp bar leads back to the pumpkin so let's do the hp bar so when the green flag is clicked it will switch costume to costume one which is our first beautiful costume with all your lives in it and the pumpkin so we have to do the got hit first sorry guys because we have to make the get it hit i think that's how you lose hp so when i res when the green bag is clicked it will go forever and then if it's touching the ghost then it will broadcast got hit which is a new broadcast message uh so i'm going to make a new message drag this so broadcast got hit and white you have to put that weight go ahead and wait add the weight and then wait 0.5 seconds and now let's go to the hp bar because after the pumpkin it leads back to the hp bar so we already got this set up so let's do the big script of code not really big but still when i receive got hit it will go next costume which is the lost one life costume so and then if then the costume number equals 11. so i have to get an equal sign if the costume number equals to 11. which is the last costume when we'll have to broadcast game over and wait game over see a costume number is 11 that's the last costume everything's gray that's the costume so and then um you need a if then statement now if then uh under if then uh the costume number is greater than six it'll start blinking so pew pew start that uh blinking spree and uh whenever it gets hit and then it will hide okay so this is how you do the blinking hide wait 0.2 seconds show and then we duplicate this duplicate this and then we have another weight 0.2 seconds and then hide and then wait 0.2 seconds and show so i'll give you a second to absorb this code feel free to pause and so now let's um go make the game over so i told you earlier that i'll come back to the laser and finish the script of code so when i receive senior when i receive delete laser then it'll delete this clone and now we're done with the laser and now we have to work on the game over sprite so we just have to paint a new sprite so we just need a dark red and then we have hand handwriting as always and we write game over make it pretty big and put it in the middle and now we have to go to the game over when the green flag is clicked and go to zero zero hide and then when i receive game over and it will show and stumble and now we're gonna go to the backdrop and finish off the music so when the green flag is clicked we're gonna use a sound you can use any sound you want but we use cave so then it will set volume well you don't really have to do this but optional set volume to 25 and then go forever and then place down cave until done so we're done let's test this out get hit oh i just lost a life oh no i lost another two lives because he was gliding around i shot so this is pretty much the game and so no need to uh so just go to my project if you're uh want to export the hp bar or the pumpkin or anything or the game over uh just go to my project go to gumball098 or laser or whatever go to gumball098 um and then right click and export it and use your uh regular account if you're in if you're in school don't use your school account and then um download uh don't use the school account for the google drive or else you have to request access and that's not good so just use your regular main account that you're using on the computer as of right now so export it and then you have everything set so um please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below uh yeah what else games you want and anyways happy halloween oh yeah oh yeah and tell us how much uh candy you got from halloween if you're going trickortreating and yeah comment down in the comment section below what candy you got and like what's your favorite candy and uh what you're being this year for a costume to make the comments a little bit fun and anyways uh see you guys next time and happy
