00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - hey guys it's kids coding playground
00:09 - here and today we're back for another
00:11 - video and it's called the spear fishing
00:13 - game today
00:14 - on our scratch tutorial we'll be working
00:16 - on this game the objective of the game
00:18 - is to catch fishes
00:19 - by throwing a spear at the fish avoid
00:22 - the puffer fish if you touch it you will
00:23 - lose hp
00:24 - so one of our viewers right here the
00:26 - small shout out
00:28 - said we should make this game so we
00:29 - decided to make one
00:34 - so spearfishing game we'll be learning
00:36 - these following concepts from scratch
00:37 - variables loops broadcast messaging
00:41 - a controlling spread with arrow keys and
00:43 - custom blocks
00:46 - so i'm just going to demo the game
00:49 - so as you can see it plays some music i
00:52 - think it's like a
00:52 - it sounds like an ocean music there's
00:55 - some fish
00:56 - other swimming around in a puffer fish
00:58 - if you touch the puffer
00:59 - it changes color effect and changes back
01:01 - to the regular version
01:03 - and it keeps doing that and then that's
01:05 - what you should basically do
01:07 - and then you just you can catch the fish
01:09 - with
01:10 - space to throw and i caught the fish
01:16 - and you can also catch them from the
01:17 - head too
01:20 - [Music]
01:22 - see i caught one from the head there's a
01:26 - [Music]
01:30 - so yeah so i sped up the process
01:34 - as you can see um i'm losing health i'm
01:37 - trying to kill myself right now
01:38 - let me show you what it says when you
01:41 - come at 10 hp
01:43 - so 1 hp of 10 as you can see it says
01:46 - game over
01:47 - so we're going to start our project
01:48 - before i start please like
01:50 - share and subscribe and comment in the
01:52 - comment section below what else games
01:53 - you want
01:54 - so let's just start a new game
02:00 - so you can rename this to spear fishing
02:03 - game
02:03 - in the beginning
02:07 - and just delete the sprite so i already
02:10 - have things in the backpack for me
02:12 - like the sprite
02:16 - the trident and they also and you can
02:19 - also get the diver it's in here
02:22 - diver diver so i think i use this one
02:26 - yes i use this one
02:29 - so i'm going to show the trident and
02:32 - then i'm also going to add
02:35 - i also have the fish so
02:38 - the fish already has all the costumes
02:41 - fish one fish two so it normally comes
02:43 - with fish one fish two and fish
02:45 - three and fish four actually you have to
02:48 - rename this to fish one
02:50 - and this is fish two it's actually fish
02:51 - a b c
02:53 - and d and then you also have to make
02:55 - fish one
02:57 - dead one so that's a fish one and it's
03:00 - dead one
03:02 - because this is a first death and fish
03:04 - one death two that's from the
03:06 - butt and
03:09 - fish two dead one so this was
03:13 - it from the head but this one and this
03:15 - one's
03:17 - from the tail too this one's from the
03:18 - tail and then this one's from the head
03:21 - but the another fish this one's from the
03:23 - butt it
03:24 - and it's just a pattern so here you go
03:27 - so it's all the costumes you need so
03:31 - anyway so we're gonna show you how to
03:34 - drill the trident
03:35 - so it's basically um
03:38 - just a line and just three spikes you
03:42 - can just use a reshape tool
03:44 - to do this stuff and let's paint the new
03:50 - so this is just a triangle
03:54 - you can just make the square the
03:56 - rectangle
03:59 - and then you can just use the reshape
04:00 - tool and turn it into a triangle
04:02 - really quickly so you can use you can
04:05 - also click delete
04:06 - to make it a triangle so there's two
04:09 - ways to make it a triangle
04:10 - you can just curve up the edge and then
04:12 - you got a neat triangle
04:15 - and then you can just copy paste it and
04:20 - make the third one longer because all
04:22 - tridents have this type of thing
04:23 - and you can also do it for that one too
04:27 - and then you can also
04:29 - get like the brown color
04:33 - and then use the rectangle
04:37 - and make the
04:40 - um like the part of like
04:43 - where the spikes where it holds the
04:45 - spikes and you can also reshape it
04:47 - to make it look more like a i don't know
04:50 - what shape that is more like an oval
04:54 - and you can also make the edge like the
04:57 - spear
04:59 - you start with a line
05:04 - you can also click shift to make a
05:06 - straight line
05:07 - so there you go to try to
05:10 - so here you go this is your trident so
05:12 - we can delete this costume
05:16 - we gotta group them together and rotate
05:18 - them to the right
05:22 - so let's just delete and you can just
05:24 - rotate it
05:25 - just group it all then rotate it
05:31 - there it's uh tried it here we go
05:36 - i think it was made the other way so
05:38 - it's fine it's a negative 90 actually
05:41 - so we can make it positive here we go
05:46 - and yeah that's how you make a trident
05:53 - so i'm just going to delete that and
05:55 - let's get started in the code
05:57 - so we also have to get our backdrop
05:59 - first
06:01 - i think i use underwater one
06:04 - and i'm going to the diver
06:08 - and go to the code so we're going to
06:09 - make some
06:13 - once you create it created the trident
06:16 - you have to load it into the fish
06:17 - and group it together and put
06:20 - put it in the fish
06:25 - so i just got fish here and
06:28 - you can go to the spear um group it
06:33 - ctrl c ctrl v
06:36 - and then add it here
06:41 - this is actually ish
06:44 - a2 so it's basically the death
06:49 - and this is from the head so that's what
06:52 - it is
06:54 - and you can also duplicate it again and
06:56 - make it from the tail
07:03 - and you can also hold shift to make it
07:06 - even
07:06 - so here we go um that's how it's
07:09 - supposed to be
07:10 - so i'm just going to delete this
07:13 - and let's get started on the code
07:18 - so i'm just going to move that right
07:20 - here and let's go to the variables and
07:22 - we have to make some variables
07:26 - and then make some variables fishes
07:29 - which is fish
07:30 - i actually don't think it's plural it's
07:32 - just fish
07:33 - i think it's fish it's fish and
07:36 - hp
07:41 - those are two variables you need for the
07:42 - diver
07:44 - and then the backdrop we already did
07:45 - that in the backdrop we can also
07:47 - add the sound so when green flag is
07:50 - clicked
07:51 - let's just get my sound i use ode song
07:57 - um and when the green flag is clicked
08:03 - it will go forever
08:06 - and play sound ode song until done
08:10 - that's it for the backdrop and then you
08:13 - have to work on the diver
08:16 - so when the green flag is clicked
08:23 - um it'll set hp to 100 so that means in
08:26 - the beginning it'll have 100 hp
08:33 - and it'll set rotation cell left right
08:35 - so it won't will not flip over when you
08:37 - move him
08:38 - to negative 90.
08:41 - and it'll go forever
08:45 - if then the right arrow key is pressed
08:53 - is pressed everyone knows how to do this
08:55 - right arrow key is pressed
08:56 - that means i'll point in direction 90
09:00 - and change x by 5.
09:05 - we just duplicate that
09:08 - please
09:12 - duplicate that and change it to left
09:14 - arrow
09:16 - and point in direction negative 90
09:21 - and change x by negative 5
09:27 - and then the up arrow is just a little
09:29 - bit different
09:31 - you can just duplicate this but you got
09:33 - to change it to y
09:34 - instead and you can take out the point
09:36 - in direction
09:38 - part and then change y instead
09:43 - by five
09:47 - and this up arrow
09:50 - you just duplicate this one
09:58 - so i'm just going to put that whole
10:00 - thing
10:02 - and down arrow instead
10:07 - and change y by negative five
10:11 - so okay so
10:15 - i'm going to show you how to move so
10:17 - it's simple
10:18 - it's moving it's really fine you can't
10:22 - feel those gears yet because we didn't
10:23 - code that yet
10:25 - and then i'm gonna work on the spear
10:29 - so you're gonna go to my blocks and make
10:32 - a block
10:32 - called go to diver so i'll go to the
10:35 - diver in the beginning
10:40 - go to diver
10:44 - and then it'll go to the front layer
10:46 - let's just make this a little bit bigger
10:48 - we'll go to the front layer
10:51 - go to the front there
10:55 - and hide
11:00 - right there and i'll go to diver two
11:05 - that's basically the diver so go to
11:08 - diver two and then point in direction
11:11 - direction of diver so it'll throw the
11:13 - spear
11:14 - wherever you're pointing in the
11:15 - direction where the diver is pointing
11:17 - direction
11:18 - so it's point in direction
11:23 - direction you need this one
11:26 - it's a little bit tricky get to change
11:28 - the one behind it
11:30 - and then you can change the one over
11:32 - here
11:34 - and then point in direction of diver so
11:36 - here we go
11:38 - now when green flag is clicked it will
11:40 - set
11:44 - fish to zero
11:48 - it'll go forever and it'll go to the
11:54 - diver
11:57 - if the arrow key are not the arrow key
12:01 - if then the space key is pressed
12:09 - then broadcast fire this spear
12:19 - broadcasting white fires because it
12:21 - needs to wait
12:23 - a broadcast
12:27 - fire the
12:31 - speaker
12:35 - and then you have to work on the spear
12:38 - more
12:38 - so when i receive fire the sphere
12:42 - i'll show that's when you click spacebar
12:45 - and it'll repeat until it's touching
12:47 - that edge
12:55 - it'll move 10 steps and i'll keep on
12:58 - moving
12:58 - until it touches the edge and then i'll
13:00 - go to driver
13:05 - so i'm going to show it as you can see
13:08 - the spears are coming out
13:10 - fine
13:11 - [Music]
13:15 - that's basically what's happening and
13:18 - then
13:18 - let's work on the fish so we might have
13:21 - to make a part two later but
13:23 - let's just work on it for now so define
13:26 - move fish
13:35 - it'll go to random position i'll be at a
13:39 - random position
13:41 - and we have to make a variable so we
13:44 - have to make a new variable
13:45 - just for the sprite and it's called
13:48 - costume name
13:54 - and delete this so costume name
14:00 - costume name and then for the sprite
14:04 - only
14:05 - okay so set costume
14:09 - name to join
14:14 - pick random
14:19 - join fish so the fish
14:22 - now pick random one to four fish
14:26 - no one one two four costume of the fish
14:29 - so as you can see there's four fish
14:31 - types
14:32 - one two three four
14:37 - and that's fish four fish three fish two
14:39 - fish one
14:40 - okay so let's keep on going so and
14:44 - switch costume to costume name
14:51 - and oh show
14:57 - it'll show and go forever
15:02 - if then
15:05 - it's touching the spear
15:11 - then it'll broadcast got fish so you're
15:14 - gonna make a new message
15:16 - got fish
15:20 - and i'll move five steps
15:29 - if then if then statement
15:35 - it's touching the edge
15:39 - then if it's on the azure bounce
15:44 - so yeah so as i call the function
15:48 - you have to do if the green flag is
15:50 - clicked
15:52 - go to front layer
15:57 - and set rotation style left right
16:03 - rotation style right right there
16:06 - and call the function
16:09 - so here you go so i'm gonna demo the
16:13 - game
16:14 - as you can see it's this fish are
16:17 - bouncing around
16:18 - [Music]
16:20 - and then
16:23 - [Music]
16:26 - so in next video we'll be working on
16:29 - more fish
16:30 - a puffer fish and the spear killing the
16:32 - fish
16:33 - so anyways we're going so please like
16:36 - share subscribe and comment in the
16:38 - comment section below for up what else
16:40 - videos you want so anyways goodbye
16:50 - [Music]
16:52 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys it's kids coding playground here and today we're back for another video and it's called the spear fishing game today on our scratch tutorial we'll be working on this game the objective of the game is to catch fishes by throwing a spear at the fish avoid the puffer fish if you touch it you will lose hp so one of our viewers right here the small shout out said we should make this game so we decided to make one so spearfishing game we'll be learning these following concepts from scratch variables loops broadcast messaging a controlling spread with arrow keys and custom blocks so i'm just going to demo the game so as you can see it plays some music i think it's like a it sounds like an ocean music there's some fish other swimming around in a puffer fish if you touch the puffer it changes color effect and changes back to the regular version and it keeps doing that and then that's what you should basically do and then you just you can catch the fish with space to throw and i caught the fish and you can also catch them from the head too see i caught one from the head there's a so yeah so i sped up the process as you can see um i'm losing health i'm trying to kill myself right now let me show you what it says when you come at 10 hp so 1 hp of 10 as you can see it says game over so we're going to start our project before i start please like share and subscribe and comment in the comment section below what else games you want so let's just start a new game so you can rename this to spear fishing game in the beginning and just delete the sprite so i already have things in the backpack for me like the sprite the trident and they also and you can also get the diver it's in here diver diver so i think i use this one yes i use this one so i'm going to show the trident and then i'm also going to add i also have the fish so the fish already has all the costumes fish one fish two so it normally comes with fish one fish two and fish three and fish four actually you have to rename this to fish one and this is fish two it's actually fish a b c and d and then you also have to make fish one dead one so that's a fish one and it's dead one because this is a first death and fish one death two that's from the butt and fish two dead one so this was it from the head but this one and this one's from the tail too this one's from the tail and then this one's from the head but the another fish this one's from the butt it and it's just a pattern so here you go so it's all the costumes you need so anyway so we're gonna show you how to drill the trident so it's basically um just a line and just three spikes you can just use a reshape tool to do this stuff and let's paint the new so this is just a triangle you can just make the square the rectangle and then you can just use the reshape tool and turn it into a triangle really quickly so you can use you can also click delete to make it a triangle so there's two ways to make it a triangle you can just curve up the edge and then you got a neat triangle and then you can just copy paste it and make the third one longer because all tridents have this type of thing and you can also do it for that one too and then you can also get like the brown color and then use the rectangle and make the um like the part of like where the spikes where it holds the spikes and you can also reshape it to make it look more like a i don't know what shape that is more like an oval and you can also make the edge like the spear you start with a line you can also click shift to make a straight line so there you go to try to so here you go this is your trident so we can delete this costume we gotta group them together and rotate them to the right so let's just delete and you can just rotate it just group it all then rotate it there it's uh tried it here we go i think it was made the other way so it's fine it's a negative 90 actually so we can make it positive here we go and yeah that's how you make a trident so i'm just going to delete that and let's get started in the code so we also have to get our backdrop first i think i use underwater one and i'm going to the diver and go to the code so we're going to make some once you create it created the trident you have to load it into the fish and group it together and put put it in the fish so i just got fish here and you can go to the spear um group it ctrl c ctrl v and then add it here this is actually ish a2 so it's basically the death and this is from the head so that's what it is and you can also duplicate it again and make it from the tail and you can also hold shift to make it even so here we go um that's how it's supposed to be so i'm just going to delete this and let's get started on the code so i'm just going to move that right here and let's go to the variables and we have to make some variables and then make some variables fishes which is fish i actually don't think it's plural it's just fish i think it's fish it's fish and hp those are two variables you need for the diver and then the backdrop we already did that in the backdrop we can also add the sound so when green flag is clicked let's just get my sound i use ode song um and when the green flag is clicked it will go forever and play sound ode song until done that's it for the backdrop and then you have to work on the diver so when the green flag is clicked um it'll set hp to 100 so that means in the beginning it'll have 100 hp and it'll set rotation cell left right so it won't will not flip over when you move him to negative 90. and it'll go forever if then the right arrow key is pressed is pressed everyone knows how to do this right arrow key is pressed that means i'll point in direction 90 and change x by 5. we just duplicate that please duplicate that and change it to left arrow and point in direction negative 90 and change x by negative 5 and then the up arrow is just a little bit different you can just duplicate this but you got to change it to y instead and you can take out the point in direction part and then change y instead by five and this up arrow you just duplicate this one so i'm just going to put that whole thing and down arrow instead and change y by negative five so okay so i'm going to show you how to move so it's simple it's moving it's really fine you can't feel those gears yet because we didn't code that yet and then i'm gonna work on the spear so you're gonna go to my blocks and make a block called go to diver so i'll go to the diver in the beginning go to diver and then it'll go to the front layer let's just make this a little bit bigger we'll go to the front layer go to the front there and hide right there and i'll go to diver two that's basically the diver so go to diver two and then point in direction direction of diver so it'll throw the spear wherever you're pointing in the direction where the diver is pointing direction so it's point in direction direction you need this one it's a little bit tricky get to change the one behind it and then you can change the one over here and then point in direction of diver so here we go now when green flag is clicked it will set fish to zero it'll go forever and it'll go to the diver if the arrow key are not the arrow key if then the space key is pressed then broadcast fire this spear broadcasting white fires because it needs to wait a broadcast fire the speaker and then you have to work on the spear more so when i receive fire the sphere i'll show that's when you click spacebar and it'll repeat until it's touching that edge it'll move 10 steps and i'll keep on moving until it touches the edge and then i'll go to driver so i'm going to show it as you can see the spears are coming out fine that's basically what's happening and then let's work on the fish so we might have to make a part two later but let's just work on it for now so define move fish it'll go to random position i'll be at a random position and we have to make a variable so we have to make a new variable just for the sprite and it's called costume name and delete this so costume name costume name and then for the sprite only okay so set costume name to join pick random join fish so the fish now pick random one to four fish no one one two four costume of the fish so as you can see there's four fish types one two three four and that's fish four fish three fish two fish one okay so let's keep on going so and switch costume to costume name and oh show it'll show and go forever if then it's touching the spear then it'll broadcast got fish so you're gonna make a new message got fish and i'll move five steps if then if then statement it's touching the edge then if it's on the azure bounce so yeah so as i call the function you have to do if the green flag is clicked go to front layer and set rotation style left right rotation style right right there and call the function so here you go so i'm gonna demo the game as you can see it's this fish are bouncing around and then so in next video we'll be working on more fish a puffer fish and the spear killing the fish so anyways we're going so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below for up what else videos you want so anyways goodbye you
