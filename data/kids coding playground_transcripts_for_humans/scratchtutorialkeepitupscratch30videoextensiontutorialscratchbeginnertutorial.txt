00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys it's
00:08 - kidscodingplayground here
00:10 - today we'll be working on another
00:11 - scratch tutorial so we're going to make
00:13 - a game called keep it up
00:14 - so what you do is you don't need your
00:17 - keyboard or mouse or anything like that
00:19 - all you need is your hands or your head
00:21 - or something like that
00:22 - so the ball will be bouncing around the
00:24 - screen and
00:26 - you're supposed to use your hands and
00:28 - head and the video sensing
00:30 - will show up and you you move your hands
00:32 - and stuff like that to make the ball
00:34 - keep on bouncing
00:35 - and every hit you get increases the
00:38 - score right here
00:39 - and when the ball touches the ground
00:42 - it's game over
00:43 - so without further ado let's get on to
00:46 - the demo no face reveal yet so i'll be
00:49 - wearing this
00:50 - devil mask for now
00:54 - okay let's start
00:58 - okay so basically you just use your
01:00 - hands or something like that and then
01:01 - you just knock the ball up
01:06 - as you can see um and when it touches
01:09 - the green is getting over let's
01:11 - [Music]
01:25 - okay let me stop this one
01:31 - so guys we are going to delete the
01:33 - scratch cap for us so let's delete it
01:35 - and next let's go get the video
01:37 - extension go into the
01:38 - extensions and import this one so now
01:41 - you have the video
01:43 - okay and next we're gonna import some
01:46 - sprites
01:46 - so what i got was this thing it's just
01:48 - the ground i just drew
01:50 - a rectangle with green that's basically
01:53 - what i did
01:56 - okay so for the backdrops i have this is
01:59 - one
01:59 - white backdrop as the main one so this
02:02 - is the one with the video so we're gonna
02:03 - just
02:04 - import another backdrop i thought so all
02:07 - i did was just make
02:08 - it blue and right game over with it and
02:11 - center the game over
02:12 - okay so that's what i did for here
02:16 - so you guys can do that on your own and
02:18 - then we're going to get a soccer ball
02:20 - now so just search up
02:26 - soccer ball this one so just take that
02:30 - so you can see the soccer ball okay now
02:32 - we can work on the code so in the soccer
02:34 - ball we can get our one green flag
02:36 - clicked
02:36 - let's zoom in and we're going to get
02:41 - switch backdrop to the backdrop one
02:44 - first which is the starting backdrop we
02:47 - can rename this backdrop to start if you
02:50 - would like
02:53 - start okay and next
02:57 - in the soccer ball after you switch to
02:59 - start i'm going to make it go to a
03:00 - random position
03:01 - so let's go to pick random negative 200
03:05 - to 200
03:10 - 200 and we're going to set the y to 100
03:15 - in the beginning and then after that
03:18 - we're going to
03:19 - point in direction of 180 so let's do
03:22 - that
03:24 - 180 so 180
03:28 - and then we're going to make a new
03:29 - variable called score
03:32 - for all sprites score so we can set the
03:36 - score
03:37 - to zero in the beginning and then we're
03:40 - gonna
03:40 - turn the video on and it's already on
03:44 - right now as you can see
03:45 - so like if you start a new project video
03:48 - on the previous one it will
03:49 - automatically add it for you
03:51 - and then we're going to set the video
03:52 - transparency like 20
03:54 - 20 so then it's easier um it's
03:58 - not completely like think so it's a
04:02 - little bit
04:02 - um faded as you can see it's a little
04:05 - less
04:07 - and then we're gonna make it wait two
04:08 - seconds before starting
04:11 - wait two seconds and after that we're
04:14 - going to get a forever loop
04:17 - when uh move 10 steps
04:21 - and if on edge we want to bounce okay
04:25 - so this is the ball as you can see let's
04:27 - play it
04:28 - the ball start bouncing around
04:31 - after that okay and next
04:35 - we're going to detect when you
04:38 - touch it or not like the motion okay now
04:41 - let's work on the motion
04:43 - of the thing so like when it when the
04:46 - motion is greater than 10
04:47 - then the ball will start bouncing off
04:50 - your hand or
04:51 - your body parts and then it's gonna
04:53 - change the score by one every single
04:55 - time
04:56 - you touch it change score by one
05:01 - and then we're going to play the sound
05:03 - boeing in the sound library
05:06 - or we can just use the basketball bounce
05:07 - this one's fine as well
05:09 - pick whatever sound you would like and
05:12 - after that we're going to do point
05:13 - direction
05:14 - point in direction of the
05:20 - uh video direction on sprite
05:23 - okay and then we're going to wait 0.5
05:25 - seconds
05:26 - so every time i touch this as you can
05:28 - just start playing that balance
05:29 - sound sound so like every time
05:33 - the motion is greater than 10 it will
05:35 - bounce as you can see
05:37 - and then i'm gonna get a one green flag
05:39 - clicked
05:42 - so i'm gonna i guess i can like take
05:45 - this out for now because like
05:46 - i'll put it back in later okay that's
05:49 - like it might be a little bit annoying
05:50 - for you guys
05:51 - so next we're going to get the
05:54 - score like we can know like this when
05:56 - you touch the ground we will get this
05:59 - so when greenfly clicked oh yeah and we
06:03 - can wait 0.5 seconds right here forgot
06:05 - to do that
06:07 - so then it's a little bit weight
06:11 - it's really hard to breathe in this mask
06:14 - and then we're going to get an if then
06:15 - statement so if
06:17 - if touching ground
06:22 - touching ground
06:27 - touching the ground which is the thing
06:29 - and i forgot to mention put a forever
06:31 - loop around this thing
06:33 - forever loop and if touching ground
06:38 - you can play uh we're gonna get a sound
06:42 - called drum bass too that's the one i
06:45 - used for the previous one
06:47 - drum bass to this one so if it's
06:49 - touching the ground we'll play this
06:50 - sound
06:51 - so start this and we're going to turn
06:54 - the video off
06:55 - once that happens turn the video off
06:59 - once it touches the ground and we're
07:01 - going to switch the backdrop to game
07:03 - over as you can see right here
07:05 - with the game over one so we're gonna do
07:08 - switch backdrop
07:11 - to game over
07:16 - and we're gonna stop all so now let's
07:20 - test it out
07:21 - so i'm gonna put this back in
07:24 - save let's play
07:27 - [Music]
07:28 - as you can see it's gonna be bouncing
07:30 - around
07:33 - and as you see i'm not gonna touch it
07:37 - i'm gonna move out of the way
07:40 - as you can see when it touches the
07:41 - ground it's game over so yeah
07:44 - that's it for this tutorial i hope you
07:46 - guys enjoyed learning with us
07:48 - please like share and subscribe and
07:50 - we'll see you guys in the next video
07:53 - [Music]
07:56 - bye
08:01 - [Music]
08:03 - you

so like when it when the motion is greater than 10 then the ball will start bouncing off your hand or your body parts and then it's gonna change the score by one every single time you touch it change score by one and then we're going to play the sound boeing in the sound library or we can just use the basketball bounce this one's fine as well pick whatever sound you would like and after that we're going to do point direction point in direction of the uh video direction on sprite okay and then we're going to wait 0.5 seconds so every time i touch this as you can just start playing that balance sound sound so like every time the motion is greater than 10 it will bounce as you can see and then i'm gonna get a one green flag clicked so i'm gonna i guess i can like take this out for now because like i'll put it back in later okay that's like it might be a little bit annoying for you guys so next we're going to get the score like we can know like this when you touch the ground we will get this so when greenfly clicked oh yeah and we can wait 0.5 seconds right here forgot to do that so then it's a little bit weight it's really hard to breathe in this mask and then we're going to get an if then statement so if if touching ground touching ground touching the ground which is the thing and i forgot to mention put a forever loop around this thing forever loop and if touching ground you can play uh we're gonna get a sound called drum bass too that's the one i used for the previous one drum bass to this one so if it's touching the ground we'll play this sound so start this and we're going to turn the video off once that happens turn the video off once it touches the ground and we're going to switch the backdrop to game over as you can see right here with the game over one so we're gonna do switch backdrop to game over and we're gonna stop all so now let's test it out so i'm gonna put this back in save let's play as you can see it's gonna be bouncing around and as you see i'm not gonna touch it i'm gonna move out of the way as you can see when it touches the ground it's game over so yeah that's it for this tutorial i hope you guys enjoyed learning with us please like share and subscribe and we'll see you guys in the next video bye you
