00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys
00:08 - to another tutorial on kids coding
00:09 - playground today we'll be working on the
00:11 - part three for the math game
00:14 - so i already have my division button
00:15 - from the backpack
00:17 - so what i did was just drew a rectangle
00:19 - and wrote division so it's pretty simple
00:21 - to do
00:21 - pretty sure you guys can all do that so
00:24 - first i'm gonna
00:25 - start on the code on division so i'm
00:28 - gonna get a one flag
00:29 - clicked i wanna hide
00:33 - let me zoom in a little bit one flight
00:36 - click time
00:37 - and then when i receive start game
00:41 - i wanna hide
00:45 - and then when this sprite is clicked i'm
00:48 - gonna um
00:49 - broadcast start game and
00:53 - i'm gonna broadcast a new message
00:56 - and call it start division
00:58 - [Music]
01:02 - start division and next
01:06 - when i receive choose game we are also
01:08 - going to
01:10 - show when you receive
01:14 - to choose game we're going to show and
01:15 - then this part is just
01:17 - for when you put your mouse on it will
01:19 - get bigger and smaller so when flag
01:21 - clicks get a forever loop
01:24 - if touching mouse pointer
01:29 - then set size to 85
01:33 - 85
01:37 - else we want to set the size back to 100
01:39 - so
01:40 - okay so that's all the code for the
01:42 - division button let's move on to the cat
01:44 - so for the cap we're going to be making
01:46 - a new custom block
01:48 - so let's go to my blocks so we can
01:50 - create our new custom block
01:52 - and we can just simply call it division
01:55 - division and click ok
01:59 - division i'm going to move it onto this
02:01 - side
02:03 - so i'm going to start coding from this
02:05 - side okay zoom in a little bit
02:07 - so i'm gonna get a forever loop uh i'm
02:10 - gonna set the guess
02:11 - to zero
02:14 - set the guess to zero and then i'm gonna
02:16 - set the random number one
02:19 - to pick random 100 so i'm going to do a
02:23 - pic random 100 but for the second one
02:26 - i'm only going to pick random
02:27 - 1 to 10 so it's not too hard random
02:30 - number 2 to 1 to 10.
02:32 - so it could be 2 digit divided by one
02:35 - digit or
02:36 - three digit divided by two digit so it's
02:38 - not too hard
02:40 - um so we're gonna get a repeat loop
02:42 - repeat until
02:44 - repeat until um we're gonna repeat until
02:47 - we're gonna get an equal sign and a mod
02:50 - so what mod is is basically the
02:52 - remainder of two numbers
02:54 - so let's say i have a 10
02:57 - and i have a five so if you click on it
03:00 - the mod is zero because 10 and five do
03:02 - not have a remainder
03:03 - but let's say if you do 10 and 3 the mod
03:06 - would be 1
03:07 - because 10 divided by 3 is 3 remainder 1
03:10 - so the remainder is 1. so
03:12 - mod is simply put the two
03:16 - values the and the remainder of the two
03:19 - values so that's what mod is
03:21 - so we're gonna get the mod so this is
03:23 - just to pick it so it'll be a
03:25 - um so the two numbers getting divided
03:27 - would be even
03:29 - so it would not have remainder so we're
03:31 - going to make
03:32 - the numbers not have remainders so we're
03:34 - going to find the mod
03:36 - of random number one and random number
03:38 - two
03:39 - and if it's equal to zero because zero
03:41 - means um
03:43 - that there will be no remainder then we
03:46 - want to
03:46 - reset set the random number one
03:49 - to one pick random one to 100
03:52 - like that and then we're going to set
03:56 - answer to problem uh to
04:00 - random number one divided by random
04:02 - number two so
04:03 - right here gonna put random number one
04:07 - divided by random number two
04:11 - like that and then we're gonna get a
04:13 - repeat until
04:14 - so we're going to repeat until
04:18 - repeat until um guess is equal to answer
04:20 - to problem
04:23 - guess is equal to answer problem
04:28 - um and then next we want to ask
04:32 - ask uh join we need two joins
04:36 - um since there's no division sign on the
04:38 - keyboard
04:39 - i'm gonna be using the slash symbol
04:41 - which also means division
04:42 - so we're gonna join the random number
04:45 - one
04:46 - and then i'm gonna put slash random
04:49 - number two
04:50 - like that and then i'm gonna set the
04:53 - guess
04:53 - to the answer set
04:56 - yes to the answer
05:01 - and then after that i'm going to get an
05:02 - if else so let's put the if else in here
05:06 - drag the if else right here and if
05:09 - answer gonna get uh equal
05:14 - so if the answer
05:18 - is equal to random number one divided by
05:21 - random number two
05:24 - um random number one divide that by
05:27 - random number two
05:30 - then we're gonna play i'm just gonna
05:32 - duplicate this
05:33 - play sound guitar strum say that is
05:35 - correct
05:36 - and change the score by one and then
05:39 - when you get it incorrect i'm going to
05:40 - duplicate the same thing
05:42 - play the string pluck and say that is
05:44 - the wrong answer
05:45 - so that's it for the division block so
05:48 - now we're gonna have to call it so
05:49 - let's go back right here um
05:52 - so i'm just gonna get a broadcast when i
05:55 - receive
05:56 - start division i'm gonna
06:01 - call the custom block division and one
06:04 - last thing we have to do the random
06:06 - so i'm actually gonna i have to put i
06:08 - still have to put the random in my um
06:10 - backpack so i'm gonna do that real quick
06:13 - okay so now i have the random block
06:15 - so what this does is if you can't pick
06:18 - either of the modes then you can just
06:19 - click
06:20 - random and it'll pick a random
06:23 - mode for you so let's get a one flat
06:26 - clicked
06:26 - we won't hide this in the beginning hide
06:31 - and then when i receive start game
06:35 - when i receive start game we're gonna
06:37 - hide
06:40 - and then when i receive choose game
06:44 - we want to show
06:48 - and then um we're gonna get the same
06:50 - thing from here
06:52 - drag and drop this into here this is all
06:55 - the same
06:57 - like that and then for the random part
06:59 - we're gonna do the random part now so
07:01 - this
07:02 - function right here will pick a random
07:05 - uh mode for you so when this right click
07:07 - we want to broadcast
07:09 - start game
07:11 - [Music]
07:12 - and then we want to set um the variable
07:15 - random game we made from the beginning
07:17 - of the
07:18 - uh videos from the first video we made
07:21 - the
07:22 - variable random game so now we're gonna
07:24 - have to use it so we're gonna make it
07:25 - pick random one to four because there's
07:27 - four operators
07:28 - addition subtraction multiplication and
07:30 - division
07:31 - and then we're going to get an if then
07:32 - statement if random game is equal to one
07:38 - if random game is equal to one
07:42 - then we want to broadcast start edition
07:48 - um so i'm gonna duplicate this
07:49 - everything else is pretty much the same
07:51 - so if random game is equal to two then
07:54 - we're gonna have to do subtraction
07:57 - and let's duplicate all of this put it
07:59 - under here
08:00 - and when random game is equal to three
08:03 - then we want to start multiplication
08:06 - and then when random number game is
08:08 - equal to four
08:10 - then we can start division
08:13 - okay so i think that's it
08:16 - so let's play the game i'm gonna save it
08:19 - and then for the cat i'm just gonna um
08:22 - put this right here so i don't have to
08:24 - keep on listening to this
08:26 - so let's make it bigger let's play let's
08:29 - play a math game
08:31 - so let's click random as you can see it
08:33 - picked a random
08:34 - one for me and when you get it right
08:36 - i'll say it's correct
08:38 - if you get it wrong you'll say it's
08:39 - wrong so i'm gonna quit
08:41 - um and i'm gonna do division this time
08:43 - to show you guys
08:45 - what division is so 44 as you can see
08:48 - it's a
08:48 - whole not it's a a number that
08:52 - has no remainders um so 44 divided by 4
08:55 - is 11.
08:56 - see there's no remainders uh we use the
08:58 - mod making it have no remainder so
09:00 - that's
09:02 - that's the good part of this so as you
09:05 - can see there's still no remainder
09:08 - so that's working so it's pretty cool
09:13 - so that's it for this video i hope you
09:17 - enjoyed
09:17 - learning the series make sure to like
09:21 - share and subscribe i'll see you guys
09:24 - next video

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys to another tutorial on kids coding playground today we'll be working on the part three for the math game so i already have my division button from the backpack so what i did was just drew a rectangle and wrote division so it's pretty simple to do pretty sure you guys can all do that so first i'm gonna start on the code on division so i'm gonna get a one flag clicked i wanna hide let me zoom in a little bit one flight click time and then when i receive start game i wanna hide and then when this sprite is clicked i'm gonna um broadcast start game and i'm gonna broadcast a new message and call it start division start division and next when i receive choose game we are also going to show when you receive to choose game we're going to show and then this part is just for when you put your mouse on it will get bigger and smaller so when flag clicks get a forever loop if touching mouse pointer then set size to 85 85 else we want to set the size back to 100 so okay so that's all the code for the division button let's move on to the cat so for the cap we're going to be making a new custom block so let's go to my blocks so we can create our new custom block and we can just simply call it division division and click ok division i'm going to move it onto this side so i'm going to start coding from this side okay zoom in a little bit so i'm gonna get a forever loop uh i'm gonna set the guess to zero set the guess to zero and then i'm gonna set the random number one to pick random 100 so i'm going to do a pic random 100 but for the second one i'm only going to pick random 1 to 10 so it's not too hard random number 2 to 1 to 10. so it could be 2 digit divided by one digit or three digit divided by two digit so it's not too hard um so we're gonna get a repeat loop repeat until repeat until um we're gonna repeat until we're gonna get an equal sign and a mod so what mod is is basically the remainder of two numbers so let's say i have a 10 and i have a five so if you click on it the mod is zero because 10 and five do not have a remainder but let's say if you do 10 and 3 the mod would be 1 because 10 divided by 3 is 3 remainder 1 so the remainder is 1. so mod is simply put the two values the and the remainder of the two values so that's what mod is so we're gonna get the mod so this is just to pick it so it'll be a um so the two numbers getting divided would be even so it would not have remainder so we're going to make the numbers not have remainders so we're going to find the mod of random number one and random number two and if it's equal to zero because zero means um that there will be no remainder then we want to reset set the random number one to one pick random one to 100 like that and then we're going to set answer to problem uh to random number one divided by random number two so right here gonna put random number one divided by random number two like that and then we're gonna get a repeat until so we're going to repeat until repeat until um guess is equal to answer to problem guess is equal to answer problem um and then next we want to ask ask uh join we need two joins um since there's no division sign on the keyboard i'm gonna be using the slash symbol which also means division so we're gonna join the random number one and then i'm gonna put slash random number two like that and then i'm gonna set the guess to the answer set yes to the answer and then after that i'm going to get an if else so let's put the if else in here drag the if else right here and if answer gonna get uh equal so if the answer is equal to random number one divided by random number two um random number one divide that by random number two then we're gonna play i'm just gonna duplicate this play sound guitar strum say that is correct and change the score by one and then when you get it incorrect i'm going to duplicate the same thing play the string pluck and say that is the wrong answer so that's it for the division block so now we're gonna have to call it so let's go back right here um so i'm just gonna get a broadcast when i receive start division i'm gonna call the custom block division and one last thing we have to do the random so i'm actually gonna i have to put i still have to put the random in my um backpack so i'm gonna do that real quick okay so now i have the random block so what this does is if you can't pick either of the modes then you can just click random and it'll pick a random mode for you so let's get a one flat clicked we won't hide this in the beginning hide and then when i receive start game when i receive start game we're gonna hide and then when i receive choose game we want to show and then um we're gonna get the same thing from here drag and drop this into here this is all the same like that and then for the random part we're gonna do the random part now so this function right here will pick a random uh mode for you so when this right click we want to broadcast start game and then we want to set um the variable random game we made from the beginning of the uh videos from the first video we made the variable random game so now we're gonna have to use it so we're gonna make it pick random one to four because there's four operators addition subtraction multiplication and division and then we're going to get an if then statement if random game is equal to one if random game is equal to one then we want to broadcast start edition um so i'm gonna duplicate this everything else is pretty much the same so if random game is equal to two then we're gonna have to do subtraction and let's duplicate all of this put it under here and when random game is equal to three then we want to start multiplication and then when random number game is equal to four then we can start division okay so i think that's it so let's play the game i'm gonna save it and then for the cat i'm just gonna um put this right here so i don't have to keep on listening to this so let's make it bigger let's play let's play a math game so let's click random as you can see it picked a random one for me and when you get it right i'll say it's correct if you get it wrong you'll say it's wrong so i'm gonna quit um and i'm gonna do division this time to show you guys what division is so 44 as you can see it's a whole not it's a a number that has no remainders um so 44 divided by 4 is 11. see there's no remainders uh we use the mod making it have no remainder so that's that's the good part of this so as you can see there's still no remainder so that's working so it's pretty cool so that's it for this video i hope you enjoyed learning the series make sure to like share and subscribe i'll see you guys next video
