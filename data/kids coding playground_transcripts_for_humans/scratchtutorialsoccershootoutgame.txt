00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:09 - kids coding lagron and another video to
00:12 - the sequence of future and projects from
00:15 - kids like you so this is a project Jalen
00:19 - my cousin submitted to us it's called
00:22 - soccer shootout so that one of the game
00:24 - is to shoot this ball into the goal
00:27 - without the goalie blocking it so we'll
00:32 - be learning these following concepts
00:33 - today and stretch custom blocks
00:36 - broadcasting messages using brain
00:38 - operator touching sprites when key
00:41 - pressed and hit boxes so let's demo his
00:47 - game so when you shoot you press the
00:53 - spacebar the ball will go into the goal
00:55 - and I'll say goal up here and you can
00:59 - move him there are some things you can
01:03 - improve them because whenever you shoot
01:06 - a goal and you move the ball will move
01:10 - with you and you don't want that and
01:15 - there's also these two buttons are here
01:18 - which you can use the increase and
01:20 - decrease the speed of the golden wait
01:22 - time if you do this they'll increase the
01:25 - speed by 7 so now we'll wait 7 seconds
01:29 - before moving to this next spot and if
01:32 - you click this they'll decrease it so
01:36 - next I'll move every 1 second so see now
01:40 - it's faster moving to its next spot and
01:43 - instead of instead of gliding instead of
01:47 - moving to the x + y position we can use
01:50 - gliding to make the game more smoothly
01:53 - run more smoothly so there's also this
02:00 - goal we can also change it to a hitbox
02:02 - instead of this and hide the hitbox with
02:06 - ghost effect so without further ado
02:11 - let's get on to the project
02:13 - so I already have a project right here
02:17 - that has all the sprites already so
02:22 - these are all the sprites you'll need so
02:24 - before I can continue on the code I
02:26 - would like you guys to hit the like
02:28 - button subscribe to our channel share
02:30 - our video and comment down in the
02:33 - comments below on what you think about
02:35 - this video so these are the sprites you
02:40 - need all these sprites are from the
02:43 - sprite library and scratch so you can
02:47 - just search them here and this one is
02:50 - just um a dress print this one paint
02:53 - spray paint spray so first we'll start
02:56 - out with the green button this one's
02:59 - supposed to trace the speed so when the
03:02 - sprite is clicked we one dragon if then
03:09 - statement so we'll need variables the
03:15 - speed points and ball is moving those
03:18 - are the three variables we will need
03:19 - okay
03:20 - so we'll need the greater than symbol so
03:26 - if the speed is greater than zero then
03:30 - any number over 0 then it will change
03:34 - the speed by - neck is zero point one
03:38 - change the speed so what this basically
03:41 - does is make the speed go down by zero
03:44 - point one every time you click the
03:45 - button and we'll need a one click so we
03:53 - can set the X and y position to this
03:56 - position and set the speed to 1 as the
04:01 - default speed to 1 as default so next
04:11 - we'll work on the stop button which is
04:13 - kind of like the thing that makes it um
04:16 - makes the speed go up so it'll take
04:19 - longer time so we'll need the one sprite
04:23 - clicks when sprite clicks right here
04:27 - if then statement great we need a less
04:31 - than symbol
04:32 - each time so if the speed is less than 2
04:36 - 2 is the maximum speed you can cope to
04:40 - there no change the speed by 0.1 so this
04:43 - button makes its peak go up and speed
04:46 - will make the Goldie transition slower
04:50 - so you need a 1 clicks let me fly click
04:54 - set the X and y position okay so now
05:00 - next we'll make the goal text we're here
05:04 - it's one it's a pause the video if you
05:07 - need time to write it out so you can
05:09 - rename this to full text so we will set
05:17 - the X and y position first on the click
05:21 - to go to this position and hide we'll
05:27 - need more code for this goal text later
05:29 - so now next we'll be working on the goal
05:35 - which is technically the hitbox I'm
05:37 - gonna troll the hitbox so I'm gonna make
05:47 - the hitbox for the goal
05:49 - [Music]
06:08 - okay so this should be good enough you
06:11 - could rename this to on hitbox hitbox
06:18 - the code for the hitbox really simple
06:20 - all you need is to go to this position
06:28 - and set the ghost effect to 100 what the
06:41 - ghost effect does is basically making
06:42 - this thing hide they're not really high
06:45 - because if you hide it won't detect
06:46 - anything so you have to set the ghost
06:49 - effect Oh subset that goes to 100 so it
06:54 - will disappear so if you play it the
07:01 - cool the hitbox is not there anymore
07:05 - so yeah and this is not the right
07:13 - position so let me change the X in my
07:15 - position of this okay now let's move on
07:23 - to the Goldie spring this sprite will
07:27 - need to custom blocks called one
07:29 - Tollbooth holy okay and you also need
07:39 - one more block of check ball so with
07:47 - check ball you first of all there's a
07:51 - move going to find the move of Goldie
07:53 - block first okay and we'll need a
07:56 - forever loop so what this basically does
07:59 - is just move the goalie randomly around
08:01 - this box right here this box okay so we
08:07 - need to get a glide speed speed is the
08:12 - variable of how fast or slow the goalie
08:15 - glides to the different place and pick
08:19 - random negative 85
08:23 - to 100 so that negative 85 to hundreds
08:30 - around this area into the box and then
08:34 - the Y picker in I'm reading 25 in 1850
08:43 - so this is move goal even announced to
08:47 - find the check ball function so you need
08:50 - a forever loop and you need it if then
08:55 - statement inside the forever loop saying
08:57 - if then it's touching the soccer ball
09:00 - which is the ball then we can broadcast
09:06 - a message called missed this is just to
09:15 - say that um if you hit if it the goalie
09:18 - touches the ball they'll broadcast a
09:20 - message called missed because you didn't
09:22 - make it to the goal your know when
09:24 - clicked go to this x and y position the
09:30 - goalie can go to the front layer and we
09:37 - need to call this the function roof
09:40 - goalie and we'll need another one click
09:43 - block call the function check ball the
09:49 - reason why we can't put check ball right
09:51 - here is because this is a forever loop
09:53 - so it will not call the check ball
09:55 - function so if you play this it will
09:58 - only play it will only play the this one
10:02 - and she just a one the default okay so
10:12 - now if you have to put this right here
10:15 - because if you put it down here it won't
10:17 - work so next we'll move on to the player
10:25 - player so for the player will need if
10:32 - the spacebar is pressed
10:35 - then if then ball moving ball is moving
10:42 - is equal to n which means no or you can
10:45 - write no balls moving ball is moving is
10:52 - equal to no then move ten steps so glide
10:56 - towards the goal then wait one second
11:04 - then we can broadcast a message called
11:07 - the kick kick and set the ball moving to
11:22 - Y because now the ball is colliding
11:24 - towards the goal and obviously it's
11:28 - moving set the x and y position off the
11:34 - player in the beginning it's in this
11:40 - position and then when clicked you know
11:43 - one clicked set the x and y position
11:49 - then set the hall to moving time no
11:52 - because in the beginning your ball is
11:55 - not moving to end next you want to do
12:05 - the movement left and right so go to
12:07 - events and drag in om left arrow key is
12:11 - pressed then I'll change the X by
12:16 - negative 10 so I'll move to the left
12:18 - side by negative 10 then we can
12:25 - duplicate this instead of just changes
12:28 - to right and change X by 10 now we need
12:37 - to go on to the Soccer Bowl
12:40 - so first we'll need to custom blocks for
12:44 - the soccer ball call one call set ball
12:47 - left set ball up and set ball right set
13:01 - ball right so you got to cussing blocks
13:04 - to find the left one first okay so good
13:09 - so you want it to go to x position and y
13:15 - position of X position of the player and
13:22 - Y position of the player so it will
13:26 - follow the player so player x position
13:32 - to have a player and y position the
13:37 - player Y position and we need to add 20
13:44 - so yeah add 20 Y position plus 20 then
13:56 - we'll need to we can duplicate this code
13:58 - oops
14:05 - but instead instead of this we need to
14:12 - add 25 for the x position we needed to
14:21 - add because you want it to follow the
14:23 - player and why this issue yep that seems
14:29 - right so this is an X in my position
14:32 - it took blocks we just defined now we
14:36 - have to call those functions so if the
14:38 - left arrow is pressed
14:47 - then if then statement if then the ball
14:52 - is moving is equal to no equal to n ball
15:00 - moving equal to n then set ball left so
15:06 - you call this function right here so if
15:09 - the what arrow is being pressed then you
15:13 - call this function right here then we
15:16 - can duplicate this code and right arrow
15:20 - is being pressed set ball and moving to
15:24 - know instead of calling the left one
15:25 - call the right one then we need a one
15:28 - clipped one flag click statement set the
15:36 - points to zero so the points will reset
15:39 - every game putting direction of zero and
15:42 - zero is upward so the so the ball will
15:48 - point upwards point direction of zero
15:56 - and go to this x and y position in the
16:02 - beginning okay now there's still some
16:09 - more code to the soccer ball so that's
16:11 - not all for the soccer ball so we'll
16:17 - need to receive the kick remember the
16:20 - kick one like hick it will point
16:24 - direction of zero
16:30 - pointing direction of zero yes then we
16:37 - need a repeat until touching the goal or
16:39 - goalie so the ball will keep on gliding
16:41 - until either such as the hitbox which is
16:45 - the gold technically and or touching the
16:49 - goalie
16:49 - okay so repeat until touching you need a
16:56 - or Steven operator touching gold hitbox
17:08 - touching the hitbox or touching the
17:13 - goalie then we'll need to move two steps
17:16 - so move it will move out a little bit if
17:23 - then if then is touching the goalie if
17:27 - then touching the goalie touching cool
17:34 - so if it's touching the goalie then
17:36 - broadcast goal and wait this this goal
17:45 - would broadcast to the coal tag so it
17:47 - will say you school if it if it's
17:55 - touching the hitbox right now you have
17:59 - to put this sir next you'll need to if
18:05 - it's touching the hitbox then go and you
18:11 - also need to add stop this script at the
18:15 - end of this so we won't keep on running
18:22 - so when this receives goal I'll let you
18:27 - seal the code so if you need to copy
18:28 - something down then you can do it right
18:31 - now
18:32 - then if you receive the goal the goal
18:38 - goal the goal message then
18:43 - each points by one because point the
18:47 - score will go up every single time you
18:49 - hit the hitbox point on set ball is
18:54 - moving to no post it's not moving
18:55 - anymore once it hits the goal wait two
19:01 - seconds and then call the function call
19:07 - the function set ball up again you can
19:11 - duplicate this and change the receive to
19:15 - miss change and take out the points
19:18 - because you don't score if you miss
19:20 - change it to n yeah that's right you can
19:24 - wait two seconds and set ball like it
19:30 - it's missed so now you can actually
19:35 - decree this two one one second if you'd
19:37 - like next we finally have more more for
19:43 - the goalie sprite a little bit more for
19:48 - the goalie so for the goalie if it
19:51 - receives Miss then stop other scripts in
19:57 - the sprite because he miss and it won't
20:00 - move anymore
20:01 - stopped other scripts in this bright
20:05 - then you can say say for like one second
20:11 - you missed you missed you guys and then
20:22 - you can broadcast a message and wait
20:29 - called start again
20:37 - start again
20:39 - um and then when you receive start again
20:46 - there you start again then it will check
20:51 - ball it will call this function of check
20:56 - ball if the soccer ball touches the
20:59 - goalie okay so now you need to receive
21:06 - another broadcast message when I receive
21:08 - gold then stop other scripts in the
21:13 - sprite so even if you make it then
21:16 - you'll also stop other scripts in the
21:17 - sprite and wait one second give it a
21:25 - little pause and you can start again
21:29 - drop test start again and wait start
21:33 - again
21:34 - it was so good and then when you receive
21:39 - start again they move the goalie use
21:46 - call the function neuticle so it will
21:49 - start moving again okay and one last
21:54 - chunk of code for the soccer ball so
21:57 - when I receive start again when I
22:03 - receive start again start again set ball
22:10 - left
22:12 - call the function set bola okay and last
22:16 - but not least we have more code for the
22:18 - context for the goalie we have this code
22:24 - when you make a goal merci cool yo show
22:32 - you can like wait two seconds then
22:34 - behind again wait two seconds and hi
22:41 - so this pretty much sums up the game so
22:44 - I'll play it one time for you guys so
22:46 - he's at your speed right now so if you
22:48 - want to increase the speed so there's an
22:54 - error right here instead of this you
22:57 - have to put a less than symbol I found
23:00 - out my mistake less than symbol speed is
23:03 - less than 2 then I'll change Europe
23:06 - advise 4.1 max speed you can go up to is
23:09 - 2 so if you try it now so if you try it
23:14 - now now he's at default speed which is 1
23:22 - but I thought I press subtract so well
23:33 - suppose he went sprite click see when
23:38 - you do it the next day you don't
23:39 - remember much
23:48 - so now if you try it and you shoot it
23:52 - says you missed and you can decrease the
23:56 - speed at the time so now he's really
23:59 - fast he waits very fast so it's harder
24:03 - if you decrease the speed but it's
24:05 - easier if you increase the speed so
24:07 - let's say I increase the speed see house
24:11 - see house house slow slow he goes he
24:15 - goes much slower than the one see if he
24:19 - put on one he goes a bit faster if you
24:22 - put it on 0.1 it's even faster and if
24:26 - you try to shoot it and you make it it
24:30 - was like goal up here as you can see so
24:34 - that pretty much sums up the video thank
24:37 - you guys for watching and please like
24:39 - share and subscribe to this channel and
24:42 - comment down in the comments below of
24:44 - what you think about this video thank
24:47 - you for watching

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding lagron and another video to the sequence of future and projects from kids like you so this is a project Jalen my cousin submitted to us it's called soccer shootout so that one of the game is to shoot this ball into the goal without the goalie blocking it so we'll be learning these following concepts today and stretch custom blocks broadcasting messages using brain operator touching sprites when key pressed and hit boxes so let's demo his game so when you shoot you press the spacebar the ball will go into the goal and I'll say goal up here and you can move him there are some things you can improve them because whenever you shoot a goal and you move the ball will move with you and you don't want that and there's also these two buttons are here which you can use the increase and decrease the speed of the golden wait time if you do this they'll increase the speed by 7 so now we'll wait 7 seconds before moving to this next spot and if you click this they'll decrease it so next I'll move every 1 second so see now it's faster moving to its next spot and instead of instead of gliding instead of moving to the x + y position we can use gliding to make the game more smoothly run more smoothly so there's also this goal we can also change it to a hitbox instead of this and hide the hitbox with ghost effect so without further ado let's get on to the project so I already have a project right here that has all the sprites already so these are all the sprites you'll need so before I can continue on the code I would like you guys to hit the like button subscribe to our channel share our video and comment down in the comments below on what you think about this video so these are the sprites you need all these sprites are from the sprite library and scratch so you can just search them here and this one is just um a dress print this one paint spray paint spray so first we'll start out with the green button this one's supposed to trace the speed so when the sprite is clicked we one dragon if then statement so we'll need variables the speed points and ball is moving those are the three variables we will need okay so we'll need the greater than symbol so if the speed is greater than zero then any number over 0 then it will change the speed by neck is zero point one change the speed so what this basically does is make the speed go down by zero point one every time you click the button and we'll need a one click so we can set the X and y position to this position and set the speed to 1 as the default speed to 1 as default so next we'll work on the stop button which is kind of like the thing that makes it um makes the speed go up so it'll take longer time so we'll need the one sprite clicks when sprite clicks right here if then statement great we need a less than symbol each time so if the speed is less than 2 2 is the maximum speed you can cope to there no change the speed by 0.1 so this button makes its peak go up and speed will make the Goldie transition slower so you need a 1 clicks let me fly click set the X and y position okay so now next we'll make the goal text we're here it's one it's a pause the video if you need time to write it out so you can rename this to full text so we will set the X and y position first on the click to go to this position and hide we'll need more code for this goal text later so now next we'll be working on the goal which is technically the hitbox I'm gonna troll the hitbox so I'm gonna make the hitbox for the goal okay so this should be good enough you could rename this to on hitbox hitbox the code for the hitbox really simple all you need is to go to this position and set the ghost effect to 100 what the ghost effect does is basically making this thing hide they're not really high because if you hide it won't detect anything so you have to set the ghost effect Oh subset that goes to 100 so it will disappear so if you play it the cool the hitbox is not there anymore so yeah and this is not the right position so let me change the X in my position of this okay now let's move on to the Goldie spring this sprite will need to custom blocks called one Tollbooth holy okay and you also need one more block of check ball so with check ball you first of all there's a move going to find the move of Goldie block first okay and we'll need a forever loop so what this basically does is just move the goalie randomly around this box right here this box okay so we need to get a glide speed speed is the variable of how fast or slow the goalie glides to the different place and pick random negative 85 to 100 so that negative 85 to hundreds around this area into the box and then the Y picker in I'm reading 25 in 1850 so this is move goal even announced to find the check ball function so you need a forever loop and you need it if then statement inside the forever loop saying if then it's touching the soccer ball which is the ball then we can broadcast a message called missed this is just to say that um if you hit if it the goalie touches the ball they'll broadcast a message called missed because you didn't make it to the goal your know when clicked go to this x and y position the goalie can go to the front layer and we need to call this the function roof goalie and we'll need another one click block call the function check ball the reason why we can't put check ball right here is because this is a forever loop so it will not call the check ball function so if you play this it will only play it will only play the this one and she just a one the default okay so now if you have to put this right here because if you put it down here it won't work so next we'll move on to the player player so for the player will need if the spacebar is pressed then if then ball moving ball is moving is equal to n which means no or you can write no balls moving ball is moving is equal to no then move ten steps so glide towards the goal then wait one second then we can broadcast a message called the kick kick and set the ball moving to Y because now the ball is colliding towards the goal and obviously it's moving set the x and y position off the player in the beginning it's in this position and then when clicked you know one clicked set the x and y position then set the hall to moving time no because in the beginning your ball is not moving to end next you want to do the movement left and right so go to events and drag in om left arrow key is pressed then I'll change the X by negative 10 so I'll move to the left side by negative 10 then we can duplicate this instead of just changes to right and change X by 10 now we need to go on to the Soccer Bowl so first we'll need to custom blocks for the soccer ball call one call set ball left set ball up and set ball right set ball right so you got to cussing blocks to find the left one first okay so good so you want it to go to x position and y position of X position of the player and Y position of the player so it will follow the player so player x position to have a player and y position the player Y position and we need to add 20 so yeah add 20 Y position plus 20 then we'll need to we can duplicate this code oops but instead instead of this we need to add 25 for the x position we needed to add because you want it to follow the player and why this issue yep that seems right so this is an X in my position it took blocks we just defined now we have to call those functions so if the left arrow is pressed then if then statement if then the ball is moving is equal to no equal to n ball moving equal to n then set ball left so you call this function right here so if the what arrow is being pressed then you call this function right here then we can duplicate this code and right arrow is being pressed set ball and moving to know instead of calling the left one call the right one then we need a one clipped one flag click statement set the points to zero so the points will reset every game putting direction of zero and zero is upward so the so the ball will point upwards point direction of zero and go to this x and y position in the beginning okay now there's still some more code to the soccer ball so that's not all for the soccer ball so we'll need to receive the kick remember the kick one like hick it will point direction of zero pointing direction of zero yes then we need a repeat until touching the goal or goalie so the ball will keep on gliding until either such as the hitbox which is the gold technically and or touching the goalie okay so repeat until touching you need a or Steven operator touching gold hitbox touching the hitbox or touching the goalie then we'll need to move two steps so move it will move out a little bit if then if then is touching the goalie if then touching the goalie touching cool so if it's touching the goalie then broadcast goal and wait this this goal would broadcast to the coal tag so it will say you school if it if it's touching the hitbox right now you have to put this sir next you'll need to if it's touching the hitbox then go and you also need to add stop this script at the end of this so we won't keep on running so when this receives goal I'll let you seal the code so if you need to copy something down then you can do it right now then if you receive the goal the goal goal the goal message then each points by one because point the score will go up every single time you hit the hitbox point on set ball is moving to no post it's not moving anymore once it hits the goal wait two seconds and then call the function call the function set ball up again you can duplicate this and change the receive to miss change and take out the points because you don't score if you miss change it to n yeah that's right you can wait two seconds and set ball like it it's missed so now you can actually decree this two one one second if you'd like next we finally have more more for the goalie sprite a little bit more for the goalie so for the goalie if it receives Miss then stop other scripts in the sprite because he miss and it won't move anymore stopped other scripts in this bright then you can say say for like one second you missed you missed you guys and then you can broadcast a message and wait called start again start again um and then when you receive start again there you start again then it will check ball it will call this function of check ball if the soccer ball touches the goalie okay so now you need to receive another broadcast message when I receive gold then stop other scripts in the sprite so even if you make it then you'll also stop other scripts in the sprite and wait one second give it a little pause and you can start again drop test start again and wait start again it was so good and then when you receive start again they move the goalie use call the function neuticle so it will start moving again okay and one last chunk of code for the soccer ball so when I receive start again when I receive start again start again set ball left call the function set bola okay and last but not least we have more code for the context for the goalie we have this code when you make a goal merci cool yo show you can like wait two seconds then behind again wait two seconds and hi so this pretty much sums up the game so I'll play it one time for you guys so he's at your speed right now so if you want to increase the speed so there's an error right here instead of this you have to put a less than symbol I found out my mistake less than symbol speed is less than 2 then I'll change Europe advise 4.1 max speed you can go up to is 2 so if you try it now so if you try it now now he's at default speed which is 1 but I thought I press subtract so well suppose he went sprite click see when you do it the next day you don't remember much so now if you try it and you shoot it says you missed and you can decrease the speed at the time so now he's really fast he waits very fast so it's harder if you decrease the speed but it's easier if you increase the speed so let's say I increase the speed see house see house house slow slow he goes he goes much slower than the one see if he put on one he goes a bit faster if you put it on 0.1 it's even faster and if you try to shoot it and you make it it was like goal up here as you can see so that pretty much sums up the
