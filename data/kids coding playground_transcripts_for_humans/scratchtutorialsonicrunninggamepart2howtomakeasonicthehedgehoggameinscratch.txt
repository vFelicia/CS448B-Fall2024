00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys to the kids coding
00:08 - playground here and today we'll be doing
00:10 - the part two
00:11 - of the sonic series so this is the sonic
00:13 - game we've been working on in the last
00:15 - tutorial so
00:17 - we have all the running walking
00:19 - down arrow up air jumping all the like
00:22 - movement
00:23 - done in the last video so here's our
00:25 - second part of this tutorial so first i
00:28 - forgot to rename this project actually
00:30 - so my name is sonic runner game i guess
00:33 - runner
00:34 - runner game so
00:36 - here we're gonna name it and then this
00:38 - is what we had from last time
00:40 - so if you missed anything or something's
00:42 - not working here's the time to do it
00:44 - you can pause the video if you want
00:46 - and then next let's work on the
00:48 - backdrops so we have the background one
00:50 - two so we're going to make it start
00:51 - scrolling so courtesy to scratch team
00:54 - for showing how to do this it's really
00:55 - simple so i'll just show you guys right
00:57 - now so
00:58 - when we fly clicked we're just gonna go
01:00 - to the back layer
01:03 - go to back layer
01:05 - and then we're gonna go to zero zero uh
01:08 - go to the x
01:10 - zero y zero so this is the first
01:12 - backdrop so we're gonna make it go to
01:13 - the middle
01:14 - and then we're gonna get a forever loop
01:17 - forever we're gonna change the x my name
01:19 - before so we're gonna make the backdrop
01:21 - move to the left because it'll simulate
01:24 - as the player is moving so see the
01:26 - background will move to the left that
01:27 - means the player is moving to the right
01:29 - so we're going to change the x by
01:31 - negative four
01:33 - negative four okay
01:35 - put that right there and then we're
01:36 - gonna
01:38 - if if uh the exposition is less than
01:43 - negative one 460 sorry so basically
01:46 - we're going to make it scroll all the
01:48 - way to negative 460 which is somewhere
01:50 - on the far left so if the x position is
01:52 - less than that then we're gonna move the
01:55 - backdrop back to its position so we're
01:57 - gonna move it to 460 zero which is all
02:00 - the way in the far right so we want to
02:02 - make it in like a continuous pattern
02:04 - where this one gets here this other
02:06 - backdrop will get here so it's kind of
02:08 - like scrolling in a pattern so and then
02:10 - we're going to go to the exposition of
02:12 - 460
02:14 - to and y0 and then we're going to do the
02:15 - next costume so then it will switch the
02:18 - costume to the other costume so we'll
02:19 - have some more variety to the background
02:22 - so here's our first part of code and
02:23 - then we're just going to drag and drop
02:24 - this into the second backdrop
02:26 - it's not completely the same so we're
02:28 - going to have to change some of the code
02:30 - so right here we have the x is going to
02:32 - be 460 so we're going to make this first
02:34 - backdrop start in the middle and this
02:36 - one's going to start on the far right so
02:38 - when this one is finished scrolling all
02:39 - the way to the far left this one will be
02:41 - in the middle
02:42 - so it's kind of in a pattern and then
02:44 - right here x is negative 4 x matrix is
02:46 - less than negative 40. 460 goes to this
02:49 - position so that's all
02:50 - that is except for this just change the
02:52 - x position to 460.
02:54 - so now we have the two backdrops they
02:56 - can scroll so let's save the project as
02:59 - you can see the backdrop was scrolling
03:01 - it actually looks like sonic is moving
03:02 - now so yeah there we have our simple
03:05 - scrolling backdrop
03:07 - it's
03:08 - uh much more simple than other scrolling
03:09 - backdrop tutorials i've seen like from
03:11 - griff patch but this is just a simple
03:13 - one
03:14 - just keep it simple
03:15 - next let's hop into our trap sprites so
03:18 - here we have the trap sprite we're gonna
03:20 - do a
03:21 - when i receive the message reset
03:24 - um so what we're gonna do is make it
03:26 - easier as the player progresses
03:29 - usually it's supposed to be the other
03:30 - way around we're doing it like that
03:31 - because we want it to be easier to get
03:34 - higher score in this game so we're going
03:35 - to make it like so spikes and traps will
03:38 - appear less often as you go further into
03:40 - the game
03:41 - so we're going to go to so the player
03:43 - will have more playing time obviously so
03:46 - we'll go to s 200 y negative 110 and
03:48 - then we're going to go hide
03:50 - so in the beginnings that hide and then
03:52 - forever
03:53 - forever loop we are going to
03:55 - if else so this is the part where we
03:57 - show
03:58 - the spikes so if the score is greater
04:00 - than 100 so basically after it's past
04:03 - 100
04:04 - the spikes and traps will start showing
04:07 - less often so
04:08 - score is greater than 100 then we'll
04:10 - wait
04:12 - i'm gonna wait five to eight seconds
04:17 - five to eight seconds
04:19 - and then else we're gonna wait one to
04:21 - three seconds so in the early game you
04:22 - will have to face a lot of spikes
04:25 - and
04:26 - we're going to create clone of myself so
04:28 - we're going to be using clones create
04:29 - clone myself
04:31 - and then when i receive reset
04:34 - we're going to delete this clone so
04:35 - we're going to delete this clone so
04:37 - we're going to delete all the previous
04:38 - clones before creating new ones
04:40 - and then when i start
04:43 - as a clone right here
04:45 - then we're going to show
04:48 - and then we're going to switch costume
04:49 - to pick random one to three
04:51 - as you can see we have three costumes
04:53 - let me like put this code in i'll show
04:55 - you so
04:57 - one two three so inside here you can see
04:58 - we have the spike saw and the spike head
05:01 - three costumes we're gonna pick random
05:03 - which one show up
05:04 - and then we're gonna repeat
05:07 - uh repeat until
05:11 - x position is less than negative 220
05:13 - which is near the left so we're gonna do
05:17 - uh
05:18 - repeat until what x position is less
05:20 - than negative 220.
05:24 - if it is then we're going to change the
05:26 - oops man and we're going to change that
05:28 - x by negative 6
05:30 - and then we're going to delete this
05:32 - clone when it gets to the edge so we're
05:34 - doing negative 6 because you see the
05:35 - backdrop is scrolling by negative four
05:38 - so we have to do negative six or else
05:40 - the spikes and traps will not appear to
05:42 - move so as you can see if we put
05:43 - negative two it will not move at all
05:45 - it'll look
05:47 - like it's not moving at all so you see
05:48 - it's actually moving
05:50 - at oh like towards you
05:52 - but like really slow
05:54 - so it doesn't look good at all so we're
05:56 - gonna have to do negative six which is
05:58 - more
05:59 - than what the backdrop is scrolling at
06:00 - the backdrop is scrolling at negative
06:02 - four so we want to make it negative six
06:04 - so i'll show you guys now
06:08 - so as you can see the spikes are
06:10 - scrolling at much faster rate and it
06:12 - looks much better
06:13 - okay so now let's work on our bullet
06:15 - bill
06:16 - so our bullet bill the code is quite
06:18 - similar except it's higher in the error
06:20 - and it'll probably move quicker
06:22 - so
06:23 - uh we're just going to drag this code in
06:26 - and then i'll switch it up a little so
06:28 - we have the reset
06:29 - code so right here instead we're going
06:31 - to go to the x 214 wide negative 25
06:34 - so we're going to get 214
06:37 - and the y is negative 25.
06:40 - so
06:40 - uh you can adjust your bullet bill
06:42 - accordingly to however high your sonic
06:45 - is
06:46 - because we want it to make the bullet
06:47 - bill he had sonic if he's not ducking so
06:49 - only if he's ducking he'll avoid bullet
06:51 - bill so here this this is the coordinate
06:53 - i got and then right here forever we're
06:56 - going to get an if then statement so if
06:58 - um score is greater than 100 we're going
07:00 - gonna wait pick a random let's do two to
07:03 - five um i'm just gonna do this number i
07:06 - don't
07:07 - this i don't think i had this in my old
07:08 - game but i think we'll just do two to
07:11 - five that sounds pretty reasonable and
07:12 - then we're gonna
07:14 - create a clone of myself
07:16 - and then we're going to do when i
07:18 - receive reset we're going to delete all
07:20 - the previous clips as well so we're
07:22 - going to do that
07:23 - and next we're going to do a when i
07:25 - start us clone we are going to
07:28 - show show the bullet bill and then
07:31 - repeat until the exposition is less than
07:33 - negative 220 same as the other one so
07:35 - we're going to repeat until
07:38 - x is less than negative 220 so
07:44 - x position less than negative 220
07:46 - then we're going to
07:48 - change the x by negative eight so as you
07:50 - can see the drops are negative six this
07:52 - one is going to be negative eight
07:53 - because we want to make the bullets go
07:55 - faster so we're going to change the x by
07:57 - negative eight
08:00 - and then next we're going to delete this
08:01 - clone
08:02 - and there we have all our code with the
08:04 - bullet build so let's save it
08:07 - i'll show you
08:08 - so
08:09 - right here we have the
08:10 - traps just wait for the bullet bill yeah
08:13 - sometimes like you see the
08:14 - uh trap and the bullet bill come at the
08:16 - same time there's not really any way you
08:18 - can like prevent that from happening
08:20 - besides making the traps show less
08:23 - and the bulls show more
08:25 - um there probably is a way but like
08:27 - we'll just have to think about it so
08:29 - this game definitely needs like some
08:31 - fine tuning but if you can
08:33 - do that this game would work really well
08:35 - so i'll show you guys the bullet bill
08:38 - so jump over this
08:41 - show you guys a duck under oh no i died
08:43 - from it
08:44 - but like basically the point is that
08:46 - you're supposed to duck under the
08:47 - bulkhead let's see
08:48 - as you can see you don't get killed by
08:50 - the bullet bill if you duck but in
08:52 - theory if you
08:53 - just stay like this
08:55 - a bullet bill should be able to kill you
08:57 - and sometimes another bug in this game
08:59 - is like when you die
09:01 - um you know how you spawn you'll
09:02 - instantly be able to jump up there
09:04 - that's not really much of a problem
09:07 - but you can fix it by maybe putting a
09:09 - little delay
09:11 - okay so
09:12 - i guess that's pretty much it for the
09:14 - bullet bill i just want to show you guys
09:16 - that
09:17 - to make sure that you die if you don't
09:19 - duck so
09:21 - yes you die you lose all your score
09:23 - so your score like goes back to zero if
09:25 - you die in this game
09:27 - okay
09:28 - so next let's go to the ring so inside
09:30 - our ring
09:31 - we're going to
09:32 - when i receive the message reset we can
09:35 - just drag and drop this code in
09:38 - and
09:39 - in here we're just going to change some
09:41 - of the positions x is going to be 200
09:43 - y 185 we're going to hide it forever
09:47 - we're not even going to do the score
09:48 - thing we're just going to put this in
09:49 - and then we'll be five to eight how does
09:51 - that
09:52 - five to eight seconds
09:54 - it's not as common
09:55 - but these will give you 500 scores if
09:57 - you're able to collect them
09:59 - then wait until when i receive reset
10:02 - we're going to delete this clone
10:05 - and then we're going to get i want to
10:06 - receive a star music one when i start as
10:08 - a clone sorry we're going to show
10:11 - and then we're going to switch costume
10:13 - to pick around one to two so you know we
10:15 - have the heart and the um ring both in
10:19 - the same costume so one to two
10:21 - and then we're just going to repeat
10:23 - until
10:24 - x position is
10:25 - great uh less than negative 220 sorry
10:28 - or we're gonna have an or or if it's
10:30 - touching the sonic so we're going to do
10:32 - 2 negative 220
10:34 - so if the x position is
10:36 - less than negative 220
10:38 - or it's touching sonic
10:41 - so if it's touching sonic as well then
10:43 - we will
10:44 - change the x by negative 10. so
10:46 - basically the rings are going to move
10:47 - the quickest they can move at negative
10:49 - 10.
10:51 - so we're going to repeat until it's
10:53 - touching either of those and then if it
10:55 - does if it's touching sonic
10:58 - then we are going to
11:00 - uh
11:02 - if it's touching the sonic let me get
11:04 - that
11:05 - touching sonic then we're going to
11:07 - change the score by 500
11:09 - so it's going to give them this
11:10 - a score boost
11:12 - the wrong one
11:14 - score and then we'll do 500
11:17 - and then we're going to delete this
11:18 - clone once it has been collected or it
11:20 - touches the edge
11:23 - so here we have our heart and ring code
11:27 - so
11:28 - one last thing we can go back to our
11:30 - sonic and then we can add a high score
11:33 - tracker thing so here inside this code
11:36 - right here when green fly clicked we can
11:37 - add a high score tracker thing so this
11:40 - is gonna like
11:42 - show the high score and stuff so we're
11:43 - gonna have to make a cloud variable so
11:45 - it'll save on the cloud
11:47 - so we're gonna make it cloud variables
11:49 - it's stored i'm gonna name it high score
11:53 - high score and then we have a high score
11:56 - variable right here so we're going to do
11:57 - a forever loop you have it right there
11:59 - this is really simple code if
12:02 - the score is greater than high score so
12:04 - if the score you have is greater than
12:05 - the high score
12:08 - then we will set the high score variable
12:11 - to the scores variable so
12:13 - here we have
12:14 - a simple high score script
12:16 - and there you go there's our project
12:18 - so let's hide the fall speed sprite on
12:21 - variable and then let's put the high
12:22 - scores one like right here i guess
12:26 - i don't know like that okay so let's
12:27 - save the project
12:29 - i'll just demonstrate it so
12:31 - jump
12:32 - you can jump over the obstacles duh it
12:35 - works
12:36 - you see the score scores increasing with
12:37 - the high score this is the only score we
12:39 - have
12:42 - tucking it under the bullet bills
12:45 - we're pretty lucky with the amount of
12:47 - spawns we're having we're not having too
12:48 - much oh there so now we're dead
12:50 - so see as you can see our high score is
12:53 - set to 561 which i believe is what i got
12:56 - so
12:57 - that's it for today's tutorial this is
12:59 - the second part for our
13:01 - sonic runner game
13:03 - so don't forget to like share and
13:05 - subscribe and ring the notification bell
13:07 - and i will see you guys in the next
13:08 - video
13:10 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys to the kids coding playground here and today we'll be doing the part two of the sonic series so this is the sonic game we've been working on in the last tutorial so we have all the running walking down arrow up air jumping all the like movement done in the last video so here's our second part of this tutorial so first i forgot to rename this project actually so my name is sonic runner game i guess runner runner game so here we're gonna name it and then this is what we had from last time so if you missed anything or something's not working here's the time to do it you can pause the video if you want and then next let's work on the backdrops so we have the background one two so we're going to make it start scrolling so courtesy to scratch team for showing how to do this it's really simple so i'll just show you guys right now so when we fly clicked we're just gonna go to the back layer go to back layer and then we're gonna go to zero zero uh go to the x zero y zero so this is the first backdrop so we're gonna make it go to the middle and then we're gonna get a forever loop forever we're gonna change the x my name before so we're gonna make the backdrop move to the left because it'll simulate as the player is moving so see the background will move to the left that means the player is moving to the right so we're going to change the x by negative four negative four okay put that right there and then we're gonna if if uh the exposition is less than negative one 460 sorry so basically we're going to make it scroll all the way to negative 460 which is somewhere on the far left so if the x position is less than that then we're gonna move the backdrop back to its position so we're gonna move it to 460 zero which is all the way in the far right so we want to make it in like a continuous pattern where this one gets here this other backdrop will get here so it's kind of like scrolling in a pattern so and then we're going to go to the exposition of 460 to and y0 and then we're going to do the next costume so then it will switch the costume to the other costume so we'll have some more variety to the background so here's our first part of code and then we're just going to drag and drop this into the second backdrop it's not completely the same so we're going to have to change some of the code so right here we have the x is going to be 460 so we're going to make this first backdrop start in the middle and this one's going to start on the far right so when this one is finished scrolling all the way to the far left this one will be in the middle so it's kind of in a pattern and then right here x is negative 4 x matrix is less than negative 40. 460 goes to this position so that's all that is except for this just change the x position to 460. so now we have the two backdrops they can scroll so let's save the project as you can see the backdrop was scrolling it actually looks like sonic is moving now so yeah there we have our simple scrolling backdrop it's uh much more simple than other scrolling backdrop tutorials i've seen like from griff patch but this is just a simple one just keep it simple next let's hop into our trap sprites so here we have the trap sprite we're gonna do a when i receive the message reset um so what we're gonna do is make it easier as the player progresses usually it's supposed to be the other way around we're doing it like that because we want it to be easier to get higher score in this game so we're going to make it like so spikes and traps will appear less often as you go further into the game so we're going to go to so the player will have more playing time obviously so we'll go to s 200 y negative 110 and then we're going to go hide so in the beginnings that hide and then forever forever loop we are going to if else so this is the part where we show the spikes so if the score is greater than 100 so basically after it's past 100 the spikes and traps will start showing less often so score is greater than 100 then we'll wait i'm gonna wait five to eight seconds five to eight seconds and then else we're gonna wait one to three seconds so in the early game you will have to face a lot of spikes and we're going to create clone of myself so we're going to be using clones create clone myself and then when i receive reset we're going to delete this clone so we're going to delete this clone so we're going to delete all the previous clones before creating new ones and then when i start as a clone right here then we're going to show and then we're going to switch costume to pick random one to three as you can see we have three costumes let me like put this code in i'll show you so one two three so inside here you can see we have the spike saw and the spike head three costumes we're gonna pick random which one show up and then we're gonna repeat uh repeat until x position is less than negative 220 which is near the left so we're gonna do uh repeat until what x position is less than negative 220. if it is then we're going to change the oops man and we're going to change that x by negative 6 and then we're going to delete this clone when it gets to the edge so we're doing negative 6 because you see the backdrop is scrolling by negative four so we have to do negative six or else the spikes and traps will not appear to move so as you can see if we put negative two it will not move at all it'll look like it's not moving at all so you see it's actually moving at oh like towards you but like really slow so it doesn't look good at all so we're gonna have to do negative six which is more than what the backdrop is scrolling at the backdrop is scrolling at negative four so we want to make it negative six so i'll show you guys now so as you can see the spikes are scrolling at much faster rate and it looks much better okay so now let's work on our bullet bill so our bullet bill the code is quite similar except it's higher in the error and it'll probably move quicker so uh we're just going to drag this code in and then i'll switch it up a little so we have the reset code so right here instead we're going to go to the x 214 wide negative 25 so we're going to get 214 and the y is negative 25. so uh you can adjust your bullet bill accordingly to however high your sonic is because we want it to make the bullet bill he had sonic if he's not ducking so only if he's ducking he'll avoid bullet bill so here this this is the coordinate i got and then right here forever we're going to get an if then statement so if um score is greater than 100 we're going gonna wait pick a random let's do two to five um i'm just gonna do this number i don't this i don't think i had this in my old game but i think we'll just do two to five that sounds pretty reasonable and then we're gonna create a clone of myself and then we're going to do when i receive reset we're going to delete all the previous clips as well so we're going to do that and next we're going to do a when i start us clone we are going to show show the bullet bill and then repeat until the exposition is less than negative 220 same as the other one so we're going to repeat until x is less than negative 220 so x position less than negative 220 then we're going to change the x by negative eight so as you can see the drops are negative six this one is going to be negative eight because we want to make the bullets go faster so we're going to change the x by negative eight and then next we're going to delete this clone and there we have all our code with the bullet build so let's save it i'll show you so right here we have the traps just wait for the bullet bill yeah sometimes like you see the uh trap and the bullet bill come at the same time there's not really any way you can like prevent that from happening besides making the traps show less and the bulls show more um there probably is a way but like we'll just have to think about it so this game definitely needs like some fine tuning but if you can do that this game would work really well so i'll show you guys the bullet bill so jump over this show you guys a duck under oh no i died from it but like basically the point is that you're supposed to duck under the bulkhead let's see as you can see you don't get killed by the bullet bill if you duck but in theory if you just stay like this a bullet bill should be able to kill you and sometimes another bug in this game is like when you die um you know how you spawn you'll instantly be able to jump up there that's not really much of a problem but you can fix it by maybe putting a little delay okay so i guess that's pretty much it for the bullet bill i just want to show you guys that to make sure that you die if you don't duck so yes you die you lose all your score so your score like goes back to zero if you die in this game okay so next let's go to the ring so inside our ring we're going to when i receive the message reset we can just drag and drop this code in and in here we're just going to change some of the positions x is going to be 200 y 185 we're going to hide it forever we're not even going to do the score thing we're just going to put this in and then we'll be five to eight how does that five to eight seconds it's not as common but these will give you 500 scores if you're able to collect them then wait until when i receive reset we're going to delete this clone and then we're going to get i want to receive a star music one when i start as a clone sorry we're going to show and then we're going to switch costume to pick around one to two so you know we have the heart and the um ring both in the same costume so one to two and then we're just going to repeat until x position is great uh less than negative 220 sorry or we're gonna have an or or if it's touching the sonic so we're going to do 2 negative 220 so if the x position is less than negative 220 or it's touching sonic so if it's touching sonic as well then we will change the x by negative 10. so basically the rings are going to move the quickest they can move at negative 10. so we're going to repeat until it's touching either of those and then if it does if it's touching sonic then we are going to uh if it's touching the sonic let me get that touching sonic then we're going to change the score by 500 so it's going to give them this a score boost the wrong one score and then we'll do 500 and then we're going to delete this clone once it has been collected or it touches the edge so here we have our heart and ring code so one last thing we can go back to our sonic and then we can add a high score tracker thing so here inside this code right here when green fly clicked we can add a high score tracker thing so this is gonna like show the high score and stuff so we're gonna have to make a cloud variable so it'll save on the cloud so we're gonna make it cloud variables it's stored i'm gonna name it high score high score and then we have a high score variable right here so we're going to do a forever loop you have it right there this is really simple code if the score is greater than high score so if the score you have is greater than the high score then we will set the high score variable to the scores variable so here we have a simple high score script and there you go there's our project so let's hide the fall speed sprite on variable and then let's put the high scores one like right here i guess i don't know like that okay so let's save the project i'll just demonstrate it so jump you can jump over the obstacles duh it works you see the score scores increasing with the high score this is the only score we have tucking it under the bullet bills we're pretty lucky with the amount of spawns we're having we're not having too much oh there so now we're dead so see as you can see our high score is set to 561 which i believe is what i got so that's it for today's tutorial this is the second part for our sonic runner game so don't forget to like share and subscribe and ring the notification bell and i will see you guys in the next video
