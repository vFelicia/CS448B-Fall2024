00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kid playground
00:08 - here and today we're back with another
00:09 - video in scratch and today we'll be
00:11 - making the fifth part of the hero war
00:13 - game so if you have not checked out the
00:15 - first four parts go check that out on
00:17 - our Channel and that'll just get us to
00:20 - where we are right now so today we're
00:23 - going to try to work on the Speedy enemy
00:24 - and the armored enemy and maybe the
00:28 - boss the speedy is fairly simple just
00:31 - drag all the code right into
00:34 - here and then we'll just alter it as
00:38 - needed so just like
00:40 - that so the first change that we're
00:42 - going to make is make this weight pick
00:45 - random to to 4 seconds so it spawns
00:48 - slower and then it'll set zombie HP to
00:51 - 100 but we're actually going to rename
00:53 - this zombie HP cuz it's only for the
00:56 - this zombie HP right here is only for
00:59 - the Speedy enemy so to not get confused
01:01 - we're going to change it to Speedy enemy
01:03 - it's a speedy
01:05 - HP just like
01:07 - that and then it'll set speed HP to 100
01:10 - and all
01:12 - that
01:14 - okay so uh when I start as a clone
01:17 - instead of moving two steps I move six
01:19 - steps because it's a fast
01:20 - enemy so we're going to uh change the
01:23 - code a little bit here so if it touches
01:25 - any type of projectile let's delete that
01:27 - touches any type of projectile then it
01:30 - will broadcast delete Arrow so let's
01:32 - just throw this all the
01:35 - way broadcast delete Arrow change score
01:39 - by one and then delete this
01:42 - clone and then since we have any type of
01:44 - projectile we can go throw all of this
01:47 - away you see hero selected two hero
01:49 - selected three you can all
01:51 - go and now we're going to work on the
01:53 - first ability here one it will change
01:56 - score by one and delete this clone uh if
01:59 - it's touching the second ability which
02:00 - is the death Arrow it'll change score by
02:02 - one it broadcast delete arrow and delete
02:05 - this clone then if it's searching the
02:07 - first ability and hero selected is equal
02:09 - to two uh that's just the um teleport so
02:13 - same
02:15 - code and if it's touching the second
02:19 - ability and hero selected is equal to
02:21 - two it'll also die by the lightning no
02:23 - matter what so we're just going to
02:25 - change that change score by one
02:30 - so when it's touching the apprentices
02:32 - star we don't need any of that we just
02:35 - don't need that either it'll just be
02:37 - like that it would change score by one
02:39 - and delete this clone so for the
02:42 - apprentices star and if it's touching
02:44 - the second ability and hero selected to
02:45 - three which is the Fairy Escape Arrow it
02:49 - just change 4ore by one and delete this
02:51 - clone if it's touching a third ability
02:53 - and her three which is
02:56 - the um the uh Defender Shield it will
03:00 - just change score by one and delete this
03:04 - Clon and if it's touching the
03:07 - player then it'll
03:10 - actually uh we're going to have a new
03:12 - set hit player so we're going to set
03:16 - make a variable hit
03:23 - player Speedy so each of them have their
03:26 - own hit damage and um damage stuff
03:30 - so sent hit player
03:32 - Speedy to
03:36 - Y then after that it will broadcast hit
03:43 - player so
03:45 - yeah that's the
03:49 - Speedy um code but we're also going to
03:51 - have this when the green flag is clicked
03:53 - it'll switch costume to costume one just
03:56 - in case if it doesn't switch it's
03:58 - because it can get killed when when it's
04:00 - like um on its second form so that's why
04:02 - you want to have it like
04:06 - that so to make it die when it touches
04:09 - you we're actually going to make it um
04:14 - so it will delete this clone after it
04:17 - touches them so we're going to put a
04:18 - delete this clone over here and take out
04:20 - the front Loop just like
04:22 - that the forever Loop is optional
04:25 - because I tried it and it works for both
04:27 - times but so you can put a forever or
04:30 - you don't have to so I'm just going to
04:31 - put it it doesn't really matter so that
04:34 - should be the Speedy enemy and that's
04:36 - how it should work so when it touches
04:38 - you it dies just like that so it just
04:41 - kind of like just runs at you and tries
04:43 - to kill you with all its
04:45 - might and yeah so that's the Speedy
04:49 - enemy so now let's work on the armored
04:53 - enemy oh let's actually see if the
04:55 - Speedy enemy dies first yeah see like if
04:58 - I touch the projectile it dies
05:01 - so yeah now let's work on the armored
05:06 - enemy so let's drag this all into the
05:08 - armored
05:15 - enemy just like that and we're just
05:18 - going to alter a few
05:21 - things so we have the armored enemy over
05:24 - here so when I start as a clone all of
05:27 - that but instead it'll move 0 five steps
05:31 - it's a lot
05:32 - slower and it won't delete this club
05:34 - when it touches
05:35 - you so when the grief I clicked it's
05:38 - just like that and
05:41 - then uh when I start as a clone it's
05:44 - we're going to rename this Speedy HP
05:47 - which is for the armored enemy to
05:49 - armored
05:51 - HP
05:54 - armored
05:56 - HP so and it will set armored HP to
06:00 - 1,000 so armored enemies have 1,000
06:04 - Health until touching player weight. 5
06:08 - uh seconds and then after that um let's
06:12 - see if we have to alter anything
06:14 - else and it'll pick random instead of
06:17 - two to 4 seconds cuz that' be way too
06:18 - hard we made it 9 to 11 seconds for it
06:23 - spawning and then so when I start as a
06:26 - clone forever if it's touching so this
06:30 - is actually going to be different so if
06:32 - touching
06:33 - projectile so let's actually duplicate
06:36 - this if touching
06:38 - projectile
06:40 - and hero
06:43 - selected
06:45 - projectile Pro and hero select is equal
06:48 - to one it
06:50 - will then it will instead of doing just
06:53 - dying from one Arrow it will
06:56 - change armored HP by minus 180 cuz this
07:00 - is the first
07:02 - hero and after that it will broadcast
07:05 - delete
07:07 - arrow and then we're going to have the
07:10 - if then if then you need a
07:16 - or if then armored HP is equal to
07:21 - zero armored HP is equal to
07:26 - zero or is less than zero
07:34 - is less than zero then it will change
07:38 - score by 10 and delete this
07:41 - clim so that's just for the first hero
07:44 - for the second hero we can just do the
07:45 - same thing just duplicate this put it
07:50 - under and then if it's touching hero
07:53 - select is equal to 2 to change armored
07:56 - HP by - 250
08:01 - D and then it's going to delete the
08:03 - arrow and it'll change score by 10 so
08:06 - same thing and then now we'll
08:08 - do the fairy queen so put it under and
08:12 - here select is equal to three then it
08:15 - change armor to HP by minus
08:18 - 60 broadcast delete Arrow change score
08:21 - by 10 delete this
08:22 - clim so now we have that we're going to
08:25 - add this whole hunk of code in here but
08:27 - we can just duplicate this cuz it's
08:29 - easier because it just won't die from
08:30 - one ability
08:33 - so let's put this
08:36 - under so if it's touching the first
08:41 - ability and hero selected is equal to
08:44 - one which is the spectral Arrow then
08:48 - it'll change armored HP by minus
08:51 - 100 since it passes through it many
08:53 - times it'll actually do more damage in
08:54 - that and then it'll change score by 10
08:57 - oh yeah no delete Arrow here so just
09:00 - like
09:02 - that yep and then now we're going to
09:06 - continue with that so if it's
09:09 - touching
09:11 - uh the so if it's touching the second
09:15 - ability of hero selected one so let's
09:19 - just move this up a little bit if it's
09:21 - touching the second ability and here
09:23 - selected is equal to
09:25 - one then it will broadcast delete Arrow
09:29 - so let's just take that from
09:32 - here change score by 10 and then delete
09:35 - this clone so death Arrow just kills
09:37 - anything and then now we don't need that
09:41 - so let's move on to here so if it's
09:44 - touching the first ability and hereo
09:46 - selected it's equal to two which is the
09:48 - teleport
09:49 - back then we're going to change this up
09:52 - so we need to if
09:55 - then we need if then so if then
10:00 - the costume
10:03 - number if then the costume
10:05 - number is equal to one so if you
10:10 - teleport the dude when he's has his
10:11 - armor on then it'll switch
10:15 - costume to costume
10:17 - 4 which is this one cuz it'll teleport
10:21 - like that and if you dismantle his armor
10:23 - then it'll teleport back like that so so
10:25 - if you dismantle armor they teleport
10:27 - back like that so that's why it has to
10:28 - be different so if his touch's costume
10:30 - number is equal to one then then it'll
10:33 - wait .1
10:36 - seconds let's just duplicate that wait1
10:39 - seconds move 150 steps wait3 seconds and
10:42 - switch costume back to costume
10:45 - 1 now we're going to have another equals
10:48 - if then costume number is equal to
10:50 - two then it will switch costume to
10:54 - costume five which is the one without
10:56 - the armor so if you want to teleport it
10:58 - afterward you just B to armor just like
11:00 - that costume 5 and wait1 seconds and it
11:04 - switch uh back to costume costume 2
11:08 - which is the dismantled armor
11:11 - costume so yeah since we have that if
11:14 - it's touching the second ability and
11:16 - hero selected is equal to two since it's
11:19 - so strong against
11:21 - um the the armored enemies it'll do 850
11:27 - damage to it but it cannot kill it so
11:30 - even if you use two Lightnings in it it
11:32 - won't kill it so I did that on purpose
11:34 - so it's kind of like a different ability
11:37 - so it'll switch costume costume 2 it'll
11:39 - dismantle its
11:41 - armor so if it's touching the
11:43 - apprentices star let's
11:48 - actually um let's actually take this
11:51 - code from up here
11:53 - so let's take this right
11:57 - here so if it's touching the parenthesis
11:59 - star then it
12:02 - will change armored
12:04 - HP by minus
12:07 - 400 oh not plus 400 minus
12:11 - 400 and then it'll broadcast delete
12:14 - apprentices star and then if it's equal
12:17 - to zero or less than zero change score
12:18 - by
12:20 - 10 so if it's seing the second ability
12:22 - in hero select is equal to three which
12:25 - is the defend the the fairy teleport it
12:29 - CH change score by 10 and delet this CL
12:30 - so the fairy teport is really strong and
12:34 - then we're gonna for the third ability
12:36 - we're going to have some difference so
12:39 - it will move negative 150 steps so the
12:43 - third ability is the defender ship that
12:45 - teleports everyone back when they touch
12:46 - it move negative 150 steps it will
12:50 - change armored
12:52 - HP by minus
12:56 - 400 the switch costum
13:00 - to costume
13:02 - 3 it will wait 2
13:09 - seconds 2
13:11 - seconds then it'll switch costume back
13:14 - to costume
13:19 - one and we're going to take this script
13:21 - over here
13:23 - so if this one if armored HP is equal to
13:27 - zero or less than zero
13:29 - uh they'll change score by 10 and delete
13:31 - this clone so put it right
13:34 - there and then if it's touching the
13:36 - player with to make a new
13:38 - variable hit
13:42 - player
13:46 - armored so if it's searing a player
13:48 - it'll set hit player armored to Y and
13:52 - broadcast hit player and since it won't
13:55 - die when you touch it when it touches
13:57 - the player it'll move 20 steps
14:02 - instead so yeah that should be the code
14:06 - for the armored enemy and to finish off
14:08 - this video we'll do the player um taking
14:12 - damage so let's actually do that now so
14:16 - when I receive hit
14:19 - player then it
14:22 - will if
14:27 - then who need to equal
14:29 - sign if then hit
14:33 - player
14:35 - zombie is equal to
14:38 - Y then it'll change
14:43 - lives by
14:48 - minus5 and then we will if then hit
14:52 - player
14:56 - Speedy player speedy is equal to Y then
14:59 - change lives by
15:02 - -20 if hit
15:04 - player
15:07 - armored equals
15:10 - y then we'll change lives by -25 so
15:15 - those are the main two characters and
15:16 - then there's also the peons there's the
15:18 - bosses but we'll get that into the next
15:20 - video and then after that it will
15:23 - set hit
15:25 - player zombie to end
15:31 - it'll set hit player Speedy to
15:34 - end and set set hit player armored to
15:38 - end so and then we'll add all the other
15:40 - ones
15:41 - later so let's just close some of the
15:44 - variables real quick just like that oh
15:48 - yeah let's just close these over here
15:51 - Speedy
15:53 - HP zombie
15:55 - HP and let's see if our game works so
15:59 - let's just move these up
16:03 - here so yeah let's see if it works so
16:06 - yeah it seems like our game is working
16:08 - so I'm going to try out let's try the
16:10 - Grand Master beage let's full screen
16:12 - this so as you can see the speed enemy
16:14 - just hit me I'm at 980 lives I can shoot
16:18 - them they can hit me so let's just shoot
16:21 - them let's see how much damage the
16:22 - zombie does
16:24 - 15 I can shoot them let's see how much
16:27 - the armored zombie does if if we can get
16:28 - close enough let's see if the powerups
16:30 - work on them so that's the teleport
16:32 - power up you
16:33 - see and
16:35 - then we have the lightning tele oh the
16:39 - lightning and then we can have teleport
16:41 - the back without their armor oh my
16:44 - gosh and then our power up three the
16:48 - turret and we're shooting them
16:56 - yeah so yeah it seems to be working all
16:59 - the um zombies are spawning they're
17:01 - taking damage they're doing the right
17:05 - thing so
17:10 - yeah all
17:12 - right so please like share subscribe and
17:16 - comment in the comment section below
17:17 - what else games that you want to see
17:19 - later and I'll see you guys next
17:23 - [Music]
17:27 - time
17:29 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's kid playground here and today we're back with another video in scratch and today we'll be making the fifth part of the hero war game so if you have not checked out the first four parts go check that out on our Channel and that'll just get us to where we are right now so today we're going to try to work on the Speedy enemy and the armored enemy and maybe the boss the speedy is fairly simple just drag all the code right into here and then we'll just alter it as needed so just like that so the first change that we're going to make is make this weight pick random to to 4 seconds so it spawns slower and then it'll set zombie HP to 100 but we're actually going to rename this zombie HP cuz it's only for the this zombie HP right here is only for the Speedy enemy so to not get confused we're going to change it to Speedy enemy it's a speedy HP just like that and then it'll set speed HP to 100 and all that okay so uh when I start as a clone instead of moving two steps I move six steps because it's a fast enemy so we're going to uh change the code a little bit here so if it touches any type of projectile let's delete that touches any type of projectile then it will broadcast delete Arrow so let's just throw this all the way broadcast delete Arrow change score by one and then delete this clone and then since we have any type of projectile we can go throw all of this away you see hero selected two hero selected three you can all go and now we're going to work on the first ability here one it will change score by one and delete this clone uh if it's touching the second ability which is the death Arrow it'll change score by one it broadcast delete arrow and delete this clone then if it's searching the first ability and hero selected is equal to two uh that's just the um teleport so same code and if it's touching the second ability and hero selected is equal to two it'll also die by the lightning no matter what so we're just going to change that change score by one so when it's touching the apprentices star we don't need any of that we just don't need that either it'll just be like that it would change score by one and delete this clone so for the apprentices star and if it's touching the second ability and hero selected to three which is the Fairy Escape Arrow it just change 4ore by one and delete this clone if it's touching a third ability and her three which is the um the uh Defender Shield it will just change score by one and delete this Clon and if it's touching the player then it'll actually uh we're going to have a new set hit player so we're going to set make a variable hit player Speedy so each of them have their own hit damage and um damage stuff so sent hit player Speedy to Y then after that it will broadcast hit player so yeah that's the Speedy um code but we're also going to have this when the green flag is clicked it'll switch costume to costume one just in case if it doesn't switch it's because it can get killed when when it's like um on its second form so that's why you want to have it like that so to make it die when it touches you we're actually going to make it um so it will delete this clone after it touches them so we're going to put a delete this clone over here and take out the front Loop just like that the forever Loop is optional because I tried it and it works for both times but so you can put a forever or you don't have to so I'm just going to put it it doesn't really matter so that should be the Speedy enemy and that's how it should work so when it touches you it dies just like that so it just kind of like just runs at you and tries to kill you with all its might and yeah so that's the Speedy enemy so now let's work on the armored enemy oh let's actually see if the Speedy enemy dies first yeah see like if I touch the projectile it dies so yeah now let's work on the armored enemy so let's drag this all into the armored enemy just like that and we're just going to alter a few things so we have the armored enemy over here so when I start as a clone all of that but instead it'll move 0 five steps it's a lot slower and it won't delete this club when it touches you so when the grief I clicked it's just like that and then uh when I start as a clone it's we're going to rename this Speedy HP which is for the armored enemy to armored HP armored HP so and it will set armored HP to 1,000 so armored enemies have 1,000 Health until touching player weight. 5 uh seconds and then after that um let's see if we have to alter anything else and it'll pick random instead of two to 4 seconds cuz that' be way too hard we made it 9 to 11 seconds for it spawning and then so when I start as a clone forever if it's touching so this is actually going to be different so if touching projectile so let's actually duplicate this if touching projectile and hero selected projectile Pro and hero select is equal to one it will then it will instead of doing just dying from one Arrow it will change armored HP by minus 180 cuz this is the first hero and after that it will broadcast delete arrow and then we're going to have the if then if then you need a or if then armored HP is equal to zero armored HP is equal to zero or is less than zero is less than zero then it will change score by 10 and delete this clim so that's just for the first hero for the second hero we can just do the same thing just duplicate this put it under and then if it's touching hero select is equal to 2 to change armored HP by 250 D and then it's going to delete the arrow and it'll change score by 10 so same thing and then now we'll do the fairy queen so put it under and here select is equal to three then it change armor to HP by minus 60 broadcast delete Arrow change score by 10 delete this clim so now we have that we're going to add this whole hunk of code in here but we can just duplicate this cuz it's easier because it just won't die from one ability so let's put this under so if it's touching the first ability and hero selected is equal to one which is the spectral Arrow then it'll change armored HP by minus 100 since it passes through it many times it'll actually do more damage in that and then it'll change score by 10 oh yeah no delete Arrow here so just like that yep and then now we're going to continue with that so if it's touching uh the so if it's touching the second ability of hero selected one so let's just move this up a little bit if it's touching the second ability and here selected is equal to one then it will broadcast delete Arrow so let's just take that from here change score by 10 and then delete this clone so death Arrow just kills anything and then now we don't need that so let's move on to here so if it's touching the first ability and hereo selected it's equal to two which is the teleport back then we're going to change this up so we need to if then we need if then so if then the costume number if then the costume number is equal to one so if you teleport the dude when he's has his armor on then it'll switch costume to costume 4 which is this one cuz it'll teleport like that and if you dismantle his armor then it'll teleport back like that so so if you dismantle armor they teleport back like that so that's why it has to be different so if his touch's costume number is equal to one then then it'll wait .1 seconds let's just duplicate that wait1 seconds move 150 steps wait3 seconds and switch costume back to costume 1 now we're going to have another equals if then costume number is equal to two then it will switch costume to costume five which is the one without the armor so if you want to teleport it afterward you just B to armor just like that costume 5 and wait1 seconds and it switch uh back to costume costume 2 which is the dismantled armor costume so yeah since we have that if it's touching the second ability and hero selected is equal to two since it's so strong against um the the armored enemies it'll do 850 damage to it but it cannot kill it so even if you use two Lightnings in it it won't kill it so I did that on purpose so it's kind of like a different ability so it'll switch costume costume 2 it'll dismantle its armor so if it's touching the apprentices star let's actually um let's actually take this code from up here so let's take this right here so if it's touching the parenthesis star then it will change armored HP by minus 400 oh not plus 400 minus 400 and then it'll broadcast delete apprentices star and then if it's equal to zero or less than zero change score by 10 so if it's seing the second ability in hero select is equal to three which is the defend the the fairy teleport it CH change score by 10 and delet this CL so the fairy teport is really strong and then we're gonna for the third ability we're going to have some difference so it will move negative 150 steps so the third ability is the defender ship that teleports everyone back when they touch it move negative 150 steps it will change armored HP by minus 400 the switch costum to costume 3 it will wait 2 seconds 2 seconds then it'll switch costume back to costume one and we're going to take this script over here so if this one if armored HP is equal to zero or less than zero uh they'll change score by 10 and delete this clone so put it right there and then if it's touching the player with to make a new variable hit player armored so if it's searing a player it'll set hit player armored to Y and broadcast hit player and since it won't die when you touch it when it touches the player it'll move 20 steps instead so yeah that should be the code for the armored enemy and to finish off this video we'll do the player um taking damage so let's actually do that now so when I receive hit player then it will if then who need to equal sign if then hit player zombie is equal to Y then it'll change lives by minus5 and then we will if then hit player Speedy player speedy is equal to Y then change lives by 20 if hit player armored equals y then we'll change lives by 25 so those are the main two characters and then there's also the peons there's the bosses but we'll get that into the next video and then after that it will set hit player zombie to end it'll set hit player Speedy to end and set set hit player armored to end so and then we'll add all the other ones later so let's just close some of the variables real quick just like that oh yeah let's just close these over here Speedy HP zombie HP and let's see if our game works so let's just move these up here so yeah let's see if it works so yeah it seems like our game is working so I'm going to try out let's try the Grand Master beage let's full screen this so as you can see the speed enemy just hit me I'm at 980 lives I can shoot them they can hit me so let's just shoot them let's see how much damage the zombie does 15 I can shoot them let's see how much the armored zombie does if if we can get close enough let's see if the powerups work on them so that's the teleport power up you see and then we have the lightning tele oh the lightning and then we can have teleport the back without their armor oh my gosh and then our power up three the turret and we're shooting them yeah so yeah it seems to be working all the um zombies are spawning they're taking damage they're doing the right thing so yeah all right so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below what else games that you want to see later and I'll see you guys next time
