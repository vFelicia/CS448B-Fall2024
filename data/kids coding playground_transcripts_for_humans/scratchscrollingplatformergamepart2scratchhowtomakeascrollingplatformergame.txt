00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:09 - kids coding playground
00:10 - today we'll be doing the part two for
00:12 - the scrolling platform
00:13 - so i'll show you guys what we'll be
00:15 - doing today
00:17 - so today all we'll be doing is the
00:18 - movement of the player
00:21 - as you can see there's also friction so
00:24 - the longer you hold it the more friction
00:26 - it has it will like slide a little bit
00:28 - after you hold down
00:30 - so we'll only be doing the left and
00:31 - right controls right now
00:34 - it's not dropping down because we have
00:35 - not done the y
00:37 - scrolling in the y uh code so
00:40 - today we'll just be doing the x so
00:44 - now i'm gonna go to the code so we're
00:46 - gonna actually do the tile sets first
00:48 - so i already have it all done in the
00:50 - tile sets so i'm gonna teach you guys
00:52 - how to do it
00:57 - so we have these tiles already
00:59 - downloaded in the google drive
01:01 - so you guys can just get it in the first
01:04 - video we already have it
01:05 - so you can just duplicate this ctrl c
01:08 - ctrl v and then you can just do the tile
01:10 - sets
01:12 - so i'm just going to make a simple tile
01:14 - set
01:16 - let's make it side by side
01:22 - you can use the arrow keys so it can um
01:25 - make it out a little bit more so that's
01:27 - actually pretty good
01:29 - now i can select both of them ctrl c
01:31 - ctrl v
01:34 - and drag it right there i'll probably do
01:37 - two more on this side
01:39 - on the on the right side so
01:43 - just duplicate that
01:47 - hold down shift hold down shift to
01:49 - select multiple items
01:53 - oops ctrl v i i guess i can select all
01:57 - of it
01:58 - i'll group it so then it'll stay all
02:00 - together and paste it again
02:02 - i'll just make a simple uh
02:06 - a tile like a little platform
02:09 - you move around on
02:12 - so yeah that's pretty much how you do it
02:15 - you center it
02:18 - there you go so that's like a little
02:20 - tile set that's how you do it
02:22 - in our other videos we also did it uh
02:24 - taught you guys how to do it we can get
02:26 - some boxes
02:27 - it's like make the platform look cooler
02:30 - i guess
02:31 - we can like put boxes everywhere yeah
02:34 - see
02:35 - looks pretty nice already so yeah that's
02:38 - pretty much how you do it we also taught
02:40 - you guys how to do that in the
02:42 - simple platformer and the um
02:45 - and the ninja platformer so if you watch
02:48 - those two then you should be
02:50 - you should know how to do these tile
02:51 - sets so yeah that's how you do it
02:54 - and we can also teach you how to draw
02:56 - these
02:58 - so we also made our own types of tile
03:00 - sets we drew these
03:02 - um so i will be teaching you guys how to
03:04 - draw them
03:05 - so let's paint a new costume
03:09 - oops go back
03:13 - paint a new costume so
03:17 - what we do is no outline and then use
03:20 - the rectangle tool
03:21 - so first we draw a rectangle
03:24 - so we just use some green color
03:28 - we can use like some lines for the side
03:30 - as like vines or something
03:33 - like vines
03:39 - 20 maybe um and then we'll draw hold
03:42 - down
03:43 - shift so then you get a straight line
03:45 - we'll draw the top
03:46 - and then we can get a darker lighter
03:48 - color
03:50 - a lighter color maybe and then uh put it
03:54 - on top of there we can make it go to the
03:56 - back layer
03:58 - select it make it go the back layer
04:06 - so boom there you go uh the thing let's
04:09 - move that back
04:10 - layer and then we can draw some vines on
04:13 - the side
04:14 - hold down shift
04:20 - there you go so now you can just uh
04:24 - copy paste all of that group group all
04:26 - of it
04:28 - and then you can just copy paste it make
04:30 - some
04:32 - oops gotta copy that
04:36 - copy paste it and then you have like you
04:38 - can put like multiple you can like
04:40 - stack them so yeah that's how you do
04:42 - tile sets
04:46 - so next you can rename it to level one
04:50 - one
04:50 - which means level one part one
04:54 - with the space in between and then this
04:56 - is level
04:57 - this is level one part two level one
05:00 - part three
05:00 - level one part four level two part one
05:03 - level part
05:04 - two part two level two part three level
05:06 - three part one level
05:07 - three part two level three part three
05:10 - and finally level three part four and
05:12 - this is just level four
05:15 - so i'm going to delete these so now
05:18 - let's move on to the code
05:21 - so i looked through the code for the
05:22 - player and i found out that
05:24 - set game would be kind of confusing
05:26 - because i broadcasted something else
05:27 - called
05:28 - set up so we can delete this
05:31 - and broadcast exchange that out
05:35 - for let's name it the green flag
05:38 - as before sorry for the confusion guys
05:42 - just do it like that green flag and then
05:46 - play game
05:48 - i'll zoom in and then instead of set
05:52 - game
05:52 - now you have to change this to green
05:54 - flag
06:00 - so now let's receive a new message
06:02 - called play game
06:04 - so when i see play game let's get a
06:06 - forever loop
06:07 - we'll broadcast and wait a new message
06:10 - called reset so this is just to reset
06:12 - the whole game reset
06:16 - and broadcast another message called set
06:18 - up to set up the game again
06:24 - set up and then we can game on so it
06:27 - will
06:28 - run all of this reset all the variables
06:32 - so let's go to my blocks get the game on
06:35 - get a repeat until so repeat until
06:40 - exit is greater than nothing so um
06:43 - if the player dies or something we'll
06:45 - fill this place with die
06:47 - but right now we're going to put it as
06:48 - an empty string and put
06:50 - exit right here exit so if it touches
06:54 - the portal this will
06:55 - be wind and if it dies we can like fill
06:58 - it up with
06:59 - dye and now we will make a new custom
07:03 - block called tick
07:04 - it's it's uh it's really fast that's why
07:07 - we call it tick
07:08 - just leave this blank for now just
07:11 - tick it's really fast that's why we call
07:13 - it tick it's like a tick tock
07:16 - untick on a clock so it's got the tick
07:20 - get an if then statement this is a
07:22 - movement if
07:24 - the left arrow key key left arrow
07:27 - is pressed then we can point in
07:29 - direction of negative 90
07:31 - so we'll face the left side point in
07:33 - direction
07:34 - of negative 90. and don't forget to do
07:38 - this
07:38 - set it to don't rotate or else your
07:40 - sprite will flips upside down
07:42 - and you don't want that so click don't
07:44 - rotate
07:46 - and we will change that screw
07:49 - uh change the um sorry uh speed x sx
07:54 - by negative two um so
07:57 - sx is uh just for the player
08:00 - so you go to uh set uh make it for this
08:03 - sprite only i think
08:04 - we said that on the last video
08:07 - so next you want to duplicate this put
08:10 - it under here
08:11 - instead of left arrow you want to do
08:12 - right arrow key
08:15 - if right arrow key is pressed then you
08:16 - point direction of 90 so it'll face the
08:18 - right side
08:19 - and the speed x should be 2 instead
08:22 - and then you can also do wasd as well
08:26 - so then you can put an or right here or
08:30 - so if the key left arrow or
08:33 - the a key is pressed then it will move
08:36 - to the left
08:37 - we just duplicate this move that out put
08:41 - that in here
08:42 - if the key right arrow key is pressed
08:44 - that or the
08:46 - d is pressed then we can also do the
08:50 - same thing
08:51 - and now we're going to work on the
08:52 - friction so we're going to set
08:55 - the speed x the sx
08:59 - to um sx multiplied by 0.8
09:05 - so this is to make it a pretty small
09:07 - number so
09:08 - um it won't go super fast and glide all
09:11 - over the screen
09:13 - so you'll have a little bit friction to
09:15 - the player
09:17 - put that in here and if
09:22 - um you need the greater than so
09:26 - if the absolute value
09:29 - absolute value of the speed x
09:32 - is greater than 0.9 so the absolute
09:36 - value is just to keep it a
09:37 - positive number not negative whenever
09:40 - you move a little bit
09:41 - it will also change a little bit so
09:44 - that's the friction for the
09:46 - player then we'll make a new block keep
09:49 - that empty for
09:50 - now we'll make a new block called change
09:54 - player x change player x
09:57 - by change player x by
10:00 - um and then you add an input called sx
10:04 - like that so press ok i'm going to
10:07 - change player x by
10:09 - right here so then we can change the x
10:12 - oops change x
10:15 - by the speed x and then you
10:19 - position we'll make a new vis uh block
10:22 - called position
10:25 - so position like that so positions just
10:29 - for the scrolling
10:32 - so so position is for positioning the
10:36 - sprites
10:37 - as equal to the scrolling so position a
10:41 - little bit
10:42 - to the scrolling and for position we'll
10:46 - just
10:46 - take go to go to
10:51 - and you want to find the difference
10:54 - between the
10:54 - x and scroll x
11:00 - and just duplicate this and instead of
11:04 - x you can do y right here and instead of
11:06 - scroll x you just scroll y
11:09 - there you go and then you want to do the
11:12 - and then right down here at the friction
11:14 - area you want to change the player x by
11:17 - round
11:17 - of the speed x so this will round the
11:20 - number to the
11:21 - like the nearest tenth or something uh
11:23 - first number
11:24 - one whole number so um
11:28 - just round the number so you won't have
11:30 - any decimals and left over
11:33 - and then finally you want to go over
11:34 - here and then you run the position
11:38 - like that and then right here in the
11:40 - repeat until
11:42 - we will run the tick
11:45 - and broadcast and wait a new message
11:47 - called take
11:53 - oops accidentally turn on caps lock i
11:55 - will
11:56 - i guess i can keep it it's okay um
12:00 - i'll guess i can do it again
12:03 - tick so like that so as of now we have
12:07 - all of this code
12:08 - i'll zoom out a little bit
12:13 - like that
12:16 - go to the platforms go make a block
12:20 - called position
12:25 - and add two inputs one called x and one
12:28 - called y
12:30 - and then click ok so do it in platforms
12:36 - next you wanna get a go-to now we're
12:39 - trying to position the
12:40 - platform we already have the positioning
12:42 - for the player
12:44 - right here and right here
12:49 - so now let's go to the platform i
12:52 - already have the platform right here
12:55 - um so we want to get a go to
12:59 - like i said go to
13:02 - x and y of the position
13:06 - get an if else if
13:09 - the x is equal to the y
13:12 - uh equal to the x position
13:15 - so if the x is equal to the uh x
13:17 - position let's go to motion x position
13:21 - and you gotta and and
13:26 - so you can duplicate this
13:30 - put this right here and instead of x you
13:33 - want to do y
13:35 - and instead of x position you do y
13:37 - position
13:40 - so like this if the x
13:43 - is equal to x position and y is equal to
13:46 - the y position this is positioning the
13:48 - platforms so we want to show it if it's
13:50 - the correct
13:51 - um position and we want to hide it if
13:54 - it's not
13:56 - and that will now we will need to if it
13:59 - receives the tick
14:01 - i receive the tick
14:04 - then we can position it
14:08 - of the difference of the scroll x of the
14:11 - difference of the x
14:12 - and the scroll x so get a subtraction
14:15 - subtraction
14:17 - um x and
14:20 - oops x subtracted by the scroll x you
14:23 - want to find the difference
14:25 - and then instead of uh and then right
14:28 - here just duplicate this
14:31 - because right now this is only for
14:33 - scrolling for the x
14:34 - so just put it like that
14:39 - and then next you want to get a clone
14:42 - you're going to make a new block
14:45 - instead of x sorry i accidentally said
14:46 - the wrong thing so you say y right here
14:48 - and scroll y
14:50 - like that and then now we need to make a
14:54 - new block
14:57 - called clone so this is just to like um
15:00 - uh make where you want the platforms to
15:02 - be so clone at
15:04 - put two inputs x and put another one
15:08 - y so clone at x and y
15:12 - so you want to create a clone of myself
15:17 - and then you want to change the x
15:21 - we'll get onto this in the next video
15:23 - because we're running low on time
15:26 - we will finish the platform um
15:29 - like the positioning of the platform
15:31 - later but we will finish this part first
15:34 - so change the y
15:38 - by so you want to change the x by the x
15:40 - y by the y
15:42 - and you want next costume so the
15:44 - costumes will just
15:45 - go to the next costume like that
15:48 - next costume
15:52 - under here and then finally we have one
15:55 - last bit of code
15:56 - for the backdrop so when the key
15:59 - m is pressed so this is just for like
16:01 - finding where you want the um
16:04 - uh to position your collectibles we'll
16:06 - get onto that later
16:08 - so like when you press m it will set the
16:10 - mouse
16:13 - set the mouse variable
16:16 - to joining the um
16:21 - join the mouse x
16:27 - and plus the scroll x sorry
16:31 - so you add the scroll x right here
16:36 - mouse x plus the scroll x so this is
16:39 - just
16:39 - showing the position of it and then you
16:41 - put the join right there put a comma
16:43 - just to separate the two and then again
16:46 - duplicate this
16:48 - instead of scroll x we do scroll y
16:51 - instead of mouse x we do mouse y
16:54 - so we got this from proof patches
16:56 - tutorial it's a pretty good strategy i
16:58 - guess
16:58 - and then we can show the variable
17:00 - because when you're testing sometimes
17:01 - you might hide the mouse variable
17:04 - so when you play this now we have the
17:07 - movement
17:08 - as you can see and then when you press
17:12 - m it will go to the position of the y
17:16 - x and y position of the mouse
17:19 - so next we're gonna add the last chunk
17:21 - of code
17:22 - for our backdrop i mean uh for our
17:25 - platforms
17:27 - so we're gonna get when i receive the
17:29 - green flag we will hide
17:33 - and when i receive reset from the
17:37 - player just resetting the game it will
17:39 - delete the clones because as you can see
17:41 - we're using clones right here
17:43 - reset delete this clone
17:47 - and then finally when i receive setup
17:50 - to reset the game oops set up
17:55 - then we can set the x to zero
18:00 - set x to zero duplicate this and this is
18:04 - for the um
18:05 - the sprite only as you can see if i
18:07 - showed it
18:09 - it's platforms x for the platforms only
18:12 - so if it's
18:12 - not for the platforms only for you guys
18:15 - you guys got to do that
18:18 - only for the platforms and you want to
18:20 - hide after that
18:23 - get an if then statement if
18:26 - level is equal to if the level
18:31 - is equal to one
18:34 - then we can switch costume
18:39 - switch costume sorry
18:42 - to level one one the first thing
18:47 - and then we can create a clone at
18:50 - uh x360
18:54 - like that's somewhere right here and y0
19:00 - okay now let's play it as you can see
19:02 - the backdrops are showing up
19:04 - it's not the background is not scrolling
19:07 - those platforms are not scrolling yet
19:09 - we have not got on to that the player is
19:11 - moving fine
19:13 - when you press m the mouse will go to
19:15 - the mouse position
19:17 - so yeah that's all we have for now
19:21 - thank you guys for watching please like
19:23 - share and subscribe
19:24 - and i'll see you guys in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today we'll be doing the part two for the scrolling platform so i'll show you guys what we'll be doing today so today all we'll be doing is the movement of the player as you can see there's also friction so the longer you hold it the more friction it has it will like slide a little bit after you hold down so we'll only be doing the left and right controls right now it's not dropping down because we have not done the y scrolling in the y uh code so today we'll just be doing the x so now i'm gonna go to the code so we're gonna actually do the tile sets first so i already have it all done in the tile sets so i'm gonna teach you guys how to do it so we have these tiles already downloaded in the google drive so you guys can just get it in the first video we already have it so you can just duplicate this ctrl c ctrl v and then you can just do the tile sets so i'm just going to make a simple tile set let's make it side by side you can use the arrow keys so it can um make it out a little bit more so that's actually pretty good now i can select both of them ctrl c ctrl v and drag it right there i'll probably do two more on this side on the on the right side so just duplicate that hold down shift hold down shift to select multiple items oops ctrl v i i guess i can select all of it i'll group it so then it'll stay all together and paste it again i'll just make a simple uh a tile like a little platform you move around on so yeah that's pretty much how you do it you center it there you go so that's like a little tile set that's how you do it in our other videos we also did it uh taught you guys how to do it we can get some boxes it's like make the platform look cooler i guess we can like put boxes everywhere yeah see looks pretty nice already so yeah that's pretty much how you do it we also taught you guys how to do that in the simple platformer and the um and the ninja platformer so if you watch those two then you should be you should know how to do these tile sets so yeah that's how you do it and we can also teach you how to draw these so we also made our own types of tile sets we drew these um so i will be teaching you guys how to draw them so let's paint a new costume oops go back paint a new costume so what we do is no outline and then use the rectangle tool so first we draw a rectangle so we just use some green color we can use like some lines for the side as like vines or something like vines 20 maybe um and then we'll draw hold down shift so then you get a straight line we'll draw the top and then we can get a darker lighter color a lighter color maybe and then uh put it on top of there we can make it go to the back layer select it make it go the back layer so boom there you go uh the thing let's move that back layer and then we can draw some vines on the side hold down shift there you go so now you can just uh copy paste all of that group group all of it and then you can just copy paste it make some oops gotta copy that copy paste it and then you have like you can put like multiple you can like stack them so yeah that's how you do tile sets so next you can rename it to level one one which means level one part one with the space in between and then this is level this is level one part two level one part three level one part four level two part one level part two part two level two part three level three part one level three part two level three part three and finally level three part four and this is just level four so i'm going to delete these so now let's move on to the code so i looked through the code for the player and i found out that set game would be kind of confusing because i broadcasted something else called set up so we can delete this and broadcast exchange that out for let's name it the green flag as before sorry for the confusion guys just do it like that green flag and then play game i'll zoom in and then instead of set game now you have to change this to green flag so now let's receive a new message called play game so when i see play game let's get a forever loop we'll broadcast and wait a new message called reset so this is just to reset the whole game reset and broadcast another message called set up to set up the game again set up and then we can game on so it will run all of this reset all the variables so let's go to my blocks get the game on get a repeat until so repeat until exit is greater than nothing so um if the player dies or something we'll fill this place with die but right now we're going to put it as an empty string and put exit right here exit so if it touches the portal this will be wind and if it dies we can like fill it up with dye and now we will make a new custom block called tick it's it's uh it's really fast that's why we call it tick just leave this blank for now just tick it's really fast that's why we call it tick it's like a tick tock untick on a clock so it's got the tick get an if then statement this is a movement if the left arrow key key left arrow is pressed then we can point in direction of negative 90 so we'll face the left side point in direction of negative 90. and don't forget to do this set it to don't rotate or else your sprite will flips upside down and you don't want that so click don't rotate and we will change that screw uh change the um sorry uh speed x sx by negative two um so sx is uh just for the player so you go to uh set uh make it for this sprite only i think we said that on the last video so next you want to duplicate this put it under here instead of left arrow you want to do right arrow key if right arrow key is pressed then you point direction of 90 so it'll face the right side and the speed x should be 2 instead and then you can also do wasd as well so then you can put an or right here or so if the key left arrow or the a key is pressed then it will move to the left we just duplicate this move that out put that in here if the key right arrow key is pressed that or the d is pressed then we can also do the same thing and now we're going to work on the friction so we're going to set the speed x the sx to um sx multiplied by 0.8 so this is to make it a pretty small number so um it won't go super fast and glide all over the screen so you'll have a little bit friction to the player put that in here and if um you need the greater than so if the absolute value absolute value of the speed x is greater than 0.9 so the absolute value is just to keep it a positive number not negative whenever you move a little bit it will also change a little bit so that's the friction for the player then we'll make a new block keep that empty for now we'll make a new block called change player x change player x by change player x by um and then you add an input called sx like that so press ok i'm going to change player x by right here so then we can change the x oops change x by the speed x and then you position we'll make a new vis uh block called position so position like that so positions just for the scrolling so so position is for positioning the sprites as equal to the scrolling so position a little bit to the scrolling and for position we'll just take go to go to and you want to find the difference between the x and scroll x and just duplicate this and instead of x you can do y right here and instead of scroll x you just scroll y there you go and then you want to do the and then right down here at the friction area you want to change the player x by round of the speed x so this will round the number to the like the nearest tenth or something uh first number one whole number so um just round the number so you won't have any decimals and left over and then finally you want to go over here and then you run the position like that and then right here in the repeat until we will run the tick and broadcast and wait a new message called take oops accidentally turn on caps lock i will i guess i can keep it it's okay um i'll guess i can do it again tick so like that so as of now we have all of this code i'll zoom out a little bit like that go to the platforms go make a block called position and add two inputs one called x and one called y and then click ok so do it in platforms next you wanna get a goto now we're trying to position the platform we already have the positioning for the player right here and right here so now let's go to the platform i already have the platform right here um so we want to get a go to like i said go to x and y of the position get an if else if the x is equal to the y uh equal to the x position so if the x is equal to the uh x position let's go to motion x position and you gotta and and so you can duplicate this put this right here and instead of x you want to do y and instead of x position you do y position so like this if the x is equal to x position and y is equal to the y position this is positioning the platforms so we want to show it if it's the correct um position and we want to hide it if it's not and that will now we will need to if it receives the tick i receive the tick then we can position it of the difference of the scroll x of the difference of the x and the scroll x so get a subtraction subtraction um x and oops x subtracted by the scroll x you want to find the difference and then instead of uh and then right here just duplicate this because right now this is only for scrolling for the x so just put it like that and then next you want to get a clone you're going to make a new block instead of x sorry i accidentally said the wrong thing so you say y right here and scroll y like that and then now we need to make a new block called clone so this is just to like um uh make where you want the platforms to be so clone at put two inputs x and put another one y so clone at x and y so you want to create a clone of myself and then you want to change the x we'll get onto this in the next video because we're running low on time we will finish the platform um like the positioning of the platform later but we will finish this part first so change the y by so you want to change the x by the x y by the y and you want next costume so the costumes will just go to the next costume like that next costume under here and then finally we have one last bit of code for the backdrop so when the key m is pressed so this is just for like finding where you want the um uh to position your collectibles we'll get onto that later so like when you press m it will set the mouse set the mouse variable to joining the um join the mouse x and plus the scroll x sorry so you add the scroll x right here mouse x plus the scroll x so this is just showing the position of it and then you put the join right there put a comma just to separate the two and then again duplicate this instead of scroll x we do scroll y instead of mouse x we do mouse y so we got this from proof patches tutorial it's a pretty good strategy i guess and then we can show the variable because when you're testing sometimes you might hide the mouse variable so when you play this now we have the movement as you can see and then when you press m it will go to the position of the y x and y position of the mouse so next we're gonna add the last chunk of code for our backdrop i mean uh for our platforms so we're gonna get when i receive the green flag we will hide and when i receive reset from the player just resetting the game it will delete the clones because as you can see we're using clones right here reset delete this clone and then finally when i receive setup to reset the game oops set up then we can set the x to zero set x to zero duplicate this and this is for the um the sprite only as you can see if i showed it it's platforms x for the platforms only so if it's not for the platforms only for you guys you guys got to do that only for the platforms and you want to hide after that get an if then statement if level is equal to if the level is equal to one then we can switch costume switch costume sorry to level one one the first thing and then we can create a clone at uh x360 like that's somewhere right here and y0 okay now let's play it as you can see the backdrops are showing up it's not the background is not scrolling those platforms are not scrolling yet we have not got on to that the player is moving fine when you press m the mouse will go to the mouse position so yeah that's all we have for now thank you guys for watching please like share and subscribe and i'll see you guys in the next video
