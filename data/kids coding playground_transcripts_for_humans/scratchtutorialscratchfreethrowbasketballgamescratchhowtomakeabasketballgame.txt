00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids coding
00:09 - playground here and today we're back for
00:11 - another video
00:12 - on scratch and today we'll be making
00:14 - another face sensing game
00:15 - called free throw basketball and i'll be
00:18 - wearing the same demon mask
00:20 - so if you do not enjoy demon masks
00:22 - please do not watch the video while i do
00:24 - it i don't know why but okay so
00:26 - anyways i'm gonna show you the demo so
00:28 - i'm not going to start it yet because my
00:30 - face i get give me the mask
00:40 - i got the face mask on
00:44 - not the face mask the demon mask
00:50 - oh my demon mask
00:55 - in a basketball hoop and you try to get
00:56 - the basketball to touch the
00:59 - uh
01:02 - so you can use your hands and everything
01:04 - so swing the basketball and
01:07 - make it move i can also use my head
01:24 - you can do
01:31 - [Music]
01:42 - [Music]
01:52 - okay
02:00 - okay so we're back like this and um i
02:03 - just took off my d-wind mask
02:05 - and we are going to start coding so
02:10 - so i were back and um i'm going to turn
02:13 - on the
02:13 - face sensing so yeah uh
02:17 - the face sensing i'm trying to put on my
02:20 - mask
02:21 - but don't don't don't turn it on yet so
02:23 - uh
02:24 - if you click on it it'll just show your
02:26 - face and then i put on my mask right now
02:28 - and it's all
02:29 - disproportioned and everything so i'm
02:31 - just gonna turn it on now
02:33 - click it's gonna turn on i don't want
02:35 - that to happen let's see
02:36 - you see my face no you don't but now we
02:39 - have to get
02:40 - turn video on
02:43 - instead turn it off you don't have to do
02:46 - this because
02:47 - i don't want a face reveal so i'm just
02:49 - going to turn it off so you can't you
02:51 - don't have to see my face and i don't
02:52 - have to
02:53 - uh suffocate in this mask so um
02:57 - the first thing we're going to do is the
03:00 - um is drawing the basketball
03:03 - we don't need this at all
03:07 - oh yeah we have nothing on our um
03:09 - backpack this is today
03:10 - so we have a basketball if you do not
03:12 - know how to draw a basketball hoop
03:14 - uh we draw on our own and if you don't
03:16 - know how to draw you can just go down
03:18 - our project and export it
03:19 - and we also need uh we're gonna draw
03:22 - a basketball paint
03:27 - first you start the rectangle the
03:28 - outline is four
03:30 - and it's black and the inside
03:34 - is a dark grayish blackish color with a
03:37 - 4 or 5
03:38 - if you want to and we're going to start
03:40 - out with a nice rectangle
03:43 - a light nice long pool because every
03:46 - basketball
03:47 - has a pole and you have to have the
03:50 - rectangle on the bottom and we're gonna
03:53 - proportion that
03:54 - so now it's all even and then now you
03:57 - gotta make this
03:58 - the board you know all basketball hoops
04:00 - have a board so the thickness has to be
04:02 - 15 at this point i'm pretty sure and
04:06 - it has to be a light gray color because
04:08 - all boards are light gray or sometimes
04:10 - white
04:11 - uh and now it's 10 it's 10 yeah and
04:15 - uh we have this and we're gonna make the
04:16 - whole entire rectangle
04:22 - so yeah and we're gonna put that on top
04:27 - and we're gonna
04:31 - do the smaller rectangle inside
04:34 - which is just another rectangle but just
04:37 - slightly smaller
04:38 - because they always have that i don't
04:39 - know why they waste paint just to do a
04:42 - smaller
04:43 - uh rectangle it doesn't matter but uh
04:45 - and then we have a red rectangle
04:47 - it's to help you balance the ball so we
04:49 - just make a red rectangle
04:53 - with no fill
04:57 - so no fill
05:01 - so the fill is going to be the same
05:03 - color as the scoreboard
05:04 - now i mean the board and then the
05:06 - outline is red
05:12 - and that would be 15.
05:19 - so yeah
05:23 - so yeah uh we're gonna make that 15 and
05:26 - there we go we got a scoreboard and we
05:28 - just
05:28 - did not scoreboard but the thing that
05:30 - helps you balance the goal over there
05:32 - and now we got to make the uh goal
05:35 - itself the hoop
05:36 - so we first start out with a dark brown
05:39 - color almost a maroon
05:41 - uh darkish color not black a little bit
05:44 - lighter ish
05:51 - so a brownish color
05:55 - and we got more of a burgundy color
05:59 - and there we go burgundy same thing so
06:02 - we got 15
06:02 - thickness and uh we put
06:06 - a straight line hold shift remember
06:09 - and drag it across and there you got
06:12 - the top of the hoop and now you got to
06:14 - make the net itself
06:16 - which is a brown color
06:20 - a brown color
06:24 - you should just have to drag it down
06:26 - there and
06:28 - we have to make the net so hold
06:31 - shift no hold shift because you have to
06:34 - make a line like that
06:36 - because the hoop is not just um
06:40 - like just put like not straight it's
06:43 - more of uh sideways so you want to do
06:46 - ctrl c
06:47 - ctrl v we and then we can flip
06:50 - horizontal
06:51 - so that will be on the other side and we
06:53 - can just move it
07:00 - up
07:02 - and we're gonna put a third line in the
07:03 - middle of course because that's how the
07:05 - hoop is so shift this time because it's
07:07 - straight
07:09 - and we're gonna put two lines on the
07:11 - sides so remember
07:12 - hold shift are these two
07:16 - and hold shift for the other this might
07:19 - be worse than my last goal
07:21 - because of the bottom and all we have to
07:23 - do is just
07:24 - group these together drag them on the
07:27 - uh wooden thing not the wooden thing but
07:29 - the thing
07:31 - that holds the net and we can make that
07:33 - thing go in front
07:35 - and we group that
07:41 - again and we place it on
07:44 - the thing so there we go a basketball
07:47 - hoop
07:47 - so if you do not know how to draw this
07:48 - still just export it
07:50 - and we can just make this a little
07:52 - thinner
07:55 - little just thinner
07:58 - but you know uh
08:01 - we still have it in our backpack so we
08:04 - just have to drag
08:07 - i think it's this one
08:10 - so i don't think we have in our backpack
08:13 - so i'm just gonna
08:14 - so i'm gonna put this like that a little
08:17 - skinnier
08:18 - but not too fat like the last one
08:22 - a little down and maybe
08:26 - so there we go all we have to do is just
08:28 - do control c
08:29 - and make the scoreboards right which is
08:32 - paint control v
08:33 - and there we go the scoreboard sprite
08:35 - and we got to make it on top of the net
08:37 - but not really on top of the net so it's
08:40 - actually on the bottom of the net
08:42 - behind the net but actually in front of
08:45 - the hoop
08:46 - so i mean the uh
08:49 - the thing where you shoot the thing in
08:53 - the goal and uh we gotta put that on top
08:55 - and then we have to make it go to back
08:57 - later
09:04 - gotta make it go to back layer
09:13 - so i'm gonna just change the backdrop so
09:15 - all we need oh
09:16 - yeah i'm gonna click this real quick
09:18 - wait a second so they'll go to the
09:20 - backlight
09:22 - and then we have to make the um blue
09:24 - backdrop which is
09:26 - um just a blue color
09:30 - regular look at this color
09:34 - and then we make a gigan it doesn't
09:37 - matter about the red thing
09:39 - you won't be able to see it anyways but
09:41 - like still
09:45 - yeah and we got it and we're gonna so
09:50 - now we're gonna move we're gonna code
09:52 - the basketball we don't have much code
09:54 - so that's the good part because we can
09:56 - make a fun face sensing game without
09:59 - much code and then now we need to when
10:01 - the green flag is clicked
10:02 - it will go show go switch
10:05 - costume switch backdrop
10:10 - oh it's already that same backdrop it'll
10:12 - go to
10:13 - a position and i'm gonna move it up here
10:16 - around here
10:18 - and it will point in direction 180 so
10:21 - it'll
10:21 - be pointing down
10:26 - and we're gonna have set score to zero
10:31 - new variable
10:36 - set score to zero and turn video on
10:41 - but we're not going to turn it on until
10:43 - the end where i wear the demon mask and
10:45 - everything
10:46 - you know set video transparency to 20 so
10:49 - it'll be not that faint because 50 is
10:52 - very faint
10:53 - and yeah so we need to see and then wait
10:55 - two seconds
10:58 - i i hope i don't click on the green flag
11:00 - on this thing and also turn on
11:02 - everything
11:03 - and wait two seconds and it'll go
11:05 - forever
11:08 - move 10 seconds and if on the edge it
11:10 - will bounce
11:12 - 10 steps
11:16 - this is a very dangerous code block and
11:19 - dangerous and now we're going to work on
11:23 - another piece of code we have so when
11:25 - the green flag is collect
11:27 - it will go forever
11:30 - it will you need to make a
11:33 - score called high score i'll do it in a
11:36 - second so i'm going to make that a
11:37 - second
11:38 - right here variables you know we have
11:41 - high
11:42 - score cloud variable
11:46 - so we have that and um
11:50 - and we have if then
11:54 - if then the score
11:57 - is greater than the high score
12:04 - then it will set high score
12:07 - to score that means if you get a higher
12:10 - score than the world score
12:12 - or whoever plays this game score that
12:14 - means it will set the score
12:16 - to that score and then now if then
12:20 - if then not inside the if then but
12:22 - inside the forever
12:23 - if that is touching sprite 2 which is
12:26 - now target square
12:33 - now target square
12:38 - then it will start sound drum bass too
12:50 - yeah and then we need to change the
12:53 - score by one
12:58 - and hide
13:04 - and it will wait 0.5 seconds
13:09 - and it will show
13:14 - and then after that it will go to a
13:17 - position which is just the same thing as
13:20 - this position
13:21 - and point and direction
13:25 - 180 so where's that block
13:33 - and then we're going to have when the
13:34 - video motion
13:37 - is greater than 10 it'll start to sound
13:40 - boiling
13:41 - and it will send it flying
13:45 - okay so i'm going to use the boiling and
13:47 - b-o-i-n-g
13:52 - this one so blink starts on boink
13:56 - and then point and direction
14:00 - point where is that block point and
14:03 - direction there you
14:04 - are uh video direction
14:09 - video motion on
14:13 - sprite on sprite
14:16 - and when the s key is pressed it will
14:19 - stop
14:20 - everything because if if you just click
14:23 - the stop
14:24 - key uh if you just click the
14:27 - regular stop like the stop sign
14:30 - it will just keep on going this the the
14:34 - basketball the video will keep on going
14:37 - in the basketball and everything
14:38 - but we just need to do this so then turn
14:41 - the video off
14:46 - and it will stop all
14:51 - and now i'm going to get my demon face
14:53 - mask so wait a second
14:55 - so i got my face mask back and now i'm
14:58 - going to
14:59 - save now i'm going to move the high
15:01 - score
15:03 - to that side and now we're going to play
15:10 - it
15:12 - okay so i'm going to full screen this
15:15 - and let's start so i got my mask back
15:20 - so my camera's on
15:38 - oh
16:04 - [Music]
16:13 - so so yeah um have you uh please like
16:17 - share subscribe and comment in the
16:20 - comment section below
16:22 - uh and like basically anything you want
16:24 - to come
16:25 - like like any new projects that you
16:27 - could ask for and we can make it
16:29 - so anyways see you guys
16:33 - next oh i forgot to rename the project
16:34 - let me do this i just saw that
16:36 - oh what is this supposed to be called
16:37 - free throw basketball right
16:40 - yeah i think it's called free throw
16:41 - basketball and yeah
16:43 - we have it so anyways see you guys
16:48 - next
16:53 - [Music]
17:00 - you

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here and today we're back for another video on scratch and today we'll be making another face sensing game called free throw basketball and i'll be wearing the same demon mask so if you do not enjoy demon masks please do not watch the video while i do it i don't know why but okay so anyways i'm gonna show you the demo so i'm not going to start it yet because my face i get give me the mask i got the face mask on not the face mask the demon mask oh my demon mask in a basketball hoop and you try to get the basketball to touch the uh so you can use your hands and everything so swing the basketball and make it move i can also use my head you can do okay okay so we're back like this and um i just took off my dwind mask and we are going to start coding so so i were back and um i'm going to turn on the face sensing so yeah uh the face sensing i'm trying to put on my mask but don't don't don't turn it on yet so uh if you click on it it'll just show your face and then i put on my mask right now and it's all disproportioned and everything so i'm just gonna turn it on now click it's gonna turn on i don't want that to happen let's see you see my face no you don't but now we have to get turn video on instead turn it off you don't have to do this because i don't want a face reveal so i'm just going to turn it off so you can't you don't have to see my face and i don't have to uh suffocate in this mask so um the first thing we're going to do is the um is drawing the basketball we don't need this at all oh yeah we have nothing on our um backpack this is today so we have a basketball if you do not know how to draw a basketball hoop uh we draw on our own and if you don't know how to draw you can just go down our project and export it and we also need uh we're gonna draw a basketball paint first you start the rectangle the outline is four and it's black and the inside is a dark grayish blackish color with a 4 or 5 if you want to and we're going to start out with a nice rectangle a light nice long pool because every basketball has a pole and you have to have the rectangle on the bottom and we're gonna proportion that so now it's all even and then now you gotta make this the board you know all basketball hoops have a board so the thickness has to be 15 at this point i'm pretty sure and it has to be a light gray color because all boards are light gray or sometimes white uh and now it's 10 it's 10 yeah and uh we have this and we're gonna make the whole entire rectangle so yeah and we're gonna put that on top and we're gonna do the smaller rectangle inside which is just another rectangle but just slightly smaller because they always have that i don't know why they waste paint just to do a smaller uh rectangle it doesn't matter but uh and then we have a red rectangle it's to help you balance the ball so we just make a red rectangle with no fill so no fill so the fill is going to be the same color as the scoreboard now i mean the board and then the outline is red and that would be 15. so yeah so yeah uh we're gonna make that 15 and there we go we got a scoreboard and we just did not scoreboard but the thing that helps you balance the goal over there and now we got to make the uh goal itself the hoop so we first start out with a dark brown color almost a maroon uh darkish color not black a little bit lighter ish so a brownish color and we got more of a burgundy color and there we go burgundy same thing so we got 15 thickness and uh we put a straight line hold shift remember and drag it across and there you got the top of the hoop and now you got to make the net itself which is a brown color a brown color you should just have to drag it down there and we have to make the net so hold shift no hold shift because you have to make a line like that because the hoop is not just um like just put like not straight it's more of uh sideways so you want to do ctrl c ctrl v we and then we can flip horizontal so that will be on the other side and we can just move it up and we're gonna put a third line in the middle of course because that's how the hoop is so shift this time because it's straight and we're gonna put two lines on the sides so remember hold shift are these two and hold shift for the other this might be worse than my last goal because of the bottom and all we have to do is just group these together drag them on the uh wooden thing not the wooden thing but the thing that holds the net and we can make that thing go in front and we group that again and we place it on the thing so there we go a basketball hoop so if you do not know how to draw this still just export it and we can just make this a little thinner little just thinner but you know uh we still have it in our backpack so we just have to drag i think it's this one so i don't think we have in our backpack so i'm just gonna so i'm gonna put this like that a little skinnier but not too fat like the last one a little down and maybe so there we go all we have to do is just do control c and make the scoreboards right which is paint control v and there we go the scoreboard sprite and we got to make it on top of the net but not really on top of the net so it's actually on the bottom of the net behind the net but actually in front of the hoop so i mean the uh the thing where you shoot the thing in the goal and uh we gotta put that on top and then we have to make it go to back later gotta make it go to back layer so i'm gonna just change the backdrop so all we need oh yeah i'm gonna click this real quick wait a second so they'll go to the backlight and then we have to make the um blue backdrop which is um just a blue color regular look at this color and then we make a gigan it doesn't matter about the red thing you won't be able to see it anyways but like still yeah and we got it and we're gonna so now we're gonna move we're gonna code the basketball we don't have much code so that's the good part because we can make a fun face sensing game without much code and then now we need to when the green flag is clicked it will go show go switch costume switch backdrop oh it's already that same backdrop it'll go to a position and i'm gonna move it up here around here and it will point in direction 180 so it'll be pointing down and we're gonna have set score to zero new variable set score to zero and turn video on but we're not going to turn it on until the end where i wear the demon mask and everything you know set video transparency to 20 so it'll be not that faint because 50 is very faint and yeah so we need to see and then wait two seconds i i hope i don't click on the green flag on this thing and also turn on everything and wait two seconds and it'll go forever move 10 seconds and if on the edge it will bounce 10 steps this is a very dangerous code block and dangerous and now we're going to work on another piece of code we have so when the green flag is collect it will go forever it will you need to make a score called high score i'll do it in a second so i'm going to make that a second right here variables you know we have high score cloud variable so we have that and um and we have if then if then the score is greater than the high score then it will set high score to score that means if you get a higher score than the world score or whoever plays this game score that means it will set the score to that score and then now if then if then not inside the if then but inside the forever if that is touching sprite 2 which is now target square now target square then it will start sound drum bass too yeah and then we need to change the score by one and hide and it will wait 0.5 seconds and it will show and then after that it will go to a position which is just the same thing as this position and point and direction 180 so where's that block and then we're going to have when the video motion is greater than 10 it'll start to sound boiling and it will send it flying okay so i'm going to use the boiling and boing this one so blink starts on boink and then point and direction point where is that block point and direction there you are uh video direction video motion on sprite on sprite and when the s key is pressed it will stop everything because if if you just click the stop key uh if you just click the regular stop like the stop sign it will just keep on going this the the basketball the video will keep on going in the basketball and everything but we just need to do this so then turn the video off and it will stop all and now i'm going to get my demon face mask so wait a second so i got my face mask back and now i'm going to save now i'm going to move the high score to that side and now we're going to play it okay so i'm going to full screen this and let's start so i got my mask back so my camera's on oh so so yeah um have you uh please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below uh and like basically anything you want to come like like any new projects that you could ask for and we can make it so anyways see you guys next oh i forgot to rename the project let me do this i just saw that oh what is this supposed to be called free throw basketball right yeah i think it's called free throw basketball and yeah we have it so anyways see you guys next you
