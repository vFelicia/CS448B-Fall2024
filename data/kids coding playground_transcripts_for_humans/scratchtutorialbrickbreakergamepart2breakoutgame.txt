00:09 - hello guys welcome back remember we were
00:13 - working on a previous lesson for break
00:14 - breaker
00:15 - so now we'll work on continuing with
00:18 - this lesson
00:19 - adding the star for the bonus point and
00:23 - also making that stage continue after
00:26 - you break all the breaks okay let's
00:28 - begin before we begin please subscribe
00:32 - like give us a comment and share with
00:36 - your friend ok alright ok now what we
00:41 - need to do is we need to make two new
00:43 - variable actually number of breaks so
00:51 - this variable keep track of how many
00:53 - breaks we have and also how many breaks
00:55 - we'll generate for the clock and also we
01:00 - will add one say you win so this
01:03 - variable check if the player wins the
01:06 - game if they win the game we can proceed
01:09 - to the next level all right so we have
01:13 - those two variable and we also fixed it
01:16 - the issue with the bounce on the
01:19 - previous lesson to make it more random
01:21 - with the bounce now welcome to the
01:26 - breaks okay let's go back to the break
01:31 - so so far this is what we have put a
01:34 - code for the breaks we are called the
01:36 - change disco a little bit what we're
01:39 - going to do is we are going to create
01:41 - some custom function as you remember I
01:45 - custom block because right here
01:46 - basically if you create a custom block
01:49 - you can reuse those block again so
01:54 - that's what we are going to do okay what
01:59 - we can do is this okay call it create
02:03 - right so this function will help us
02:09 - create the breaks we will move this Co
02:13 - here
02:14 - we're gonna set the number of breaks
02:17 - let's let's put them on this in the
02:20 - bottom for now okay we'll say set number
02:27 - break let's say we sin say ten or twenty
02:31 - or five whatever we have I said we say
02:34 - ten with us we have the cohere right
02:37 - we'll put this in here so basically
02:40 - whatever we're going to try and do here
02:42 - we go we are going to put it here that
02:45 - ways we can reuse this oops
02:48 - need to high and then we need to repeat
02:53 - itself I will say repeat by the number
02:57 - of breaks we have setup in this variable
03:00 - then we call the chrome of myself and
03:02 - then we are going to podcast a new
03:05 - message this will tell when the break is
03:10 - finished cloning so we can have the star
03:13 - okay right now this start what we are
03:22 - going to do is we can reuse this code
03:24 - calling this create break okay
03:28 - so we have to find a custom block here
03:31 - to for cream the breaks and we're
03:33 - calling T start to create a brace okay
03:38 - also we need to make some changes to on
03:42 - to this as well with the game over okay
03:47 - they're not secured here it's in case
03:51 - you guys want to look at the call again
03:55 - let's put them closer together we can
03:57 - zoom in one more time okay okay so this
04:03 - is still the same right and you can give
04:06 - the pin score correct and the bounce and
04:10 - then we say so what we can do it with a
04:15 - keep track up number break still have
04:17 - left so they break a break where the say
04:21 - change the break before we delete it was
04:25 - a chain
04:25 - Break by minus one so we can check this
04:29 - variable later how many breaks I have
04:31 - left when we have no more breaks we can
04:33 - create an X next stage for the photo
04:37 - player so that's why wouldn't this
04:39 - variable here so subtract one from that
04:42 - so we have ten breaks we subtract one
04:44 - with nine breaks and then any breaks and
04:47 - then so on and so forth until zero
04:48 - breaks right so now then we notice
04:51 - there's no more break okay so let's go
04:57 - to the stall or at least all right so
05:03 - type in star here
05:08 - so this is our bonus don't miss a sprite
05:13 - that the player can catch okay so we
05:17 - remember we broadcast the message shall
05:22 - prick finish cloning what we want to do
05:26 - is we don't want to generate the star on
05:28 - top of the brain so we want to wait for
05:30 - the break to finish cloning so a podcast
05:33 - is message so basically all the bricks
05:35 - are laid then we're gonna generate the
05:37 - star on top of it then put in a
05:39 - different location so the star we can
05:42 - have it the size or we can do a little
05:45 - bit smaller you can say set that says
05:48 - cider 75 see how it looks
05:50 - do those okay 100 looks a little bit
05:58 - better it didn't is 75 looks like it's
06:00 - just something cut off here and this I
06:02 - am not sure why so let's leave it I'm
06:05 - good we're gonna change it okay so what
06:09 - we need to do is we're going to hide the
06:11 - first just similar to the other one and
06:13 - we are going to use a repeat loop here
06:16 - we are going to repeat only three star
06:18 - to be bonus star but I'm gonna till we
06:21 - pit so many okay and who had to go back
06:26 - over here say it create a call myself
06:31 - so basically three times I'll create
06:33 - three star and then we are going to
06:36 - podcast
06:37 - a message so we'll podcast a message
06:42 - saying the message saying star club
06:49 - finish but that way would let the game
06:52 - know that game can be begin now we
06:54 - created breaks and we created star a
06:57 - crane can begin so we can change the
06:59 - game to look for this message later on
07:01 - so this is how we can change between
07:03 - these different sprite when we
07:06 - podcasting messages so similarly we had
07:09 - done that for the game over right for
07:12 - the other one with at that we receive
07:15 - game over you want to say stop stop
07:20 - other scripting sprite basically
07:22 - stopping this scrip or whatever other
07:24 - script is have and also we want to have
07:27 - one more in the beginning we also want
07:30 - to hide this star we don't want the star
07:32 - to be showing up okay okay so we have
07:37 - all the code for the star so far okay
07:41 - let's move on okay okay we have this
07:50 - cause of all we need to add some more
07:53 - when I stop as a clone I have not done
07:55 - any code for that we need to put that in
07:57 - if not then it will walk okay we're to
08:03 - go back here I'm gonna say when I start
08:06 - as a clone basically this is the right
08:09 - way career clone myself this one wash we
08:12 - call this code whatever you are going to
08:14 - put down here right now or say show so
08:18 - we want to show them the star and we can
08:24 - go to go to random position what we can
08:30 - do is part we can copy some code from
08:32 - here as well so let's just copy this
08:35 - okay let's go make it a little bit
08:38 - faster so track it kind of you see
08:39 - wobbly a little bit we drop it so now we
08:43 - copied it the go here so what we are
08:46 - going to do
08:47 - modify disco a little bit so it will be
08:51 - fast plus okay so we have the random
08:54 - position and what we going to do is
09:00 - you're going to add another loop here
09:04 - okay repeat until so what we want to do
09:08 - is repeat until it's not touching the
09:12 - break so basically after break generated
09:14 - we're gonna put the star around the area
09:16 - maybe we'll give it a little bit more
09:20 - yeah maybe yeah let's see how it
09:24 - generative it doesn't generate well we
09:26 - can we can change this position make you
09:28 - know give it more space or we can you
09:31 - know change the number break it less
09:34 - right or we can change the start or be
09:37 - smaller so what we are going to do we're
09:39 - gonna use one of this operator called
09:41 - not basically this is the opposite of is
09:44 - right so it's not so not touching what
09:48 - we say not touching not touching the
09:52 - breaks oh we didn't even name it okay oh
09:56 - okay let's bring in this corporate okay
10:01 - so we are gonna say not touching the
10:05 - break okay and then we are going to make
10:10 - it generate again so if you touch the
10:15 - break it will try to move move out and
10:17 - create something else create another
10:21 - position so we'll say ok there's
10:24 - touching baseball we want to hide we
10:28 - want to give some bonus point I don't
10:29 - know it doesn't matter we can say let's
10:31 - say 25 points right bonus right and then
10:36 - we'll podcast balance and we delete this
10:38 - clone we don't need this here because
10:41 - this is not related break won't delete
10:44 - that then we'll also check ok we will
10:50 - check another condition here
10:54 - so what we wanted to is you remember I
10:59 - didn't mention about a clone right every
11:01 - time you use a clone the other thing
11:02 - lead it right but let's say you've
11:05 - completed all the breaks but you did not
11:07 - get out of stock you still have to
11:09 - delete it if not the game will be messed
11:11 - up you'll see if you don't do that I can
11:16 - probably show you in a bit but let me
11:19 - call this first and then I can show you
11:21 - later what I mean okay here we have the
11:25 - whole data there's some condition here
11:29 - we'll check this variable you when we
11:34 - created earlier we are going to
11:36 - initialize it later okay but for now
11:39 - let's say we check you in yes then we
11:43 - also have to delete this clone if not it
11:46 - will be messed up I'll show you later
11:48 - okay so this is what we have so far for
11:50 - this star okay now we have the complete
11:56 - call of the star let's go back somehow a
12:00 - little bit so this is everything we can
12:03 - find laid up little bit nicer here so
12:06 - that you can see everything in one
12:09 - screen so this is how it's gonna look so
12:12 - you need to pause the screen look at
12:15 - your comb it she looks kind of similar
12:17 - okay alright we'll go back to the
12:21 - baseball now so let's go back to the
12:24 - baseball we are going to change the Coe
12:28 - a little bit instead of like this score
12:32 - check here and all that will change it a
12:34 - little bit so what we're going to do is
12:36 - we are going to leave this the same
12:40 - leave this the same will break this guy
12:41 - out we are going to take another here
12:45 - variable we initialize you wind right we
12:49 - need set it to something like no so in
12:52 - the beginning of the game you win will
12:54 - be no okay when I receive I want to
12:59 - receive when I when I receive you
13:02 - because this okay so I already have
13:08 - received you in here we'll move it away
13:10 - we'll change this in a bit to change it
13:12 - a little bit so we are going to changes
13:15 - in the way we will do this now we are
13:19 - going to move this set variable so when
13:26 - we say when we get you in this message
13:29 - basically we break the lot of breaks we
13:31 - walk on the set - yes and then we'll say
13:36 - when right for two - second right and
13:40 - what we can do is whether we set this
13:43 - ball at the position so we'll reset it
13:47 - back to zero we can go back to the
13:49 - center so that same start and we are
13:52 - going to broadcast a message say start
13:55 - again so this will help us to restart
13:57 - the game so we'll say start again and
14:04 - after we we have set it to when Raptor
14:08 - when we need to set it back to know so
14:11 - that way we can restart the game right
14:13 - just like how we did in the beginning so
14:16 - you have to track this back out and you
14:19 - know you're selecting you win and you
14:22 - put know so this will create the reset
14:26 - the variable like what we did here every
14:28 - setting the variable and allow us to
14:30 - start the game again well delete this
14:32 - stop all for now we all right we also
14:35 - took out this part we need to change it
14:37 - later so now we will have to wait until
14:44 - the star is finished or you remember we
14:46 - the star but cast right star come finish
14:50 - so this is when the stars finished the
14:52 - clone then we can begin our game so we
14:56 - have to say receive okay when I receive
15:06 - okay in septums we are going to work on
15:10 - this part here when I receive star
15:13 - chrome finish so
15:15 - starts done what we wanted we give it a
15:18 - little time won't give one second
15:21 - wait just like what we had already will
15:25 - track this up connect here and we are
15:30 - going to change this out and repeat
15:33 - until the score is equal to 15 we are
15:36 - going to take this out we are going to
15:39 - say repeat until the prick number prick
15:44 - is zero so basically you're no more
15:46 - breaks then we are going to say you know
15:51 - you win the game so before that hole
15:53 - keep on bouncing right and then we'd get
15:56 - to 160 also and right and then if you
16:00 - create break all the breaks and you what
16:03 - can you win so this is what we have so
16:06 - far let's zoom out a little bit so this
16:10 - is kinda hard ko I think if I did not
16:13 - miss anything I let it go check so this
16:16 - is kind of Hanako that we have so far
16:20 - okay for the game okay so you guys hope
16:27 - you guys can see everything okay so now
16:31 - what we need to do is we have go back to
16:33 - the break when we receive so we podcast
16:38 - start again right on the on the baseball
16:40 - so we say okay when I receive start
16:45 - again I need to create a break so that's
16:49 - why we need to create this custom block
16:50 - here so that we can reuse it like in the
16:53 - beginning and when we receive this game
16:55 - the sub message saying start again right
16:58 - okay so let's see if I can actually walk
17:03 - if not then we might need to debug this
17:05 - game so debug is meaning like if you see
17:08 - if there's any issue with the game is
17:10 - trying to see way is having problem and
17:12 - you have to fix it so let's just try it
17:14 - out okay okay so as you can see we
17:21 - generate the breaks or restore did not
17:23 - touch the
17:24 - all right we can get the star come on oh
17:34 - forget it stop so as you can see the it
17:38 - hits all the brakes you see it connected
17:41 - it started the new came again Wow
17:43 - so yeah after you break all the breaks
17:45 - you don't need to get on the star that's
17:47 - right it created a new king so if you
17:51 - get the let's get a lumber break let's
17:53 - make it like five or something so then
17:55 - we go a little bit faster right to
17:57 - finish this game so let's test this out
18:00 - right so we can see right we have the
18:05 - right star so catch the star okay so we
18:11 - cut all the stuff at this time
18:12 - so number break as you can see in one
18:15 - right right right
18:17 - so this is quite a bit difficult to get
18:21 - it right this pause not be dating okay I
18:29 - think I might have to change this co-op
18:31 - it okay so we kept all the stall
18:37 - everything is done you know it created a
18:40 - new game ah okay let me see hmm okay so
18:48 - also you have to make sure that you
18:51 - delete this part of the code for the
18:53 - panel because we changed a co-write to
18:57 - now that when when you when you break
19:00 - all the breaks you can still start the
19:02 - game again right so what we need to do
19:05 - is going to go back to the param I show
19:07 - you this code if not all not work
19:09 - correctly all right so once we remove
19:12 - this code and let's test out him again
19:16 - what we can do it with one brake only
19:19 - for the testing purposes so we laughs
19:23 - faster
19:25 - [Music]
19:30 - double-click I don't know doesn't look
19:34 - good right these things - ok oh well
19:37 - because it's because our name is too
19:39 - long you can say maybe we'll change it
19:43 - to rename it to inside number but this
19:53 - may be ok
19:55 - that may be better ok ok let's just test
20:01 - it again
20:02 - so as you can see it brought us up so
20:06 - when we create it we win so we create a
20:09 - new one new stage right for us so we
20:12 - don't need to make it or the star but we
20:15 - do need to get all the break ah ok so I
20:19 - was saying earlier about a clone so
20:22 - let's say we don't have this correct
20:24 - well you will see how this is for the
20:27 - function correctly let's run this again
20:29 - so first we have 20 star looks correct
20:34 - right so let me I think I need to make
20:40 - it more stand and show you let's say 10
20:44 - star ok so when we start the game we'll
20:48 - run it again you see it created tensed
20:50 - alright right so like I kept all the
20:53 - breaks
20:54 - you see oh you see bunch of stock
20:55 - regular you know you see how it is so so
21:01 - so as you can see it duplicate it like
21:03 - like top of whatever star that's
21:07 - remaining because we do not have that
21:09 - delete clone you see right so so this is
21:12 - not right so that's why you that's to
21:14 - make sure that you delete your your your
21:20 - call back here ok so let's start again
21:24 - so now we have 1 3 star so as you see
21:29 - one break ok so now we got that so you
21:38 - see it was only 3 star it doesn't create
21:40 - more more than 3
21:43 - so even the munis right there's only
21:46 - three you see so this is correct
21:48 - all right I think that is everything we
21:51 - can say you came and maybe change the
21:54 - break back to your like you know ten
21:58 - breaks or something like that just
21:59 - change it to a number break here and the
22:02 - game will start with ten break and then
22:05 - you know one you can change your start a
22:06 - little smaller maybe 75% or something
22:10 - then you can add it over here or 50%
22:15 - that way you can fit more fit fit the
22:19 - star pattern I think that's at that you
22:22 - can see so as you can see that little
22:25 - stars there right so bring little
22:27 - smaller than the bright corner together
22:29 - so that's about it but a game right okay
22:33 - hope you guys like it and please give a
22:35 - thumbs up and comment and and subscribe
22:40 - to our Channel all right thank you have
22:42 - a good day bye bye
22:46 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome back remember we were working on a previous lesson for break breaker so now we'll work on continuing with this lesson adding the star for the bonus point and also making that stage continue after you break all the breaks okay let's begin before we begin please subscribe like give us a comment and share with your friend ok alright ok now what we need to do is we need to make two new variable actually number of breaks so this variable keep track of how many breaks we have and also how many breaks we'll generate for the clock and also we will add one say you win so this variable check if the player wins the game if they win the game we can proceed to the next level all right so we have those two variable and we also fixed it the issue with the bounce on the previous lesson to make it more random with the bounce now welcome to the breaks okay let's go back to the break so so far this is what we have put a code for the breaks we are called the change disco a little bit what we're going to do is we are going to create some custom function as you remember I custom block because right here basically if you create a custom block you can reuse those block again so that's what we are going to do okay what we can do is this okay call it create right so this function will help us create the breaks we will move this Co here we're gonna set the number of breaks let's let's put them on this in the bottom for now okay we'll say set number break let's say we sin say ten or twenty or five whatever we have I said we say ten with us we have the cohere right we'll put this in here so basically whatever we're going to try and do here we go we are going to put it here that ways we can reuse this oops need to high and then we need to repeat itself I will say repeat by the number of breaks we have setup in this variable then we call the chrome of myself and then we are going to podcast a new message this will tell when the break is finished cloning so we can have the star okay right now this start what we are going to do is we can reuse this code calling this create break okay so we have to find a custom block here to for cream the breaks and we're calling T start to create a brace okay also we need to make some changes to on to this as well with the game over okay they're not secured here it's in case you guys want to look at the call again let's put them closer together we can zoom in one more time okay okay so this is still the same right and you can give the pin score correct and the bounce and then we say so what we can do it with a keep track up number break still have left so they break a break where the say change the break before we delete it was a chain Break by minus one so we can check this variable later how many breaks I have left when we have no more breaks we can create an X next stage for the photo player so that's why wouldn't this variable here so subtract one from that so we have ten breaks we subtract one with nine breaks and then any breaks and then so on and so forth until zero breaks right so now then we notice there's no more break okay so let's go to the stall or at least all right so type in star here so this is our bonus don't miss a sprite that the player can catch okay so we remember we broadcast the message shall prick finish cloning what we want to do is we don't want to generate the star on top of the brain so we want to wait for the break to finish cloning so a podcast is message so basically all the bricks are laid then we're gonna generate the star on top of it then put in a different location so the star we can have it the size or we can do a little bit smaller you can say set that says cider 75 see how it looks do those okay 100 looks a little bit better it didn't is 75 looks like it's just something cut off here and this I am not sure why so let's leave it I'm good we're gonna change it okay so what we need to do is we're going to hide the first just similar to the other one and we are going to use a repeat loop here we are going to repeat only three star to be bonus star but I'm gonna till we pit so many okay and who had to go back over here say it create a call myself so basically three times I'll create three star and then we are going to podcast a message so we'll podcast a message saying the message saying star club finish but that way would let the game know that game can be begin now we created breaks and we created star a crane can begin so we can change the game to look for this message later on so this is how we can change between these different sprite when we podcasting messages so similarly we had done that for the game over right for the other one with at that we receive game over you want to say stop stop other scripting sprite basically stopping this scrip or whatever other script is have and also we want to have one more in the beginning we also want to hide this star we don't want the star to be showing up okay okay so we have all the code for the star so far okay let's move on okay okay we have this cause of all we need to add some more when I stop as a clone I have not done any code for that we need to put that in if not then it will walk okay we're to go back here I'm gonna say when I start as a clone basically this is the right way career clone myself this one wash we call this code whatever you are going to put down here right now or say show so we want to show them the star and we can go to go to random position what we can do is part we can copy some code from here as well so let's just copy this okay let's go make it a little bit faster so track it kind of you see wobbly a little bit we drop it so now we copied it the go here so what we are going to do modify disco a little bit so it will be fast plus okay so we have the random position and what we going to do is you're going to add another loop here okay repeat until so what we want to do is repeat until it's not touching the break so basically after break generated we're gonna put the star around the area maybe we'll give it a little bit more yeah maybe yeah let's see how it generative it doesn't generate well we can we can change this position make you know give it more space or we can you know change the number break it less right or we can change the start or be smaller so what we are going to do we're gonna use one of this operator called not basically this is the opposite of is right so it's not so not touching what we say not touching not touching the breaks oh we didn't even name it okay oh okay let's bring in this corporate okay so we are gonna say not touching the break okay and then we are going to make it generate again so if you touch the break it will try to move move out and create something else create another position so we'll say ok there's touching baseball we want to hide we want to give some bonus point I don't know it doesn't matter we can say let's say 25 points right bonus right and then we'll podcast balance and we delete this clone we don't need this here because this is not related break won't delete that then we'll also check ok we will check another condition here so what we wanted to is you remember I didn't mention about a clone right every time you use a clone the other thing lead it right but let's say you've completed all the breaks but you did not get out of stock you still have to delete it if not the game will be messed up you'll see if you don't do that I can probably show you in a bit but let me call this first and then I can show you later what I mean okay here we have the whole data there's some condition here we'll check this variable you when we created earlier we are going to initialize it later okay but for now let's say we check you in yes then we also have to delete this clone if not it will be messed up I'll show you later okay so this is what we have so far for this star okay now we have the complete call of the star let's go back somehow a little bit so this is everything we can find laid up little bit nicer here so that you can see everything in one screen so this is how it's gonna look so you need to pause the screen look at your comb it she looks kind of similar okay alright we'll go back to the baseball now so let's go back to the baseball we are going to change the Coe a little bit instead of like this score check here and all that will change it a little bit so what we're going to do is we are going to leave this the same leave this the same will break this guy out we are going to take another here variable we initialize you wind right we need set it to something like no so in the beginning of the game you win will be no okay when I receive I want to receive when I when I receive you because this okay so I already have received you in here we'll move it away we'll change this in a bit to change it a little bit so we are going to changes in the way we will do this now we are going to move this set variable so when we say when we get you in this message basically we break the lot of breaks we walk on the set yes and then we'll say when right for two second right and what we can do is whether we set this ball at the position so we'll reset it back to zero we can go back to the center so that same start and we are going to broadcast a message say start again so this will help us to restart the game so we'll say start again and after we we have set it to when Raptor when we need to set it back to know so that way we can restart the game right just like how we did in the beginning so you have to track this back out and you know you're selecting you win and you put know so this will create the reset the variable like what we did here every setting the variable and allow us to start the game again well delete this stop all for now we all right we also took out this part we need to change it later so now we will have to wait until the star is finished or you remember we the star but cast right star come finish so this is when the stars finished the clone then we can begin our game so we have to say receive okay when I receive okay in septums we are going to work on this part here when I receive star chrome finish so starts done what we wanted we give it a little time won't give one second wait just like what we had already will track this up connect here and we are going to change this out and repeat until the score is equal to 15 we are going to take this out we are going to say repeat until the prick number prick is zero so basically you're no more breaks then we are going to say you know you win the game so before that hole keep on bouncing right and then we'd get to 160 also and right and then if you create break all the breaks and you what can you win so this is what we have so far let's zoom out a little bit so this is kinda hard ko I think if I did not miss anything I let it go check so this is kind of Hanako that we have so far okay for the game okay so you guys hope you guys can see everything okay so now what we need to do is we have go back to the break when we receive so we podcast start again right on the on the baseball so we say okay when I receive start again I need to create a break so that's why we need to create this custom block here so that we can reuse it like in the beginning and when we receive this game the sub message saying start again right okay so let's see if I can actually walk if not then we might need to debug this game so debug is meaning like if you see if there's any issue with the game is trying to see way is having problem and you have to fix it so let's just try it out okay okay so as you can see we generate the breaks or restore did not touch the all right we can get the star come on oh forget it stop so as you can see the it hits all the brakes you see it connected it started the new came again Wow so yeah after you break all the breaks you don't need to get on the star that's right it created a new king so if you get the let's get a lumber break let's make it like five or something so then we go a little bit faster right to finish this game so let's test this out right so we can see right we have the right star so catch the star okay so we cut all the stuff at this time so number break as you can see in one right right right so this is quite a bit difficult to get it right this pause not be dating okay I think I might have to change this coop it okay so we kept all the stall everything is done you know it created a new game ah okay let me see hmm okay so also you have to make sure that you delete this part of the code for the panel because we changed a cowrite to now that when when you when you break all the breaks you can still start the game again right so what we need to do is going to go back to the param I show you this code if not all not work correctly all right so once we remove this code and let's test out him again what we can do it with one brake only for the testing purposes so we laughs faster doubleclick I don't know doesn't look good right these things ok oh well because it's because our name is too long you can say maybe we'll change it to rename it to inside number but this may be ok that may be better ok ok let's just test it again so as you can see it brought us up so when we create it we win so we create a new one new stage right for us so we don't need to make it or the star but we do need to get all the break ah ok so I was saying earlier about a clone so let's say we don't have this correct well you will see how this is for the function correctly let's run this again so first we have 20 star looks correct right so let me I think I need to make it more stand and show you let's say 10 star ok so when we start the game we'll run it again you see it created tensed alright right so like I kept all the breaks you see oh you see bunch of stock regular you know you see how it is so so so as you can see it duplicate it like like top of whatever star that's remaining because we do not have that delete clone you see right so so this is not right so that's why you that's to make sure that you delete your your your call back here ok so let's start again so now we have 1 3 star so as you see one break ok so now we got that so you see it was only 3 star it doesn't create more more than 3 so even the munis right there's only three you see so this is correct all right I think that is everything we can say you came and maybe change the break back to your like you know ten breaks or something like that just change it to a number break here and the game will start with ten break and then you know one you can change your start a little smaller maybe 75% or something then you can add it over here or 50% that way you can fit more fit fit the star pattern I think that's at that you can see so as you can see that little stars there right so bring little smaller than the bright corner together so that's about it but a game right okay hope you guys like it and please give a thumbs up and comment and and subscribe to our Channel all right thank you have a good day bye bye
