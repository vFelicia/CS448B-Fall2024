00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys the kids coding
00:08 - playground here today we'll be doing a
00:10 - new python project on our channel so we
00:13 - haven't done a python video in a while
00:14 - so we're going to be making a dice
00:15 - simulator on python so i will be showing
00:18 - you guys two different ways to make this
00:20 - python
00:21 - dye simulator and one way in scratch how
00:23 - to do it
00:24 - so like i'll show you how it's similar
00:26 - to the one in python we've also made a
00:29 - die simulator on scratch as well so if
00:31 - you want to check that out then you can
00:33 - check that out on our channel
00:34 - and without further ado let's start a
00:36 - new project so click file new project
00:39 - right we have a new project right so
00:40 - we're going to rename it so if you don't
00:43 - uh don't know how to do this like
00:45 - starting a new project and like setting
00:46 - up python um you should watch our
00:48 - beginners tutorial on python we have
00:50 - like how to set up pycharm and all that
00:52 - stuff so you can check that out if you
00:55 - are new to python okay so we're going to
00:57 - name our project i'm going to name it
00:59 - die simulator
01:02 - simulator for video
01:05 - because i already have a project named
01:07 - simulator so it would like kind of mess
01:09 - it up so
01:10 - it can't be the same thing we're going
01:12 - to create it and i'm just going to put
01:13 - it as this window
01:15 - right here we have our project it's
01:17 - starting up
01:22 - all right so it's now started up we're
01:24 - going to just right click on this folder
01:27 - right here click new
01:30 - new and then we're going to click python
01:31 - file and then rename the python file we
01:33 - can name that dice simulator
01:36 - so we're going to click ok
01:39 - and there we have our python simulator
01:40 - and we can type inside this area so
01:43 - the first way we're gonna do it
01:45 - is like it's gonna detect if you say yes
01:48 - or no so it's kind of like a repeat
01:49 - until loop in scratch and the second one
01:52 - is more of like a forever loop so we're
01:54 - going to start out with uh importing
01:57 - some
01:58 - a library so we're going to import the
02:00 - library random so we're going to import
02:02 - so you have import right here import
02:04 - random so that's what we're going to do
02:05 - that
02:06 - and then we're gonna go down one and
02:08 - then we're gonna do define two variables
02:10 - one named min
02:12 - min is the minimum on the dice you know
02:14 - how a dice has six sides so the minimum
02:17 - is one and the max should be six
02:20 - so we have our two variables right there
02:22 - and then we're gonna define one more
02:24 - variable we're gonna roll
02:26 - again
02:27 - and then underscore again and then we're
02:29 - gonna make it equal and then yes
02:31 - so we have the rule again
02:33 - and then right here we have down here
02:35 - we're going to make a while loop so
02:37 - we're going to do while
02:39 - roll
02:40 - again
02:41 - is double two equal signs means
02:44 - basically if something is equal to
02:46 - another
02:47 - so
02:48 - it's kind of like you know the or like
02:50 - something is equal to or equal to in
02:52 - scratch so that's what it is so we're
02:54 - going to equal and so again yes
02:57 - or we're going to do roll again is equal
03:00 - to
03:01 - uh
03:02 - y we're going to do y so basically you
03:04 - know how sometimes you can just type y
03:05 - or yes same thing
03:07 - put a colon at the end
03:09 - and then enter it should be indented so
03:11 - it has to be indented to be inside the
03:12 - loop and then we do print and then we're
03:14 - going to print put
03:16 - parentheses i'm gonna just say rolling
03:19 - the dices
03:21 - rolling the dices
03:22 - and then we're gonna enter one more line
03:24 - down and then print
03:28 - prints and then we're gonna say the
03:30 - value are the values are
03:32 - the values are
03:34 - not so that's like it's going to tell
03:36 - what the values are and then after that
03:38 - it's going to print what the values will
03:40 - be so you're going to be rolling two
03:41 - dices
03:42 - so you can do one if you want but we're
03:44 - going to be doing two so print
03:47 - random dot brand int
03:49 - random.int
03:51 - and then we're going to do
03:52 - parentheses and then min and then comma
03:55 - max
03:56 - so this is basically getting the numbers
03:58 - so you know pick a random number from
04:00 - one to six min is one max is six
04:03 - and then
04:04 - we're also going to get the same thing
04:05 - so we can just copy paste it so we're
04:07 - just gonna copy
04:09 - uh enter one line down and we have we
04:11 - just have to do it twice because we're
04:12 - doing two dices
04:13 - and then we're gonna go down
04:16 - uh two more lines so and we're gonna do
04:18 - roll
04:19 - of roll again we can just do that
04:22 - roll again is equal to
04:24 - input
04:26 - input so input uh roll the dices again
04:30 - so
04:31 - input sorry actually misspelled it input
04:35 - roll
04:36 - the dices again so this is to ask
04:38 - confirm the player they want to roll
04:40 - again or not so right here and it has to
04:43 - be inside the while loop or else um it's
04:45 - going to be like
04:47 - um go forever so we have to keep it
04:48 - inside the wire let me delete this blank
04:50 - indent okay so now we have our thing
04:53 - so basically if you put this outside it
04:55 - will just keep on running forever and
04:57 - right here it's only going to happen if
05:00 - this is happening so while this is
05:01 - happening this is going to run so we're
05:04 - going to run the project so we're going
05:05 - to click run right here
05:07 - and then we'll click die simulator so
05:08 - the first time you run it you have to do
05:09 - that so as you can see it says rolling
05:11 - the devices the values are five and six
05:13 - so those are the two random values he's
05:15 - got so let's say you want to roll again
05:17 - you click yes
05:18 - it will roll a one and five what if you
05:20 - put y as you can see it is working so
05:22 - you can see the numbers are random and
05:25 - they're
05:26 - and it's working so
05:27 - let's say
05:29 - uh
05:31 - let's say you want to stop it so you
05:33 - just click
05:34 - type in no sorry and then it'll say
05:36 - process finish
05:37 - so that means it's ended the code so it
05:40 - ended it
05:41 - you ended the process and i'll show you
05:43 - guys if you just don't put this in the
05:45 - while loop this is what will happen so
05:46 - we're going to run
05:48 - run dye simulator see as you can see it
05:50 - just keeps on going so we don't want
05:52 - that we want to confirm with the user if
05:54 - they want to roll again or not so
05:56 - we do not want to have it going on
05:58 - forever so just tab it and has to be
06:00 - inside this loop so this is the first
06:02 - way to make it
06:03 - i'm going to comment out all of this
06:05 - code so i can show you guys the second
06:07 - one so you can just do control slash
06:09 - it'll comment out everything right here
06:12 - as you can see
06:13 - so our second way we can do this
06:15 - and we're going to make it like a
06:16 - forever loop and scratch so we're going
06:18 - to do while
06:20 - while uh one is equal to one so this
06:23 - basically means you know one is always
06:24 - equal to one so this is basically a
06:25 - forever loop
06:27 - so we're gonna print a
06:29 - print
06:30 - and we're gonna do rolling the dice we
06:33 - can just copy this
06:35 - right here so we're just gonna copy this
06:37 - code right here
06:40 - right here
06:42 - and we'll just get rid of this
06:44 - there you go
06:46 - oops
06:48 - backspace this right here
06:50 - okay so now it's the same one so prints
06:52 - rolling devices and the values are
06:55 - and then we can also just copy this
07:00 - and instead right here we're gonna put
07:02 - one and six because we don't have the
07:03 - variables defined so we're gonna copy
07:05 - this one line
07:07 - copy and then we're gonna go paste it in
07:09 - here so instead of using the variables
07:12 - because we we're not using them here
07:14 - we're gonna use one and six it's
07:16 - basically the same thing
07:18 - except you're just using the numbers as
07:19 - substitutes of the variables and then we
07:21 - just copy this one more time
07:25 - so now we have our two
07:27 - prints for the random numbers and right
07:29 - here is the printing for the
07:30 - instructions
07:31 - and then right here we can take the roll
07:33 - again right here you know just
07:35 - copy that
07:36 - and then we're going to go down and then
07:38 - roll again is equal to the input roll
07:41 - the dices again so that's we're gonna
07:43 - make it say that and then right here
07:45 - we're gonna do a break so basically this
07:46 - is like a stop the scripts thing so
07:48 - basically if the player says n or no
07:50 - it's gonna stop the script so as you can
07:52 - see this is like the inverse of this one
07:54 - this one's like saying
07:56 - uh if you want to roll again then you
07:58 - put yes
07:59 - this one's going to say um if you if you
08:01 - want to stop the script then you say no
08:03 - so that's
08:04 - it's pretty it does the same thing but
08:06 - it's written in a different way so
08:08 - we're going to do if roll again is equal
08:11 - to
08:12 - n
08:14 - or
08:15 - roll again
08:16 - as equal to
08:19 - uh no so if it's equal to that
08:21 - then we will
08:22 - say break
08:24 - and it should work so
08:26 - right here uh no new line
08:28 - i think i might have put a new line or
08:30 - something
08:32 - so
08:33 - okay
08:34 - delete that okay there you go um so now
08:37 - we have this let's test it out so we're
08:39 - going to click run
08:41 - run dice simulator see as you can see it
08:43 - rolls the two and six
08:45 - so roll the dice again you say yes it'll
08:47 - also do that
08:48 - y
08:49 - so anything but
08:51 - no
08:52 - or n it will roll again
08:55 - this one anything
08:56 - uh but
08:58 - yes or why we won't run again so that's
09:01 - kind of like the opposite
09:03 - and next we can just put no
09:06 - or n so it says the process is finished
09:08 - so here we have our two simple ways of
09:10 - making
09:11 - um the dye simulator in python and then
09:15 - i'm gonna do a side by side comparison
09:16 - on scratch
09:18 - so let me move
09:19 - scratch on this silly so
09:21 - here we have our scratch project um
09:24 - smaller
09:28 - okay
09:29 - so here we have our side by side
09:30 - comparison
09:31 - um
09:32 - right here
09:34 - when i clipped set roll again to yes so
09:37 - this is more of like this line instead
09:39 - of this line so we're going to set the
09:41 - rule again to yes so that's basically
09:43 - right here you're setting the variable
09:45 - and then forever loop this is like the
09:47 - uh while one is equal to one that's the
09:49 - forever loop so all this is in the
09:51 - forever loop
09:52 - we're going to print the random number
09:54 - one to six one to six like that
09:56 - and then we're gonna set the roll dice
09:59 - to and then we're gonna ask roll dices
10:01 - again right here you see we're gonna ask
10:03 - the question and we're gonna set this
10:04 - variable to the answer
10:06 - and down here is the same thing as this
10:08 - one if the roll again is equal to no or
10:10 - n then it's gonna stop all so this code
10:12 - is the same as this one
10:14 - so you can see that scratch is
10:16 - very similar to this one and i'll show
10:18 - you guys that like a full screen
10:21 - uh let's go for here so
10:23 - maybe maybe do this
10:25 - all right so i play it
10:26 - so you see it says the two random
10:28 - numbers are one and two so if you say
10:30 - yes they'll say 1 4
10:32 - so if you say no it will stop the
10:34 - scripts
10:35 - you can do stop all because this is just
10:37 - one sprite but if you want to be more
10:39 - specific then stop the script it would
10:40 - work as well
10:42 - okay
10:44 - so that is pretty much it for this
10:45 - tutorial on python
10:48 - on how to make a dye simulator
10:50 - if you enjoyed this video don't forget
10:52 - to leave a like subscribe and ring the
10:54 - notification bell
10:55 - and i'll see you guys in the next
10:57 - tutorial

11:10 - you

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys the kids coding playground here today we'll be doing a new python project on our channel so we haven't done a python video in a while so we're going to be making a dice simulator on python so i will be showing you guys two different ways to make this python dye simulator and one way in scratch how to do it so like i'll show you how it's similar to the one in python we've also made a die simulator on scratch as well so if you want to check that out then you can check that out on our channel and without further ado let's start a new project so click file new project right we have a new project right so we're going to rename it so if you don't uh don't know how to do this like starting a new project and like setting up python um you should watch our beginners tutorial on python we have like how to set up pycharm and all that stuff so you can check that out if you are new to python okay so we're going to name our project i'm going to name it die simulator simulator for video because i already have a project named simulator so it would like kind of mess it up so it can't be the same thing we're going to create it and i'm just going to put it as this window right here we have our project it's starting up all right so it's now started up we're going to just right click on this folder right here click new new and then we're going to click python file and then rename the python file we can name that dice simulator so we're going to click ok and there we have our python simulator and we can type inside this area so the first way we're gonna do it is like it's gonna detect if you say yes or no so it's kind of like a repeat until loop in scratch and the second one is more of like a forever loop so we're going to start out with uh importing some a library so we're going to import the library random so we're going to import so you have import right here import random so that's what we're going to do that and then we're gonna go down one and then we're gonna do define two variables one named min min is the minimum on the dice you know how a dice has six sides so the minimum is one and the max should be six so we have our two variables right there and then we're gonna define one more variable we're gonna roll again and then underscore again and then we're gonna make it equal and then yes so we have the rule again and then right here we have down here we're going to make a while loop so we're going to do while roll again is double two equal signs means basically if something is equal to another so it's kind of like you know the or like something is equal to or equal to in scratch so that's what it is so we're going to equal and so again yes or we're going to do roll again is equal to uh y we're going to do y so basically you know how sometimes you can just type y or yes same thing put a colon at the end and then enter it should be indented so it has to be indented to be inside the loop and then we do print and then we're going to print put parentheses i'm gonna just say rolling the dices rolling the dices and then we're gonna enter one more line down and then print prints and then we're gonna say the value are the values are the values are not so that's like it's going to tell what the values are and then after that it's going to print what the values will be so you're going to be rolling two dices so you can do one if you want but we're going to be doing two so print random dot brand int random.int and then we're going to do parentheses and then min and then comma max so this is basically getting the numbers so you know pick a random number from one to six min is one max is six and then we're also going to get the same thing so we can just copy paste it so we're just gonna copy uh enter one line down and we have we just have to do it twice because we're doing two dices and then we're gonna go down uh two more lines so and we're gonna do roll of roll again we can just do that roll again is equal to input input so input uh roll the dices again so input sorry actually misspelled it input roll the dices again so this is to ask confirm the player they want to roll again or not so right here and it has to be inside the while loop or else um it's going to be like um go forever so we have to keep it inside the wire let me delete this blank indent okay so now we have our thing so basically if you put this outside it will just keep on running forever and right here it's only going to happen if this is happening so while this is happening this is going to run so we're going to run the project so we're going to click run right here and then we'll click die simulator so the first time you run it you have to do that so as you can see it says rolling the devices the values are five and six so those are the two random values he's got so let's say you want to roll again you click yes it will roll a one and five what if you put y as you can see it is working so you can see the numbers are random and they're and it's working so let's say uh let's say you want to stop it so you just click type in no sorry and then it'll say process finish so that means it's ended the code so it ended it you ended the process and i'll show you guys if you just don't put this in the while loop this is what will happen so we're going to run run dye simulator see as you can see it just keeps on going so we don't want that we want to confirm with the user if they want to roll again or not so we do not want to have it going on forever so just tab it and has to be inside this loop so this is the first way to make it i'm going to comment out all of this code so i can show you guys the second one so you can just do control slash it'll comment out everything right here as you can see so our second way we can do this and we're going to make it like a forever loop and scratch so we're going to do while while uh one is equal to one so this basically means you know one is always equal to one so this is basically a

or roll again as equal to uh no so if it's equal to that then we will say break and it should work so right here uh no new line i think i might have put a new line or something so okay delete that okay there you go um so now we have this let's test it out so we're going to click run run dice simulator see as you can see it rolls the two and six so roll the dice again you say yes it'll also do that y so anything but no or n it will roll again this one anything uh but yes or why we won't run again so that's kind of like the opposite and next we can just put no or n so it says the process is
