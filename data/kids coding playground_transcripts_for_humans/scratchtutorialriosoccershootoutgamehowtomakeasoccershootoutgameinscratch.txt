00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kitchen on
00:08 - playground here and today we're back for
00:09 - another video in scratch and today we
00:11 - will be making a game called
00:15 - rio soccer shootout and let's see what
00:18 - this game is all about so let's play it
00:20 - there's a whistle sign in the beginning
00:22 - bullseye's moving everywhere this keeper
00:24 - is here guarding the goal very tough and
00:26 - you click space oh yeah and you have 10
00:29 - balls over here
00:30 - and you score zero so
00:33 - that's a goal
00:34 - so it has a chance to leap up and get
00:37 - your ball so let's see
00:39 - [Applause]
00:41 - uh
00:42 - i missed okay
00:46 - all right so that's three
00:48 - [Applause]
00:52 - i'm trying to win here
00:58 - so it looks like i won here and if you
01:00 - run out of balls you lose
01:02 - yeah and there's a little thing in the
01:04 - beginning
01:06 - you have to get five points to win and
01:07 - wherever the target is that's where the
01:09 - ball is going to be so
01:14 - so i started my new project and of
01:16 - course we delete this scratch
01:18 - uh uh sprite so we have the sprite
01:22 - we have the bullseye
01:24 - we you can come by my project and export
01:26 - the sprites we have the ball
01:29 - we have or you can draw on your own we
01:30 - have the keeper
01:32 - we have
01:33 - the
01:34 - backdrop
01:36 - we have the goal post
01:39 - the net
01:41 - the waves there's a lot of stuff in here
01:44 - and there's the cloud
01:46 - and there's the score whatever to win so
01:50 - let's do this so first we have to start
01:52 - off the bullseye
01:55 - so we have the
01:56 - when the green flag is clicked
02:00 - it will set size to a hundred percent so
02:04 - it's going to be pretty big
02:05 - in the show
02:08 - and after that it will um
02:10 - go to this certain position
02:17 - so so um we have our bull's-eye so we
02:21 - just wanted to start around here so
02:24 - because we want the bullseye to start
02:25 - around there and go around so
02:28 - go to this position
02:30 - and then it will go forever
02:34 - and glide to this position
02:40 - and
02:41 - glide
02:43 - one second to this position
02:46 - and then it'll glide to
02:49 - to
02:50 - this position
02:53 - which is
02:55 - this and then it'll collide to this
02:58 - position so we're getting a bunch of
03:00 - coordinates down here
03:02 - and then it'll collide to
03:05 - this position
03:10 - and then it'll glide to
03:12 - oopsies this position
03:19 - and then it will glide
03:22 - back up
03:27 - so yeah
03:29 - so i'm going to put 0.5 on here so
03:34 - we use the same coordinates so negative
03:36 - 113
03:38 - and
03:38 - uh positive 82.
03:41 - so yeah
03:44 - and now let's see look it's gliding
03:50 - seems right and we'll go back up so now
03:52 - we have to do another script so when the
03:55 - green flag is clicked
03:57 - it'll clear the graphic effects because
03:59 - it will constantly change color so you
04:01 - want to clear in the beginning and then
04:03 - uh
04:04 - we have to put forever
04:07 - let's make a new variable uh
04:09 - to make x
04:14 - and then we have to make
04:16 - y
04:20 - and then now we have to make set x
04:23 - to x position up here
04:26 - so it will follow
04:29 - and then
04:30 - set
04:32 - y
04:36 - to
04:37 - y position
04:42 - the reason for this is it'll keep track
04:45 - of the place where you click space and
04:46 - then you'll shoot the soccer ball so
04:48 - that's for later use and now i would
04:50 - change color effect
04:54 - by 20 doesn't really matter but 20 why
04:56 - not and then let's go to the ball we do
04:59 - have some last script to code in the
05:00 - bulls eye but first we do have to do the
05:03 - ball first unfortunately so let's do
05:05 - this so when the green flag is clicked
05:10 - it'll set ball to 10. so you have 10
05:13 - balls to shoot so let's make
05:18 - set ball to 10.
05:22 - we set our ball to 10. so
05:26 - and now we have to set score which is
05:27 - another sprite i mean variable set score
05:32 - to zero
05:34 - and it'll go to the front layer
05:36 - because the ball is always in front
05:40 - set size to 50
05:44 - so after that we have go to x
05:49 - uh
05:51 - we have to find a position so zero
05:53 - negative 80
05:55 - and then it'll place down the whistle so
05:58 - oh we already have the whistle so that's
06:00 - really nice
06:03 - whistle until time so
06:05 - these uh sounds are actually from the
06:08 - ball sprite so you guys can export the
06:10 - sprite from my project and i'm
06:12 - gumball098 so just go to my project and
06:16 - export it and you also also can download
06:18 - it from the google drive but you have to
06:20 - use your own google account to do that
06:21 - so
06:22 - so okay so let's move on
06:25 - so when the space key is pressed
06:28 - if then
06:31 - and
06:34 - if then the ball is greater than zero
06:39 - so the ball is greater than zero
06:44 - oh and
06:45 - not
06:46 - so you need a knot
06:50 - uh
06:51 - and not equal
06:54 - score fives
07:00 - and if you still have balls and
07:04 - uh you
07:06 - don't have
07:08 - um
07:09 - more less yeah you don't have
07:12 - you don't have five points yet you can
07:14 - continue playing and um
07:16 - so you can continue shooting the goals
07:18 - so
07:19 - let's get broadcast
07:24 - shoot and wait so we have to actually
07:25 - make a new message here
07:28 - shoot and wait
07:33 - and uh now when i receive shoot
07:40 - oh change ball by minus one because you
07:42 - lost the ball from shooting
07:45 - and
07:46 - it will glide 0.5 seconds to x and y so
07:49 - that's why we track down the coordinates
07:51 - for bullseye because the ball has to go
07:53 - to the position where you shot it from
07:55 - so you need glide 0.5 seconds to
08:00 - x and y
08:06 - and now you need an if then statement
08:09 - so if
08:10 - then you need a and statement if then
08:16 - it's touching the net so you need
08:18 - touching net
08:21 - and
08:22 - not touching keeper that means you get a
08:24 - goal so not touching
08:31 - touching
08:34 - then broadcast goal and wait so that's a
08:37 - new broadcast message we will be using
08:38 - that later
08:43 - broadcast goal
08:45 - and weight and you also need an if then
08:48 - statement
08:49 - if then it's touching the keeper which
08:51 - you don't get the point for
08:55 - then it will broadcast miss and wait
09:04 - so now we're done with that uh we still
09:06 - have a little bit more code to do so
09:09 - let's finish this off so you want to
09:11 - give some effect to the thing so when
09:13 - when i broadcast when i receive shoot
09:15 - it'll repeat 12 times
09:18 - it'll get smaller and smaller so it
09:20 - looks like you kicked it away so that
09:22 - will
09:23 - add effect so
09:24 - change
09:26 - size
09:27 - by -2
09:31 - and now when i
09:33 - when i receive shoot then it will play
09:37 - sound kick off
09:38 - until done
09:40 - so because you kick the ball
09:42 - so if you want to put this into one
09:44 - script you could actually put this
09:46 - inside here but you have to use the
09:49 - start sound block
09:51 - instead of
09:52 - the
09:54 - you want to put it up here
09:56 - uh uh you want to put start sound kick
09:57 - off up here you don't want to do play
09:59 - sound until done you can put it into one
10:01 - uh
10:02 - script if you want and now you have to
10:03 - go back to the bullseye to finish off
10:05 - the shoot
10:06 - so when i receive
10:10 - shoot
10:12 - it'll hide
10:15 - and because you are thing you are
10:18 - kicking the ball so it will just hide so
10:20 - then you can see where it is so
10:22 - hide wait two seconds and then it will
10:25 - show again
10:27 - and now we're done with all of those
10:29 - scripts over there we have to go to the
10:30 - keeper
10:32 - so
10:33 - so we're actually not done with the ball
10:35 - yet so we have to continue the ball
10:37 - there's a little bit more scripts over
10:38 - here so
10:39 - uh when i receive gold
10:42 - it will wait one second
10:45 - and it will do an if then statement if
10:48 - then the score is equal to 5
10:56 - then it will
10:57 - broadcast win which you win if you
11:00 - broadcast win and wait
11:04 - so one
11:08 - and wait and then after that you need an
11:10 - if then statement
11:13 - if then the you need to and so i'll
11:16 - explain this when i'm done so
11:19 - so i'm going to explain this when i'm
11:20 - done so
11:21 - if that equals zero
11:25 - if the ball
11:27 - equals zero
11:29 - and
11:31 - not
11:34 - score equals five
11:37 - you still lose because uh you you ran
11:40 - out of balls and
11:42 - uh you
11:44 - did not complete the quest of getting
11:46 - five points so
11:48 - you still lose though broadcast a new
11:50 - message
11:52 - and wait
11:55 - lose
11:56 - lost
11:59 - now we have lost and then this is just a
12:01 - few scripts so when i receive goal i'll
12:03 - play sound goal until done
12:06 - because you won
12:08 - you got the goal
12:09 - and then you
12:10 - when i receive
12:13 - miss
12:14 - it's boo
12:17 - all right so now we have to do this so
12:20 - when i receive goal it will change score
12:23 - by one
12:28 - because you got a goal so now you're
12:30 - gonna get one more score it'll say
12:34 - goal
12:38 - for one second
12:39 - and
12:41 - uh
12:42 - you have to wait one second
12:45 - and it'll set size back to 50 so it'll
12:48 - go back to normal size so then you can
12:49 - kick it off again
12:53 - and now it will go to the position where
12:55 - it was earlier so go to x
12:58 - 0
12:59 - y
13:00 - negative 80. so we have that
13:04 - and now we have to get missed so when i
13:07 - receive
13:10 - miss
13:13 - oh wait one second
13:15 - and it will if then statement
13:19 - if the ball equals zero
13:22 - so if you ran out of balls
13:26 - you still lose so where's ball
13:29 - uh broadcast lost
13:32 - and wait
13:36 - and now
13:37 - you're done with that script we have to
13:38 - do when i receive miss
13:44 - um
13:45 - you have to say miss
13:47 - for one second so say
13:52 - one second
13:53 - and it will wait one second
13:57 - and it will do the same as this because
13:59 - it will wait once i can set the size
14:01 - back to 50 and go to the place where it
14:03 - was originally so this is a lot of code
14:06 - so if you need to take a moment to pause
14:09 - i know it's really small
14:12 - so now the code is organized you can
14:15 - feel free to pause and here's all our
14:17 - code so i'm gonna give you a few seconds
14:23 - and
14:24 - we have shoot we have space bar we have
14:27 - the green flag
14:29 - and more shoot over here
14:31 - so feel free to pause goal
14:35 - all throughout there
14:37 - and then
14:38 - miss
14:40 - all over there
14:41 - so now let's test out
14:43 - our
14:44 - ball so our bull's eye is working
14:47 - perfectly it looks like knuckle
14:50 - now we have to code the keeper so it
14:53 - works
14:54 - uh hello so now we have to code the
14:56 - keeper so let's go to the keeper
14:59 - and when the green flag is clicked
15:04 - i have to also have to hide the
15:06 - y
15:07 - so when the oh yes i have to rename this
15:09 - to rio
15:11 - soccer
15:13 - shoot
15:15 - and now when the green flag is clicked
15:17 - it will set the size to 45
15:23 - and it'll switch costume to keeper one
15:28 - go to x
15:29 - i think i already have the position for
15:31 - him yet
15:32 - and forever
15:35 - it will wait 0.5 seconds
15:41 - and next costume
15:45 - and now
15:46 - see our costumes we have one two one two
15:49 - so it looks like he's ready to carve
15:51 - now we have when i receive shoot
15:56 - we have to have glide
15:58 - 0.5 seconds
16:03 - to a pick random place so we're gonna
16:05 - pick random
16:09 - negative 90
16:12 - to positive 90.
16:15 - so as you can see the
16:16 - x for this keeper from negative 90 see
16:20 - negative 98 to positive 90
16:24 - and there's also the y so pick random
16:29 - from
16:30 - 20
16:32 - to 70 so
16:34 - maybe from here 20
16:37 - that's yeah 20 around 20 and then to 70
16:40 - yeah so that's
16:42 - our code over here and then wait two
16:44 - seconds
16:47 - and then it'll go to
16:49 - back to that position
16:56 - yep
16:58 - all right and this is the code so
17:00 - feel free to pause
17:02 - so let's try this out real quick so he's
17:04 - in his position
17:05 - we have that
17:06 - miss
17:07 - uh
17:09 - [Applause]
17:16 - so it's just a pick random wherever
17:19 - and it doesn't look like he's too smart
17:21 - so i want to add something called
17:23 - perfect block so it doesn't look like
17:24 - he's too smart so i'm gonna make perfect
17:26 - block so when i receive shoot
17:30 - it will set perfect block
17:33 - a new variable
17:36 - perfect
17:38 - block
17:42 - and
17:44 - it will set perfect block to pick random
17:48 - one to three and if you want it to be
17:50 - harder like really hard you can do one
17:52 - to two so it's a really high chance
17:54 - you'll get your ball but i'm doing one
17:56 - to three so it's more easier for me and
17:59 - then i'm going to use it if then else
18:01 - statement
18:03 - uh per if perfect block equals one
18:08 - perfect block equals one
18:10 - and it will glide 0.5 seconds
18:15 - to
18:20 - seconds to x and y
18:22 - but
18:23 - remember from the bullseye we have the x
18:25 - and y we've marked down the coordinates
18:27 - well if it equals one so it's going to
18:29 - pick a random number and then if equals
18:31 - one it'll go to that coordinate and
18:32 - it'll catch your ball so we have that
18:34 - and then i'm just gonna drag in this
18:36 - script right here
18:38 - yeah um else it will go somewhere random
18:42 - and then it'll wait two seconds and go
18:44 - back there so now we are done with the
18:47 - keeper
18:48 - uh
18:50 - let's organize our variables a little
18:51 - bit so ball
18:54 - score
18:55 - so you see perfect block
18:57 - let's see it's one so he will get the
19:00 - ball but what if it's three it's a goal
19:03 - so let's see
19:04 - and it's one again so
19:07 - three again so
19:08 - it's perfect block right there
19:11 - hide it real quick
19:16 - and now we have to work on the goal post
19:19 - which has barely any code just when the
19:21 - green block is clicked just in case it
19:24 - will go to this position
19:26 - just in case if it moves or whatever and
19:29 - our net
19:30 - that has
19:32 - exactly the same code just
19:36 - you know just in case
19:38 - and now our wave which has some code so
19:41 - unless we're gonna wave so it's just
19:43 - gonna add some effects so the green flag
19:45 - is clicked it will go to x zero zero
19:50 - y zero and then it'll go forever
19:55 - it'll repeat three times
19:59 - and wait 0.2 seconds
20:03 - so it'll go up and down and up and down
20:05 - and up and down and it'll change y
20:10 - by
20:11 - -10
20:13 - and then i'll repeat another three
20:17 - let's just duplicate that and just make
20:18 - some tweaks to it put it under do not
20:20 - put it in wait 0.2 seconds instead of
20:23 - change y by negative 10 change y by 10
20:25 - so it's like what down up and down and
20:27 - up and down
20:30 - so as you can see look at the waves look
20:31 - at the waves
20:32 - and now let's look at the clouds which
20:34 - is just some extra
20:36 - you know
20:38 - look so
20:39 - when the green flag is clicked
20:42 - it'll go to this position i think i have
20:44 - the position yet and it'll go forever
20:48 - he'll go forever um
20:52 - well let's just make this even uh
20:55 - repeat
20:56 - oh
20:57 - repeat two times
21:00 - and it will wait 0.4 seconds
21:05 - it will change y by minus 1 so go up and
21:07 - down and up and down just like the waves
21:09 - but just in the sky so change y by
21:13 - -1
21:14 - and then you just have to duplicate this
21:18 - put it under
21:19 - and then change y by one
21:22 - so we have our game and our banner is
21:24 - the last thing to code on our list so
21:27 - let's see what we have to do this year
21:29 - so when the green flag is clicked we
21:31 - have our three costumes you can either
21:33 - go to my thing my project and export the
21:35 - sprites or you can either write your own
21:38 - i think it's pretty easy to write on
21:39 - your own you just need some uh text and
21:41 - just write it so when the green flag is
21:44 - clicked
21:46 - so three costumes are the start score
21:48 - five to win are one and the lost
21:52 - and when the green fog is clicked um
21:55 - it'll go to
21:56 - x 0 y negative 40. i'll go to the front
21:59 - layer so be in front of everything and
22:01 - it will switch costume to start so it's
22:03 - in the beginning
22:05 - so switch costume to start
22:10 - and then it will show
22:15 - and then it'll wait 0.5 seconds
22:19 - and then it will hide
22:22 - and after all of that
22:24 - when i receive
22:28 - one
22:29 - that no go to
22:34 - uh same position and
22:36 - switch costume to one
22:41 - and it'll show
22:44 - and then it'll stop
22:46 - so
22:48 - it's the end of our project
22:50 - if you win and now we have to do the
22:52 - lose so just duplicate when i receive
22:55 - lost it'll go to this position switch
22:58 - costume to lost instead of one show and
23:00 - stuff so let's test out our game over
23:04 - here so we have our 10 balls our bulls
23:06 - eye is moving our goals keeper is
23:08 - dancing our waves are moving our clouds
23:10 - are slightly moving our score
23:14 - and we missed let's see what we get
23:17 - so he got basically two ones in a row
23:19 - and i got maybe a two or three so
23:23 - let's see
23:26 - i think i'm gonna lose this one though
23:28 - [Applause]
23:31 - it's really hard actually to do this
23:35 - okay that's one more ball please
23:37 - yes okay so it says you won okay
23:40 - and now
23:41 - you lose uh
23:44 - so i'm here in my goalie to speed up the
23:46 - process perfect block is gonna be one
23:48 - out of one so it will always make it
23:51 - this is impossible game to win now
23:55 - no way you can get score anymore
23:57 - let's just farm out all our balls here
24:01 - so we're in our last ball here and it
24:05 - looks like you lost works so

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's kitchen on playground here and today we're back for another video in scratch and today we will be making a game called rio soccer shootout and let's see what this game is all about so let's play it there's a whistle sign in the beginning bullseye's moving everywhere this keeper is here guarding the goal very tough and you click space oh yeah and you have 10 balls over here and you score zero so that's a goal so it has a chance to leap up and get your ball so let's see uh i missed okay all right so that's three i'm trying to win here so it looks like i won here and if you run out of balls you lose yeah and there's a little thing in the beginning you have to get five points to win and wherever the target is that's where the ball is going to be so so i started my new project and of course we delete this scratch uh uh sprite so we have the sprite we have the bullseye we you can come by my project and export the sprites we have the ball we have or you can draw on your own we have the keeper we have the backdrop we have the goal post the net the waves there's a lot of stuff in here and there's the cloud and there's the score whatever to win so let's do this so first we have to start off the bullseye so we have the when the green flag is clicked it will set size to a hundred percent so it's going to be pretty big in the show and after that it will um go to this certain position so so um we have our bull'seye so we just wanted to start around here so because we want the bullseye to start around there and go around so go to this position and then it will go forever and glide to this position and glide one second to this position and then it'll glide to to this position which is this and then it'll collide to this position so we're getting a bunch of coordinates down here and then it'll collide to this position and then it'll glide to oopsies this position and then it will glide back up so yeah so i'm going to put 0.5 on here so we use the same coordinates so negative 113 and uh positive 82. so yeah and now let's see look it's gliding seems right and we'll go back up so now we have to do another script so when the green flag is clicked it'll clear the graphic effects because it will constantly change color so you want to clear in the beginning and then uh we have to put forever let's make a new variable uh to make x and then we have to make y and then now we have to make set x to x position up here so it will follow and then set y to y position the reason for this is it'll keep track of the place where you click space and then you'll shoot the soccer ball so that's for later use and now i would change color effect by 20 doesn't really matter but 20 why not and then let's go to the ball we do have some last script to code in the bulls eye but first we do have to do the ball first unfortunately so let's do this so when the green flag is clicked it'll set ball to 10. so you have 10 balls to shoot so let's make set ball to 10. we set our ball to 10. so and now we have to set score which is another sprite i mean variable set score to zero and it'll go to the front layer because the ball is always in front set size to 50 so after that we have go to x uh we have to find a position so zero negative 80 and then it'll place down the whistle so oh we already have the whistle so that's really nice whistle until time so these uh sounds are actually from the ball sprite so you guys can export the sprite from my project and i'm gumball098 so just go to my project and export it and you also also can download it from the google drive but you have to use your own google account to do that so so okay so let's move on so when the space key is pressed if then and if then the ball is greater than zero so the ball is greater than zero oh and not so you need a knot uh and not equal score fives and if you still have balls and uh you don't have um more less yeah you don't have you don't have five points yet you can continue playing and um so you can continue shooting the goals so let's get broadcast shoot and wait so we have to actually make a new message here shoot and wait and uh now when i receive shoot oh change ball by minus one because you lost the ball from shooting and it will glide 0.5 seconds to x and y so that's why we track down the coordinates for bullseye because the ball has to go to the position where you shot it from so you need glide 0.5 seconds to x and y and now you need an if then statement so if then you need a and statement if then it's touching the net so you need touching net and not touching keeper that means you get a goal so not touching touching then broadcast goal and wait so that's a new broadcast message we will be using that later broadcast goal and weight and you also need an if then statement if then it's touching the keeper which you don't get the point for then it will broadcast miss and wait so now we're done with that uh we still have a little bit more code to do so let's finish this off so you want to give some effect to the thing so when when i broadcast when i receive shoot it'll repeat 12 times it'll get smaller and smaller so it looks like you kicked it away so that will add effect so change size by 2 and now when i when i receive shoot then it will play sound kick off until done so because you kick the ball so if you want to put this into one script you could actually put this inside here but you have to use the start sound block instead of the you want to put it up here uh uh you want to put start sound kick off up here you don't want to do play sound until done you can put it into one uh script if you want and now you have to go back to the bullseye to finish off the shoot so when i receive shoot it'll hide and because you are thing you are kicking the ball so it will just hide so then you can see where it is so hide wait two seconds and then it will show again and now we're done with all of those scripts over there we have to go to the keeper so so we're actually not done with the ball yet so we have to continue the ball there's a little bit more scripts over here so uh when i receive gold it will wait one second and it will do an if then statement if then the score is equal to 5 then it will broadcast win which you win if you broadcast win and wait so one and wait and then after that you need an if then statement if then the you need to and so i'll explain this when i'm done so so i'm going to explain this when i'm done so if that equals zero if the ball equals zero and not score equals five you still lose because uh you you ran out of balls and uh you did not complete the quest of getting five points so you still lose though broadcast a new message and wait lose lost now we have lost and then this is just a few scripts so when i receive goal i'll play sound goal until done because you won you got the goal and then you when i receive miss it's boo all right so now we have to do this so when i receive goal it will change score by one because you got a goal so now you're gonna get one more score it'll say goal for one second and uh you have to wait one second and it'll set size back to 50 so it'll go back to normal size so then you can kick it off again and now it will go to the position where it was earlier so go to x 0 y negative 80. so we have that and now we have to get missed so when i receive miss oh wait one second and it will if then statement if the ball equals zero so if you ran out of balls you still lose so where's ball uh broadcast lost and wait and now you're done with that script we have to do when i receive miss um you have to say miss for one second so say one second and it will wait one second and it will do the same as this because it will wait once i can set the size back to 50 and go to the place where it was originally so this is a lot of code so if you need to take a moment to pause i know it's really small so now the code is organized you can feel free to pause and here's all our code so i'm gonna give you a few seconds and we have shoot we have space bar we have the green flag and more shoot over here so feel free to pause goal all throughout there and then miss all over there so now let's test out our ball so our bull's eye is working perfectly it looks like knuckle now we have to code the keeper so it works uh hello so now we have to code the keeper so let's go to the keeper and when the green flag is clicked i have to also have to hide the y so when the oh yes i have to rename this to rio soccer shoot and now when the green flag is clicked it will set the size to 45 and it'll switch costume to keeper one go to x i think i already have the position for him yet and forever it will wait 0.5 seconds and next costume and now see our costumes we have one two one two so it looks like he's ready to carve now we have when i receive shoot we have to have glide 0.5 seconds to a pick random place so we're gonna pick random negative 90 to positive 90. so as you can see the x for this keeper from negative 90 see negative 98 to positive 90 and there's also the y so pick random from 20 to 70 so maybe from here 20 that's yeah 20 around 20 and then to 70 yeah so that's our code over here and then wait two seconds and then it'll go to back to that position yep all right and this is the code so feel free to pause so let's try this out real quick so he's in his position we have that miss uh so it's just a pick random wherever and it doesn't look like he's too smart so i want to add something called perfect block so it doesn't look like he's too smart so i'm gonna make perfect block so when i receive shoot it will set perfect block a new variable perfect block and it will set perfect block to pick random one to three and if you want it to be harder like really hard you can do one to two so it's a really high chance you'll get your ball but i'm doing one to three so it's more easier for me and then i'm going to use it if then else statement uh per if perfect block equals one perfect block equals one and it will glide 0.5 seconds to seconds to x and y but remember from the bullseye we have the x and y we've marked down the coordinates well if it equals one so it's going to pick a random number and then if equals one it'll go to that coordinate and it'll catch your ball so we have that and then i'm just gonna drag in this script right here yeah um else it will go somewhere random and then it'll wait two seconds and go back there so now we are done with the keeper uh let's organize our variables a little bit so ball score so you see perfect block let's see it's one so he will get the ball but what if it's three it's a goal so let's see and it's one again so three again so it's perfect block right there hide it real quick and now we have to work on the goal post which has barely any code just when the green block is clicked just in case it will go to this position just in case if it moves or whatever and our net that has exactly the same code just you know just in case and now our wave which has some code so unless we're gonna wave so it's just gonna add some effects so the green flag is clicked it will go to x zero zero y zero and then it'll go forever it'll repeat three times and wait 0.2 seconds so it'll go up and down and up and down and up and down and it'll change y by 10 and then i'll repeat another three let's just duplicate that and just make some tweaks to it put it under do not put it in wait 0.2 seconds instead of change y by negative 10 change y by 10 so it's like what down up and down and up and down so as you can see look at the waves look at the waves and now let's look at the clouds which is just some extra you know look so when the green flag is clicked it'll go to this position i think i have the position yet and it'll go forever he'll go forever um well let's just make this even uh repeat oh repeat two times and it will wait 0.4 seconds it will change y by minus 1 so go up and down and up and down just like the waves but just in the sky so change y by 1 and then you just have to duplicate this put it under and then change y by one so we have our game and our banner is the last thing to code on our list so let's see what we have to do this year so when the green flag is clicked we have our three costumes you can either go to my thing my project and export the sprites or you can either write your own i think it's pretty easy to write on your own you just need some uh text and just write it so when the green flag is clicked so three costumes are the start score five to win are one and the lost and when the green fog is clicked um it'll go to x 0 y negative 40. i'll go to the front layer so be in front of everything and it will switch costume to start so it's in the beginning so switch costume to start and then it will show and then it'll wait 0.5 seconds and then it will hide and after all of that when i receive one that no go to uh same position and switch costume to one and it'll show and then it'll stop so it's the end of our project if you win and now we have to do the lose so just duplicate when i receive lost it'll go to this position switch costume to lost instead of one show and stuff so let's test out our game over here so we have our 10 balls our bulls eye is moving our goals keeper is dancing our waves are moving our clouds are slightly moving our score and we missed let's see what we get so he got basically two ones in a row and i got maybe a two or three so let's see i think i'm gonna lose this one though it's really hard actually to do this okay that's one more ball please yes okay so it says you won okay and now you lose uh so i'm here in my goalie to speed up the process perfect block is gonna be one out of one so it will always make it this is impossible game to win now no way you can get score anymore let's just farm out all our balls here so we're in our last ball here and it looks like you lost works so we have our game here so please like share subscribe join our studio join our discord server um and comment the comment section below what else games you want to make and so we also have if you have any questions please comment down below and we also have a discord server where you can ask all your questions you want all about rock blaster all about scrolling platformer all about the games that you need help on there's also scratch help channel where you can uh list your scratch help you need to scratch out and our our helpers will come and help you and um we will be having a 10k sub special and uh yeah just stay tuned for that so see you guys next time
