00:03 - [Music]
00:08 - hello welcome back to kids coding
00:10 - playground channel
00:11 - today we'll continue working on the
00:13 - halloween memory game that we have left
00:15 - off
00:16 - so this is part three uh before i
00:19 - start let's let me do this let me rename
00:22 - this
00:24 - halloween memory game
00:28 - i'll call it teaching so because i have
00:30 - the other one don't want to get it
00:31 - confused
00:32 - all right um i believe uh you guys
00:36 - understand if not
00:37 - you have to uh look at the uh part two
00:39 - of the video but uh
00:40 - last what we left off is we generate the
00:42 - list for the game matching number and
00:45 - then we generate the
00:46 - game sprite name and after that we send
00:50 - the broadcast message to
00:51 - the individual halloween sprite
00:54 - and based on that they get the name of
00:57 - the uh
00:58 - sprite and then it will set that costume
01:00 - just like right here you see that uh
01:02 - one is a spider so that's why one got
01:05 - set up as a spider
01:06 - and number two is the candy that's why
01:08 - it's set up as a candy
01:10 - so that's where we left off so now we
01:12 - will continue to walk on it we'll work
01:14 - on the cover
01:16 - um and then we will create a
01:20 - clone of each of these duplicate this uh
01:22 - costume
01:24 - uh this sprite and then we want to set
01:25 - the costume
01:27 - for our game all right
01:30 - okay let's go to the uh the sprite
01:34 - uh first so make sure we have uh the
01:37 - correct code
01:38 - uh we have let's go to the first frame
01:41 - so we have the uh when we set up this
01:43 - sprite we have changed the customer i
01:45 - think you'll
01:45 - understand that uh what we also want to
01:48 - do is we will
01:49 - put the drag this show under here just
01:51 - in case later on we hide it at the end
01:54 - you know we can hide the screen and then
01:56 - you know we need to show it at the
01:57 - beginning
01:58 - all right okay that's done
02:02 - uh we'll add the same thing here i think
02:04 - i was missed that earlier
02:05 - let's add this here as well okay so we
02:09 - have this
02:09 - and this now let's walk on the covering
02:12 - okay
02:13 - all right so we will work on the first
02:16 - cover so the first cover will be
02:18 - covering the first right here
02:20 - okay uh what we're going to do is we
02:24 - are going to drag the event when green
02:26 - flap is clicked
02:28 - kind of zoom in a little bit so you can
02:30 - see a little better
02:32 - and what we can do is there's something
02:35 - called go
02:36 - to right what you can say is go to
02:40 - halloween sprite one so this cover one
02:42 - will go covering this guy
02:44 - all right and what you also want to do
02:46 - is make it go to the front layer so that
02:48 - you know when it goes there we'll cover
02:50 - the hollowing spray so that
02:52 - player cannot see that and then you say
02:55 - show
02:56 - okay all right
02:59 - okay what we want to do is if we run
03:01 - this code right now you will see that
03:03 - this will cover the
03:04 - first box so let me try that let me run
03:06 - this code real quick you see
03:08 - it covered the first box right so what
03:10 - we need to do is when we clicked on it
03:11 - we have to review the
03:13 - the card underneath so what we need to
03:16 - do is this
03:18 - uh we have something called a there's an
03:20 - event for when the sprite is clicked
03:22 - right
03:23 - so there's some kind of event like that
03:24 - so we'll look for that let's see
03:26 - when the sprite is clicked right this is
03:29 - when the sprite is clicked and what we
03:32 - need to do
03:33 - is we are going to check if the actually
03:35 - the cat finished saying something right
03:37 - you remember
03:38 - cat we were broadcasting the game is
03:40 - started as yes right here
03:42 - this broadcast here so what we want to
03:44 - see is after this is done then
03:46 - we will allow it to click otherwise we
03:48 - don't want it to click while the
03:49 - game is still setting up right so that's
03:52 - why we need to check
03:54 - so you say if
03:57 - put this here and get this operator okay
04:01 - you are going to compare that variable
04:03 - we just set
04:04 - right is game started
04:09 - we set it to y right so if the game is
04:11 - started then
04:12 - that will allow the player to click on
04:14 - it okay
04:19 - okay so how do we hide it is very simple
04:22 - right we can just call the high
04:23 - right also like let's say we do this
04:27 - we click on it you see it shows right
04:30 - but this is not enough to
04:31 - make the game um correct right we just
04:35 - started
04:35 - the cover and then once it populated
04:38 - we just say hi right high height
04:42 - right it click it open up so that's how
04:44 - we hide right
04:45 - but this is not enough so what we need
04:47 - to do is we have to keep track of the
04:50 - what the player selected the first
04:52 - choice and the second choice right
04:53 - so what we have to do is you remember we
04:56 - created some variable earlier
04:58 - uh for the players choice one and two so
05:00 - we will be using these to uh to check
05:03 - okay all right so we'll get another
05:07 - uh condition here so you drag this let's
05:10 - take this high
05:11 - alpha right now we'll put this condition
05:13 - in here
05:15 - okay we are going to use a or joint here
05:19 - okay this is a hall joint for the if
05:21 - statement
05:22 - what we're going to do is we're going to
05:24 - check if the user had already selected
05:26 - something
05:27 - so uh how do you tell if the user has
05:29 - selected something
05:30 - what you can do is using this link
05:32 - though so the link just telling like
05:34 - how big the uh how many letter in the
05:37 - variable they have
05:38 - so let's say we have um say player
05:41 - choice one so we
05:42 - player did not choose anything the link
05:44 - will be zero so if the player choose
05:46 - something we'll put
05:48 - we'll put the name of the sprite into
05:49 - this variable so will have some value
05:52 - right so we'll do that later so what you
05:54 - can do is just take this the length of
05:56 - this guy
05:57 - nope you have to do the operator take
06:00 - another operator equal
06:03 - so you say the player choice
06:06 - link to zero meaning nothing is there
06:09 - okay
06:10 - you drop this into the first or joint
06:13 - here
06:14 - then let's take a duplicate this and
06:17 - put on the second one maybe i'll zoom
06:20 - back out a little bit
06:21 - okay and then you can right click and
06:24 - you can choose the player choice two
06:27 - so basically you're saying if the user
06:29 - have not choose anything
06:31 - for the first choice or the second
06:33 - choice what we want to do is we are
06:35 - going to broadcast something called
06:37 - selected sprite
06:38 - one right because this is the first
06:40 - sprite and this is the first cover
06:42 - so we'll in order to communicate with
06:44 - the other sprite and the variable
06:47 - will have to broadcast messages okay so
06:50 - use this broadcast message
06:53 - and wait uh click on this new message
06:57 - and then type in selected
07:00 - sprite one so the player selected the
07:04 - sprite one since it's clicking on the
07:05 - cover one right which is
07:06 - going to be on top of the sprite one
07:09 - okay
07:10 - and then what we're going to do is we
07:12 - are going to hide it
07:15 - okay okay so this is the first time the
07:19 - players do the choice so where to do the
07:20 - second choice so we'll work on that a
07:22 - little bit later
07:23 - so this is either choice one or choice
07:25 - two is not there or broadcast
07:27 - the the the message okay okay all right
07:30 - so what we go
07:31 - going to do we're going to go back to
07:33 - the first sprite
07:35 - when we broadcast a message for the
07:37 - sprite and we are going to add some code
07:41 - okay so we just broadcast that message
07:44 - right so we have to receive that message
07:47 - so let me kind of zoom in a little bit
07:50 - so when i receive this selected sprite
07:53 - one okay then we're gonna check the link
07:57 - again
07:58 - so using the if condition here
08:02 - okay and then you can use the operator
08:07 - and you can use the length again
08:11 - and we are you checking for player
08:13 - choice one
08:15 - okay we don't have to check both of them
08:17 - since there's only two choice
08:19 - so what we do is we are going to check
08:21 - up check the first choice
08:23 - if the first choice is not correct then
08:25 - we'll use the second choice so we know
08:27 - the second
08:27 - the if if it's not the first choice then
08:29 - it will be a second choice
08:31 - so uh what you do actually i pull the
08:33 - wrong one we need the if and nails right
08:35 - so that because we have two choices so
08:37 - what we do is this
08:40 - okay if the length of the first choice
08:42 - is zero
08:43 - meaning it did not if it is not it did
08:46 - not have anything
08:47 - selected then we will set it
08:51 - okay we'll say variable
08:54 - set the player choice one
08:58 - okay to or say it
09:02 - set it to the custom name so what is
09:04 - that custom name let's go back to look
09:06 - what the custom here right so let's say
09:09 - costume
09:10 - number right name so we want the name so
09:14 - which is these
09:14 - kind of name right and then else
09:19 - we will set it to player choice 2.
09:23 - so if it's not player choice 1 it's not
09:25 - there we'll set set it if
09:27 - play choice one is already there we'll
09:28 - set it to player choice 2.
09:30 - so when you first time you clicked on it
09:31 - let's say player clicked on choice 1
09:35 - then the player doesn't have any choice
09:36 - yet then they will set that name
09:38 - and then the the player click on another
09:40 - choice
09:41 - uh for a different sprite and uh you
09:43 - know there's choice one already picked
09:45 - then they set it to choice two
09:47 - okay i hope you guys understand that
09:49 - okay i'll run through
09:50 - some scenario you you'll understand a
09:52 - little bit better
09:54 - so what we need to do is we are going to
09:57 - create
09:59 - another another cover but before we
10:02 - do that let's go back to the cover we'll
10:04 - finish some code here so we can
10:05 - duplicate the code
10:08 - okay so we will need another if operator
10:10 - here
10:12 - put it underneath here uh what we want
10:15 - to do is make sure that okay if the
10:16 - player has select both of the choice
10:18 - then we want to check the answer right
10:21 - okay so what we can do is this
10:24 - we use an operator this time another or
10:27 - so above is using or now we're going to
10:29 - use it
10:30 - in so we are going to take this
10:35 - choice one and choice two
10:40 - not greater than we're going to use a
10:41 - greater than not equal
10:43 - so sorry i was trying to be lazy i guess
10:46 - that's not going to work
10:48 - let's just use the greater than here
10:52 - oops
10:57 - so the length of choice one is greater
10:59 - than zero meaning something already
11:01 - selected
11:02 - and we'll duplicate this now
11:07 - we don't need this we'll select this so
11:10 - you have to right click that if you want
11:12 - to select it okay right click on the
11:13 - variable it will pop up this
11:15 - uh window and you can select okay so the
11:17 - length of
11:18 - player choice one is greater than zero
11:20 - meaning something has selected on player
11:22 - choice one
11:23 - and the player choice two also selected
11:25 - so basically the player had
11:27 - selected two uh two cards
11:30 - then what we want to do is one broadcast
11:33 - a message
11:35 - okay and wait so what you want to do is
11:37 - use broadcast a message and wait
11:39 - what this is going to do is wait for the
11:41 - checking of the instruction
11:42 - so if you don't if you put a weight here
11:44 - so that means they'll prevent users
11:46 - from clicking more than one time on the
11:48 - or if they already select two choices
11:50 - you don't want them to keep on clicking
11:51 - right
11:52 - so that's why we use this uh selected uh
11:54 - broadcast and wait
11:56 - or settle a new message called let's say
12:00 - check answer
12:03 - okay i have this a lowercase i mean it
12:06 - could be uppercase i guess let's
12:08 - maybe let's make it um
12:11 - same i think all my broadcast is
12:13 - uppercase right yeah let's just change
12:15 - that to be consistent
12:17 - call it select
12:22 - one right selected sprite one okay all
12:25 - right
12:26 - okay once since we made that change we
12:28 - make sure that we have followed that
12:30 - uh changes back to select sprite one
12:32 - okay
12:33 - all right so you don't have to do that i
12:36 - just want to check make sure it's
12:37 - consistent
12:38 - so send us as i was using capital as in
12:41 - the broadcast message i want to make it
12:43 - the same
12:43 - okay all right okay
12:47 - so what we want to do is
12:50 - we are going to create one more cover
12:52 - box okay
12:53 - uh and then we are going to code the
12:55 - second sprite here
12:56 - so you can see so let's just say uh
12:59 - right click
13:00 - say duplicate so this is cover two so
13:03 - cover two will have most of the code
13:05 - from what we have done for cover one
13:07 - but we are going to change it slightly
13:10 - okay instead go to halloween
13:12 - sprite one we have to go to halloween
13:14 - sprite two so this is the second box we
13:15 - want to cover this guy so i want to
13:18 - go to uh two right same thing here
13:21 - the game is started same we are going to
13:24 - check this but instead of broadcast uh
13:27 - selected sprite one
13:28 - we need to broadcast a different one
13:30 - we'll call it
13:32 - selected
13:34 - two so this will let the
13:37 - sprite number two know that we have
13:39 - selected him
13:41 - okay so same code uh player choice one
13:44 - not there
13:45 - or this then it will select it if um
13:49 - if the player choice uh one or two is
13:52 - greater than
13:53 - zero meaning both of the choices are
13:55 - populated then we'll broadcast check
13:56 - answer
13:57 - so check answer will have the code in
13:59 - the cat later but for now don't worry
14:01 - about that just
14:02 - make sure the code is kind of looking
14:04 - like this
14:05 - and we have to set up in a a different
14:07 - location right
14:09 - uh i don't know i think we're fine
14:10 - because we have the location of the
14:12 - sprite too i think we're good there so
14:14 - far
14:15 - okay all right let's go back to number
14:19 - two
14:19 - we're gonna have to copy some code from
14:21 - the cat to this guy the sprite one to
14:23 - two
14:24 - okay let's see we have this let's copy
14:26 - drag and then
14:28 - kind of drop it in here okay all right
14:31 - so make sure you remember to change this
14:33 - to two
14:34 - right because we are number two sprite
14:37 - and
14:38 - i think we're good here so far let's
14:41 - just run the game see how it goes
14:44 - okay so run the game will populate the
14:46 - list and properly the uh
14:48 - the sprite and they'll cover it so what
14:50 - do we see here
14:51 - number one is the toe is that right yep
14:54 - that's the toe
14:56 - and number two here is the black cat
14:59 - right so that's correct so let's say we
15:02 - click on this does it open
15:03 - and show let's see okay also we want to
15:06 - see the variable right you guys make
15:09 - sure you want to turn this on
15:10 - so that you can see what you have what
15:13 - the player has
15:14 - chosen right okay let's see so if i
15:17 - click on number two first doesn't matter
15:19 - which one
15:20 - whatever i click on first we'll go to
15:22 - the first choice okay
15:23 - let's say click on the second box so you
15:26 - see it populate the first choice
15:28 - same black cat right the black cat if i
15:31 - click on the second choice
15:32 - since the first choice is populated here
15:35 - right this code here right
15:37 - you see right if it's or or this or
15:40 - broadcast
15:41 - so so now player choice number one
15:44 - already been populated now player choice
15:46 - number two is not there
15:47 - so what it does is it's gonna broadcast
15:49 - this uh select uh
15:51 - sprite one we'll come back over here and
15:53 - select
15:54 - sprite one will set the name right if
15:55 - there's nothing has chosen
15:58 - uh for choice one it will put this and
16:00 - else it'll just put on choice two so it
16:02 - doesn't matter
16:02 - so choice one already fulfilled right
16:05 - because of this
16:06 - this code here so choice one was not
16:08 - there before so it set it the name for
16:10 - choice one
16:11 - so now this will run the choice two so
16:13 - if i click on this
16:14 - so you see that it populated choice two
16:17 - as the frog
16:18 - so now we have over the choice so player
16:20 - have opened two card
16:22 - so now we are going to match it right
16:25 - okay all right so how do you match it so
16:28 - what you have to do is you have to go
16:30 - back to the cat
16:32 - okay the cat has a lot of code we'll do
16:35 - some code on the side here
16:37 - let's do it over here
16:40 - okay so what we do we're going to zoom
16:42 - in a little bit
16:47 - drag this event here when i receive
16:51 - check answer that's when we have both of
16:53 - the choices have been picked we're going
16:55 - to call this
16:56 - check answer what we're going to do is
16:58 - we are going to grab the
17:00 - condition here this if statement and
17:03 - else everything else
17:04 - so we are going to check if they're the
17:06 - same
17:09 - so what we're going to check is
17:12 - we're going to check the variable of
17:14 - their choice 1
17:16 - and the variable here is two so if
17:18 - they're the same
17:20 - if that's the same then we will make the
17:23 - cat say something
17:25 - say uh you have a match
17:32 - we'll do it for one second so a little
17:34 - bit faster
17:35 - if you want the user to be able to see
17:38 - the
17:39 - longer then you can put it like no two
17:41 - seconds
17:43 - and then what we want to do is we want
17:45 - to add this uh
17:46 - choice to the uh match list so we are
17:49 - going to use the match list to
17:51 - uh to match it later okay
17:55 - so that we know like if the user have
17:57 - picked up all the
17:59 - match then the game is over so what
18:01 - we're going to do is
18:03 - we'll go back to variable go to the list
18:05 - here
18:06 - grab this one at things okay
18:11 - so we'll put it under here
18:14 - so we'll take up one of the variable it
18:16 - doesn't matter which one because they're
18:17 - the same right
18:18 - so they're the same right you can get
18:20 - one or two it doesn't matter
18:21 - and what we want to do is we are going
18:23 - to set it to this
18:24 - [Music]
18:25 - player selected actually so
18:29 - this is so if you have a match we'll add
18:31 - it to this list
18:32 - okay and we will use another one
18:37 - i'll put this here so we are going to
18:40 - compare
18:41 - the the less sense we have a
18:44 - six uh 12 we are we're going to create
18:47 - 12 boxes right so that will be six match
18:49 - right so if all of them are done they
18:52 - will have actually six
18:53 - uh value in this list right so we can
18:56 - say
18:58 - go back to variable and you will say um
19:02 - there's something called linked right so
19:04 - you say linked off
19:07 - player match selected list equal to six
19:11 - meaning you match all six pair
19:14 - then you can broadcast a message
19:18 - so you can broadcast a message anyway it
19:22 - doesn't matter it doesn't really matter
19:23 - for this one you can
19:24 - podcast a u in
19:28 - so because you made all the six pair
19:30 - send you in so we can create another
19:31 - sprite and then display you in later
19:33 - okay just for now just broadcast it
19:36 - don't worry about it we'll
19:37 - get back to it and then we will grab
19:40 - this one
19:41 - here saying sorry
19:46 - not a match on or not a match
19:51 - again
19:54 - [Music]
19:57 - okay and then we what we need to do is
20:00 - after they check the answer we want to
20:02 - clear the
20:03 - answer okay okay so
20:06 - we have to clear the answer so that next
20:08 - time we can check it right
20:10 - so you have to say check player choice
20:14 - one just delete that
20:18 - duplicate this player choice two
20:22 - or delete it okay and then what we need
20:26 - to do if it doesn't match what you have
20:28 - to do
20:28 - you have to cover it right if it match
20:31 - then we'll
20:32 - stay on right so we actually after
20:34 - running this
20:35 - check here after the check what we can
20:38 - do is we can broadcast an error message
20:41 - all right so
20:45 - you can say broadcast net message
20:50 - you can either use either one this one
20:52 - really doesn't matter
20:54 - so what we can do is just say
20:57 - a new message called
21:01 - cover cards okay so what it does is it's
21:04 - gonna tell the
21:05 - sprite to to cover it up if they don't
21:08 - find a match
21:09 - okay so we're gonna go back to our
21:11 - sprite
21:12 - right so when we receive like uh
21:16 - covering the card where they do
21:18 - something right
21:19 - okay so what we need to do is we are
21:22 - going to grab this
21:24 - let me move this over a little bit i
21:27 - guess
21:29 - okay and i'll move this over here
21:33 - i'll zoom back out a little bit okay
21:37 - all right okay we are going to grab this
21:41 - if statement here
21:45 - and then we will use a
21:48 - not operator so you remember the list
21:51 - that we created earlier
21:52 - when we found a match we added to this
21:55 - list so what we can do is we're going to
21:57 - check if that
21:58 - they have the match here okay
22:02 - okay so here you say not
22:06 - use a not operator here and then
22:10 - we are going to grab the player
22:14 - mesh list whereas that we are looking
22:17 - for
22:18 - contain here
22:19 - [Music]
22:21 - contain okay
22:24 - game matching number let's play your
22:26 - selected matchmakers that's the list
22:28 - that the player selected right
22:29 - if it contains okay
22:33 - go back to look
22:36 - and then we're gonna use the custom name
22:41 - okay if it contains a custom name that
22:43 - means it's a match
22:46 - okay then what we're going to do is
22:48 - we're going to broadcast another message
22:52 - okay we will broadcast another message
22:58 - okay what we want to say is
23:05 - show cover one
23:08 - i think i have spaces and lines
23:11 - uh okay this one doesn't last man i'm
23:14 - not
23:14 - putting consistently i really hate that
23:17 - but uh
23:18 - anyway i think these have no space
23:19 - that's me putting no space
23:24 - i should make it more consistent on my
23:26 - coding
23:27 - with these messages
23:30 - show cover one so what we want to do if
23:33 - it doesn't match anything
23:34 - we want to make sure the cover cover
23:36 - back the the sprite so we have this in
23:39 - our sprite one right we have to go back
23:40 - to cover one
23:43 - okay so in the cover one we will
23:46 - receive this
23:49 - right show cover one what we want to do
23:53 - is we are going to show it basically
23:56 - after you hide it right select it open
23:58 - and then if it doesn't match
24:00 - the the sprite then this guy will
24:03 - broadcast the
24:04 - show cover one will come back to here
24:06 - and then this guy will show up
24:07 - and we'll hide the frog right whatever
24:10 - it is
24:10 - okay now let's finish the other cat as
24:13 - well
24:14 - similar to what we had here okay we are
24:17 - going to drag it and drop it into the
24:19 - cat
24:21 - and we move it down here okay so we
24:24 - we copy it over here right now let's go
24:26 - check
24:27 - okay we have it over here the uh
24:31 - check answer so
24:34 - what we need to do we are going to
24:36 - change this broadcast message
24:38 - we'll make a new one say show
24:43 - cover two so this will broadcast back to
24:47 - uh cover two
24:49 - so similarly for cover one right with
24:51 - this show we'll just copy it over we'll
24:53 - we're going to change the message here
24:57 - [Music]
24:58 - show cover two okay all right i think
25:02 - we are good here let's just test out the
25:04 - code and see how it goes okay
25:07 - okay let me play this again so you have
25:11 - the empty list
25:13 - two of them populated i'll click on the
25:15 - first
25:16 - choice is the i second choice
25:21 - oops okay i made a mistake over here
25:24 - this is the
25:25 - check answer make sure you guys
25:28 - select the uh cover cards okay
25:32 - just like what we had here should be
25:34 - cover card no check answer okay
25:36 - i'm gonna stick there so all right so
25:40 - make sure you select that correctly i
25:42 - think i
25:42 - did not select it correctly earlier
25:45 - okay uh the check answer should only be
25:48 - here
25:48 - that we're checking the answer these two
25:51 - are actually covering the
25:53 - cards okay so make sure you do that okay
25:56 - let's run it again
25:57 - [Music]
25:59 - okay once it's populated the list right
26:03 - we will click on the first one just send
26:05 - it the demo
26:07 - second one the candy you see that it
26:09 - doesn't match
26:10 - so it close it back so they actually
26:12 - have a match
26:13 - then it will actually stay on okay i
26:16 - think we'll stop right here for now
26:18 - um next time we'll go into uh
26:22 - creating more uh sprite and then the
26:24 - more cover
26:25 - uh to finish off that part
26:29 - okay so thank you uh for watching please
26:32 - like
26:32 - share subscribe to our channel and see
26:35 - you guys in the next video bye
26:38 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hello welcome back to kids coding playground channel today we'll continue working on the halloween memory game that we have left off so this is part three uh before i start let's let me do this let me rename this halloween memory game i'll call it teaching so because i have the other one don't want to get it confused all right um i believe uh you guys understand if not you have to uh look at the uh part two of the video but uh last what we left off is we generate the list for the game matching number and then we generate the game sprite name and after that we send the broadcast message to the individual halloween sprite and based on that they get the name of the uh sprite and then it will set that costume just like right here you see that uh one is a spider so that's why one got set up as a spider and number two is the candy that's why it's set up as a candy so that's where we left off so now we will continue to walk on it we'll work on the cover um and then we will create a clone of each of these duplicate this uh costume uh this sprite and then we want to set the costume for our game all right okay let's go to the uh the sprite uh first so make sure we have uh the correct code uh we have let's go to the first frame so we have the uh when we set up this sprite we have changed the customer i think you'll understand that uh what we also want to do is we will put the drag this show under here just in case later on we hide it at the end you know we can hide the screen and then you know we need to show it at the beginning all right okay that's done uh we'll add the same thing here i think i was missed that earlier let's add this here as well okay so we have this and this now let's walk on the covering okay all right so we will work on the first cover so the first cover will be covering the first right here okay uh what we're going to do is we are going to drag the event when green flap is clicked kind of zoom in a little bit so you can see a little better and what we can do is there's something called go to right what you can say is go to halloween sprite one so this cover one will go covering this guy all right and what you also want to do is make it go to the front layer so that you know when it goes there we'll cover the hollowing spray so that player cannot see that and then you say show okay all right okay what we want to do is if we run this code right now you will see that this will cover the first box so let me try that let me run this code real quick you see it covered the first box right so what we need to do is when we clicked on it we have to review the the card underneath so what we need to do is this uh we have something called a there's an event for when the sprite is clicked right so there's some kind of event like that so we'll look for that let's see when the sprite is clicked right this is when the sprite is clicked and what we need to do is we are going to check if the actually the cat finished saying something right you remember cat we were broadcasting the game is started as yes right here this broadcast here so what we want to see is after this is done then we will allow it to click otherwise we don't want it to click while the game is still setting up right so that's why we need to check so you say if put this here and get this operator okay you are going to compare that variable we just set right is game started we set it to y right so if the game is started then that will allow the player to click on it okay okay so how do we hide it is very simple right we can just call the high right also like let's say we do this we click on it you see it shows right but this is not enough to make the game um correct right we just started the cover and then once it populated we just say hi right high height right it click it open up so that's how we hide right but this is not enough so what we need to do is we have to keep track of the what the player selected the first choice and the second choice right so what we have to do is you remember we created some variable earlier uh for the players choice one and two so we will be using these to uh to check okay all right so we'll get another uh condition here so you drag this let's take this high alpha right now we'll put this condition in here okay we are going to use a or joint here okay this is a hall joint for the if statement what we're going to do is we're going to check if the user had already selected something so uh how do you tell if the user has selected something what you can do is using this link though so the link just telling like how big the uh how many letter in the variable they have so let's say we have um say player choice one so we player did not choose anything the link will be zero so if the player choose something we'll put we'll put the name of the sprite into this variable so will have some value right so we'll do that later so what you can do is just take this the length of this guy nope you have to do the operator take another operator equal so you say the player choice link to zero meaning nothing is there okay you drop this into the first or joint here then let's take a duplicate this and put on the second one maybe i'll zoom back out a little bit okay and then you can right click and you can choose the player choice two so basically you're saying if the user have not choose anything for the first choice or the second choice what we want to do is we are going to broadcast something called selected sprite one right because this is the first sprite and this is the first cover so we'll in order to communicate with the other sprite and the variable will have to broadcast messages okay so use this broadcast message and wait uh click on this new message and then type in selected sprite one so the player selected the sprite one since it's clicking on the cover one right which is going to be on top of the sprite one okay and then what we're going to do is we are going to hide it okay okay so this is the first time the players do the choice so where to do the second choice so we'll work on that a little bit later so this is either choice one or choice two is not there or broadcast the the the message okay okay all right so what we go going to do we're going to go back to the first sprite when we broadcast a message for the sprite and we are going to add some code okay so we just broadcast that message right so we have to receive that message so let me kind of zoom in a little bit so when i receive this selected sprite one okay then we're gonna check the link again so using the if condition here okay and then you can use the operator and you can use the length again and we are you checking for player choice one okay we don't have to check both of them since there's only two choice so what we do is we are going to check up check the first choice if the first choice is not correct then we'll use the second choice so we know the second the if if it's not the first choice then it will be a second choice so uh what you do actually i pull the wrong one we need the if and nails right so that because we have two choices so what we do is this okay if the length of the first choice is zero meaning it did not if it is not it did not have anything selected then we will set it okay we'll say variable set the player choice one okay to or say it set it to the custom name so what is that custom name let's go back to look what the custom here right so let's say costume number right name so we want the name so which is these kind of name right and then else we will set it to player choice 2. so if it's not player choice 1 it's not there we'll set set it if play choice one is already there we'll set it to player choice 2. so when you first time you clicked on it let's say player clicked on choice 1 then the player doesn't have any choice yet then they will set that name and then the the player click on another choice uh for a different sprite and uh you know there's choice one already picked then they set it to choice two okay i hope you guys understand that okay i'll run through some scenario you you'll understand a little bit better so what we need to do is we are going to create another another cover but before we do that let's go back to the cover we'll finish some code here so we can duplicate the code okay so we will need another if operator here put it underneath here uh what we want to do is make sure that okay if the player has select both of the choice then we want to check the answer right okay so what we can do is this we use an operator this time another or so above is using or now we're going to use it in so we are going to take this choice one and choice two not greater than we're going to use a greater than not equal so sorry i was trying to be lazy i guess that's not going to work let's just use the greater than here oops so the length of choice one is greater than zero meaning something already selected and we'll duplicate this now we don't need this we'll select this so you have to right click that if you want to select it okay right click on the variable it will pop up this uh window and you can select okay so the length of player choice one is greater than zero meaning something has selected on player choice one and the player choice two also selected so basically the player had selected two uh two cards then what we want to do is one broadcast a message okay and wait so what you want to do is use broadcast a message and wait what this is going to do is wait for the checking of the instruction so if you don't if you put a weight here so that means they'll prevent users from clicking more than one time on the or if they already select two choices you don't want them to keep on clicking right so that's why we use this uh selected uh broadcast and wait or settle a new message called let's say check answer okay i have this a lowercase i mean it could be uppercase i guess let's maybe let's make it um same i think all my broadcast is uppercase right yeah let's just change that to be consistent call it select one right selected sprite one okay all right okay once since we made that change we make sure that we have followed that uh changes back to select sprite one okay all right so you don't have to do that i just want to check make sure it's consistent so send us as i was using capital as in the broadcast message i want to make it the same okay all right okay so what we want to do is we are going to create one more cover box okay uh and then we are going to code the second sprite here so you can see so let's just say uh right click say duplicate so this is cover two so cover two will have most of the code from what we have done for cover one but we are going to change it slightly okay instead go to halloween sprite one we have to go to halloween sprite two so this is the second box we want to cover this guy so i want to go to uh two right same thing here the game is started same we are going to check this but instead of broadcast uh selected sprite one we need to broadcast a different one we'll call it selected two so this will let the sprite number two know that we have selected him okay so same code uh player choice one not there or this then it will select it if um if the player choice uh one or two is greater than zero meaning both of the choices are populated then we'll broadcast check answer so check answer will have the code in the cat later but for now don't worry about that just make sure the code is kind of looking like this and we have to set up in a a different location right uh i don't know i think we're fine because we have the location of the sprite too i think we're good there so far okay all right let's go back to number two we're gonna have to copy some code from the cat to this guy the sprite one to two okay let's see we have this let's copy drag and then kind of drop it in here okay all right so make sure you remember to change this to two right because we are number two sprite and i think we're good here so far let's just run the game see how it goes okay so run the game will populate the list and properly the uh the sprite and they'll cover it so what do we see here number one is the toe is that right yep that's the toe and number two here is the black cat right so that's correct so let's say we click on this does it open and show let's see okay also we want to see the variable right you guys make sure you want to turn this on so that you can see what you have what the player has chosen right okay let's see so if i click on number two first doesn't matter which one whatever i click on first we'll go to the first choice okay let's say click on the second box so you see it populate the first choice same black cat right the black cat if i click on the second choice since the first choice is populated here right this code here right you see right if it's or or this or broadcast so so now player choice number one already been populated now player choice number two is not there so what it does is it's gonna broadcast this uh select uh sprite one we'll come back over here and select sprite one will set the name right if there's nothing has chosen uh for choice one it will put this and else it'll just put on choice two so it doesn't matter so choice one already fulfilled right because of this this code here so choice one was not there before so it set it the name for choice one so now this will run the choice two so if i click on this so you see that it populated choice two as the frog so now we have over the choice so player have opened two card so now we are going to match it right okay all right so how do you match it so what you have to do is you have to go back to the cat okay the cat has a lot of code we'll do some code on the side here let's do it over here okay so what we do we're going to zoom in a little bit drag this event here when i receive check answer that's when we have both of the choices have been picked we're going to call this check answer what we're going to do is we are going to grab the condition here this if statement and else everything else so we are going to check if they're the same so what we're going to check is we're going to check the variable of their choice 1 and the variable here is two so if they're the same if that's the same then we will make the cat say something say uh you have a match we'll do it for one second so a little bit faster if you want the user to be able to see the longer then you can put it like no two seconds and then what we want to do is we want to add this uh choice to the uh match list so we are going to use the match list to uh to match it later okay so that we know like if the user have picked up all the match then the game is over so what we're going to do is we'll go back to variable go to the list here grab this one at things okay so we'll put it under here so we'll take up one of the variable it doesn't matter which one because they're the same right so they're the same right you can get one or two it doesn't matter and what we want to do is we are going to set it to this player selected actually so this is so if you have a match we'll add it to this list okay and we will use another one i'll put this here so we are going to compare the the less sense we have a six uh 12 we are we're going to create 12 boxes right so that will be six match right so if all of them are done they will have actually six uh value in this list right so we can say go back to variable and you will say um there's something called linked right so you say linked off player match selected list equal to six meaning you match all six pair then you can broadcast a message so you can broadcast a message anyway it doesn't matter it doesn't really matter for this one you can podcast a u in so because you made all the six pair send you in so we can create another sprite and then display you in later okay just for now just broadcast it don't worry about it we'll get back to it and then we will grab this one here saying sorry not a match on or not a match again okay and then we what we need to do is after they check the answer we want to clear the answer okay okay so we have to clear the answer so that next time we can check it right so you have to say check player choice one just delete that duplicate this player choice two or delete it okay and then what we need to do if it doesn't match what you have to do you have to cover it right if it match then we'll stay on right so we actually after running this check here after the check what we can do is we can broadcast an error message all right so you can say broadcast net message you can either use either one this one really doesn't matter so what we can do is just say a new message called cover cards okay so what it does is it's gonna tell the sprite to to cover it up if they don't find a match okay so we're gonna go back to our sprite right so when we receive like uh covering the card where they do something right okay so what we need to do is we are going to grab this let me move this over a little bit i guess okay and i'll move this over here i'll zoom back out a little bit okay all right okay we are going to grab this if statement here and then we will use a not operator so you remember the list that we created earlier when we found a match we added to this list so what we can do is we're going to check if that they have the match here okay okay so here you say not use a not operator here and then we are going to grab the player mesh list whereas that we are looking for contain here contain okay game matching number let's play your selected matchmakers that's the list that the player selected right if it contains okay go back to look and then we're gonna use the custom name okay if it contains a custom name that means it's a match okay then what we're going to do is we're going to broadcast another message okay we will broadcast another message okay what we want to say is show cover one i think i have spaces and lines uh okay this one doesn't last man i'm not putting consistently i really hate that but uh anyway i think these have no space that's me putting no space i should make it more consistent on my coding with these messages show cover one so what we want to do if it doesn't match anything we want to make sure the cover cover back the the sprite so we have this in our sprite one right we have to go back to cover one okay so in the cover one we will receive this right show cover one what we want to do is we are going to show it basically after you hide it right select it open and then if it doesn't match the the sprite then this guy will broadcast the show cover one will come back to here and then this guy will show up and we'll hide the frog right whatever it is okay now let's finish the other cat as well similar to what we had here okay we are going to drag it and drop it into the cat and we move it down here okay so we we copy it over here right now let's go check okay we have it over here the uh check answer so what we need to do we are going to change this broadcast message we'll make a new one say show cover two so this will broadcast back to uh cover two so similarly for cover one right with this show we'll just copy it over we'll we're going to change the message here show cover two okay all right i think we are good here let's just test out the code and see how it goes okay okay let me play this again so you have the empty list two of them populated i'll click on the first choice is the i second choice oops okay i made a mistake over here this is the check answer make sure you guys select the uh cover cards okay just like what we had here should be cover card no check answer okay i'm gonna stick there so all right so make sure you select that correctly i think i did not select it correctly earlier okay uh the check answer should only be here that we're checking the answer these two are actually covering the cards okay so make sure you do that okay let's run it again okay once it's populated the list right we will click on the first one just send it the demo second one the candy you see that it doesn't match so it close it back so they actually have a match then it will actually stay on okay i think we'll stop right here for now um next time we'll go into uh creating more uh sprite and then the more cover uh to finish off that part okay so thank you uh for watching please like share subscribe to our channel and see you guys in the next video bye
