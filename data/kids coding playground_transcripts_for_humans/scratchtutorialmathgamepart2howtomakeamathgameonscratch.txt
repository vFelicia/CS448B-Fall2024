00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:09 - kids coding playground
00:10 - today we're working the second part for
00:12 - the um scratch
00:13 - math game so in the last tutorial uh we
00:16 - learned how to make the addition
00:18 - and we made the audition button so today
00:21 - and the quick button um so we're gonna
00:24 - work in the subtraction button
00:26 - um subtraction um the custom block and
00:30 - we're also going to work on
00:30 - multiplication
00:32 - so i'm just going to drag and drop the
00:33 - multiplication
00:35 - in here as well hold up i don't have it
00:37 - so let me get it
00:39 - okay so now i have the multiplication
00:40 - button i just got it from
00:43 - my other project so now i have the three
00:44 - buttons
00:46 - so let's start out from the subtraction
00:48 - button everyone
00:49 - um so everyone let's go to the
00:51 - subtraction button and let's code on
00:52 - here first let's zoom in a little bit
00:54 - so for addition we can just copy paste
00:58 - everything just drag and drop everything
01:00 - into the subtraction
01:02 - except we just need to change up one
01:03 - broadcast that's
01:05 - pretty much it for the subtraction
01:06 - button so for subtraction button
01:09 - we're gonna get um so we'll separate all
01:11 - this
01:13 - instead of here instead of start edition
01:16 - we have to broadcast a new message
01:17 - called start
01:18 - subtraction
01:24 - so we have broadcast start subtraction
01:28 - so let's go back into our cat we have to
01:29 - define a new custom block
01:31 - so let's go to my blocks and let's make
01:34 - a new custom block and name it
01:36 - subtraction
01:39 - so subtraction click ok
01:42 - so let's define it now so let's get a
01:44 - forever loop
01:45 - [Music]
01:47 - forever loop so in the beginning we
01:49 - always want to set the guess to zero
01:52 - to zero and then we want to set the
01:54 - random number one
01:56 - and the random number two to pick random
01:58 - one to 100
02:02 - and the um subtraction is a little bit
02:04 - different from addition
02:05 - that's why i didn't copy paste it
02:07 - because you need to find
02:08 - if the random number one is greater than
02:10 - random number two
02:12 - because if the random number uh two is
02:15 - smaller than the random number one and
02:16 - you're subtracting it
02:18 - we don't want negative numbers so we
02:19 - have to do that so
02:22 - so if we set the two random numbers pick
02:25 - random one to 100
02:26 - let's get a repeat until so we have to
02:29 - repeat until
02:29 - guess is equal to answer problem so if
02:32 - the
02:33 - guess of the answer is equal to the
02:34 - actual answer
02:36 - so repeat until the guess is equal to
02:39 - the answer
02:40 - problem and then after that we want to
02:43 - get an if density
02:44 - if
02:48 - wouldn't it if then else sorry put an if
02:51 - then else inside this repeat
02:52 - until loop so we wanna if random number
02:56 - one is greater than random number two so
02:58 - this is where you detect if
02:59 - random number one is greater than random
03:02 - number two
03:03 - so if random number one is greater than
03:05 - random number two
03:07 - then we want to set the answer to
03:08 - problem of random number one minus
03:10 - random number two so let's set the
03:13 - answer to problem
03:14 - some random number one minus random
03:16 - number two so
03:19 - uh get a subtraction symbol put that in
03:21 - here
03:23 - random number one subtracted
03:27 - random number two so subtract the first
03:29 - number which is greater than random
03:30 - number two
03:32 - i'll be random number one minus random
03:34 - number two
03:35 - and then we'll ask a question ask
03:38 - we're gonna put two joins
03:42 - put a drawing here and put a join here
03:46 - so we want to say random number one
03:49 - in the first slot which is any number
03:51 - that's from 100
03:53 - then we join it with the minus sign
03:56 - and then we get a random number two
04:00 - and put it in here else if
04:03 - a random number one is not greater than
04:05 - random number two
04:06 - then we want to set the random num then
04:08 - we want to just duplicate this
04:10 - and instead of doing this we can switch
04:13 - them around
04:13 - so instead of putting random number one
04:15 - minus random
04:16 - two it'll be random number two minus
04:18 - random number one so
04:20 - do it the other way around so then it'll
04:22 - always never be negative
04:24 - and then i'll ask and say right here
04:25 - we're gonna switch these two again so
04:28 - we're gonna join random number two minus
04:30 - random number one
04:33 - and then we're gonna set the guess to
04:35 - the answer
04:37 - down here let's set the guess to answer
04:43 - um and then if we're going to get
04:46 - another if then else
04:48 - okay so let's get an if then else and
04:50 - put it right here
04:52 - so if the guess is equal to the answer
04:54 - to problem
04:56 - yes is equal to answer to problem
05:01 - um then we're gonna have to start the
05:04 - sound guitar strum i already have it
05:07 - start sound guitar strum and then
05:10 - we're going to say that is correct so
05:12 - i'm just going to duplicate this
05:13 - right here and then put it down here
05:16 - else
05:17 - we're going to do this string pluck and
05:19 - say that is the wrong answer
05:21 - so as you can see subtraction needs a
05:22 - bit more code than addition because you
05:24 - have to find
05:25 - which number is greater than which so
05:28 - and then finally we have to do a uh
05:30 - we have to um call the
05:33 - function right here so we're gonna get a
05:35 - broadcast
05:37 - when i receive start edition uh
05:39 - subtraction sorry about that
05:41 - we're gonna run the subtraction call
05:43 - this
05:45 - custom blocker here so let's try it out
05:47 - right now
05:48 - so i'm gonna save it and play it
05:53 - let's try it out so
05:57 - okay so at the subtraction button
05:59 - addition button so let's say if i click
06:01 - on subtraction
06:02 - boom now it will not be negative as you
06:04 - can see 90 minus 49
06:06 - is not a negative number so let's say i
06:08 - get right
06:10 - so let's say i get it wrong then i'll do
06:12 - that
06:13 - but if i get it right then don't do this
06:18 - so there was a little bug right here so
06:20 - i got the answer correct which was 41
06:23 - and it didn't work so i accidentally
06:24 - didn't answer the problem right here it
06:26 - should be
06:26 - guess so um you guys have to do guess
06:29 - instead of answering a problem that was
06:31 - a little
06:32 - mistake by me so don't do answer problem
06:35 - you have to put yes that's why it did
06:36 - not work
06:37 - so now let's see if it works now it
06:40 - should work
06:46 - so
06:48 - now let's go to subtraction so i'm just
06:50 - going to click on it 60 minus 1 that's
06:52 - 59.
06:53 - so as you can see now it's correct back
06:55 - then i uh when i got the right answer it
06:57 - still didn't get it right because
06:59 - um there's a little bug in it so um so
07:02 - the answer is 22 for here let's see if
07:04 - it's right
07:05 - okay that's right and gain score and you
07:07 - get it wrong
07:08 - on purpose it'll say that's the wrong
07:10 - answer so now
07:12 - we have the subtraction and addition
07:14 - functioning correctly
07:15 - now we can work on our multiplication
07:17 - button
07:18 - so let's go to our multiplication uh
07:21 - just drag and drop
07:22 - all of this code into the multiplication
07:24 - we just have to change one broadcast
07:29 - um just drag and drop all this
07:32 - and one more
07:36 - let's see if i got it off oops i did not
07:39 - get one of them i think
07:42 - yeah i did not get the one flag clicked
07:48 - uh yeah this one so i'm just gonna drag
07:49 - and drop it here
07:52 - and i don't know where this one went so
07:53 - i'm just gonna give it to here as well
07:55 - so drag it from the front i think that's
07:59 - why
08:00 - so when flying click time yeah okay so
08:02 - now we have
08:03 - the code for the multiplication instead
08:05 - of broadcasting
08:06 - start subtraction we're gonna have to
08:08 - broadcast start multiplication
08:11 - start
08:13 - [Music]
08:15 - multiplication i think that's how you
08:18 - spell it but
08:20 - that's just broadcast that and then
08:23 - let's go back into our cat sprint
08:26 - and then so for the multiplication um
08:28 - i'm only going to do it 1 to 12
08:31 - because um this is like for kids
08:33 - multiplication so i'm not going to make
08:34 - it too hard
08:35 - but you have to use like scratch paper
08:37 - and all that so to make a new custom
08:39 - block
08:40 - it's called multiplication
08:45 - multiplication click ok
08:49 - so we're going to define multiplication
08:50 - so let's get a forever loop
08:54 - um you want to set the guess to zero
09:00 - yes to zero and
09:03 - we're gonna set the random number one
09:06 - and the random number two
09:08 - both to only pick random one to twelve
09:12 - so it isn't too hard so
09:15 - pick random one twelve only you guys can
09:18 - do it any value you want
09:21 - and i'm going to set the answer to
09:22 - problem
09:25 - to um random number one multiplying
09:28 - by random number two so multiply this
09:32 - random number by
09:33 - this random number so random number one
09:36 - times random number two
09:40 - and okay so we're going to get a repeat
09:42 - until we're going to repeat until
09:45 - guess is equal to answer to problem
09:49 - so wait until the correct answer
09:52 - guess is equal to uh answer to problem
09:57 - and then once it is then we want to ask
10:01 - um ask we're gonna ask
10:05 - two joints let's put two joints okay so
10:07 - we're gonna since
10:09 - um you guys can do the star symbol for
10:11 - multiplication
10:12 - um or just use the x symbol i'm just
10:15 - gonna do the x symbol so
10:16 - uh x letter i mean so we're gonna join
10:19 - the random number one
10:21 - x or you can do the star symbol this one
10:24 - i'm just gonna do the x random number
10:27 - two so
10:28 - multiply these two ask what's random
10:31 - number one times random number two
10:33 - and then um we want to set the guess
10:36 - to answer set the guess
10:40 - to the answer put that in here
10:44 - and then we gotta get an if else
10:46 - statement so if
10:50 - if the answer is equal to random number
10:52 - one multiplied by random number two that
10:54 - means they got correctly
10:56 - random number one so if the answer
11:00 - is equal to random number one multiplied
11:02 - by random number two
11:06 - then we can just duplicate this this is
11:09 - just
11:10 - to show they're correct i'll play start
11:12 - sound
11:13 - guitar strum that is correct and then
11:16 - change the score by one and if they get
11:18 - it wrong then we just duplicate this
11:20 - that is the wrong answer so that is the
11:23 - code for the
11:23 - multiplication and of course we have to
11:26 - call the code so
11:27 - i'm going to go here when i receive
11:31 - uh start multiplication we'll want to
11:34 - run this code right here
11:36 - so now we have the multiplication let's
11:38 - try that out so
11:40 - save it go full screen
11:42 - [Music]
11:44 - so let's play a math game answer the
11:46 - following questions
11:48 - press the quick button to stop all
11:49 - questions choose one of the
11:51 - operators are random so i'm going to
11:53 - pick multiplication
11:55 - um so 1 times 11
11:58 - so multiplication is working right now
12:00 - so as you can see when you answer it
12:02 - correctly it will say that is correct
12:03 - your score will go up
12:05 - let's say if i answer it wrong on
12:06 - purpose let's see if it works
12:08 - and they'll say that is the wrong answer
12:11 - so our game is working
12:12 - uh perfectly right now so that is
12:16 - uh i think we'll stop here so today we
12:18 - just worked
12:20 - on the subtraction and multiplication
12:21 - button
12:23 - in the next episode i think we'll work
12:25 - on division
12:27 - and the random so i think that's it for
12:29 - this video
12:30 - thank you guys for watching don't forget
12:32 - to like share subscribe
12:34 - and ring the notification bell and i'll
12:36 - see you guys in the next video
12:39 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today we're working the second part for the um scratch math game so in the last tutorial uh we learned how to make the addition and we made the audition button so today and the quick button um so we're gonna work in the subtraction button um subtraction um the custom block and we're also going to work on multiplication so i'm just going to drag and drop the multiplication in here as well hold up i don't have it so let me get it okay so now i have the multiplication button i just got it from my other project so now i have the three buttons so let's start out from the subtraction button everyone um so everyone let's go to the subtraction button and let's code on here first let's zoom in a little bit so for addition we can just copy paste everything just drag and drop everything into the subtraction except we just need to change up one broadcast that's pretty much it for the subtraction button so for subtraction button we're gonna get um so we'll separate all this instead of here instead of start edition we have to broadcast a new message called start subtraction so we have broadcast start subtraction so let's go back into our cat we have to define a new custom block so let's go to my blocks and let's make a new custom block and name it subtraction so subtraction click ok so let's define it now so let's get a forever loop forever loop so in the beginning we always want to set the guess to zero to zero and then we want to set the random number one and the random number two to pick random one to 100 and the um subtraction is a little bit different from addition that's why i didn't copy paste it because you need to find if the random number one is greater than random number two because if the random number uh two is smaller than the random number one and you're subtracting it we don't want negative numbers so we have to do that so so if we set the two random numbers pick random one to 100 let's get a repeat until so we have to repeat until guess is equal to answer problem so if the guess of the answer is equal to the actual answer so repeat until the guess is equal to the answer problem and then after that we want to get an if density if wouldn't it if then else sorry put an if then else inside this repeat until loop so we wanna if random number one is greater than random number two so this is where you detect if random number one is greater than random number two so if random number one is greater than random number two then we want to set the answer to problem of random number one minus random number two so let's set the answer to problem some random number one minus random number two so uh get a subtraction symbol put that in here random number one subtracted random number two so subtract the first number which is greater than random number two i'll be random number one minus random number two and then we'll ask a question ask we're gonna put two joins put a drawing here and put a join here so we want to say random number one in the first slot which is any number that's from 100 then we join it with the minus sign and then we get a random number two and put it in here else if a random number one is not greater than random number two then we want to set the random num then we want to just duplicate this and instead of doing this we can switch them around so instead of putting random number one minus random two it'll be random number two minus random number one so do it the other way around so then it'll always never be negative and then i'll ask and say right here we're gonna switch these two again so we're gonna join random number two minus random number one and then we're gonna set the guess to the answer down here let's set the guess to answer um and then if we're going to get another if then else okay so let's get an if then else and put it right here so if the guess is equal to the answer to problem yes is equal to answer to problem um then we're gonna have to start the sound guitar strum i already have it start sound guitar strum and then we're going to say that is correct so i'm just going to duplicate this right here and then put it down here else we're going to do this string pluck and say that is the wrong answer so as you can see subtraction needs a bit more code than addition because you have to find which number is greater than which so and then finally we have to do a uh we have to um call the function right here so we're gonna get a broadcast when i receive start edition uh subtraction sorry about that we're gonna run the subtraction call this custom blocker here so let's try it out right now so i'm gonna save it and play it let's try it out so okay so at the subtraction button addition button so let's say if i click on subtraction boom now it will not be negative as you can see 90 minus 49 is not a negative number so let's say i get right so let's say i get it wrong then i'll do that but if i get it right then don't do this so there was a little bug right here so i got the answer correct which was 41 and it didn't work so i accidentally didn't answer the problem right here it should be guess so um you guys have to do guess instead of answering a problem that was a little mistake by me so don't do answer problem you have to put yes that's why it did not work so now let's see if it works now it should work so now let's go to subtraction so i'm just going to click on it 60 minus 1 that's 59. so as you can see now it's correct back then i uh when i got the right answer it still didn't get it right because um there's a little bug in it so um so the answer is 22 for here let's see if it's right okay that's right and gain score and you get it wrong on purpose it'll say that's the wrong answer so now we have the subtraction and addition functioning correctly now we can work on our multiplication button so let's go to our multiplication uh just drag and drop all of this code into the multiplication we just have to change one broadcast um just drag and drop all this and one more let's see if i got it off oops i did not get one of them i think yeah i did not get the one flag clicked uh yeah this one so i'm just gonna drag and drop it here and i don't know where this one went so i'm just gonna give it to here as well so drag it from the front i think that's why so when flying click time yeah okay so now we have the code for the multiplication instead of broadcasting start subtraction we're gonna have to broadcast start multiplication start multiplication i think that's how you spell it but that's just broadcast that and then let's go back into our cat sprint and then so for the multiplication um i'm only going to do it 1 to 12 because um this is like for kids multiplication so i'm not going to make it too hard but you have to use like scratch paper and all that so to make a new custom block it's called multiplication multiplication click ok so we're going to define multiplication so let's get a forever loop um you want to set the guess to zero yes to zero and we're gonna set the random number one and the random number two both to only pick random one to twelve so it isn't too hard so pick random one twelve only you guys can do it any value you want and i'm going to set the answer to problem to um random number one multiplying by random number two so multiply this random number by this random number so random number one times random number two and okay so we're going to get a repeat until we're going to repeat until guess is equal to answer to problem so wait until the correct answer guess is equal to uh answer to problem and then once it is then we want to ask um ask we're gonna ask two joints let's put two joints okay so we're gonna since um you guys can do the star symbol for multiplication um or just use the x symbol i'm just gonna do the x symbol so uh x letter i mean so we're gonna join the random number one x or you can do the star symbol this one i'm just gonna do the x random number two so multiply these two ask what's random number one times random number two and then um we want to set the guess to answer set the guess to the answer put that in here and then we gotta get an if else statement so if if the answer is equal to random number one multiplied by random number two that means they got correctly random number one so if the answer is equal to random number one multiplied by random number two then we can just duplicate this this is just to show they're correct i'll play start sound guitar strum that is correct and then change the score by one and if they get it wrong then we just duplicate this that is the wrong answer so that is the code for the multiplication and of course we have to call the code so i'm going to go here when i receive uh start multiplication we'll want to run this code right here so now we have the multiplication let's try that out so save it go full screen so let's play a math game answer the following questions press the quick button to stop all questions choose one of the operators are random so i'm going to pick multiplication um so 1 times 11 so multiplication is working right now so as you can see when you answer it correctly it will say that is correct your score will go up let's say if i answer it wrong on purpose let's see if it works and they'll say that is the wrong answer so our game is working uh perfectly right now so that is uh i think we'll stop here so today we just worked on the subtraction and multiplication button in the next episode i think we'll work on division and the random so i think that's it for this video thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share subscribe and ring the notification bell and i'll see you guys in the next video
