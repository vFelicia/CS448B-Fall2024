00:03 - [Music]
00:08 - hey guys welcome back to kids coding
00:10 - playground so today we'll continue our
00:12 - center uh platformer game here uh these
00:16 - are the code last time i'm
00:17 - trying to go real quick with this so
00:19 - i'll explain in the second video
00:22 - uh with this part how that works so this
00:24 - is the movement
00:25 - the sound for the initializing and then
00:28 - the resetting the variable and all
00:30 - and this is the movement control that is
00:33 - for like sliding
00:34 - uh left side right slide and then the
00:37 - left and right
00:38 - okay so that's the code for that and
00:41 - then this side is uh
00:42 - the uh those podcast message for
00:45 - checking platform and all and move the
00:46 - hitbox
00:48 - and we have the uh the center
00:51 - where we are making it to go to the uh
00:53 - main character so the enemy is
00:55 - character called the main character so
00:57 - today we'll work on a little bit more
00:58 - making it uh you know maybe detect the
01:00 - platform and all
01:01 - so let's go back to the main character
01:04 - okay
01:05 - okay so what we're going to do is we're
01:07 - going to do the jump control first
01:08 - and then we're going to work on the
01:10 - detection okay so
01:12 - here click on this make a new block
01:16 - jump ctrl select without refresh
01:20 - okay let's put it over here
01:25 - we'll take a if statement here let's
01:28 - zoom in a little bit
01:31 - okay and we're gonna use the operator
01:34 - and
01:35 - so basically both condition is true then
01:37 - they'll execute that
01:39 - uh we'll use a knot
01:42 - and then we're gonna use one more of
01:44 - this so basically we're gonna check if
01:46 - the up key is pressed and the player is
01:48 - not dead we'll let him
01:49 - jump okay so the player is dying so we
01:52 - should not
01:52 - jump so go back over here
01:56 - key put this here i will select the up
01:59 - key
02:02 - and then we have the variable that keeps
02:04 - track of the player
02:05 - g player animation type
02:10 - all right so basically it's a
02:14 - not that then
02:16 - [Music]
02:18 - we're gonna use the if condition
02:22 - put this here okay and then we're gonna
02:25 - check
02:27 - here's the all operator and operator
02:29 - here
02:30 - gonna check if the plate is actually on
02:32 - the ground and it's not jumping then
02:33 - we'll let them jump
02:35 - we'll check on the ground and
02:40 - so ground is the weather global variable
02:42 - right the underground
02:45 - on the ground one meaning it's on the
02:47 - ground
02:49 - jumping jumping is the uh for the sprite
02:51 - only this
02:52 - variable is for the sprite only you can
02:54 - see right the main character
02:56 - okay and if jumping is zero meaning he's
02:59 - not jumping
03:00 - then we'll let them jump so we'll say
03:03 - set the animation type to zero
03:09 - okay uh set the underground
03:14 - okay to zero because it's jumping
03:18 - set jumping so we have the one this
03:21 - leaping off
03:22 - jumping will mark it as one i mean true
03:27 - and then we're gonna change the velocity
03:30 - as well
03:32 - um changing the
03:35 - velocity where is it here
03:38 - uh to 15 so when it jump it it jumps 15
03:41 - um up y up okay
03:45 - and now what we want to do is when we
03:47 - jump right you remember the
03:48 - among us when we jump the o1 it has a
03:51 - lot of
03:53 - sound so we don't want to have that
03:55 - multiple sound
03:56 - so only one time when it jumps up we
03:58 - have only one sound
04:00 - so what we're going to do is we're going
04:01 - to use something called
04:03 - uh here okay
04:06 - so what we're saying is if
04:10 - we're going to use the uh the check for
04:12 - this guy
04:14 - uh let's use operator first put this
04:17 - here
04:19 - and then we're gonna check the list
04:22 - so this is uh the item on the list so
04:25 - you can
04:26 - say you can use whichever uh one you
04:28 - want so for
04:30 - for me i put one for the jump so i put
04:32 - up
04:33 - basically put i'd uh put the item one
04:37 - so i'm gonna put the item one uh right
04:39 - now i'm checking the item one
04:41 - of the list is zero meaning is is not
04:44 - being played
04:45 - then i set it to one so that we can play
04:48 - that sound
04:49 - so i'll show you what i mean so you're
04:50 - gonna replace the item one
04:53 - on the list the sound list with one
04:57 - so basically let's say now you have the
04:59 - sound list let's say where is it
05:02 - let's show the sound list so let's say
05:04 - when we initialize the sound list is
05:06 - zero
05:07 - now if we push the up key right i'll
05:10 - call this
05:11 - obviously okay so we'll have to call
05:14 - this first i'll demonstrate to you guys
05:16 - okay let me move over here uh here we
05:19 - will call it
05:20 - okay okay so uh move control and then
05:24 - the jump control let's go back over here
05:27 - so if i push up okay if i push up
05:31 - [Music]
05:33 - so since we have the code for the
05:35 - underground it won't show like let me
05:37 - take this out i'll just kind of show it
05:39 - to you
05:40 - so let's say the jump controls here if i
05:43 - push up
05:43 - you can see right this sound let's
05:45 - change the one
05:47 - so that way i will let the sound know
05:50 - later to play the sound the jump
05:52 - sound so let me uh so let me put this
05:55 - back
05:55 - in so let's put this back in
05:59 - we'll put it back in here okay so since
06:02 - i have not
06:02 - touched the ground right that's why when
06:04 - i push up earlier didn't work
06:06 - but uh once it touched the ground you
06:08 - were able to jump this
06:09 - okay all right so we have to call here
06:12 - so continue on
06:16 - okay so let's move over here where we
06:18 - have the
06:19 - call the start all control i'm gonna
06:22 - have to move this guy
06:23 - somewhere else else later but for now
06:25 - let's keep it here
06:27 - uh we're gonna get the if and else block
06:30 - here
06:32 - and then we're to use sensing
06:36 - i'm going to put if the up key is
06:38 - pressed
06:39 - we're going to change the velocity so
06:42 - make sure you use the change not the set
06:44 - okay so change the
06:49 - g velocity either
06:52 - by the gravity with gravity variable
06:58 - okay so when you're jumping up
07:01 - it can't pull you down slowly but once
07:03 - you're not jump up we'll make it
07:05 - go a little bit faster so we're going to
07:07 - say change the
07:08 - velocity like this and we'll make it
07:12 - multiply so basically negative one times
07:15 - two
07:16 - will be negative two okay
07:19 - and then we are going to say change the
07:24 - y position of the
07:27 - of this main character by the
07:31 - uh velocity okay
07:34 - okay so so far this is what we have okay
07:37 - so
07:38 - i'm gonna finish up the move hit box i
07:40 - did not do that last time so let's
07:42 - finish this up for right now
07:45 - so um for the move hit box we are going
07:48 - to set
07:50 - this deviation here to zero
07:54 - and then we are going to repeat until
08:00 - repeat until here
08:04 - okay let me go in a little bit more and
08:07 - we're going to use the oil condition
08:11 - so always like basically either this or
08:13 - this is true or run whatever inside
08:17 - um we're gonna use the uh equal here
08:21 - we'll take the deviation here
08:25 - and make that eight so we kind of keep
08:28 - track of the
08:29 - depth when the uh players hitting some
08:32 - um objects and kind of check if we need
08:35 - to move the
08:36 - player back up a little bit okay or you
08:39 - know set the y to zero
08:41 - or or using the zero minus the deviation
08:43 - so
08:44 - kind of push him back not run into the
08:46 - wall
08:48 - okay so and then we're gonna use uh this
08:50 - knot
08:52 - and then what we're going to do is we're
08:54 - going to say touching
08:56 - so uh instead of the uh you remember we
08:58 - have ground
08:59 - right we have virtual ground so not the
09:01 - ground we're going to touch the virtual
09:03 - ground so that way you know
09:04 - that player can step on you know
09:06 - different things in the ground
09:08 - so right the tree you will not be able
09:10 - to stepping on the trees and the virtual
09:12 - ground does not have a tree as you can
09:13 - see
09:14 - or only have the ice box in this box so
09:16 - it will only be stepping on these
09:18 - these things right so that's why we want
09:21 - to do that
09:22 - okay let's go back to here okay so we're
09:25 - going to say change the y
09:28 - okay change the y
09:31 - by one and then we're gonna
09:36 - change the deviation here
09:41 - by one as well and then
09:44 - we need another if statement underneath
09:48 - here
09:50 - and then duplicate that
09:53 - and we are going to use the change by x
09:59 - and change y and then we are going to
10:03 - use
10:04 - the uh operator here
10:07 - use the minus okay duplicate
10:10 - one more minus and then we put zero
10:15 - now minus the speed drag this down
10:19 - and then put zero here again and then we
10:21 - are going to
10:23 - minus the deviation okay if it hits a
10:25 - we're gonna push it back to
10:27 - whatever the minus that position so
10:30 - putting back
10:31 - wherever he is okay so we won't able to
10:33 - walk past the wall
10:36 - so as you can see we have no ground
10:37 - touch so now it's
10:39 - gonna fall right because of the uh
10:41 - changing the y
10:42 - so um over here on the other one is
10:45 - changing the velocity so it will keep on
10:47 - falling
10:48 - so uh we have to because of the negative
10:50 - gravity right so
10:52 - unless we push up it will keep on
10:54 - falling every time okay so we're going
10:55 - to
10:56 - make the call to detect the ground
11:00 - okay okay so next we're going to check
11:03 - if the player hit the ground so we're
11:04 - going to create another
11:06 - block here called check
11:10 - hit ground and then we're going to
11:13 - create a boolean value
11:14 - okay it's jumping
11:18 - okay boolean value not this one okay now
11:20 - we'll make it run without refresh
11:22 - okay check hit ground okay so we're
11:25 - going to code this one down here
11:28 - maybe i'll zoom out a little bit
11:33 - okay later i'm gonna have to move this
11:36 - around a little bit let's move this over
11:38 - a little bit
11:39 - i'll organize it later so for now let's
11:42 - just keep it like that
11:44 - okay so this is for checking if the
11:46 - player hitting the ground
11:48 - so we're going to use a
11:50 - [Music]
11:51 - repeat until okay and then
11:56 - we are going to have the uh not operator
12:01 - and then we're gonna go to uh sensing
12:04 - take this
12:05 - we're choosing virtual ground again so
12:07 - everything we're gonna do is gonna
12:09 - relate to the virtual ground not the
12:11 - ground okay so the ground will look like
12:12 - the virtual ground
12:14 - so so everything for touching the uh
12:17 - the ground uh we use a virtual ground
12:20 - okay
12:21 - and then we're gonna create a
12:24 - if and else here okay so i'm gonna take
12:28 - this
12:29 - drag that down and we're gonna
12:32 - change the y
12:36 - change y i minus one
12:39 - so it's jumping you're gonna pull them
12:41 - back down
12:43 - um and then we are going to
12:46 - reset this variable
12:51 - g velocity
12:55 - to zero okay else we're gonna
13:00 - change the y by positive one
13:04 - plus or resetting this to zero and then
13:07 - we're gonna have one more
13:08 - uh saying it's on the ground to be one
13:12 - here okay after it touched the ground we
13:15 - have to push him back up a little bit
13:17 - okay make sure that he get back up and
13:20 - we have the
13:21 - if condition here
13:24 - so put that inside here
13:28 - and then we're gonna check if it's
13:29 - jumping
13:32 - so let's check so if it's jumping we'll
13:35 - set it back to
13:36 - zero so after jump with set it back to
13:38 - zero
13:39 - so that he can jump again if he wants to
13:42 - okay and then reset this oops
13:46 - don't need all that we're gonna need the
13:48 - jump
13:50 - back to zero
13:54 - so now we're gonna go and grab this code
13:57 - and we have earlier checking the
13:59 - platform
13:59 - right so what we're going to do is we're
14:02 - going to go a little bit more on this
14:03 - one
14:04 - uh the the the one that we just call
14:08 - we're going to take this out and then
14:10 - we're going to
14:11 - call with this greater than so basically
14:14 - if the g velocity is greater than
14:17 - zero we can call this uh check the
14:20 - ground okay
14:21 - so basically if he's jumping up we'll
14:22 - have to check and make sure that
14:24 - you know the user always touched the
14:26 - ground
14:27 - so let's take this um
14:31 - okay all right okay so this is what we
14:35 - have so far
14:36 - but we're gonna create some more code
14:38 - for like if the player drops into the
14:40 - water
14:41 - diet as well so what we need we will
14:44 - need
14:47 - a if condition here
14:51 - so if condition and then
14:55 - move this over a little bit okay
14:58 - so here we will use the operator
15:01 - less than so and then we're going to
15:04 - check the y position of this uh
15:07 - animated uh this main character so the y
15:10 - position
15:12 - is less than negative 150
15:15 - so basically when the when the new uh
15:18 - player is like right here right there's
15:19 - negative 130 or so somewhere here
15:22 - so negative 150 basically jumped off and
15:24 - fall into the water
15:26 - it will die but i'm using the black box
15:28 - but anyway i'm just showing you the
15:30 - santa claus the same thing santa claus
15:32 - will follow the black box
15:33 - so basically if this black box drop
15:36 - under 150
15:37 - we're gonna make the uh the uh user die
15:41 - so we're gonna have to reset the
15:43 - scrolling um
15:45 - x so we're gonna have to stop back in
15:47 - the beginning
15:49 - so we haven't got to the scrolling part
15:50 - yet but uh for now just put this here
15:54 - and then for the uh falling into the
15:56 - water we have a different sound so let's
15:58 - say
15:59 - like this sound number so i'll show you
16:01 - what i mean so here with the sound
16:03 - so jump is one right so you can see it
16:06 - so it's like a
16:08 - whip sound and then the water is number
16:11 - three
16:12 - so uh it doesn't matter so so what we
16:15 - do is we're gonna put number three for
16:17 - that sound so
16:19 - in here what we want to do is um
16:22 - it doesn't necessarily have to be in the
16:24 - same order as this
16:25 - but uh basically the list whatever you
16:27 - want to use for the list for sound
16:29 - you're going to use that to play so you
16:31 - have to remember where you are
16:33 - so for this lesson for falling off the
16:35 - water we want to play the
16:37 - water sound so uh the plunge so what
16:39 - we're going to do is we're going to take
16:41 - the
16:41 - if condition here
16:46 - put that in here and then same thing
16:49 - with that
16:50 - check that we did earlier and then using
16:53 - the
16:54 - list so the item in the list so number
16:58 - three so we're gonna use number three
17:00 - for now for that so basically okay if
17:03 - it's the plunge
17:04 - sounds not being not playing and the
17:06 - player is
17:07 - falling down then we're gonna play it so
17:10 - what we're going to do is we're going to
17:11 - replace this
17:14 - uh replace item number three with
17:17 - one so basically it will replace this
17:20 - number
17:20 - with one okay so later we'll play the
17:23 - sound
17:23 - and we're gonna call the sound to go
17:25 - through the loop
17:26 - whenever there's any uh one or play that
17:29 - sound okay
17:32 - okay so we're gonna change your life
17:35 - uh so if we fall off the water we want
17:38 - to change the life
17:39 - so change here change life
17:43 - by minus one okay
17:47 - and then we are going to check
17:51 - uh if
17:54 - uh use the operator here if the life
17:59 - is equal to zero so basically we lost
18:01 - all the life
18:03 - equal to zero then broadcast came over
18:07 - okay
18:12 - message
18:15 - okay okay all right so this
18:18 - is for this so far okay so
18:21 - before we can test it we're gonna have
18:23 - to go to the ground uh make sure you
18:25 - select this show
18:26 - okay so they're gonna show the ground
18:28 - we're gonna make him try to stand on
18:29 - that
18:30 - uh what we're going to do is right now
18:32 - we're not we don't have any scrolling
18:34 - at the moment so what we're going to do
18:36 - we're going to
18:37 - put it in the zero position
18:40 - okay put it in zero position and then do
18:42 - the same thing for this okay just drag
18:44 - this
18:45 - dump it over here okay so
18:48 - now if you play this if i say you see
18:52 - um so as you can see i forgot
18:56 - to make it uh select this so make sure
18:58 - it's showing up
18:59 - so now i play it so you see how he's
19:01 - standing on the virtual ground
19:03 - and not the uh not the uh let me take
19:06 - this list
19:07 - out so not not the actual uh spread
19:10 - ground right so you see you can see he's
19:12 - jump up
19:13 - he can walk like this right so we
19:15 - haven't done any of the walking but as
19:17 - you can see he's
19:18 - he's on the virtual ground so one thing
19:20 - you have to do is make sure that the
19:22 - actual ground is in front of the virtual
19:24 - ground okay
19:26 - so uh uh you have to say uh go in front
19:30 - okay so what we want to do we wanted to
19:32 - hide the virtual ground so uh
19:34 - um this one is front it's okay i think
19:36 - it should be okay this one don't need it
19:38 - the front
19:39 - let's go to the virtual ground and what
19:41 - we're going to do
19:42 - is same thing like the uh main character
19:45 - we are going to
19:46 - use the change uh ghost effect
19:51 - okay by 100
19:55 - and then we have to have the show also
19:58 - okay
20:00 - over here we'll just grab the show for
20:02 - now
20:04 - okay so let's test it out so as you can
20:06 - see
20:07 - we have our santa claus kind of moving
20:09 - like this
20:12 - okay you can jump you see jump is
20:14 - actually
20:15 - stopping at the uh detecting the ground
20:17 - we haven't make the santa claus like
20:19 - changing
20:20 - the the left and right right so we can
20:23 - do that
20:26 - okay so we will actually have to stop
20:28 - here uh
20:29 - next time we'll work on the santa claus
20:31 - to uh able to move uh
20:33 - you know changing the actual uh animated
20:36 - costume
20:37 - uh so that we can make him uh move and
20:40 - look and better but for now we'll have
20:43 - to stop here for now i think that one's
20:45 - gonna take a lot
20:46 - longer to explain how to change the
20:49 - costume logic
20:50 - but uh as you can see we can we have the
20:53 - center he can
20:54 - walk left and right uh he's not turning
20:57 - around yet
20:58 - we'll do that we'll do the animation
20:59 - next so we'll stop here for now thank
21:02 - you for watching guys
21:03 - uh be sure to uh give us a like and
21:05 - thumbs up on the video
21:07 - uh we'll make the next video next
21:10 - episode of the tutorial later
21:12 - all right thank you have a good day bye
21:16 - [Music]
21:22 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys welcome back to kids coding playground so today we'll continue our center uh platformer game here uh these are the code last time i'm trying to go real quick with this so i'll explain in the second video uh with this part how that works so this is the movement the sound for the initializing and then the resetting the variable and all and this is the movement control that is for like sliding uh left side right slide and then the left and right okay so that's the code for that and then this side is uh the uh those podcast message for checking platform and all and move the hitbox and we have the uh the center where we are making it to go to the uh main character so the enemy is character called the main character so today we'll work on a little bit more making it uh you know maybe detect the platform and all so let's go back to the main character okay okay so what we're going to do is we're going to do the jump control first and then we're going to work on the detection okay so here click on this make a new block jump ctrl select without refresh okay let's put it over here we'll take a if statement here let's zoom in a little bit okay and we're gonna use the operator and so basically both condition is true then they'll execute that uh we'll use a knot and then we're gonna use one more of this so basically we're gonna check if the up key is pressed and the player is not dead we'll let him jump okay so the player is dying so we should not jump so go back over here key put this here i will select the up key and then we have the variable that keeps track of the player g player animation type all right so basically it's a not that then we're gonna use the if condition put this here okay and then we're gonna check here's the all operator and operator here gonna check if the plate is actually on the ground and it's not jumping then we'll let them jump we'll check on the ground and so ground is the weather global variable right the underground on the ground one meaning it's on the ground jumping jumping is the uh for the sprite only this variable is for the sprite only you can see right the main character okay and if jumping is zero meaning he's not jumping then we'll let them jump so we'll say set the animation type to zero okay uh set the underground okay to zero because it's jumping set jumping so we have the one this leaping off jumping will mark it as one i mean true and then we're gonna change the velocity as well um changing the velocity where is it here uh to 15 so when it jump it it jumps 15 um up y up okay and now what we want to do is when we jump right you remember the among us when we jump the o1 it has a lot of sound so we don't want to have that multiple sound so only one time when it jumps up we have only one sound so what we're going to do is we're going to use something called uh here okay so what we're saying is if we're going to use the uh the check for this guy uh let's use operator first put this here and then we're gonna check the list so this is uh the item on the list so you can say you can use whichever uh one you want so for for me i put one for the jump so i put up basically put i'd uh put the item one so i'm gonna put the item one uh right now i'm checking the item one of the list is zero meaning is is not being played then i set it to one so that we can play that sound so i'll show you what i mean so you're gonna replace the item one on the list the sound list with one so basically let's say now you have the sound list let's say where is it let's show the sound list so let's say when we initialize the sound list is zero now if we push the up key right i'll call this obviously okay so we'll have to call this first i'll demonstrate to you guys okay let me move over here uh here we will call it okay okay so uh move control and then the jump control let's go back over here so if i push up okay if i push up so since we have the code for the underground it won't show like let me take this out i'll just kind of show it to you so let's say the jump controls here if i push up you can see right this sound let's change the one so that way i will let the sound know later to play the sound the jump sound so let me uh so let me put this back in so let's put this back in we'll put it back in here okay so since i have not touched the ground right that's why when i push up earlier didn't work but uh once it touched the ground you were able to jump this okay all right so we have to call here so continue on okay so let's move over here where we have the call the start all control i'm gonna have to move this guy somewhere else else later but for now let's keep it here uh we're gonna get the if and else block here and then we're to use sensing i'm going to put if the up key is pressed we're going to change the velocity so make sure you use the change not the set okay so change the g velocity either by the gravity with gravity variable okay so when you're jumping up it can't pull you down slowly but once you're not jump up we'll make it go a little bit faster so we're going to say change the velocity like this and we'll make it multiply so basically negative one times two will be negative two okay and then we are going to say change the y position of the of this main character by the uh velocity okay okay so so far this is what we have okay so i'm gonna finish up the move hit box i did not do that last time so let's finish this up for right now so um for the move hit box we are going to set this deviation here to zero and then we are going to repeat until repeat until here okay let me go in a little bit more and we're going to use the oil condition so always like basically either this or this is true or run whatever inside um we're gonna use the uh equal here we'll take the deviation here and make that eight so we kind of keep track of the depth when the uh players hitting some um objects and kind of check if we need to move the player back up a little bit okay or you know set the y to zero or or using the zero minus the deviation so kind of push him back not run into the wall okay so and then we're gonna use uh this knot and then what we're going to do is we're going to say touching so uh instead of the uh you remember we have ground right we have virtual ground so not the ground we're going to touch the virtual ground so that way you know that player can step on you know different things in the ground so right the tree you will not be able to stepping on the trees and the virtual ground does not have a tree as you can see or only have the ice box in this box so it will only be stepping on these these things right so that's why we want to do that okay let's go back to here okay so we're going to say change the y okay change the y by one and then we're gonna change the deviation here by one as well and then we need another if statement underneath here and then duplicate that and we are going to use the change by x and change y and then we are going to use the uh operator here use the minus okay duplicate one more minus and then we put zero now minus the speed drag this down and then put zero here again and then we are going to minus the deviation okay if it hits a we're gonna push it back to whatever the minus that position so putting back wherever he is okay so we won't able to walk past the wall so as you can see we have no ground touch so now it's gonna fall right because of the uh changing the y so um over here on the other one is changing the velocity so it will keep on falling so uh we have to because of the negative gravity right so unless we push up it will keep on falling every time okay so we're going to make the call to detect the ground okay okay so next we're going to check if the player hit the ground so we're going to create another block here called check hit ground and then we're going to create a boolean value okay it's jumping okay boolean value not this one okay now we'll make it run without refresh okay check hit ground okay so we're going to code this one down here maybe i'll zoom out a little bit okay later i'm gonna have to move this around a little bit let's move this over a little bit i'll organize it later so for now let's just keep it like that okay so this is for checking if the player hitting the ground so we're going to use a repeat until okay and then we are going to have the uh not operator and then we're gonna go to uh sensing take this we're choosing virtual ground again so everything we're gonna do is gonna relate to the virtual ground not the ground okay so the ground will look like the virtual ground so so everything for touching the uh the ground uh we use a virtual ground okay and then we're gonna create a if and else here okay so i'm gonna take this drag that down and we're gonna change the y change y i minus one so it's jumping you're gonna pull them back down um and then we are going to reset this variable g velocity to zero okay else we're gonna change the y by positive one plus or resetting this to zero and then we're gonna have one more uh saying it's on the ground to be one here okay after it touched the ground we have to push him back up a little bit okay make sure that he get back up and we have the if condition here so put that inside here and then we're gonna check if it's jumping so let's check so if it's jumping we'll set it back to zero so after jump with set it back to zero so that he can jump again if he wants to okay and then reset this oops don't need all that we're gonna need the jump back to zero so now we're gonna go and grab this code and we have earlier checking the platform right so what we're going to do is we're going to go a little bit more on this one uh the the the one that we just call we're going to take this out and then we're going to call with this greater than so basically if the g velocity is greater than zero we can call this uh check the ground okay so basically if he's jumping up we'll have to check and make sure that you know the user always touched the ground so let's take this um okay all right okay so this is what we have so far but we're gonna create some more code for like if the player drops into the water diet as well so what we need we will need a if condition here so if condition and then move this over a little bit okay so here we will use the operator less than so and then we're going to check the y position of this uh animated uh this main character so the y position is less than negative 150 so basically when the when the new uh player is like right here right there's negative 130 or so somewhere here so negative 150 basically jumped off and fall into the water it will die but i'm using the black box but anyway i'm just showing you the santa claus the same thing santa claus will follow the black box so basically if this black box drop under 150 we're gonna make the uh the uh user die so we're gonna have to reset the scrolling um x so we're gonna have to stop back in the beginning so we haven't got to the scrolling part yet but uh for now just put this here and then for the uh falling into the water we have a different sound so let's say like this sound number so i'll show you what i mean so here with the sound so jump is one right so you can see it so it's like a whip sound and then the water is number three so uh it doesn't matter so so what we do is we're gonna put number three for that sound so in here what we want to do is um it doesn't necessarily have to be in the same order as this but uh basically the list whatever you want to use for the list for sound you're going to use that to play so you have to remember where you are so for this lesson for falling off the water we want to play the water sound so uh the plunge so what we're going to do is we're going to take the if condition here put that in here and then same thing with that check that we did earlier and then using the list so the item in the list so number three so we're gonna use number three for now for that so basically okay if it's the plunge sounds not being not playing and the player is falling down then we're gonna play it so what we're going to do is we're going to replace this uh replace item number three with one so basically it will replace this number with one okay so later we'll play the sound and we're gonna call the sound to go through the loop whenever there's any uh one or play that sound okay okay so we're gonna change your life uh so if we fall off the water we want to change the life so change here change life by minus one okay and then we are going to check uh if uh use the operator here if the life is equal to zero so basically we lost all the life equal to zero then broadcast came over okay message okay okay all right so this is for this so far okay so before we can test it we're gonna have to go to the ground uh make sure you select this show okay so they're gonna show the ground we're gonna make him try to stand on that uh what we're going to do is right now we're not we don't have any scrolling at the moment so what we're going to do we're going to put it in the zero position okay put it in zero position and then do the same thing for this okay just drag this dump it over here okay so now if you play this if i say you see um so as you can see i forgot to make it uh select this so make sure it's showing up so now i play it so you see how he's standing on the virtual ground and not the uh not the uh let me take this list out so not not the actual uh spread ground right so you see you can see he's jump up he can walk like this right so we haven't done any of the walking but as you can see he's he's on the virtual ground so one thing you have to do is make sure that the actual ground is in front of the virtual ground okay so uh uh you have to say uh go in front okay so what we want to do we wanted to hide the virtual ground so uh um this one is front it's okay i think it should be okay this one don't need it the front let's go to the virtual ground and what we're going to do is same thing like the uh main character we are going to use the change uh ghost effect okay by 100 and then we have to have the show also okay over here we'll just grab the show for now okay so let's test it out so as you can see we have our santa claus kind of moving like this okay you can jump you see jump is actually stopping at the uh detecting the ground we haven't make the santa claus like changing the the left and right right so we can do that okay so we will actually have to stop here uh next time we'll work on the santa claus to uh able to move uh you know changing the actual uh animated costume uh so that we can make him uh move and look and better but for now we'll have to stop here for now i think that one's gonna take a lot longer to explain how to change the costume logic but uh as you can see we can we have the center he can walk left and right uh he's not turning around yet we'll do that we'll do the animation next so we'll stop here for now thank you for watching guys uh be sure to uh give us a like and thumbs up on the video uh we'll make the next video next episode of the tutorial later all right thank you have a good day bye you
