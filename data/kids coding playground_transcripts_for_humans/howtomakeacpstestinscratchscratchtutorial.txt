00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - i'm pretty sure most of you
00:08 - are familiar with the cps test or clicks
00:11 - per second test
00:12 - it is used to measure how fast you can
00:14 - click in a second
00:15 - so like many gamers use this like test
00:17 - cert clicks per second i don't know
00:19 - why but like today we're going to be
00:21 - making our own
00:23 - version on scratch so before i begin
00:25 - i'll show you what it is
00:26 - for the ones that do not know so
00:28 - basically you have five seconds to like
00:30 - click as fast as you can i guess i'm
00:32 - not a very fast clicker but i'll attempt
00:35 - to get a pretty fast
00:36 - clicks per second i guess
00:44 - all right so i got octopus which is not
00:46 - that good i guess
00:47 - but yeah that's pretty much what a
00:48 - clicks per second is
00:50 - i think i like set like a 7.4 i don't
00:53 - think that's really good
00:55 - okay so that's basically what it is i'm
00:57 - now going to hop onto here i'll show you
00:59 - what this one is
01:00 - so our version you can select a five
01:02 - second game mode or a 10 second game
01:04 - mode
01:05 - uh let's say five seconds so basically
01:06 - just click this
01:08 - circle right here i'm not going to click
01:10 - very quick okay so let's
01:11 - so as you can see my clicks per second
01:13 - is 3.8 and the highest clicks per second
01:15 - on five seconds
01:16 - is eight well well for any of them is
01:18 - eight now let's do 10 seconds
01:20 - then the timer goes to 10 as you can see
01:24 - i'm just clicking normally
01:28 - all right so this time in 10 seconds we
01:30 - got 4.8
01:31 - clicks per second so what clicks per
01:34 - second is
01:34 - is the number of clicks divided by the
01:36 - number of time
01:37 - so 48 divided by 10 seconds is 4.8 so
01:40 - our cps would be 4.8
01:42 - all right so now let's start a new
01:44 - project
01:47 - and apparently 91.1 percent of you that
01:49 - are watching this video
01:50 - are not subscribed so please subscribe
01:52 - to our channel
01:54 - it really helped to support our channel
01:57 - and
01:57 - leave a like if you enjoyed watching
01:59 - this video so first
02:01 - we are going to delete scratchcad we're
02:02 - not going to be using that we're going
02:04 - to rename this project let's name it cps
02:06 - test all right and then we're going to
02:10 - get some sprites i'm going to get the
02:11 - button this one
02:13 - this is the button we've been using and
02:15 - then we're going to
02:16 - get a two more buttons so i'm going to
02:19 - get the
02:20 - this one let's duplicate it and then
02:22 - we've got the other one but one is gonna
02:24 - be orange
02:25 - so let me know that's all the difference
02:27 - all right
02:28 - let's delete this one and get the orange
02:30 - let's delete
02:31 - in the blue one we're gonna delete the
02:33 - orange so now we have blue and orange
02:35 - and inside and we're going to rename the
02:37 - sprites first blue one's going to be
02:38 - select
02:39 - one let's name it select one this one
02:43 - should be named select
02:44 - two so select two and then we're going
02:47 - to put some
02:48 - i guess like text over it so right here
02:51 - i'm gonna make
02:52 - turn it to black and then write uh five
02:55 - seconds
02:57 - five seconds uh let's put it like
03:00 - that a little bit closer to the middle
03:04 - something like that and then we're going
03:06 - to write 10 seconds
03:09 - all right also let's put this somewhere
03:11 - near the middle of this
03:13 - sprite all right so now we got 10
03:15 - seconds so 5 seconds and we got 10
03:17 - seconds
03:18 - also we might want to group this up
03:20 - group and let's group this as well
03:23 - group all right now as you can see in
03:26 - the beginning when you start a project
03:28 - it would say like choose your game we
03:30 - have to choose your game of text we can
03:32 - easily just paint that sprite by just
03:33 - writing
03:35 - just make a black text and write choose
03:37 - your game mode
03:43 - all right of center the sprite
03:47 - hold down alt then you'll you can make
03:48 - it bigger without moving around
03:50 - then we have choose your game up right
03:52 - there so this is where i want it to be
03:54 - let's put the circle at zero zero
03:58 - yeah okay we will organize this later
04:00 - but first let's work on the clicks okay
04:02 - so we're going to get that one green
04:03 - flag clicked on the button so
04:05 - the green flag is clicked we're going to
04:08 - go to zero zero which is the center of
04:10 - the screen
04:11 - the origin so going
04:14 - and we're going to make a new variable
04:16 - let's name it clicks
04:19 - uh clicks for all sprites
04:23 - i can make another one and we're going
04:24 - to call timer we'll need this later but
04:27 - for now let's just keep it like that
04:29 - we're gonna set the clicks to zero in
04:30 - the beginning and
04:31 - hide the variable clicks and we're also
04:33 - gonna hide the variable timer in the
04:35 - beginning
04:36 - and then we're gonna hide the sprite in
04:38 - the beginning because we're gonna let
04:40 - the player select five seconds or ten
04:42 - seconds first
04:43 - all right and then we're going to get it
04:44 - forever forever
04:47 - if it's touching the mouse blender and
04:50 - mouse down so like
04:51 - after clicking on it make sure it's
04:53 - getting clicked on
04:55 - uh touch the mouse pointer and mouse
04:56 - down
04:59 - then we are going to change the number
05:02 - of clicks by one the variable clicks
05:04 - and then we're going to wait until not
05:06 - mouse down
05:07 - so then you can't just like hold the
05:09 - clicks and then
05:10 - to click individually like one at a time
05:12 - like that
05:14 - all right and then we're going to wait
05:15 - until not uh
05:18 - mouse down and then we're going to
05:21 - change color
05:22 - effect by 5 so when you click it's going
05:23 - to change color this is just for fun you
05:25 - don't have to actually add this
05:27 - i'm just going to add it because why not
05:29 - and then we're going to
05:32 - uh create a new variable let's name it
05:34 - cps
05:36 - we'll need this later as well and we're
05:38 - going to make another variable for
05:40 - cloud variable this is called high
05:43 - highest cps high score i guess
05:47 - all right first let's now let's go back
05:50 - to the select one let's go to select one
05:55 - all right and then in select one i'm
05:57 - going to
05:58 - duplicate this so i'm gonna make it so
06:01 - when you hover your mouse over it it
06:02 - will change color
06:03 - like what i did in the demonstration so
06:05 - i'm gonna make it like a
06:07 - let's say orange color or something
06:09 - orange maybe
06:10 - orange yeah let's do that all right
06:12 - let's do the same thing for this one as
06:14 - well
06:16 - oh maybe not orange because like this
06:17 - one you can't really see it uh
06:20 - maybe like a yellow color i guess maybe
06:22 - like hello okay let's
06:24 - change the color right here yellow just
06:26 - make it more
06:27 - yellow okay there we go
06:31 - all right let's duplicate this boom okay
06:33 - so now we have the two costumes
06:35 - all right and then first we're going to
06:37 - get inside select one we will get a one
06:39 - flight clicked when green flag is
06:41 - clicked we are going to
06:43 - switch costume to button to
06:46 - a the first one i'm going to switch it
06:49 - to the first one
06:51 - and i'm going to set the position to x
06:54 - negative 100 y 0
06:57 - and i'm going to show in the beginning
07:00 - show this sprite and then we're going to
07:01 - forever
07:04 - we're going to do an if else so if
07:06 - touching mouse pointer
07:08 - then we're going to switch costume to
07:10 - the button a2 which is the one with the
07:12 - yellow
07:13 - else we're going to switch that one the
07:14 - first one
07:16 - so then we have like a little cool
07:19 - effect as you can see
07:21 - changes color when you touch it and then
07:25 - uh when when the sprite is clicked
07:29 - let's do when the sprite is clicked
07:31 - we're going to
07:32 - make a new variable let's name it game
07:35 - mode seconds so like we have two game
07:39 - modes right
07:40 - so we're gonna need different seconds
07:43 - for each one so we're gonna set the game
07:44 - mode seconds
07:46 - to five because of the five second one
07:49 - and we're going to broadcast
07:51 - start so we're also gonna have a start
07:52 - two for the second one
07:54 - so first we're gonna broadcast start so
07:59 - here and then uh when i receive start
08:03 - when i receive start then i'm gonna hide
08:06 - so that means the game is started so
08:07 - we're gonna hide so we're gonna go back
08:09 - to the button oops
08:10 - let's go back to the button for a second
08:12 - all right um
08:13 - on the button we're going to when i
08:15 - receive start
08:17 - we're going to show the variable clicks
08:21 - make sure the variable clicks
08:24 - and we're also going to show the sprite
08:27 - let's show the spring all right
08:31 - now let's go back to select two let's go
08:33 - to select two now first let's go to
08:34 - select one actually and then we're going
08:36 - to drag this stuff into here
08:39 - and we have all this duplicated over
08:41 - here
08:44 - all right first we have to change some
08:45 - of this so
08:48 - costume uh we have to
08:51 - first in the beginning set it to button
08:52 - to be this one
08:54 - and this one we're going to do this one
08:57 - and like that
08:58 - so since they're different we're going
09:00 - to have to just change it
09:02 - so it doesn't get messed up so touching
09:05 - the last pointer we're going to switch
09:06 - to the second costume alice is gonna
09:08 - switch at the first costume
09:09 - so button2b is the first one button to
09:12 - b2 is the second one
09:15 - um and when the surprise click we're
09:16 - going to set the gamemode seconds
09:18 - to 10 instead 10.
09:21 - oops 10 and we're going to
09:25 - broadcast another message called start
09:27 - two
09:28 - and then when i receive start we can
09:30 - hide we can also duplicate this when i
09:31 - receive start two we're also gonna hide
09:34 - and that's pretty much it right here we
09:36 - also want to duplicate this
09:38 - when i receive start two we're also
09:40 - gonna hide all right
09:42 - and instead of negative 100 obviously
09:44 - we're going to change this position as
09:46 - well so we're going to do 100
09:48 - instead all right so now that look
09:51 - when you do this it's like that and when
09:53 - you click on it
09:54 - you can like game mode seconds but yeah
09:57 - nothing's happening right now
09:59 - yet so first we have to go back to the
10:00 - button again
10:02 - let's go back to the button um
10:05 - we're going to have to get a actually
10:08 - first let's
10:09 - uh go to the timer so okay
10:12 - first we're going to do the timer let's
10:14 - just do it in the button okay
10:16 - so in timer we're just gonna do uh when
10:19 - i receive start
10:21 - we're gonna show the variable timer show
10:24 - variable
10:24 - timer and
10:28 - start is the for the five seconds and
10:30 - start two is for the
10:32 - 10 seconds so don't get that confused so
10:34 - the first one we're gonna set the timer
10:35 - to five
10:36 - because five seconds five
10:41 - i'm gonna repeat five times because five
10:44 - seconds repeat five times
10:46 - and we're gonna wait one second and then
10:48 - we're gonna change the variable timer
10:50 - by negative one so it's going down every
10:52 - second
10:56 - and we're also gonna stop all once the
10:59 - timer goes to the end
11:01 - we're just going to duplicate this and
11:02 - when i receive start 2
11:05 - we are going to show the variable timer
11:07 - set the timer to 10
11:09 - instead of 5 and repeat 10 times instead
11:13 - all right so now we have the timer done
11:15 - let's go back
11:17 - down here into this forever loop script
11:19 - so we're going to do an if then seaman
11:20 - if
11:21 - the timer is equal to zero
11:25 - if timer is equal to zero
11:29 - then we are going to broadcast a message
11:31 - called calculate cps
11:34 - calculate the clicks per second so cal
11:38 - cps and we're going to get an if that
11:41 - statement so if
11:43 - so this is going to check the high score
11:45 - so if the cps
11:48 - is greater than the highest cps
11:53 - then we are going to set the high cps
11:56 - to the cps all right
12:00 - and then right here inside the button we
12:02 - are going to receive that message
12:04 - um okay also for here we have to
12:06 - duplicate this and when we see start two
12:08 - we also have to show the variable clicks
12:10 - and all that
12:11 - forgot to do that okay and then we're
12:13 - gonna do when i receive calculate cps
12:17 - calculate cps we are going to get a
12:19 - forever loop
12:22 - forever um we're going to set the
12:25 - variable
12:27 - cps to clicks divided by the keyboard
12:31 - seconds
12:32 - game mode seconds is how much seconds
12:34 - each one is so like i said earlier
12:37 - cps is simply put the clicks divided by
12:40 - how much time you're going up by so
12:42 - we're going to get the divide factor
12:44 - deadline we're going to get cps
12:49 - divided by game mode seconds
12:52 - all right now let's go to the sprite
12:55 - let's rename this to text
12:56 - and let's rename this to click
12:59 - click and i'm going to set this to like
13:02 - some position
13:03 - i remember i set it to like one group
13:05 - like click we're going to set this
13:08 - to we're gonna have to also hide this in
13:10 - the beginning
13:11 - i mean hide this when we start the game
13:13 - so we're gonna get one reply click so
13:15 - let's go to
13:16 - x0 y120
13:20 - and let's show
13:23 - and then when i receive start
13:28 - then we're going to hide
13:31 - and duplicate this when i receive start
13:33 - two it's also gonna hide
13:35 - all right and finally we can actually
13:37 - just
13:38 - create a backdrop as well let's just
13:40 - like
13:42 - make some cool i don't know color
13:47 - oh we can do this actually so then it
13:49 - looks a little bit better we can
13:50 - like do an orange this is what i did
13:53 - all right let's do this boom looks
13:56 - pretty good right
13:57 - this is what i had in my other theme so
14:00 - i'm gonna do that
14:02 - and i'm going to move around these
14:04 - variables so uh
14:06 - we can actually just hide keyword
14:09 - seconds
14:10 - all we need is the clicks cps
14:13 - and highest cps okay and do that all
14:16 - right and i'm also going to set the high
14:17 - cps to zero first because it got
14:20 - saved from the last one let's go in five
14:23 - seconds
14:23 - as you can see the cps is going up click
14:25 - click click look like the high cps is
14:27 - also going up
14:28 - as you can see timer goes to zero you
14:30 - can't click anymore
14:32 - it shows your clicks or cps let's do try
14:35 - 10 seconds
14:36 - same thing except 10 seconds as you can
14:39 - see
14:41 - i see this is 5.6 still saves for my
14:44 - last try
14:45 - see if i can beat that up in 5.3 all
14:48 - right so that's basically it for today's
14:49 - tutorial
14:50 - thank you guys for watching don't forget
14:51 - to like share and subscribe and i'll see
14:53 - you guys in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

i'm pretty sure most of you are familiar with the cps test or clicks per second test it is used to measure how fast you can click in a second so like many gamers use this like test cert clicks per second i don't know why but like today we're going to be making our own version on scratch so before i begin i'll show you what it is for the ones that do not know so basically you have five seconds to like click as fast as you can i guess i'm not a very fast clicker but i'll attempt to get a pretty fast clicks per second i guess all right so i got octopus which is not that good i guess but yeah that's pretty much what a clicks per second is i think i like set like a 7.4 i don't think that's really good okay so that's basically what it is i'm now going to hop onto here i'll show you what this one is so our version you can select a five second game mode or a 10 second game mode uh let's say five seconds so basically just click this circle right here i'm not going to click very quick okay so let's so as you can see my clicks per second is 3.8 and the highest clicks per second on five seconds is eight well well for any of them is eight now let's do 10 seconds then the timer goes to 10 as you can see i'm just clicking normally all right so this time in 10 seconds we got 4.8 clicks per second so what clicks per second is is the number of clicks divided by the number of time so 48 divided by 10 seconds is 4.8 so our cps would be 4.8 all right so now let's start a new project and apparently 91.1 percent of you that are watching this video are not subscribed so please subscribe to our channel it really helped to support our channel and leave a like if you enjoyed watching this video so first we are going to delete scratchcad we're not going to be using that we're going to rename this project let's name it cps test all right and then we're going to get some sprites i'm going to get the button this one this is the button we've been using and then we're going to get a two more buttons so i'm going to get the this one let's duplicate it and then we've got the other one but one is gonna be orange so let me know that's all the difference all right let's delete this one and get the orange let's delete in the blue one we're gonna delete the orange so now we have blue and orange and inside and we're going to rename the sprites first blue one's going to be select one let's name it select one this one should be named select two so select two and then we're going to put some i guess like text over it so right here i'm gonna make turn it to black and then write uh five seconds five seconds uh let's put it like that a little bit closer to the middle something like that and then we're going to write 10 seconds all right also let's put this somewhere near the middle of this sprite all right so now we got 10 seconds so 5 seconds and we got 10 seconds also we might want to group this up group and let's group this as well group all right now as you can see in the beginning when you start a project it would say like choose your game we have to choose your game of text we can easily just paint that sprite by just writing just make a black text and write choose your game mode all right of center the sprite hold down alt then you'll you can make it bigger without moving around then we have choose your game up right there so this is where i want it to be let's put the circle at zero zero yeah okay we will organize this later but first let's work on the clicks okay so we're going to get that one green flag clicked on the button so the green flag is clicked we're going to go to zero zero which is the center of the screen the origin so going and we're going to make a new variable let's name it clicks uh clicks for all sprites i can make another one and we're going to call timer we'll need this later but for now let's just keep it like that we're gonna set the clicks to zero in the beginning and hide the variable clicks and we're also gonna hide the variable timer in the beginning and then we're gonna hide the sprite in the beginning because we're gonna let the player select five seconds or ten seconds first all right and then we're going to get it forever forever if it's touching the mouse blender and mouse down so like after clicking on it make sure it's getting clicked on uh touch the mouse pointer and mouse down then we are going to change the number of clicks by one the variable clicks and then we're going to wait until not mouse down so then you can't just like hold the clicks and then to click individually like one at a time like that all right and then we're going to wait until not uh mouse down and then we're going to change color effect by 5 so when you click it's going to change color this is just for fun you don't have to actually add this i'm just going to add it because why not and then we're going to uh create a new variable let's name it cps we'll need this later as well and we're going to make another variable for cloud variable this is called high highest cps high score i guess all right first let's now let's go back to the select one let's go to select one all right and then in select one i'm going to duplicate this so i'm gonna make it so when you hover your mouse over it it will change color like what i did in the demonstration so i'm gonna make it like a let's say orange color or something orange maybe orange yeah let's do that all right let's do the same thing for this one as well oh maybe not orange because like this one you can't really see it uh maybe like a yellow color i guess maybe like hello okay let's change the color right here yellow just make it more yellow okay there we go all right let's duplicate this boom okay so now we have the two costumes all right and then first we're going to get inside select one we will get a one flight clicked when green flag is clicked we are going to switch costume to button to a the first one i'm going to switch it to the first one and i'm going to set the position to x negative 100 y 0 and i'm going to show in the beginning show this sprite and then we're going to forever we're going to do an if else so if touching mouse pointer then we're going to switch costume to the button a2 which is the one with the yellow else we're going to switch that one the first one so then we have like a little cool effect as you can see changes color when you touch it and then uh when when the sprite is clicked let's do when the sprite is clicked we're going to make a new variable let's name it game mode seconds so like we have two game modes right so we're gonna need different seconds for each one so we're gonna set the game mode seconds to five because of the five second one and we're going to broadcast start so we're also gonna have a start two for the second one so first we're gonna broadcast start so here and then uh when i receive start when i receive start then i'm gonna hide so that means the game is started so we're gonna hide so we're gonna go back to the button oops let's go back to the button for a second all right um on the button we're going to when i receive start we're going to show the variable clicks make sure the variable clicks and we're also going to show the sprite let's show the spring all right now let's go back to select two let's go to select two now first let's go to select one actually and then we're going to drag this stuff into here and we have all this duplicated over here all right first we have to change some of this so costume uh we have to first in the beginning set it to button to be this one and this one we're going to do this one and like that so since they're different we're going to have to just change it so it doesn't get messed up so touching the last pointer we're going to switch to the second costume alice is gonna switch at the first costume so button2b is the first one button to b2 is the second one um and when the surprise click we're going to set the gamemode seconds to 10 instead 10. oops 10 and we're going to broadcast another message called start two and then when i receive start we can hide we can also duplicate this when i receive start two we're also gonna hide and that's pretty much it right here we also want to duplicate this when i receive start two we're also gonna hide all right and instead of negative 100 obviously we're going to change this position as well so we're going to do 100 instead all right so now that look when you do this it's like that and when you click on it you can like game mode seconds but yeah nothing's happening right now yet so first we have to go back to the button again let's go back to the button um we're going to have to get a actually first let's uh go to the timer so okay first we're going to do the timer let's just do it in the button okay so in timer we're just gonna do uh when i receive start we're gonna show the variable timer show variable timer and start is the for the five seconds and start two is for the 10 seconds so don't get that confused so the first one we're gonna set the timer to five because five seconds five i'm gonna repeat five times because five seconds repeat five times and we're gonna wait one second and then we're gonna change the variable timer by negative one so it's going down every second and we're also gonna stop all once the timer goes to the end we're just going to duplicate this and when i receive start 2 we are going to show the variable timer set the timer to 10 instead of 5 and repeat 10 times instead all right so now we have the timer done let's go back down here into this forever loop script so we're going to do an if then seaman if the timer is equal to zero if timer is equal to zero then we are going to broadcast a message called calculate cps calculate the clicks per second so cal cps and we're going to get an if that statement so if so this is going to check the high score so if the cps is greater than the highest cps then we are going to set the high cps to the cps all right and then right here inside the button we are going to receive that message um okay also for here we have to duplicate this and when we see start two we also have to show the variable clicks and all that forgot to do that okay and then we're gonna do when i receive calculate cps calculate cps we are going to get a forever loop forever um we're going to set the variable cps to clicks divided by the keyboard seconds game mode seconds is how much seconds each one is so like i said earlier cps is simply put the clicks divided by how much time you're going up by so we're going to get the divide factor deadline we're going to get cps divided by game mode seconds all right now let's go to the sprite let's rename this to text and let's rename this to click click and i'm going to set this to like some position i remember i set it to like one group like click we're going to set this to we're gonna have to also hide this in the beginning i mean hide this when we start the game so we're gonna get one reply click so let's go to x0 y120 and let's show and then when i receive start then we're going to hide and duplicate this when i receive start two it's also gonna hide all right and finally we can actually just create a backdrop as well let's just like make some cool i don't know color oh we can do this actually so then it looks a little bit better we can like do an orange this is what i did all right let's do this boom looks pretty good right this is what i had in my other theme so i'm gonna do that and i'm going to move around these variables so uh we can actually just hide keyword seconds all we need is the clicks cps and highest cps okay and do that all right and i'm also going to set the high cps to zero first because it got saved from the last one let's go in five seconds as you can see the cps is going up click click click look like the high cps is also going up as you can see timer goes to zero you can't click anymore it shows your clicks or cps let's do try 10 seconds same thing except 10 seconds as you can see i see this is 5.6 still saves for my last try see if i can beat that up in 5.3 all right so that's basically it for today's tutorial thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe and i'll see you guys in the next video
