00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids s playground
00:09 - here today we're back for another video
00:10 - in scratch and today we'll be continuing
00:13 - the hero war game and if you do not know
00:16 - this is the fourth part of hero War so
00:19 - if you have not checked out the first
00:21 - the second and the third part go on our
00:23 - Channel and check that
00:25 - out so the first thing we're going to do
00:28 - is actually take out this
00:31 - so um U the the player won't actually
00:34 - take damage if it's if you keep on
00:37 - setting their lives so we're just going
00:39 - to take out the set lives okay so you
00:41 - see this set live to 1,200 set live to
00:43 - 850 set live to 1,000 throw those all
00:46 - away and then go to the elf portrait I'm
00:49 - um I'm sorry but it's actually over here
00:53 - so when you go to the elf portrait under
00:56 - the when this Sprite clicked it should
00:58 - actually set live to 1,200 so the live
01:03 - um rotation works so do
01:07 - that as you can see the live rotation
01:10 - works just like that and we already
01:13 - coded all the powerups and everything so
01:16 - we're actually going to start out with
01:17 - the apprentices star which is the and
01:21 - then we'll move on to the bottom
01:23 - [Music]
01:25 - so we're going to start with the
01:27 - princess star because this
01:30 - is what the Mage third ability is what
01:35 - the turret shoots so when the green flag
01:37 - is
01:39 - clicked we're going to
01:41 - hide and we need if
01:43 - then if then hero selected is equal to
01:53 - two go to third
01:58 - ability
02:00 - oh go to third ability there we go
02:04 - so I think we already made the broadcast
02:07 - so when I receive shoot apprentices star
02:11 - it'll go to thir ability so this is just
02:13 - a double check go to thir ability then
02:16 - it will
02:19 - show It'll point
02:21 - towards Point towards Mouse pointer so
02:25 - it'll just shoot wherever your mouse is
02:27 - and then it'll repeat
02:28 - until
02:33 - touching
02:35 - Edge and it'll move 30
02:38 - steps until it reaches the
02:42 - edge and it'll
02:45 - hide and it will go to third
02:53 - ability so that's it for this and we'll
02:56 - come back to this and code it more later
02:58 - so now we're going to work on the bomb
03:00 - which is the Griffin ability where the
03:02 - Griffin drops a bomb which literally
03:04 - explodes everything so I have made Four
03:07 - costumes if you watch the first part you
03:09 - will know so when the green flag is
03:11 - clicked it will switch
03:13 - costume to
03:15 - one then it'll go to back
03:19 - layer go to back
03:21 - later and the bomb is really strong
03:23 - it'll instakill anything so it'll go to
03:26 - this position and hide
03:33 - so when I receive bomb so this is when
03:35 - the Griffin drops the bomb and destroys
03:38 - everything in sight it'll go to this
03:41 - position switch costume to costume one
03:44 - just double check it will
03:46 - show and then it'll Glide 1 second to
03:51 - and I have a position for this
03:54 - 4 113 so it would just be like around
03:57 - here and that's when the explosion
03:59 - occurs which then everything
04:02 - dies and then after that it'll wait 1
04:07 - second you switch
04:09 - costume to two then we'll just duplicate
04:14 - this wait one second switch costume to
04:16 - three duplicate this switch costume to
04:21 - four oop
04:23 - sorry and then we'll have a wait one
04:25 - second and then it'll hide so that's
04:28 - just the bomb code
04:31 - and now let's work on the
04:34 - enemy so this is this will be very bulky
04:38 - code so um stay along with me because
04:42 - it's going to be a long ride
04:46 - so so um let's start this so the enem is
04:50 - going to be a clone while the projectile
04:53 - is a target I mean a single thing so
04:55 - it's not a clone so two clone so it's
04:57 - not two clones so when I receive start
05:00 - game it'll go
05:03 - forever it'll create clone of
05:07 - myself and then we'll have a
05:10 - wait pick random between 1 to
05:14 - 2.3 seconds which then a new um dude
05:17 - will
05:19 - spawn so let's get a when I start as a
05:23 - clone it will go to
05:27 - x - 175 so that's like around oops
05:33 - sorry so x 175 which will be around here
05:37 - and then we have a pick random for the Y
05:39 - it'll be pick random
05:43 - -00 to 25 and that's where like near the
05:46 - cemetery is so yeah and then it will
05:51 - show
05:54 - forever it repeat
05:57 - until um touching player always just
06:01 - point towards player no matter what and
06:06 - it
06:07 - will Point towards
06:12 - player then it will move two steps until
06:15 - it reaches the player so zombies medium
06:19 - speed so when I start as a
06:22 - clone when I start as a clone it will we
06:26 - need a new variable so makeing new
06:29 - variable zombie HP and this is for the
06:32 - Sprite only so just like that so when I
06:35 - start as a clone it will set zombie
06:41 - HP to 300 so zombies have 300
06:44 - HP and then it will repeat
06:48 - until touching
06:54 - player and then after the touch um it'll
06:57 - wait 05 seconds
07:04 - so it isn't clunky so wait. 5
07:10 - seconds then now we reach the big big
07:14 - block of
07:15 - code so this after we're done with this
07:18 - code it's going to be the end of this
07:19 - video so when I start as a clone
07:23 - forever so we're going to go in this
07:25 - order the first ability no the
07:28 - projectile the the first ability no the
07:31 - projectiles first then the first ability
07:33 - of the first character second ability of
07:35 - the second character and we'll just go
07:36 - down just like that so
07:39 - forever you need a if
07:42 - touching if
07:44 - then it's touching so after when we
07:47 - really just get one of them done for the
07:49 - projectiles we can just duplicate them
07:51 - and use it like that so and you need to
07:55 - and over here so if if then touching
07:59 - projectile so projectile and hero
08:06 - selected is equal to one so this is the
08:09 - elf Warrior so if it's touching the
08:10 - projectile of the elf Warrior this is
08:12 - basically saying it will
08:14 - change zombie
08:18 - HP by minus
08:22 - 180 and it'll broadcast a
08:25 - message delete Arrow so this delete
08:28 - Arrow message is pretty important
08:32 - error and after that we have a if then
08:36 - statement if then you need a
08:39 - or if then you need equals and a less
08:43 - than so if then zombie HP is equal to
08:49 - zero
08:52 - or or zombie HP is less than
08:56 - zero then it will change score by five
09:02 - oh change score by five and it will
09:07 - delete this
09:10 - clone and that's just the first block so
09:14 - since we have one of these it's really
09:15 - easy to make a lot of them so we just
09:17 - duplicate it remember to put it under so
09:19 - it doesn't interfere and then if it's
09:21 - touching the projectile of here selected
09:24 - two it'll change so the Mage is really
09:27 - strong so it'll do minus 250 instead -
09:29 - 180 and it'll broadcast delete Arrow
09:32 - delete arrow is just basically delete
09:33 - projectile and this is the same so you
09:36 - see once we have one we can do a lot
09:38 - remember to put it under so it's not
09:40 - overlapping so if it's touching hero
09:42 - select is equal to three which is the
09:44 - fairy queen it'll change HP by minus 60
09:48 - on HP and it'll broadcast delete arrow
09:51 - and change score by
09:53 - five so this is now we have a if then so
09:57 - place it under here if then so now we're
10:00 - getting to the first ability of the
10:02 - first hero you need to
10:05 - and if then it's touching first ability
10:09 - which is the spectral arrows which just
10:10 - go through all the
10:12 - enemies first ability and hero
10:18 - selected is equal to
10:21 - one then it will change score by five
10:25 - cuz we don't even have to deduct the HP
10:28 - from the zombie because it we're just
10:30 - going to delete its
10:32 - clone um not minus change Square by five
10:35 - then it'll delete this
10:37 - clone delete this clone and then we'll
10:41 - duplicate this put it under if touching
10:44 - second ability and hero selected is
10:46 - still one the second ability is just the
10:49 - death arrow and then we'll actually
10:53 - broadcast delete
10:55 - arrow and delete this
10:58 - club so the third ability just kills
11:00 - everything so on the side we'll put when
11:04 - I receive bomb we'll put weight one
11:07 - second and then delete this clone so it
11:09 - just wipes it
11:10 - out just like that and now we're going
11:13 - to move on to the first ability of hero
11:15 - selected is equal to two so let's just
11:18 - duplicate this so of touching first
11:21 - ability and hero selected equal o and
11:24 - hero selected equal to two which is the
11:26 - Grand Master Mage then it will
11:29 - instead of doing all
11:31 - this it's so for the Great Master Mage a
11:34 - first ability it actually teleports them
11:37 - back so switch costume to costume
11:40 - 2 it'll
11:42 - wait .1 seconds it'll move negative 150
11:46 - back steps back so it'll just move all
11:49 - the way back the Grand Master Mage is
11:51 - really strong with his teleports it'll
11:53 - move. 3 seconds I mean wait 2.3
11:57 - seconds
11:59 - and it will switch costume to costume
12:02 - one fairly simple that's the teleport
12:05 - back and now we have so let's go back to
12:08 - the projectile and get a
12:10 - duplicate we just need one so let's move
12:13 - this
12:14 - down so the second ability for the the
12:19 - second hero which is Grandmaster Mage so
12:21 - if it's touching the second ability hero
12:23 - selected is equal to two then it'll
12:26 - change zombie HP by -60 and it won't
12:29 - broadcast delete error cuz the lightning
12:31 - so the lightning strike that the grandm
12:33 - Mage does is really strong against metal
12:35 - enemies but not these enemies so it'll
12:36 - change it by - 60 and we'll just have
12:39 - the script over
12:41 - here now it's going to be the third
12:43 - ability so which is The Apprentice
12:47 - turret which he'll shoot the um
12:50 - apprentice's star at the enemy so if
12:52 - it's touching the appr princess's star
12:54 - and the hero selected is equal to two
12:57 - then it will broadcast
13:03 - broadcast delete apprentices
13:06 - star oh yeah we need to make that so
13:09 - we'll make a new message oop new
13:14 - message and we'll name it
13:17 - delete
13:19 - apprentices cuz it's shooting from a
13:21 - different place so you have to have this
13:23 - so delete apprentices star so when I
13:26 - broadcast delete apprentices star it'll
13:28 - change zombie HP by minus 90 so it's
13:31 - stronger against metal enemies just like
13:33 - the lightning ability and we'll have
13:35 - this right there if then the zombie HP
13:37 - is zero less than zero change score five
13:39 - and delete this CP so now we're already
13:42 - moving on to the third hero I know it
13:45 - looked like such a blocky amount of code
13:47 - but it's actually not so if it's
13:50 - touching we'll just have just duplicate
13:53 - this remember put it under don't overlap
13:56 - it inside so if it's touching
13:59 - the second
14:00 - ability and hero select is equal to
14:03 - three which is the fairy queen and since
14:06 - the first ability doesn't affect it we
14:07 - don't need to put the first ability
14:08 - because first ability just heals the
14:12 - dude so we don't need any of this it'll
14:14 - change score by five and delete this
14:16 - clone then um we have to get this other
14:20 - block of code so let's duplicate this so
14:24 - the second ability no I mean the third
14:26 - ability in hero select is equal to three
14:28 - which makes the huge Defender Shield
14:30 - which teleports them back once they
14:32 - touch it and does insane damage it will
14:35 - be so we'll have this
14:38 - move negative 100 steps negative 100
14:42 - steps it will
14:44 - change zombie
14:48 - HP by minus
14:52 - 200 it'll switch costume and costume
14:54 - three which is this
14:57 - one and and it will wait Point 2
15:04 - seconds and it will switch costume to
15:08 - costume one again and that's
15:12 - yeah so let's get another one and we're
15:16 - actually done with all the abilities and
15:17 - projectile shots so it was actually
15:19 - pretty quick as I I didn't think it
15:21 - would be that quick so we need if then
15:23 - over here if it's
15:25 - touching the player so we're going to
15:28 - finish up delete arrow and this going to
15:29 - be the end of the video so after this so
15:32 - if it's touching the player it'll move
15:34 - negative 20 steps back so it can hit you
15:37 - again if you're not careful enough and
15:39 - then it will
15:40 - set we need a new variable hit player so
15:46 - each of them do different damages so
15:48 - we're going to have hit player zombie
15:50 - and we'll have one for hit player Speedy
15:51 - zombie hit player blah blah blah and
15:54 - then it will set hit player zombie to
15:59 - why so you hit him and it'll
16:03 - broadcast hit player so we're actually
16:05 - getting to hit player and the rest of
16:07 - the enemies next tutorial cuz hit player
16:10 - also is involved with all the other
16:12 - enemies so this huge bul of
16:17 - code and we'll come back to do more code
16:20 - later on this Sprite but first let's go
16:23 - to the
16:24 - projectile so the projectile also has a
16:26 - delete code a delete arrow thing so when
16:29 - I receive delete Arrow it will
16:33 - hide and it'll go to player so that's
16:36 - just when it touches like the
16:41 - enemy and same with the apprentices star
16:44 - so let's go to appren Star when I
16:48 - receive delete apprentices star hide and
16:52 - then it'll go back to third ability
16:54 - which is the turret at because it's hero
16:56 - select it's two go to third
17:00 - ability and that should work so let's
17:03 - see if it works so the only enemy that
17:05 - should be spawning right now is the
17:07 - Casual enemy so let's just check it out
17:10 - we have all this clutter up here so
17:12 - let's just let's just close all this hit
17:15 - player zombie and go to the enemy close
17:17 - to zombie HP so yeah so we have all this
17:19 - clutter so let's just test it
17:22 - out let's try Grand Master Mage so as
17:26 - you can see it works the enemy is going
17:28 - to killed by the projectile and we have
17:31 - the delete arrow in code and everything
17:34 - so this is actually working pretty well
17:37 - and let's see if power up one works
17:38 - which is the teleport and it does it
17:40 - just teleports them back and then let's
17:42 - see if power up two Works which is the
17:44 - lightning that thing also works but it's
17:46 - really weak against these zombies we'll
17:47 - make him more stronger against armored
17:49 - enemies and as you can see power up one
17:52 - works so this is just the Casual basics
17:54 - of the game we have a lot of more bosses
17:56 - and stuff that will add to the game and
17:58 - then let's see if this will work oh yeah
18:01 - as you can see The Apprentice is
18:03 - shooting his stars and it does seem to
18:05 - be working so it'll work for all of them
18:08 - oh yeah and we'll shrink the princess's
18:10 - star size so it doesn't like hit a mass
18:13 - majority of things so it's actually
18:15 - going to be
18:17 - 40 and yeah oh we should code the weight
18:23 - the weight
18:25 - [Music]
18:26 - Sprite so let's actually do that first
18:30 - so um when the green flag is clicked
18:33 - it'll go to front
18:35 - layer go to front layer you go switch
18:38 - costume to costume one so there's two
18:40 - costumes for this there's the wait
18:42 - before using this item and then this
18:43 - item is in progress which is when the
18:45 - third ability is in progress and you
18:46 - can't use another one while it's in
18:47 - progress so and it'll go to 0 0 then
18:51 - it'll
18:54 - hide then when I
18:57 - receive
18:59 - start game it will switch costume to
19:03 - costume one and
19:07 - hide and then when I
19:12 - receive game
19:15 - over then it also hide so I don't oh
19:19 - yeah we don't we haven't even got the
19:20 - game over yet cuz we haven't coded the
19:22 - game over so when I receive no item to
19:26 - use so when you have nothing to use
19:29 - it'll switch costume to costume one
19:32 - start sound
19:33 - pop it will
19:37 - show wait one second then it will hide
19:41 - and the in progress part is about the
19:42 - same too so when I receive in progress
19:47 - it'll switch costume to costume oop
19:50 - it'll switch costume to costume two
19:51 - starts on pop show wait 1 second and
19:53 - hide so we coded the weight Sprite down
19:56 - too so I'm going to get a few power ups
19:58 - and I'll show you if it works so the
20:01 - heroes haven't started taking damage yet
20:02 - cuz obviously we haven't coded yet we
20:04 - haven't coded it yet so um fairy Queen's
20:06 - not going to take any damage but we can
20:09 - heal him back to Max HP even though
20:11 - she's at Max HP so yeah unless see if it
20:15 - works
20:19 - yeah I just found a bug in the code it's
20:22 - saying wait before using this item even
20:24 - though I have the item and this is
20:25 - actually not supposed to be here I
20:26 - accidentally put it in there so sorry
20:28 - please take out that no item to use and
20:31 - it should work now if I check all these
20:33 - real
20:34 - quick
20:36 - yeah so let's rerun it on fairy
20:41 - queen so I have a few abilities over
20:43 - here so let's see if it works we have
20:47 - power up yep it works so power up two
20:50 - works as I know and then let's see if
20:52 - the defender chip Works yep it seems to
20:55 - be working so yeah
20:58 - and I can heal myself even though I'm at
21:00 - Max
21:01 - HP yeah okay so it works so please like
21:07 - share subscribe and comment in the
21:09 - comment section below what else games
21:10 - you want to see on our Channel and I'll
21:13 - see you guys in the next
21:15 - [Music]
21:25 - part

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's kids s playground here today we're back for another video in scratch and today we'll be continuing the hero war game and if you do not know this is the fourth part of hero War so if you have not checked out the first the second and the third part go on our Channel and check that out so the first thing we're going to do is actually take out this so um U the the player won't actually take damage if it's if you keep on setting their lives so we're just going to take out the set lives okay so you see this set live to 1,200 set live to 850 set live to 1,000 throw those all away and then go to the elf portrait I'm um I'm sorry but it's actually over here so when you go to the elf portrait under the when this Sprite clicked it should actually set live to 1,200 so the live um rotation works so do that as you can see the live rotation works just like that and we already coded all the powerups and everything so we're actually going to start out with the apprentices star which is the and then we'll move on to the bottom so we're going to start with the princess star because this is what the Mage third ability is what the turret shoots so when the green flag is clicked we're going to hide and we need if then if then hero selected is equal to two go to third ability oh go to third ability there we go so I think we already made the broadcast so when I receive shoot apprentices star it'll go to thir ability so this is just a double check go to thir ability then it will show It'll point towards Point towards Mouse pointer so it'll just shoot wherever your mouse is and then it'll repeat until touching Edge and it'll move 30 steps until it reaches the edge and it'll hide and it will go to third ability so that's it for this and we'll come back to this and code it more later so now we're going to work on the bomb which is the Griffin ability where the Griffin drops a bomb which literally explodes everything so I have made Four costumes if you watch the first part you will know so when the green flag is clicked it will switch costume to one then it'll go to back layer go to back later and the bomb is really strong it'll instakill anything so it'll go to this position and hide so when I receive bomb so this is when the Griffin drops the bomb and destroys everything in sight it'll go to this position switch costume to costume one just double check it will show and then it'll Glide 1 second to and I have a position for this 4 113 so it would just be like around here and that's when the explosion occurs which then everything dies and then after that it'll wait 1 second you switch costume to two then we'll just duplicate this wait one second switch costume to three duplicate this switch costume to four oop sorry and then we'll have a wait one second and then it'll hide so that's just the bomb code and now let's work on the enemy so this is this will be very bulky code so um stay along with me because it's going to be a long ride so so um let's start this so the enem is going to be a clone while the projectile is a target I mean a single thing so it's not a clone so two clone so it's not two clones so when I receive start game it'll go forever it'll create clone of myself and then we'll have a wait pick random between 1 to 2.3 seconds which then a new um dude will spawn so let's get a when I start as a clone it will go to x 175 so that's like around oops sorry so x 175 which will be around here and then we have a pick random for the Y it'll be pick random 00 to 25 and that's where like near the cemetery is so yeah and then it will show forever it repeat until um touching player always just point towards player no matter what and it will Point towards player then it will move two steps until it reaches the player so zombies medium speed so when I start as a clone when I start as a clone it will we need a new variable so makeing new variable zombie HP and this is for the Sprite only so just like that so when I start as a clone it will set zombie HP to 300 so zombies have 300 HP and then it will repeat until touching player and then after the touch um it'll wait 05 seconds so it isn't clunky so wait. 5 seconds then now we reach the big big block of code so this after we're done with this code it's going to be the end of this video so when I start as a clone forever so we're going to go in this order the first ability no the projectile the the first ability no the projectiles first then the first ability of the first character second ability of the second character and we'll just go down just like that so forever you need a if touching if then it's touching so after when we really just get one of them done for the projectiles we can just duplicate them and use it like that so and you need to and over here so if if then touching projectile so projectile and hero selected is equal to one so this is the elf Warrior so if it's touching the projectile of the elf Warrior this is basically saying it will change zombie HP by minus 180 and it'll broadcast a message delete Arrow so this delete Arrow message is pretty important error and after that we have a if then statement if then you need a or if then you need equals and a less than so if then zombie HP is equal to zero or or zombie HP is less than zero then it will change score by five oh change score by five and it will delete this clone and that's just the first block so since we have one of these it's really easy to make a lot of them so we just duplicate it remember to put it under so it doesn't interfere and then if it's touching the projectile of here selected two it'll change so the Mage is really strong so it'll do minus 250 instead 180 and it'll broadcast delete Arrow delete arrow is just basically delete projectile and this is the same so you see once we have one we can do a lot remember to put it under so it's not overlapping so if it's touching hero select is equal to three which is the fairy queen it'll change HP by minus 60 on HP and it'll broadcast delete arrow and change score by five so this is now we have a if then so place it under here if then so now we're getting to the first ability of the first hero you need to and if then it's touching first ability which is the spectral arrows which just go through all the enemies first ability and hero selected is equal to one then it will change score by five cuz we don't even have to deduct the HP from the zombie because it we're just going to delete its clone um not minus change Square by five then it'll delete this clone delete this clone and then we'll duplicate this put it under if touching second ability and hero selected is still one the second ability is just the death arrow and then we'll actually broadcast delete arrow and delete this club so the third ability just kills everything so on the side we'll put when I receive bomb we'll put weight one second and then delete this clone so it just wipes it out just like that and now we're going to move on to the first ability of hero selected is equal to two so let's just duplicate this so of touching first ability and hero selected equal o and hero selected equal to two which is the Grand Master Mage then it will instead of doing all this it's so for the Great Master Mage a first ability it actually teleports them back so switch costume to costume 2 it'll wait .1 seconds it'll move negative 150 back steps back so it'll just move all the way back the Grand Master Mage is really strong with his teleports it'll move. 3 seconds I mean wait 2.3 seconds and it will switch costume to costume one fairly simple that's the teleport back and now we have so let's go back to the projectile and get a duplicate we just need one so let's move this down so the second ability for the the second hero which is Grandmaster Mage so if it's touching the second ability hero selected is equal to two then it'll change zombie HP by 60 and it won't broadcast delete error cuz the lightning so the lightning strike that the grandm Mage does is really strong against metal enemies but not these enemies so it'll change it by 60 and we'll just have the script over here now it's going to be the third ability so which is The Apprentice turret which he'll shoot the um apprentice's star at the enemy so if it's touching the appr princess's star and the hero selected is equal to two then it will broadcast broadcast delete apprentices star oh yeah we need to make that so we'll make a new message oop new message and we'll name it delete apprentices cuz it's shooting from a different place so you have to have this so delete apprentices star so when I broadcast delete apprentices star it'll change zombie HP by minus 90 so it's stronger against metal enemies just like the lightning ability and we'll have this right there if then the zombie HP is zero less than zero change score five and delete this CP so now we're already moving on to the third hero I know it looked like such a blocky amount of code but it's actually not so if it's touching we'll just have just duplicate this remember put it under don't overlap it inside so if it's touching the second ability and hero select is equal to three which is the fairy queen and since the first ability doesn't affect it we don't need to put the first ability because first ability just heals the dude so we don't need any of this it'll change score by five and delete this clone then um we have to get this other block of code so let's duplicate this so the second ability no I mean the third ability in hero select is equal to three which makes the huge Defender Shield which teleports them back once they touch it and does insane damage it will be so we'll have this move negative 100 steps negative 100 steps it will change zombie HP by minus 200 it'll switch costume and costume three which is this one and and it will wait Point 2 seconds and it will switch costume to costume one again and that's yeah so let's get another one and we're actually done with all the abilities and projectile shots so it was actually pretty quick as I I didn't think it would be that quick so we need if then over here if it's touching the player so we're going to finish up delete arrow and this going to be the end of the video so after this so if it's touching the player it'll move negative 20 steps back so it can hit you again if you're not careful enough and then it will set we need a new variable hit player so each of them do different damages so we're going to have hit player zombie and we'll have one for hit player Speedy zombie hit player blah blah blah and then it will set hit player zombie to why so you hit him and it'll broadcast hit player so we're actually getting to hit player and the rest of the enemies next tutorial cuz hit player also is involved with all the other enemies so this huge bul of code and we'll come back to do more code later on this Sprite but first let's go to the projectile so the projectile also has a delete code a delete arrow thing so when I receive delete Arrow it will hide and it'll go to player so that's just when it touches like the enemy and same with the apprentices star so let's go to appren Star when I receive delete apprentices star hide and then it'll go back to third ability which is the turret at because it's hero select it's two go to third ability and that should work so let's see if it works so the only enemy that should be spawning right now is the Casual enemy so let's just check it out we have all this clutter up here so let's just let's just close all this hit player zombie and go to the enemy close to zombie HP so yeah so we have all this clutter so let's just test it out let's try Grand Master Mage so as you can see it works the enemy is going to killed by the projectile and we have the delete arrow in code and everything so this is actually working pretty well and let's see if power up one works which is the teleport and it does it just teleports them back and then let's see if power up two Works which is the lightning that thing also works but it's really weak against these zombies we'll make him more stronger against armored enemies and as you can see power up one works so this is just the Casual basics of the game we have a lot of more bosses and stuff that will add to the game and then let's see if this will work oh yeah as you can see The Apprentice is shooting his stars and it does seem to be working so it'll work for all of them oh yeah and we'll shrink the princess's star size so it doesn't like hit a mass majority of things so it's actually going to be 40 and yeah oh we should code the weight the weight Sprite so let's actually do that first so um when the green flag is clicked it'll go to front layer go to front layer you go switch costume to costume one so there's two costumes for this there's the wait before using this item and then this item is in progress which is when the third ability is in progress and you can't use another one while it's in progress so and it'll go to 0 0 then it'll hide then when I receive start game it will switch costume to costume one and hide and then when I receive game over then it also hide so I don't oh yeah we don't we haven't even got the game over yet cuz we haven't coded the game over so when I receive no item to use so when you have nothing to use it'll switch costume to costume one start sound pop it will show wait one second then it will hide and the in progress part is about the same too so when I receive in progress it'll switch costume to costume oop it'll switch costume to costume two starts on pop show wait 1 second and hide so we coded the weight Sprite down too so I'm going to get a few power ups and I'll show you if it works so the heroes haven't started taking damage yet cuz obviously we haven't coded yet we haven't coded it yet so um fairy Queen's not going to take any damage but we can heal him back to Max HP even though she's at Max HP so yeah unless see if it works yeah I just found a bug in the code it's saying wait before using this item even though I have the item and this is actually not supposed to be here I accidentally put it in there so sorry please take out that no item to use and it should work now if I check all these real quick yeah so let's rerun it on fairy queen so I have a few abilities over here so let's see if it works we have power up yep it works so power up two works as I know and then let's see if the defender chip Works yep it seems to be working so yeah and I can heal myself even though I'm at Max HP yeah okay so it works so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below what else games you want to see on our Channel and I'll see you guys in the next part
