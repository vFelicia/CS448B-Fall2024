00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - hey guys welcome back to part two of
00:08 - tunnel of gold
00:10 - so today we'll be working on the beetle
00:14 - so um we can just
00:17 - um put this thing in
00:20 - the if green flag is clicked
00:24 - it will set gigging to
00:28 - n which means no so go to front layer
00:36 - i'll set size to 50 because i think the
00:38 - beetle is honestly way too
00:39 - big um a point in direction 90
00:46 - and it'll go to this position
00:51 - so that's just part of the beetle code
00:55 - there's still a lot to go
00:58 - so bl code so
01:01 - you also have to do so we have to do the
01:05 - movement for the beetle
01:06 - so if when i receive start game
01:10 - it'll go forever
01:15 - and go forever
01:22 - go forever in an if then statement
01:31 - the key up
01:34 - arrow is pressed it'll go up
01:39 - so it's going to point in direction zero
01:42 - which is up
01:47 - and i'll go to the next we don't have a
01:50 - costume right now
01:52 - but you can draw one if you want to so
01:55 - if
01:55 - so if you wanted a costume i'll show you
01:58 - how to draw one
01:59 - you just duplicate the next costume you
02:01 - can just move its
02:02 - legs a little bit you know that stuff
02:05 - like turn it a little bit like all his
02:07 - legs
02:07 - not all of them but just some of them
02:10 - just move them
02:14 - just turn them a little bit
02:22 - so yeah right now i'm turning them
02:30 - and then you can um
02:34 - keep on working on so you can also do
02:36 - next costume
02:39 - um move 10 steps
02:43 - and wait 0.1 seconds
02:50 - i will i'm not put 2.01 seconds yet
02:54 - i'll show you what's going on
02:56 - [Music]
03:01 - i'll finish the up arrow down here or
03:03 - everything and then i'll show you
03:05 - so that's so wait 0.1 seconds
03:15 - let's actually take this out because i'm
03:16 - going to show you later and we can just
03:18 - duplicate this it's simple
03:20 - um do the down arrow instead
03:25 - um and set a point in direction 180
03:28 - which is
03:29 - pointing to the bottom if you didn't
03:30 - know um
03:33 - i'll go next costume same thing and then
03:35 - weigh 0.1 seconds but we're not doing
03:37 - that yet
03:38 - and then we can also code the next one
03:40 - it's a bit different because it's for
03:42 - um right and left arrow key so
03:46 - let's change this to right arrow
03:49 - i'll point in direction 90 next costume
03:53 - move 10 steps
03:54 - that's it and we can do this again
04:00 - then we can do the left arrow and there
04:02 - you go
04:03 - so this is also not point ninety
04:07 - point negative ninety so that's
04:12 - it's pointing to the left i'm gonna demo
04:15 - it for you
04:16 - as you can see we can like walk through
04:19 - like everything
04:20 - and that's not good that's not how it's
04:23 - supposed to go
04:24 - it's it's because you can just hold down
04:26 - the arrow key and you just
04:28 - go through everything so you need the
04:31 - point 0.1 second
04:39 - so i'm gonna work on another type of
04:42 - code first
04:43 - before i do that and then when i receive
04:46 - start game
04:49 - it will
04:52 - it'll go forever this will prevent the
04:56 - bugs
04:57 - for from moving out of the light area so
05:00 - we can do that down here
05:01 - um if
05:05 - and then you need a if then statement
05:22 - and
05:24 - so we can put this like that
05:30 - so we'll go to a sensing
05:33 - touching
05:37 - if then punching
05:42 - rocks and you need the touching collar
05:45 - one
05:46 - you can go see if that's the right color
05:48 - first
05:51 - eyedropper that color so i think that
05:54 - was a little bit different
05:56 - and then we can also use
05:59 - and then equal sign
06:04 - digging equals
06:07 - n that means no so you can't dig
06:11 - when you're um
06:18 - when you're um doing that so you just
06:22 - move that
06:23 - right there and then
06:26 - you need another thin steep
06:32 - if then equals
06:39 - this is the direction of the bug so
06:42 - direction
06:45 - equals 90 which is right side
06:48 - and then he'll change x
06:51 - by minus five so go back
07:07 - so you can also do the left side
07:11 - it will change x by five
07:15 - and then you're not gonna do um
07:19 - uh down
07:22 - you know but instead it's changed y
07:25 - so we can to zero which is
07:29 - pointing to the top and
07:32 - instead of change x it's change y
07:36 - by minus five
07:42 - just put this inside but then this one
07:50 - put that right there actually um
07:53 - and then we put that to 180
08:01 - change y by five
08:06 - and then possibly if then statement
08:11 - that's under all of this under all of
08:13 - this
08:15 - ill and touching the gold color
08:23 - it's gold color that means it'll
08:25 - broadcast
08:27 - a new message called
08:31 - you win
08:38 - and then beetle we're still working on
08:40 - the beetle
08:41 - and then when i receive
08:44 - you win say
08:48 - stop other scripts in sprite
08:54 - you'll say i got the gold
09:03 - two seconds and i'll stop all
09:08 - so we can add the a digging
09:12 - so when
09:16 - d is pressed so where's that when
09:20 - key d is pressed
09:24 - stop other scripts in this fight i i
09:27 - mean
09:27 - um digging set digging
09:32 - to why
09:35 - broadcast
09:43 - broadcast and wait a new message
09:46 - called dig
09:50 - and then set
09:53 - digging to end
10:02 - after done digging and set it back to
10:04 - end now we're going to the digging
10:05 - sprite we'll work on this later
10:07 - we'll add that later so the dig spray
10:11 - so you don't have any code actually we
10:13 - do have a little bit code in here
10:15 - so when i receive
10:18 - dig the point in direction
10:24 - direction of the beetle
10:30 - you also have to change the back first
10:33 - the direction of the bead
10:36 - and then it'll move 20 steps
10:44 - so i'll dig in the where the beetle is
10:48 - stamp
10:52 - and then when i receive you win
10:57 - then stop other strips in this spring
11:04 - as you can see i'm using this to do it
11:07 - and then you can dig
11:10 - it's bringing it upside down and you got
11:13 - the gold and let's see if the rocks work
11:15 - so as you can see they're digging to end
11:20 - so so i'm gonna also add the
11:23 - stuff other scripts in this uh sprite
11:26 - into the gold so the timer will stop
11:28 - is it there
11:33 - why is it not going in there probably
11:35 - somewhere
11:37 - there it is there's two of them so there
11:40 - we go
11:40 - um and then um
11:45 - i'll show you the book as you see if you
11:47 - can if you hold the thing
11:49 - it'll let you go through the um the dirt
11:52 - so you need to wait 0.1 seconds
11:58 - right here
12:13 - so i'm just gonna do that
12:22 - so i'm gonna try it as you can see you
12:24 - can't i'm holding it right now
12:27 - um and you cannot go through you can dig
12:30 - too
12:30 - see and then the rocks block you from
12:34 - exiting right now
12:36 - and then you got the gold and the timer
12:39 - will stop
12:39 - so i got i took me 12 seconds to beat
12:42 - this game
12:43 - so anyways um please like
12:46 - share and subscribe to our channel and
12:48 - comments in the comment section below to
12:50 - see what else content you want to see so

can also do the left side it will change x by five and then you're not gonna do um uh down you know but instead it's changed y so we can to zero which is pointing to the top and instead of change x it's change y by minus five just put this inside but then this one put that right there actually um and then we put that to 180 change y by five and then possibly if then statement that's under all of this under all of this ill and touching the gold color it's gold color that means it'll broadcast a new message called you win and then beetle we're still working on the beetle and then when i receive you win say stop other scripts in sprite you'll say i got the gold two seconds and i'll stop all so we can add the a digging so when d is pressed so where's that when key d is pressed stop other scripts in this fight i i mean um digging set digging to why broadcast broadcast and wait a new message called dig and then set digging to end after done digging and set it back to end now we're going to the digging sprite we'll work on this later we'll add that later so the dig spray so you don't have any code actually we do have a little bit code in here so when i receive dig the point in direction direction of the beetle you also have to change the back first the direction of the bead and then it'll move 20 steps so i'll dig in the where the beetle is stamp and then when i receive you win then stop other strips in this spring as you can see i'm using this to do it and then you can dig it's bringing it upside down and you got the gold and let's see if the rocks work so as you can see they're digging to end so so i'm gonna also add the stuff other scripts in this uh sprite into the gold so the timer will stop is it there why is it not going in there probably somewhere there it is there's two of them so there we go um and then um i'll show you the book as you see if you can if you hold the thing it'll let you go through the um the dirt so you need to wait 0.1 seconds right here so i'm just gonna do that so i'm gonna try it as you can see you can't i'm holding it right now um and you cannot go through you can dig too see and then the rocks block you from exiting right now and then you got the gold and the timer will stop so i got i took me 12 seconds to beat this game so anyways um please like share and subscribe to our channel and comments in the comment section
