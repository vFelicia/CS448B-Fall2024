00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's K playground here
00:09 - today we're back for another video in
00:10 - scratch and today we'll be working on
00:12 - the seventh part of the hero war game so
00:15 - if you haven't checked out the previous
00:16 - Parts is also on our Channel and it will
00:18 - be in the video description below so all
00:21 - the parts before the seventh part and
00:23 - also if you have any problems Che uh
00:26 - with our game uh you can uh check out my
00:29 - account gumbuster 98 and I have a
00:31 - project over there hero war game and you
00:34 - can check the code and see what you have
00:39 - wrong so today we're going to try to
00:41 - code the second boss um so first let's
00:46 - drag almost all of the scripts from The
00:48 - Siege monster to that one so the old one
00:52 - let's just drag this
00:54 - one let's drag this
00:57 - one when I oh let's drag this this one
01:01 - let's dry this
01:03 - one this
01:06 - one this
01:13 - one and this
01:18 - one all right uh we actually don't need
01:21 - this one cuz this one's to summon peons
01:22 - and the old one does not summon peons so
01:24 - we have these six pieces so the first
01:27 - thing we're going to do is check what
01:29 - the siege monster P it's the old one
01:31 - sieg monster HP so let's rename this
01:33 - variable to the old one
01:38 - HP the old one HP so it'll hide variable
01:42 - the old one HP
01:45 - yeah so when I receive we're going to
01:48 - change this to new message old one
01:55 - spawn it it will set the old one HP to
01:57 - 8,000 so that's less than the seege
01:59 - monster but is it's a range attacker and
02:00 - it's very dangerous with its in tangling
02:03 - Vineyards so and then it also show
02:06 - variable old one
02:10 - HP okay after that we're going to have
02:14 - when I receive old one
02:18 - spawn old one spawn then I'll go to this
02:21 - position pick random show and then it
02:23 - will not uh repeat until touch player
02:25 - it'll just point towards player cuz the
02:27 - old one does not move there we go
02:31 - and we will
02:34 - have all right so when I receive start
02:37 - game forever if score is greater than
02:39 - 1,250 then it'll show it'll broadcast
02:42 - old one
02:43 - spawn and it'll stop the
02:46 - script good so now we will have this old
02:52 - one dead script so let's actually do
02:54 - this so uh let's actually work on this
02:57 - first cuz this one actually broadcast
02:58 - the old one dead so when I receive old
03:01 - one
03:02 - spawn forever if touching projectile on
03:04 - her is equal to one it change old one
03:06 - hpus 180 broadcast Del era and then if
03:11 - if it's less than a broadcast change
03:13 - score by 500 a broadcasting Siege
03:15 - monster dead it'll broadcast old one
03:18 - dead old one dead so touching projectile
03:22 - is equal to two it'll change old one
03:24 - minus 250 and then we'll just change
03:27 - this to old one
03:28 - dead
03:32 - and then if it's touching projectile and
03:34 - her select is equal to three then uh
03:36 - change old one HP minus 350 Fair Queen
03:39 - stronger and then it will broadcast old
03:42 - one
03:44 - dead just like that and then first
03:47 - ability here
03:49 - two the same thing old one
03:54 - dead same thing for this one just old
03:57 - one dead you just change it like that
03:59 - old oh no not not old on
04:03 - dead and that's the same for the second
04:07 - ability here two it will old one
04:12 - dead and then after that for the
04:16 - apprentices star here c 2 uh it will
04:20 - broadcast old one
04:25 - dead and let's continue and if it's
04:29 - touching second ability and here to
04:31 - three it change old one hpus
04:34 - 100 if old one HP is equal Z old one HP
04:38 - is less than zero 500 and then old one
04:41 - dead so since the old one can't move the
04:44 - shield is not affected so The Shield is
04:46 - does nothing against them so you
04:49 - actually need to delete this thir
04:52 - ability
04:53 - thing so if it's touching player know
04:57 - set hit player old so each one do
05:00 - different damage values we have to make
05:01 - a new variable for each them so hit
05:03 - player
05:06 - old it will set hit player old to Y
05:09 - broadcast hit player and it will not
05:13 - move Nega 10 steps back cuz that would
05:15 - just be really bad you're just moving 10
05:18 - steps back so now um we can change this
05:21 - so when I receive old one dead it will
05:24 - broadcast do all this and there we go
05:28 - all right let's move on to Old One's
05:30 - vineard the vine ball this is where the
05:32 - old one shoots these huge projectiles at
05:35 - the
05:40 - enemy and first of all let's I think
05:44 - it's about the same code AS really the
05:49 - you know the um projectile so let's just
05:52 - move this on to the vine ball we don't
05:54 - need any of this
05:55 - but so we have this over here so when I
05:58 - receive
06:00 - old one
06:02 - dead it will actually so we need parts
06:04 - of this code it will repeat 100 times so
06:07 - it can shoot up to 100 Vine balls if you
06:09 - don't kill them by then it'll stop
06:11 - shooting Vine balls but it'll wait 3
06:16 - seconds wait 3
06:19 - seconds and then after that it will
06:23 - show and it'll go to old one so we need
06:26 - this see go to Old
06:30 - one the old one and then after that
06:34 - it'll Point towards
06:36 - player you'll shoot in the player
06:39 - Direction Point towards player and then
06:42 - it'll repeat until touching Edge or
06:46 - player so
06:48 - or
06:51 - touching Edge or touching
06:57 - player Oh move 30 stats oh move 10 steps
07:01 - made it a little slower so it's easier
07:02 - to dodge and then it'll
07:06 - hide after that and it will go to old
07:12 - one old one the old one there we go we
07:16 - don't need none of this all
07:19 - right so when the green flag is clicked
07:22 - it will go to old
07:25 - one go to old one
07:30 - the old one the old one okay and it'll
07:37 - hide and then when I
07:40 - receive zoom in a little
07:42 - bit when I receive old one
07:48 - dead old one dead then it will
07:52 - hide and then it'll stop all the strips
07:54 - in the Sprite so let's get the stop all
07:56 - the strips in the Sprite right over here
08:00 - here here and then now when the green
08:04 - flag is
08:06 - clicked
08:09 - forever if
08:12 - then touching
08:17 - player then it will change lives by
08:19 - minus
08:25 - 30 so just 30 damage which is pretty
08:28 - decent I mean
08:31 - yeah cuz it's range anyway all right so
08:34 - let's move on to the
08:39 - vineyard this is what the old one spawns
08:41 - out to kill the enemies by poison damage
08:45 - and changes the color effect so let's do
08:47 - this so when the green flag is
08:50 - clicked it will
08:53 - hide it'll go to x150 -27 and it'll go
08:59 - to the the back layer go to back
09:04 - layer then when the green flag is
09:10 - clicked
09:12 - forever it will
09:14 - forever if then
09:18 - touching
09:24 - player
09:26 - then then it will actually if touching
09:29 - player then it'll change the lives by
09:31 - minus five so the base damage is five
09:33 - but it also has poison damage so that's
09:35 - also really strong even if you're not on
09:37 - the vineard change life of minus five
09:39 - it'll wait 05 seconds so five damage
09:42 - every .5
09:44 - seconds and then now when the uh when I
09:49 - receive old one
09:52 - dead then it'll hide stop all the
09:55 - scripts in the Sprite and now we have to
09:57 - do the old one spawn part so the scripts
09:59 - in this
10:02 - Sprite all right and now let's add the
10:06 - when I
10:08 - receive old
10:11 - one spawn then it will repeat 100 times
10:15 - so it's the capability of spawning 100
10:17 - times then it will go to
10:21 - x so this is a pick random position so
10:24 - it'll go to x we need two pick randoms
10:27 - or you can just yeah pick
10:29 - random let's do this -00 to 200 that's
10:34 - the position and then let's duplicate
10:36 - that let's put it oh yeah put one in the
10:40 - X put one in the Y but instead change
10:42 - this to 100 so it doesn't go all the way
10:44 - up and then it'll
10:48 - show it will wait 5
10:52 - seconds and then it'll
10:57 - hide so that
11:00 - is the essentially The Vineyard
11:03 - code so now let's go back to the player
11:07 - and see how that works so let's go back
11:10 - to the
11:11 - player also We'll add the old one damage
11:13 - after and the peon
11:17 - damage under here we have if
11:22 - then so under the show if then touching
11:27 - Vineyard
11:32 - yard then it'll repeat
11:37 - five it will change color effect by
11:42 - 25 it will change Lies by minus
11:50 - 5-
11:52 - 5 then it'll wait 4 seconds so wait4
11:56 - seconds change color effect change lives
12:00 - then it'll clear graphic effects after
12:04 - so under here all right so let's add the
12:07 - peon damage and The Siege and the um and
12:12 - the old one damage so let's duplicate
12:14 - this put it under here
12:18 - and if hit player
12:20 - Pon equals y so peons will do -30 damage
12:26 - actually really strong not going to lie
12:29 - um and then now let's duplicate that
12:32 - again and if hit player old one go y old
12:37 - BL is negative 120 doesn't matter if you
12:39 - get into them anyway you're going to die
12:40 - anyway so let's duplicate these two so
12:44 - and then set hit player P
12:47 - on p on to end and hit player old there
12:52 - we
12:55 - go so now let's work work on the zombie
13:01 - King actually let's do the mysterious
13:03 - man first cuz that comes in order before
13:05 - the you know the zombie
13:09 - King so let's do mysterious man so when
13:13 - the green flag is clicked the mysterious
13:15 - man is pretty much a necessity so win
13:17 - you know it'll go to x this position
13:21 - then it'll go to front
13:22 - layer go to front layer now switch
13:26 - costume to costume
13:27 - 2
13:29 - then it'll show I mean yeah and then
13:32 - it'll hide
13:35 - sorry then when the when I receive old
13:38 - one dead so after when you beat the old
13:39 - one it'll give you some heals so then
13:41 - you can fight the wicked zombie King
13:44 - then it'll wait 4
13:48 - seconds you'll switch costume to costume
13:53 - 2 which is this one so he comes in like
13:57 - and he gives you some medicine switch
13:59 - costume 2 it will
14:02 - show it'll wait. five
14:07 - seconds know switch costume to costume
14:11 - one switch costume to costume one then
14:14 - it will
14:17 - say it'll say
14:20 - you'll need this for the wicked zombie
14:25 - zombie
14:27 - King
14:30 - and then after that it'll switch costume
14:32 - the costume 3 it will
14:37 - say take some
14:41 - heels for one second and it would change
14:47 - lives
14:50 - by 1,000 so of course you can alter this
14:53 - amount like um if you want it more
14:55 - challenging honestly I would say um I
14:58 - would recommend make it more challenging
14:59 - cuz 1,000 is a lot of health and then it
15:02 - will say
15:05 - poof for one
15:08 - second and I'll switch costume back to
15:11 - costume
15:12 - 2 which is the
15:15 - poof and it will
15:19 - hide that's the mysterious man code so
15:22 - now let's work on the zombie
15:27 - King so the zombie king zombie King
15:31 - essentially will be taking a lot of code
15:33 - from The Siege monster because it's
15:36 - pretty related to the SI monster because
15:37 - it can also summon peons so let's also
15:40 - just drag them all in quickly
15:44 - so
15:47 - that the big
15:51 - one get this one and then the SI monster
15:56 - spawn so let's put them all over
16:01 - here um yeah very crowded let's just
16:05 - move some of these
16:11 - around all right so let's get to work so
16:16 - when the green switch on cost one hide
16:18 - and then of course we need to change
16:20 - this from Siege monster
16:23 - HP
16:25 - to zombie King h
16:29 - HP so it'll hide variables on be king HP
16:33 - when I receive King's spond so we need
16:35 - to make a new message King
16:38 - spawn then it will go to x yeah that
16:42 - position and it'll show and then forever
16:45 - repeat until touching player yeah move
16:47 - point one steps
16:50 - so and then I also need when I
16:56 - receive uh King spawn so we're going to
16:59 - change this to King
17:01 - spawn it will show varable zombie K HP
17:05 - and then instead it has the capability
17:06 - to repeat 12 times it'll wait 8 seconds
17:11 - it'll switch costume to costume 2 so and
17:15 - then it will broadcast death ray so
17:17 - let's actually summon the peons now so
17:21 - put those up there and then it'll
17:23 - broadcast death
17:25 - ray death ray this is where he steals
17:28 - your HP and uses it for
17:30 - himself and then it'll wait one second
17:32 - and switch costume back to costume
17:35 - 1 costume two oh no
17:41 - uh yeah so it's kind of cramped so this
17:43 - is actually going to be
17:47 - cost so I may have actually deleted
17:50 - costume 2 when I was making the first
17:53 - project so let's actually drag that in
17:56 - from the backpack I'll be right back all
17:58 - right sorry but I now have costume 2
18:01 - duplicated in my thing so oh gosh let's
18:06 - make a new
18:08 - costume let's duplicate it onto
18:11 - here yeah so this is costume 2 so let's
18:14 - just put drag it up here this is costume
18:16 - 2 where he's hitting the shield and
18:19 - creating the lines I'm sorry if I told
18:21 - you to delete that in the first part but
18:22 - we actually need that for um the
18:27 - animation so if you go to my project and
18:31 - you could just take the costume from
18:33 - there so we have 1 two three and then
18:35 - four so yeah we do need this costume or
18:39 - you can just draw it yourself it's
18:40 - pretty easy just get the costume one
18:42 - move the sword like that to hit the
18:43 - shield and then draw two little red
18:45 - lines so when I receive King spawn it'll
18:49 - uh show variable Z King HP repeat 12 and
18:53 - then switch costume to costume 2
18:54 - broadcast death rate broadcast summon
18:55 - peons wait 1 second and switch costume
18:58 - to coste costume
19:00 - one so let's continue here so when I
19:03 - receive King
19:06 - spawn King
19:09 - spot then it
19:12 - will it will so zombie can HP to 15,000
19:17 - pretty strong tching player wait. 5
19:20 - seconds and then when I receive start
19:24 - game if score is greater than 2,000 then
19:27 - show and the broadcast King
19:31 - spawn okay and
19:34 - now um when I
19:38 - receive we actually have to add this
19:40 - beam touch thing so this is what happens
19:42 - in the death R so when I receive beam
19:48 - touched or or that's from the death ray
19:50 - so let's actually code that last so
19:52 - let's do the big
19:55 - script after this one so when I receive
19:58 - King spawn it will do all that switch
20:01 - costume costume three and there we go so
20:04 - now let's code this big stop when I
20:06 - receive King spawn then forever if
20:09 - touching projectile blah blah blah blah
20:11 - blah blah and then it'll change
20:14 - score oh it won't change any score
20:18 - because it um won't change any
20:23 - score so let's actually make a
20:26 - new message King dead
20:29 - actually this is King dead I'm so sorry
20:31 - King dead so it'll do all that when he
20:34 - dies and then we have one broadcast King
20:37 - dead and it's searching projectile blah
20:39 - blah blah it will broadcast King dead
20:44 - again and then same with this
20:49 - one C King
20:51 - dead not King spawn King dead and then
20:56 - first
20:57 - ability of hero sctc one it will blah
21:02 - blah blah
21:04 - broadcast King dead won't change any
21:09 - score and then second ability here
21:12 - select is one broadcast King dead just
21:15 - like
21:17 - that and then second ability to
21:20 - two- 60
21:23 - broadcast King dead so it's pretty
21:26 - repetitive here and then it'll change
21:30 - zombie King blah blah blah and then
21:32 - it'll take out the score and then
21:35 - broadcast King dead and then now if it's
21:38 - touching second ability and here go a
21:40 - three it'll change Zombie h King HP and
21:45 - then broadcast K dead take out the
21:51 - score and then if it's touching third
21:53 - ability and he like go three it'll
21:54 - actually move 25 steps back it'll keep
21:57 - on changing um the zombie King
22:00 - HP and just like that we have King dead
22:07 - again so it's searching the player then
22:09 - it'll set hit player King to make a new
22:14 - one hit
22:17 - player
22:18 - player
22:20 - [Music]
22:23 - king um and then I'll set hit player
22:26 - King to Y and broadcast hit player and a
22:28 - move NE of 10 steps back now let's add
22:30 - this onto the player so go to the
22:35 - player sorry I don't know why and then
22:38 - we'll go to player and then it
22:42 - will it will set hit player
22:48 - King to y or change lives by - 680 so
22:53 - it's basically a death wish if you want
22:55 - to go right into there and various
22:57 - Escape you're going to die automatically
22:59 - basically and then it'll set hit player
23:02 - King to n and there we go and now let's
23:08 - move on to the death
23:10 - ray I think we're going to stop here for
23:13 - now today and code the death rate in the
23:15 - next part because the video is getting
23:17 - quite long so anyway please like share
23:20 - subscribe and comment in the comments
23:22 - section below what else games that you
23:23 - want I'll see you guys next
23:26 - time

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's K playground here today we're back for another video in scratch and today we'll be working on the seventh part of the hero war game so if you haven't checked out the previous Parts is also on our Channel and it will be in the video description below so all the parts before the seventh part and also if you have any problems Che uh with our game uh you can uh check out my account gumbuster 98 and I have a project over there hero war game and you can check the code and see what you have wrong so today we're going to try to code the second boss um so first let's drag almost all of the scripts from The Siege monster to that one so the old one let's just drag this one let's drag this one when I oh let's drag this this one let's dry this one this one this one and this one all right uh we actually don't need this one cuz this one's to summon peons and the old one does not summon peons so we have these six pieces so the first thing we're going to do is check what the siege monster P it's the old one sieg monster HP so let's rename this variable to the old one HP the old one HP so it'll hide variable the old one HP yeah so when I receive we're going to change this to new message old one spawn it it will set the old one HP to 8,000 so that's less than the seege monster but is it's a range attacker and it's very dangerous with its in tangling Vineyards so and then it also show variable old one HP okay after that we're going to have when I receive old one spawn old one spawn then I'll go to this position pick random show and then it will not uh repeat until touch player it'll just point towards player cuz the old one does not move there we go and we will have all right so when I receive start game forever if score is greater than 1,250 then it'll show it'll broadcast old one spawn and it'll stop the script good so now we will have this old one dead script so let's actually do this so uh let's actually work on this first cuz this one actually broadcast the old one dead so when I receive old one spawn forever if touching projectile on her is equal to one it change old one hpus 180 broadcast Del era and then if if it's less than a broadcast change score by 500 a broadcasting Siege monster dead it'll broadcast old one dead old one dead so touching projectile is equal to two it'll change old one minus 250 and then we'll just change this to old one dead and then if it's touching projectile and her select is equal to three then uh change old one HP minus 350 Fair Queen stronger and then it will broadcast old one dead just like that and then first ability here two the same thing old one dead same thing for this one just old one dead you just change it like that old oh no not not old on dead and that's the same for the second ability here two it will old one dead and then after that for the apprentices star here c 2 uh it will broadcast old one dead and let's continue and if it's touching second ability and here to three it change old one hpus 100 if old one HP is equal Z old one HP is less than zero 500 and then old one dead so since the old one can't move the shield is not affected so The Shield is does nothing against them so you actually need to delete this thir ability thing so if it's touching player know set hit player old so each one do different damage values we have to make a new variable for each them so hit player old it will set hit player old to Y broadcast hit player and it will not move Nega 10 steps back cuz that would just be really bad you're just moving 10 steps back so now um we can change this so when I receive old one dead it will broadcast do all this and there we go all right let's move on to Old One's vineard the vine ball this is where the old one shoots these huge projectiles at the enemy and first of all let's I think it's about the same code AS really the you know the um projectile so let's just move this on to the vine ball we don't need any of this but so we have this over here so when I receive old one dead it will actually so we need parts of this code it will repeat 100 times so it can shoot up to 100 Vine balls if you don't kill them by then it'll stop shooting Vine balls but it'll wait 3 seconds wait 3 seconds and then after that it will show and it'll go to old one so we need this see go to Old one the old one and then after that it'll Point towards player you'll shoot in the player Direction Point towards player and then it'll repeat until touching Edge or player so or touching Edge or touching player Oh move 30 stats oh move 10 steps made it a little slower so it's easier to dodge and then it'll hide after that and it will go to old one old one the old one there we go we don't need none of this all right so when the green flag is clicked it will go to old one go to old one the old one the old one okay and it'll hide and then when I receive zoom in a little bit when I receive old one dead old one dead then it will hide and then it'll stop all the strips in the Sprite so let's get the stop all the strips in the Sprite right over here here here and then now when the green flag is clicked forever if then touching player then it will change lives by minus 30 so just 30 damage which is pretty decent I mean yeah cuz it's range anyway all right so let's move on to the vineyard this is what the old one spawns out to kill the enemies by poison damage and changes the color effect so let's do this so when the green flag is clicked it will hide it'll go to x150 27 and it'll go to the the back layer go to back layer then when the green flag is clicked forever it will forever if then touching player then then it will actually if touching player then it'll change the lives by minus five so the base damage is five but it also has poison damage so that's also really strong even if you're not on the vineard change life of minus five it'll wait 05 seconds so five damage every .5 seconds and then now when the uh when I receive old one dead then it'll hide stop all the scripts in the Sprite and now we have to do the old one spawn part so the scripts in this Sprite all right and now let's add the when I receive old one spawn then it will repeat 100 times so it's the capability of spawning 100 times then it will go to x so this is a pick random position so it'll go to x we need two pick randoms or you can just yeah pick random let's do this 00 to 200 that's the position and then let's duplicate that let's put it oh yeah put one in the X put one in the Y but instead change this to 100 so it doesn't go all the way up and then it'll show it will wait 5 seconds and then it'll hide so that is the essentially The Vineyard code so now let's go back to the player and see how that works so let's go back to the player also We'll add the old one damage after and the peon damage under here we have if then so under the show if then touching Vineyard yard then it'll repeat five it will change color effect by 25 it will change Lies by minus 5 5 then it'll wait 4 seconds so wait4 seconds change color effect change lives then it'll clear graphic effects after so under here all right so let's add the peon damage and The Siege and the um and the old one damage so let's duplicate this put it under here and if hit player Pon equals y so peons will do 30 damage actually really strong not going to lie um and then now let's duplicate that again and if hit player old one go y old BL is negative 120 doesn't matter if you get into them anyway you're going to die anyway so let's duplicate these two so and then set hit player P on p on to end and hit player old there we go so now let's work work on the zombie King actually let's do the mysterious man first cuz that comes in order before the you know the zombie King so let's do mysterious man so when the green flag is clicked the mysterious man is pretty much a necessity so win you know it'll go to x this position then it'll go to front layer go to front layer now switch costume to costume 2 then it'll show I mean yeah and then it'll hide sorry then when the when I receive old one dead so after when you beat the old one it'll give you some heals so then you can fight the wicked zombie King then it'll wait 4 seconds you'll switch costume to costume 2 which is this one so he comes in like and he gives you some medicine switch costume 2 it will show it'll wait. five seconds know switch costume to costume one switch costume to costume one then it will say it'll say you'll need this for the wicked zombie zombie King and then after that it'll switch costume the costume 3 it will say take some heels for one second and it would change lives by 1,000 so of course you can alter this amount like um if you want it more challenging honestly I would say um I would recommend make it more challenging cuz 1,000 is a lot of health and then it will say poof for one second and I'll switch costume back to costume 2 which is the poof and it will hide that's the mysterious man code so now let's work on the zombie King so the zombie king zombie King essentially will be taking a lot of code from The Siege monster because it's pretty related to the SI monster because it can also summon peons so let's also just drag them all in quickly so that the big one get this one and then the SI monster spawn so let's put them all over here um yeah very crowded let's just move some of these around all right so let's get to work so when the green switch on cost one hide and then of course we need to change this from Siege monster HP to zombie King h HP so it'll hide variables on be king HP when I receive King's spond so we need to make a new message King spawn then it will go to x yeah that position and it'll show and then forever repeat until touching player yeah move point one steps so and then I also need when I receive uh King spawn so we're going to change this to King spawn it will show varable zombie K HP and then instead it has the capability to repeat 12 times it'll wait 8 seconds it'll switch costume to costume 2 so and then it will broadcast death ray so let's actually summon the peons now so put those up there and then it'll broadcast death ray death ray this is where he steals your HP and uses it for himself and then it'll wait one second and switch costume back to costume 1 costume two oh no uh yeah so it's kind of cramped so this is actually going to be cost so I may have actually deleted costume 2 when I was making the first project so let's actually drag that in from the backpack I'll be right back all right sorry but I now have costume 2 duplicated in my thing so oh gosh let's make a new costume let's duplicate it onto here yeah so this is costume 2 so let's just put drag it up here this is costume 2 where he's hitting the shield and creating the lines I'm sorry if I told you to delete that in the first part but we actually need that for um the animation so if you go to my project and you could just take the costume from there so we have 1 two three and then four so yeah we do need this costume or you can just draw it yourself it's pretty easy just get the costume one move the sword like that to hit the shield and then draw two little red lines so when I receive King spawn it'll uh show variable Z King HP repeat 12 and then switch costume to costume 2 broadcast death rate broadcast summon peons wait 1 second and switch costume to coste costume one so let's continue here so when I receive King spawn King spot then it will it will so zombie can HP to 15,000 pretty strong tching player wait. 5 seconds and then when I receive start game if score is greater than 2,000 then show and the broadcast King spawn okay and now um when I receive we actually have to add this beam touch thing so this is what happens in the death R so when I receive beam touched or or that's from the death ray so let's actually code that last so let's do the big script after this one so when I receive King spawn it will do all that switch costume costume three and there we go so now let's code this big stop when I receive King spawn then forever if touching projectile blah blah blah blah blah blah and then it'll change score oh it won't change any score because it um won't change any score so let's actually make a new message King dead actually this is King dead I'm so sorry King dead so it'll do all that when he dies and then we have one broadcast King dead and it's searching projectile blah blah blah it will broadcast King dead again and then same with this one C King dead not King spawn King dead and then first ability of hero sctc one it will blah blah blah broadcast King dead won't change any score and then second ability here select is one broadcast King dead just like that and then second ability to two 60 broadcast King dead so it's pretty repetitive here and then it'll change zombie King blah blah blah and then it'll take out the score and then broadcast King dead and then now if it's touching second ability and here go a three it'll change Zombie h King HP and then broadcast K dead take out the score and then if it's touching third ability and he like go three it'll actually move 25 steps back it'll keep on changing um the zombie King HP and just like that we have King dead again so it's searching the player then it'll set hit player King to make a new one hit player player king um and then I'll set hit player King to Y and broadcast hit player and a move NE of 10 steps back now let's add this onto the player so go to the player sorry I don't know why and then we'll go to player and then it will it will set hit player King to y or change lives by 680 so it's basically a death wish if you want to go right into there and various Escape you're going to die automatically basically and then it'll set hit player King to n and there we go and now let's move on to the death ray I think we're going to stop here for now today and code the death rate in the next part because the video is getting quite long so anyway please like share subscribe and comment in the comments section below what else games that you want I'll see you guys next time
