00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids on
00:08 - playground here and today we're back
00:09 - from another video in scratch and today
00:11 - we'll be making a 2022 new year's game
00:13 - so
00:14 - let's see how this goes so
00:17 - click on the firecracker you make it
00:19 - move so here it's moving and you have to
00:23 - touch the match to light it
00:26 - and then you throw the firecracker
00:28 - anywhere you want
00:30 - by clicking
00:32 - and if you do it five times something
00:34 - special will come up so
00:36 - let's do that five times
00:49 - see as you can see it says happy
00:52 - new
00:53 - year
00:55 - 2022 so
00:57 - here we have and that's the special
01:00 - thing that comes up so today we'll be
01:02 - coding
01:04 - this on scratch so let's go
01:07 - okay before i begin please like share
01:09 - subscribe because
01:11 - it turns out most of our viewers are not
01:14 - subscribed so please subscribe and do us
01:16 - a favor so let's the first thing we
01:18 - should do is rename our project to happy
01:21 - new year
01:24 - 2022
01:26 - and of course we never need the cat and
01:28 - our backdrop
01:31 - will always be our night city
01:37 - and our i have everything in the
01:39 - backpack so just come to my project and
01:42 - export the sprites
01:44 - if you
01:45 - uh just come in and export the sprites
01:48 - that you might want to we actually drew
01:50 - these all by ourselves so
01:52 - you see we have our match
01:55 - for our firecracker
01:57 - we have our happy
02:02 - and then we have our new
02:04 - and then we have our year
02:07 - and then we have our 2022 so um
02:10 - to make this you just have to uh get the
02:13 - h just get like the h and then choose a
02:16 - costume go to the letters and then get
02:18 - an a
02:19 - and ctrl c
02:21 - and then ctrl v and then add it to the
02:23 - place you want and after that delete the
02:25 - costume so just do that for to make
02:28 - happy
02:30 - new
02:31 - year and 2022 it might take a while but
02:34 - you can always come to my project on
02:36 - gumball098 and export the pro sprites
02:39 - from there so yeah we have that
02:42 - and um yeah so
02:46 - so i'm going to draw the sparkle sprite
02:48 - so best for our firecrackers so let's
02:50 - just draw that right now just a very
02:52 - small
02:56 - green dot so let's just zoom in a little
02:58 - bit
03:02 - yeah hold down shift and we have our
03:04 - sparkle
03:09 - i think we need that to be a little
03:11 - bigger
03:16 - that should be decent size i'm pretty
03:19 - sure okay yeah i think that should be
03:20 - fine and now let's work on the code so
03:23 - match has no code actually so we have a
03:26 - little head start over there and now we
03:28 - go straight to the firecracker
03:30 - so let's do the firecracker so let's go
03:34 - so when the green flag is clicked
03:41 - we will
03:44 - so i'm going to show you how i drew the
03:46 - match so
03:47 - let's look at let's take a quick look if
03:50 - you do want to draw your own match so
03:51 - let's see so
03:54 - so the fire is this orange thing and the
03:57 - outline is a darker orange and you just
04:00 - use the reshape tool to reshape the
04:02 - edges to make some sort of fire shape
04:05 - and that's the same applies for the
04:08 - uh
04:09 - the inside fire like the inner part the
04:12 - second layer and we have our
04:15 - match thing it's burnt so it's the black
04:18 - thing and
04:19 - this we can ungroup this real quick
04:22 - so and we have one
04:24 - uh brown
04:26 - piece of wood and one lighter brown
04:29 - piece of wood so that's for our match
04:32 - right so if you do want to draw that on
04:33 - your own here is a quick little small
04:36 - kind of tutorial to show you
04:39 - so and i'm also going to rename my
04:40 - sparkle sprite
04:45 - yeah i'm gonna move that over here
04:47 - so let's go back to the firecracker and
04:49 - let's
04:50 - show you how to draw both sprites so for
04:53 - the regular one all we have to do is
04:57 - uh
05:00 - take this
05:01 - orange sort of rectangle and reshape the
05:03 - outside and the edges out and we have
05:06 - this
05:07 - uh yellowish type of circle that we put
05:09 - over there
05:11 - and
05:12 - we have
05:13 - the
05:14 - part on the top with the little lighter
05:16 - part
05:19 - okay and
05:21 - that's for our first sprite and our
05:23 - second sprite is this one and let's it's
05:26 - just the same one duplicate this one if
05:29 - you do want to draw this and
05:30 - uh just kind of use lines to
05:35 - shape the edges like a line line line
05:37 - line line line and just shape the edges
05:40 - and then fill it in and that's how you
05:41 - make your
05:43 - sprite so we are done here off you might
05:46 - know how to make the sparkles but if you
05:48 - don't just come to my project and export
05:50 - it so let's go back to firecracker
05:54 - so when the green flag is clicked we
05:56 - make a new variable called counter
06:01 - placement
06:02 - counter
06:04 - the second thing we're gonna put since
06:06 - we just made our variable counter is set
06:09 - counter to zero because you have to make
06:12 - it five or more so we have that over
06:15 - there and now we'll set the size to a
06:17 - hundred
06:19 - and um
06:20 - it will go to
06:23 - the position marked
06:25 - and
06:26 - a point in direction 90.
06:30 - so yeah okay we also have to switch the
06:31 - custom plus we want all right and now
06:33 - i'll point direction 90 and delete this
06:36 - clone
06:39 - so now
06:40 - yeah and when i start as a no when this
06:43 - sprite is clicked it'll make a clone of
06:44 - itself because you click on the sprite
06:46 - and it'll make a clone so let's create a
06:48 - clone of myself
06:51 - and now when i start as a clone
06:56 - it will repeat until touching match
06:58 - because it will keep on following your
07:00 - mouse so repeat untouched until touching
07:03 - the match
07:06 - and it will go to mouse pointer because
07:08 - it'll follow your mouse pointer until it
07:10 - touches the match
07:15 - and it'll wait until now it's down so
07:16 - that's when you uh fire so no no that's
07:20 - when you click on the firecracker my bad
07:22 - and it will wait until now it's down
07:25 - let me put that under
07:31 - and now we will repeat ten times
07:36 - uh change size by minus five that just
07:39 - gives effect to make it smaller and
07:40 - smaller and smaller so change size by
07:43 - minus five
07:45 - and
07:46 - then we have if then statement
07:51 - if then statement and then you put an or
07:54 - so it's five or more so
07:57 - we put five
07:59 - the counter is greater to or equal to
08:02 - so
08:03 - the counter
08:05 - has to be e greater than five
08:09 - or equal
08:15 - uh and it'll broadcast happy new year so
08:17 - we still have some code to do here but
08:19 - it's very short so let's just finish
08:21 - this up real quick broadcast
08:24 - happy new
08:27 - year
08:30 - and now let's finish up the code so when
08:33 - i start as a clone
08:34 - it will go to the front layer so it's in
08:37 - front of the happy new year the match
08:39 - all that good stuff
08:41 - and it will show
08:45 - and set size to 100
08:51 - and now it will point in direction 45 so
08:54 - it's a little bit tilted to give some
08:57 - kind of effect so 45
09:00 - and now it will repeat until
09:04 - it's touching the match
09:09 - you know follow your mouse pointer so
09:13 - so go to mouse player
09:18 - let's just move that a little bit
09:20 - and go to mouse pointer and then switch
09:22 - costume to costume 2. so switch costume
09:25 - to costume 2.
09:30 - and now it will start sound poising so
09:32 - let's get oh it's already here
09:35 - oh that's probably because i put in the
09:36 - backpack but that's fine so it should be
09:38 - inside the sound thing so start sound
09:40 - toysing
09:44 - and it will wait until now it's down
09:55 - and now it will set
09:56 - a new variable
09:58 - x
09:59 - because it has to follow your mouse so
10:01 - set x
10:04 - set
10:06 - and y yeah but yeah so y
10:09 - and so set x
10:12 - to mouse x so that's just one of these
10:16 - and
10:16 - then duplicate that set y
10:20 - to mouse y so it will follow your mouse
10:23 - and now it will glide
10:26 - 0.5 seconds to where you have clicked to
10:28 - shoot
10:30 - oh
10:30 - yeah not this one sorry uh glide
10:33 - 0.5 seconds
10:35 - to mouse pointer
10:38 - and now it would change counter by one
10:44 - because you shot one firework so it
10:45 - would change the counter and when it
10:46 - gets to five it'll
10:48 - do the amazing happy new year thing so
10:51 - so change counter by one and then hide
10:55 - and then it
10:58 - will broadcast
11:06 - so yeah let's see if it works
11:08 - so let's see if it works
11:11 - it works but we just don't have the
11:12 - sparkle effect yet so let's zoom out so
11:14 - then you can see out the code feel free
11:16 - to pause here
11:23 - so feel free to pause and suck in all
11:25 - this code so just in case if you did uh
11:28 - if you missed some
11:29 - so now let's go to the sparkles and work
11:32 - on the sparkles
11:33 - so when the green flag is clicked it
11:35 - will
11:36 - erase all so by the way if you do not
11:38 - know there's this button called ad
11:40 - extension
11:42 - there's music pen video sensing all of
11:44 - these and we just click pen and we
11:46 - already have it here because it was from
11:48 - a backpack so it will erase all
11:51 - because in the beginning you always have
11:52 - to erase all the graphic effects that
11:54 - you
11:55 - made earlier and then it will hide
11:59 - and it'll wait one second
12:03 - and it will go to the front layer
12:06 - and after that i'll repeat 200 times to
12:09 - give effect
12:12 - and it will create a clone of myself so
12:14 - just make a bunch of effects
12:16 - uh some little
12:18 - sparkles some that's just very cool for
12:20 - some effect
12:21 - and now when i receive bang
12:25 - it will start the sound gong
12:28 - which we don't have yet so let's just
12:29 - get that
12:33 - yep this is a gong
12:35 - and it'll start on gong
12:37 - and you'll repeat 100 times
12:40 - for
12:41 - effect
12:43 - and it'll change color effect by two so
12:45 - just
12:46 - some
12:48 - effect added to
12:50 - the sparkles so
12:53 - and then when i receive bang
12:58 - it will set color so this is also for
13:01 - effects so there's a lot of effects that
13:03 - we could use to make this improve so set
13:06 - color effect to
13:08 - pick random
13:11 - negative 100 to positive 100 so there's
13:13 - a
13:14 - bunch of colors that
13:16 - the scratch
13:17 - the
13:18 - the thing
13:20 - makes
13:21 - there's a lot of colors to pick from so
13:23 - now let's when i receive bang
13:26 - it will
13:29 - it will set speed
13:32 - we have to make a new variable speed
13:34 - as always
13:36 - so it'll set speed
13:39 - to
13:41 - pick random 0.1
13:47 - to three to give more effect
13:50 - and it'll set ghost effect to zero so
13:52 - this is just a bunch of
13:55 - effects we could use and set ghost
13:56 - effect to zero
13:58 - and it will change color effect by 25.
14:03 - and now it will set the pen color so
14:05 - this is just a bunch of
14:07 - set the pen color
14:11 - to a pick random of 50 to 500 so there's
14:14 - a bunch of colors that
14:16 - we could pick from here
14:19 - 50 to 500
14:23 - and now pen up
14:28 - and it will go to
14:31 - x
14:33 - and then you put an x inside the x and
14:36 - you'll go to y
14:37 - y that's where you i'll put your mouse
14:39 - and you explode the thing so that's
14:41 - exactly where the sparkles are going to
14:43 - be
14:44 - so now um we'll put pen down
14:48 - to draw it yes
14:51 - pin down
14:53 - and now we will point in direction
14:58 - uh point in direction
15:01 - pick in a point in direction
15:04 - negative 180 pick random so pick random
15:07 - negative 180
15:10 - to positive 180 so there's
15:13 - different directions
15:14 - and
15:16 - it'll explode in different directions
15:18 - with this
15:19 - piece of code
15:20 - so and now
15:22 - it will show
15:26 - and it will reset the timer
15:34 - and now it will
15:36 - repeat 30 times
15:43 - move speed steps
15:50 - speed steps
15:51 - and
15:53 - so it's a random amount of steps it will
15:55 - move so we just put 0.1 to 3 so it'll
15:58 - move speed steps so it'll be just random
16:01 - and we have our change y
16:07 - by
16:10 - zero
16:13 - minus
16:15 - timer
16:21 - and now it will repeat another 30 so
16:26 - let's get that repeat another 30.
16:31 - set speed
16:36 - to
16:38 - speed
16:39 - time so you have a times reported times
16:41 - here and then put
16:43 - set
16:44 - speed to
16:46 - speed
16:49 - times 0.9
16:55 - so
16:56 - since you throw the firework and it goes
16:59 - fast fast and then slow it's because you
17:02 - have to the times just by 0.9 because
17:05 - anything times a decimal will make it
17:08 - smaller so that'll be a smaller value so
17:11 - it will go slower so go fast and then
17:14 - it'll go slow so that's the point of
17:16 - this piece
17:18 - and then it'll move speed steps we
17:20 - already have that over here
17:24 - move speed steps and i'll change ghost
17:27 - effect
17:31 - put that inside there
17:32 - chain ghost effect uh
17:35 - so it just fades away for extra effect
17:37 - so it will just fade away and i'll pick
17:40 - random one two
17:42 - three
17:43 - and it'll hide and it'll erase all
17:46 - it'll just repeat after that so
17:49 - hide and erase all
17:52 - so that's our code so let's make sure we
17:56 - got all this code and i know that's a
17:57 - really big script so i'm just going to
18:00 - try to make sure so feel free to pause
18:03 - and see if you got everything done
18:07 - so yeah
18:08 - so uh
18:09 - and we just tested out the game it was
18:12 - all wrong so we had to do something and
18:14 - we just found out that the speed is only
18:16 - for this sprite only so
18:19 - it's only for the sparkles so i'm going
18:22 - to rename this
18:25 - speed 2 so we know which one's speed and
18:27 - which one's the real speed so
18:30 - let's make a new variable called speed
18:32 - and for this sprite only not for all
18:35 - sprites this is a private variable so
18:37 - for this right only
18:39 - and then
18:40 - so the reason for this is that if you
18:43 - throw a firecracker and
18:45 - all the sparkles will move differently
18:47 - so let's replace all the speeds with
18:50 - speed twos with speed so speed
18:54 - uh do we have any more
18:57 - speed to instead put speed in
19:03 - so let's replace this
19:06 - with speed
19:07 - and set this to speed
19:10 - and then one more and there we go so now
19:15 - i think the
19:18 - the sparkles will move correctly so
19:20 - we got all the speeds and now i'm going
19:22 - to delete speed 2
19:26 - so now it's gone and
19:29 - let's do this so
19:30 - okay so let's try this
19:34 - so you have the thing you throw
19:38 - so
19:39 - uh we just i just found out that my dot
19:42 - is just a little bit too big for the
19:44 - other one so that's why it's making it
19:48 - so i'm just gonna shrink this a little
19:49 - bit
19:51 - hopefully i think that's big enough
19:53 - so let's just try one more time
19:57 - okay so
19:59 - yeah let's try it
20:03 - yeah it's still a little bit too big
20:05 - delicious
20:08 - yeah there we go hopefully this is big
20:10 - enough now
20:15 - so now let's move on to the happy
20:18 - new
20:19 - and year 2022
20:21 - so this is really easy code so let's
20:24 - just finish this wrap this up real quick
20:26 - so when the green flag is clicked
20:28 - he'll hide
20:31 - and clear graphic effects
20:34 - and it will point in direction 90
20:40 - and it will go to x
20:42 - so it will be all the way back 400
20:46 - why uh 139
20:49 - doesn't really matter and when i receive
20:55 - happy new year
20:57 - then i will show
21:02 - and it will glide one second
21:06 - to
21:08 - negative 102 y this is already the right
21:10 - coordinates because it'll just glide
21:12 - like whoo
21:13 - and then it will broadcast move new
21:16 - which will move the
21:18 - new sprite
21:19 - then yeah the new sprite so let's just
21:21 - click right move new
21:24 - and then it will go forever
21:27 - and change color effect by 1.
21:32 - just perfect
21:33 - and now we move to new
21:37 - so on new when the green flag is clicked
21:40 - it will clear graphic effects
21:45 - will hide
21:48 - it'll point in direction 90
21:52 - it'll go to
21:53 - x400
21:56 - why
21:58 - yeah 142 that's fine and
22:01 - when i receive
22:03 - move new
22:06 - it will wait one second
22:10 - and it will show
22:14 - and it will glide one second
22:18 - to the position it's already at because
22:21 - that's where we want the new to be and
22:22 - i'll broadcast move here and this will
22:25 - trigger
22:26 - year so broadcast
22:29 - move
22:32 - here
22:35 - and then it will go forever
22:37 - and change color effect by one
22:43 - now let's move to year
22:45 - so we have to go to here now so
22:50 - when the green flag is clicked it will
22:52 - clear graphic effects
22:55 - it will hide
23:00 - and it will
23:02 - go to x 400 so it's all the way in the
23:06 - back
23:07 - why 72 ish it's fine and
23:11 - i'm gonna go to
23:13 - back to here and just try to
23:15 - do that and just change it up real quick
23:17 - so when i receive move year
23:20 - then it will wait one second show glide
23:22 - one second to a different position so
23:25 - let's just drag in the position
23:27 - is gliding to now where's the light
23:30 - there we go and no broadcast instead of
23:32 - move year
23:34 - you'll have to broadcast
23:36 - move 2022
23:40 - and we have to go to 2022 now and i'm
23:43 - just going to drag this across because i
23:45 - think we just need to do some tweaking
23:47 - and that'll be all good so let's go to
23:49 - 2022
23:50 - and clear graphic effects hide and
23:53 - instead
23:54 - yeah go to
23:55 - and then when i receive
23:57 - move
23:58 - move 2022 and it'll wait one second show
24:02 - glide
24:03 - one second to a new position
24:08 - should be about the same oh and it won't
24:10 - broadcast this time because that's the
24:12 - last one so this is our project let's
24:14 - just hide the variables real quick
24:17 - and let's get let's try it
24:22 - so yeah we just have to hide speed so
24:24 - let's uh
24:25 - open this and let's see
24:28 - so you click on the firecracker you
24:30 - light it you throw it and it explodes so
24:33 - you have to do that
24:35 - uh sometimes
24:38 - [Music]
24:48 - new
24:50 - year
24:51 - 2022 and they're all
24:53 - in different colors so
24:56 - yeah
24:57 - here we have it
24:58 - make speed for this sprite only instead
25:00 - of making a public variable so
25:02 - please just do that and yeah i'll see
25:04 - you guys next please like share
25:06 - subscribe and comment in the comment
25:07 - section below and see you guys next time

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's kids on playground here and today we're back from another video in scratch and today we'll be making a 2022 new year's game so let's see how this goes so click on the firecracker you make it move so here it's moving and you have to touch the match to light it and then you throw the firecracker anywhere you want by clicking and if you do it five times something special will come up so let's do that five times see as you can see it says happy new year 2022 so here we have and that's the special thing that comes up so today we'll be coding this on scratch so let's go okay before i begin please like share subscribe because it turns out most of our viewers are not subscribed so please subscribe and do us a favor so let's the first thing we should do is rename our project to happy new year 2022 and of course we never need the cat and our backdrop will always be our night city and our i have everything in the backpack so just come to my project and export the sprites if you uh just come in and export the sprites that you might want to we actually drew these all by ourselves so you see we have our match for our firecracker we have our happy and then we have our new and then we have our year and then we have our 2022 so um to make this you just have to uh get the h just get like the h and then choose a costume go to the letters and then get an a and ctrl c and then ctrl v and then add it to the place you want and after that delete the costume so just do that for to make happy new year and 2022 it might take a while but you can always come to my project on gumball098 and export the pro sprites from there so yeah we have that and um yeah so so i'm going to draw the sparkle sprite so best for our firecrackers so let's just draw that right now just a very small green dot so let's just zoom in a little bit yeah hold down shift and we have our sparkle i think we need that to be a little bigger that should be decent size i'm pretty sure okay yeah i think that should be fine and now let's work on the code so match has no code actually so we have a little head start over there and now we go straight to the firecracker so let's do the firecracker so let's go so when the green flag is clicked we will so i'm going to show you how i drew the match so let's look at let's take a quick look if you do want to draw your own match so let's see so so the fire is this orange thing and the outline is a darker orange and you just use the reshape tool to reshape the edges to make some sort of fire shape and that's the same applies for the uh the inside fire like the inner part the second layer and we have our match thing it's burnt so it's the black thing and this we can ungroup this real quick so and we have one uh brown piece of wood and one lighter brown piece of wood so that's for our match right so if you do want to draw that on your own here is a quick little small kind of tutorial to show you so and i'm also going to rename my sparkle sprite yeah i'm gonna move that over here so let's go back to the firecracker and let's show you how to draw both sprites so for the regular one all we have to do is uh take this orange sort of rectangle and reshape the outside and the edges out and we have this uh yellowish type of circle that we put over there and we have the part on the top with the little lighter part okay and that's for our first sprite and our second sprite is this one and let's it's just the same one duplicate this one if you do want to draw this and uh just kind of use lines to shape the edges like a line line line line line line and just shape the edges and then fill it in and that's how you make your sprite so we are done here off you might know how to make the sparkles but if you don't just come to my project and export it so let's go back to firecracker so when the green flag is clicked we make a new variable called counter placement counter the second thing we're gonna put since we just made our variable counter is set counter to zero because you have to make it five or more so we have that over there and now we'll set the size to a hundred and um it will go to the position marked and a point in direction 90. so yeah okay we also have to switch the custom plus we want all right and now i'll point direction 90 and delete this clone so now yeah and when i start as a no when this sprite is clicked it'll make a clone of itself because you click on the sprite and it'll make a clone so let's create a clone of myself and now when i start as a clone it will repeat until touching match because it will keep on following your mouse so repeat untouched until touching the match and it will go to mouse pointer because it'll follow your mouse pointer until it touches the match and it'll wait until now it's down so that's when you uh fire so no no that's when you click on the firecracker my bad and it will wait until now it's down let me put that under and now we will repeat ten times uh change size by minus five that just gives effect to make it smaller and smaller and smaller so change size by minus five and then we have if then statement if then statement and then you put an or so it's five or more so we put five the counter is greater to or equal to so the counter has to be e greater than five or equal uh and it'll broadcast happy new year so we still have some code to do here but it's very short so let's just finish this up real quick broadcast happy new year and now let's finish up the code so when i start as a clone it will go to the front layer so it's in front of the happy new year the match all that good stuff and it will show and set size to 100 and now it will point in direction 45 so it's a little bit tilted to give some kind of effect so 45 and now it will repeat until it's touching the match you know follow your mouse pointer so so go to mouse player let's just move that a little bit and go to mouse pointer and then switch costume to costume 2. so switch costume to costume 2. and now it will start sound poising so let's get oh it's already here oh that's probably because i put in the backpack but that's fine so it should be inside the sound thing so start sound toysing and it will wait until now it's down and now it will set a new variable x because it has to follow your mouse so set x set and y yeah but yeah so y and so set x to mouse x so that's just one of these and then duplicate that set y to mouse y so it will follow your mouse and now it will glide 0.5 seconds to where you have clicked to shoot oh yeah not this one sorry uh glide 0.5 seconds to mouse pointer and now it would change counter by one because you shot one firework so it would change the counter and when it gets to five it'll do the amazing happy new year thing so so change counter by one and then hide and then it will broadcast so yeah let's see if it works so let's see if it works it works but we just don't have the sparkle effect yet so let's zoom out so then you can see out the code feel free to pause here so feel free to pause and suck in all this code so just in case if you did uh if you missed some so now let's go to the sparkles and work on the sparkles so when the green flag is clicked it will erase all so by the way if you do not know there's this button called ad extension there's music pen video sensing all of these and we just click pen and we already have it here because it was from a backpack so it will erase all because in the beginning you always have to erase all the graphic effects that you made earlier and then it will hide and it'll wait one second and it will go to the front layer and after that i'll repeat 200 times to give effect and it will create a clone of myself so just make a bunch of effects uh some little sparkles some that's just very cool for some effect and now when i receive bang it will start the sound gong which we don't have yet so let's just get that yep this is a gong and it'll start on gong and you'll repeat 100 times for effect and it'll change color effect by two so just some effect added to the sparkles so and then when i receive bang it will set color so this is also for effects so there's a lot of effects that we could use to make this improve so set color effect to pick random negative 100 to positive 100 so there's a bunch of colors that the scratch the the thing makes there's a lot of colors to pick from so now let's when i receive bang it will it will set speed we have to make a new variable speed as always so it'll set speed to pick random 0.1 to three to give more effect and it'll set ghost effect to zero so this is just a bunch of effects we could use and set ghost effect to zero and it will change color effect by 25. and now it will set the pen color so this is just a bunch of set the pen color to a pick random of 50 to 500 so there's a bunch of colors that we could pick from here 50 to 500 and now pen up and it will go to x and then you put an x inside the x and you'll go to y y that's where you i'll put your mouse and you explode the thing so that's exactly where the sparkles are going to be so now um we'll put pen down to draw it yes pin down and now we will point in direction uh point in direction pick in a point in direction negative 180 pick random so pick random negative 180 to positive 180 so there's different directions and it'll explode in different directions with this piece of code so and now it will show and it will reset the timer and now it will repeat 30 times move speed steps speed steps and so it's a random amount of steps it will move so we just put 0.1 to 3 so it'll move speed steps so it'll be just random and we have our change y by zero minus timer and now it will repeat another 30 so let's get that repeat another 30. set speed to speed time so you have a times reported times here and then put set speed to speed times 0.9 so since you throw the firework and it goes fast fast and then slow it's because you have to the times just by 0.9 because anything times a decimal will make it smaller so that'll be a smaller value so it will go slower so go fast and then it'll go slow so that's the point of this piece and then it'll move speed steps we already have that over here move speed steps and i'll change ghost effect put that inside there chain ghost effect uh so it just fades away for extra effect so it will just fade away and i'll pick random one two three and it'll hide and it'll erase all it'll just repeat after that so hide and erase all so that's our code so let's make sure we got all this code and i know that's a really big script so i'm just going to try to make sure so feel free to pause and see if you got everything done so yeah so uh and we just tested out the game it was all wrong so we had to do something and we just found out that the speed is only for this sprite only so it's only for the sparkles so i'm going to rename this speed 2 so we know which one's speed and which one's the real speed so let's make a new variable called speed and for this sprite only not for all sprites this is a private variable so for this right only and then so the reason for this is that if you throw a firecracker and all the sparkles will move differently so let's replace all the speeds with speed twos with speed so speed uh do we have any more speed to instead put speed in so let's replace this with speed and set this to speed and then one more and there we go so now i think the the sparkles will move correctly so we got all the speeds and now i'm going to delete speed 2 so now it's gone and let's do this so okay so let's try this so you have the thing you throw so uh we just i just found out that my dot is just a little bit too big for the other one so that's why it's making it so i'm just gonna shrink this a little bit hopefully i think that's big enough so let's just try one more time okay so yeah let's try it yeah it's still a little bit too big delicious yeah there we go hopefully this is big enough now so now let's move on to the happy new and year 2022 so this is really easy code so let's just finish this wrap this up real quick so when the green flag is clicked he'll hide and clear graphic effects and it will point in direction 90 and it will go to x so it will be all the way back 400 why uh 139 doesn't really matter and when i receive happy new year then i will show and it will glide one second to negative 102 y this is already the right coordinates because it'll just glide like whoo and then it will broadcast move new which will move the new sprite then yeah the new sprite so let's just click right move new and then it will go forever and change color effect by 1. just perfect and now we move to new so on new when the green flag is clicked it will clear graphic effects will hide it'll point in direction 90 it'll go to x400 why yeah 142 that's fine and when i receive move new it will wait one second and it will show and it will glide one second to the position it's already at because that's where we want the new to be and i'll broadcast move here and this will trigger year so broadcast move here and then it will go forever and change color effect by one now let's move to year so we have to go to here now so when the green flag is clicked it will clear graphic effects it will hide and it will go to x 400 so it's all the way in the back why 72 ish it's fine and i'm gonna go to back to here and just try to do that and just change it up real quick so when i receive move year then it will wait one second show glide one second to a different position so let's just drag in the position is gliding to now where's the light there we go and no broadcast instead of move year you'll have to broadcast move 2022 and we have to go to 2022 now and i'm just going to drag this across because i think we just need to do some tweaking and that'll be all good so let's go to 2022 and clear graphic effects hide and instead yeah go to and then when i receive move move 2022 and it'll wait one second show glide one second to a new position should be about the same oh and it won't broadcast this time because that's the last one so this is our project let's just hide the variables real quick and let's get let's try it so yeah we just have to hide speed so let's uh open this and let's see so you click on the firecracker you light it you throw it and it explodes so you have to do that uh sometimes new year 2022 and they're all in different colors so yeah here we have it make speed for this sprite only instead of making a public variable so please just do that and yeah i'll see you guys next please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below and see you guys next time you
