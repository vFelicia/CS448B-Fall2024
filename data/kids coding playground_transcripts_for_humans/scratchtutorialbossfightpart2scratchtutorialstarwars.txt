00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - so welcome back guys to the channel so
00:09 - this is in the second part for the boss
00:12 - fight game so as you can see from the
00:15 - last video we have all this code done so
00:18 - I'll let you guys look through the code
00:22 - for a little bit I just dragged through
00:24 - just copy down any code you did not do
00:27 - yet so right here this is the movement
00:30 - the left and right arrow keys and see
00:32 - jump jumping and this is the starting
00:37 - okay I hope you guys have all that done
00:41 - so today we'll be working on the attacks
00:44 - the costumes for the saber spin saber
00:47 - throw in the force attack so don't get
00:51 - another one flat legs here wait one
00:55 - second just to give it a little slight
00:57 - pause get a furfle do you get if then
01:03 - statement this is to broadcast and the
01:05 - saber Spencer will attack if then key
01:07 - one key one twist press the firt one
01:11 - button the number one button on the
01:16 - keyboard is pressed then hide and we can
01:23 - broadcast a message broadcast and wait
01:26 - called one so then the saber spin cat
01:35 - will receive the message so let's save
01:39 - your spit we'll need a wouldn't go when
01:44 - I receive the one thereof she'll show
01:50 - repeat 36 times repeat 36 times this is
01:56 - to make the full spin to concede these
01:59 - costumes they took let's look at
02:02 - spinning 36 times which means I'll go 3
02:07 - times around 36 times next costume
02:14 - it's costume hide and we can broadcast a
02:19 - new message called show one this is to
02:23 - broadcast back to the back to the cat
02:29 - itself so we'll broadcast the show one
02:32 - back to the cat but first we made it
02:34 - work on the code for them saber
02:36 - so when Lina one flat clicks here look
02:39 - like legs hide hide forever go to cat in
02:47 - porn boots dark I hope this will make
02:48 - sense to you guys
02:49 - so this all just goes to the cat sprite
02:53 - and point towards the boss point towards
02:59 - boss the boss and when clicks and flag
03:10 - clicks forever forever if then touching
03:17 - the boss touching the boss so if it's
03:22 - touching the boss then we'll change the
03:24 - boss HP by negative 400 you can make it
03:29 - any damage you want I'm just going to
03:32 - stick with 100 and wait one second so we
03:35 - have to have a slight pause before they
03:37 - can use the attack again
03:38 - and when this receives one then we can
03:41 - play a sound I'm a sound engineer called
03:45 - spin play spin it sound spin until done
03:49 - so this is a cat so from last video we
03:53 - have the movement dog back so now we
03:55 - have this saber spin ready but it's not
03:58 - completely done and as you can see it
04:01 - hit it because we have the hyper here so
04:04 - when you broadcast it back to the cat so
04:07 - the cat has to receive the show one so
04:12 - as you see we still have this
04:13 - broadcasting one so I want to receive
04:14 - show one but when we got from the arm we
04:20 - got I got the show one from the saber
04:22 - spin broadcast here we can go to saber
04:26 - spin
04:28 - so go to saber spin and show so show
04:35 - back so when you play it so now we have
04:52 - the sabers now ready
04:54 - she is pretty effective the spinning and
04:58 - we still have the ring we can do to make
05:01 - it a shield so um so what the ring is
05:05 - it's supposed to like protect when it
05:07 - spins the saber the Rings was a circle
05:09 - it to protect it from the fireballs
05:11 - coming from the goal so we need to save
05:13 - her spin um it it can also act like a
05:16 - shield so the ring is kind of like a
05:18 - shoe so we can get on flat clicks
05:21 - they're all graphic effects hide in the
05:27 - beginning forever get it forever loop
05:32 - change fish eye effect so just get the
05:36 - color thing it should be the fish eye
05:38 - effect right here fish your eye effect
05:40 - by 50 as you just make it look better
05:43 - you know
05:44 - wait 0.01 seconds you can just duplicate
05:50 - this a couple of times
05:55 - there you go to placate it like that and
05:59 - one flight wait forever forever loop go
06:05 - to cat and point towards boss go to cat
06:09 - so just go to the yeah
06:12 - and I'll always point towards the boss
06:17 - boss
06:23 - and when this receives one is his show
06:26 - so I can show when use the one attack
06:29 - you receive one then show and when this
06:34 - receives show one then it should hide
06:36 - because show one means the Sabre spin is
06:40 - over so it just becomes the regular cat
06:43 - again so I'm just brought Lucy you show
06:46 - one then hot so when we play it there's
06:53 - a little ring around it
07:01 - actually we can turn about them if they
07:04 - make this negative fifty sorry for that
07:07 - so be more visible knots more visible
07:13 - once you see it and when you're doing it
07:18 - the boss cannot be better effect you
07:20 - within the shield ring shield so next we
07:31 - want to work on the Sabre throw so saber
07:35 - throne will just go back to the cat
07:36 - again an if-then statement if then key
07:42 - to is pressed you know the - he - is
07:51 - pressed then hide hide and broadcast to
07:57 - broadcast and wait - you can make a new
08:00 - message called - so we broadcast this to
08:06 - the Sabre throat so for the safer throw
08:10 - just get on one plot clicks no actually
08:14 - we can just hit the - - so when it
08:20 - receives - it will show and one flag
08:25 - clicked hide in the beginning forever
08:32 - also you have to go to the cat and point
08:35 - towards the boss go to can point towards
08:39 - boss boss
08:43 - and show to is just to hide it again so
08:48 - it will become the cat itself again so
08:50 - when they make a new message I think
08:54 - they have any do we broadcast show too
08:57 - so we have not broadcasted show too so
09:01 - we cannot do that yet as I check through
09:03 - here so next let's work on the throne
09:07 - saber so this is the saber that's gonna
09:09 - be thrown like the same err so when it
09:14 - pressed - it'll throw the saber so when
09:16 - it receives the message to saber and
09:20 - place am throne Savior and Tilton I have
09:24 - a sound coach saber through it sounds
09:26 - like that and when flat clicked what it
09:31 - forever if then touchy dark touching the
09:38 - boss I was call it's are some reason
09:42 - boss then change HP by negative 100 you
09:45 - can make it any HP but I'm just gonna do
09:48 - negative 100 you can do anything and
09:51 - wait one second so they can't just keep
09:54 - on spamming the move because that would
09:56 - be kind of cheap
09:57 - so when flike like to in hiding
09:59 - beginning Sabre hide so we'll have more
10:04 - some more code for the Sabre so when it
10:07 - receives to the message - - then oh go
10:13 - to cat go to the cat point towards the
10:20 - boss all the time so no matter what side
10:25 - you're on does light saber I'll always
10:26 - point towards the boss switch costume
10:29 - the Sabre one so we have this is just
10:32 - explosion to me but when it impacts with
10:35 - the boss I'll explode so in the
10:37 - beginning we want to set the costume to
10:40 - the first costume save the one go to the
10:44 - front layer
10:46 - so then it will be in front of the boss
10:49 - gonna front layer and show weight 0.2
10:55 - seconds give it a little pause oops 0.2
11:04 - seconds and I'm glide 0.5 seconds lied
11:12 - 0.5 seconds in the x and y position of
11:15 - the boss so we'll want to get to
11:17 - sentencing this block and you always
11:21 - want to get this one first because you
11:23 - will not be able to select it here so
11:25 - always get here go to here boss
11:27 - exposition or boss and we'll need to get
11:31 - the Y position of the boss so glad 0.5
11:37 - seconds to the X in my position in the
11:38 - boss that makes perfect sense
11:41 - we'll need an if-then statement so if
11:45 - it's touching the dark the boss boss its
11:51 - touching the boss then switch costumes a
11:54 - saber - this is the explosion remember
11:57 - explosion if it touches the box so just
12:00 - costume saber - waiting 0.1 seconds
12:06 - that's which cost him again - saber 3
12:12 - saber 3 and then we do it again for
12:20 - saber 4 so it look like it's exploding
12:22 - so cool better so that's what I have and
12:28 - then high when it comes in contact then
12:31 - we broadcast a message called show - so
12:37 - we broadcast it here show - okay
12:45 - it's actually supposed to be an if-else
12:47 - statement sorry wrong one so if you're
12:52 - starting the boss then do this else
12:54 - waiting 0.3 seconds so if it's plotting
12:57 - the egg
12:58 - anything else and hye-jin hind and their
13:02 - broadcast show - ah mr. Coad so if
13:11 - it's touching anything besides the boss
13:13 - then it will do this that but if it's
13:17 - touching the boss then I'll call this so
13:20 - now we have the show - ready we go -
13:23 - back to the cat so let's go back to the
13:28 - cat so we don't receive show - when I
13:34 - receive show - then go to Sabre throw go
13:44 - to Sabre thrown and then show when we
13:54 - play it and press - so always pointing
13:59 - direction of the boss not see so that's
14:13 - all we have for now
14:15 - now let's finally let's work on the
14:18 - force attack so force attack we'll need
14:22 - it if then statement and the cat if then
14:26 - he number three is press key three is
14:35 - pressed then hide and broadcast three
14:41 - and lay it this message I'm gonna see
14:46 - three and wait okay so let's go to the
14:50 - force attacked or die receive three then
14:57 - go to cat so always go to the cat point
15:03 - towards the dart which is the boss
15:05 - always point towards the boss clear
15:08 - graphic effects because we'll need to
15:09 - change the brightness and
15:11 - those defects I think go to the front
15:14 - layer show and repeat five times repeat
15:24 - five times is just to make the ghost
15:27 - effect to make it fade in and fade out
15:29 - change ghost effect by 25 ghost thank my
15:36 - 25 point one seconds
15:38 - wait 0.1 seconds you can just duplicate
15:43 - this like that so we have that when I
15:51 - received three will need another one
15:56 - place I'm forced so aside for sense at
15:59 - this awesome we want to play it until
16:03 - done hide will broadcast a message whole
16:08 - show three which will go back to the cat
16:15 - so show three one click you always want
16:19 - to hide this so yeah finally we'll go up
16:24 - back to the cat just cat so when I
16:29 - receive show three then go to force
16:38 - attack and then we hide then show sorry
16:48 - can you show
16:56 - so we have the force attack so it seems
17:00 - I have made a mistake and I fixed it so
17:02 - right here remember I did the I did the
17:07 - go to boss
17:08 - so that was wrong with me so instead
17:10 - should be point towards boss and I
17:13 - forgot to put the negative sign for
17:15 - these so come back so now it will
17:19 - actually work see now it works fine
17:23 - you got all sorts gone so that's all we
17:31 - have for right now so that's all we have
17:35 - for note right now so thank you guys for
