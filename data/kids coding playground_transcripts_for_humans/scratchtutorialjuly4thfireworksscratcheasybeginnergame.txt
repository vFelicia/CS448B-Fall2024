00:07 - hey guys with kids coding playground
00:09 - here and today we're back for another
00:11 - video since tomorrow is July 4th we will
00:14 - be making a firework display in scratch
00:16 - the player can click anywhere on the
00:18 - screen and a rocket shoot up in the sky
00:20 - and explode into a nice firework display
00:22 - you can find this game idea in the book
00:25 - called coding projects and stress you
00:28 - check out that book that's pretty cool
00:30 - - you know so check out the really cool
00:32 - games so July 4th fireworks we're gonna
00:35 - be learning these following concepts in
00:36 - scratch broadcasting messages customs
00:39 - rights timer loops color effects and
00:42 - variable for this sprite only so I'm
00:50 - going to show you the demo for the game
00:51 - let's make the floor larger and you can
00:55 - see you start out with um oh we threw
01:00 - this backdrop and we also drew the
01:02 - rocket and it has like a this shoots out
01:06 - and it has a bunch of colors
01:08 - [Music]

01:55 - can choose your backdrop you can choose
01:58 - your backdrop you can do like a cine
02:01 - backdrop like yeah these backdrops are a
02:05 - lot we drew one right here so as you can
02:16 - see there it is we drew this one so you
02:20 - can also find some fireworks um there's
02:24 - some Google searches and fireworks you
02:25 - can look at their PNG as you can see
02:27 - right here there's a bunch of you can
02:30 - search up rocket firework PNG there's a
02:33 - bunch of things you can use and you can
02:35 - click on the tools button you can click
02:37 - on transparent so to show you all the
02:40 - transparent uh fireworks that are extra
02:43 - transparent because some are not friends
02:45 - parent so anyways um let's get back to
02:49 - the game we can just rename this first
02:51 - to July or and we lose all let's take
03:03 - all my all my stuff let's open the
03:05 - backpack so I have I already have a
03:08 - sprite I redrew this sprite the rocket
03:12 - sprite and we also have to make this
03:15 - Sparkle sprite I already have one we can
03:20 - paint one so I'm gonna paint uh I'm
03:25 - gonna paint one show you a demonstration
03:28 - as using you can use any color you want
03:32 - but I'm gonna use green so let's look oh
03:36 - that's the same color as
03:38 - normally you guys are the outline off
03:41 - and then you're gonna use a circle and
03:44 - then try to make a 5x5 cuz the sparkle
03:48 - is 5 by 5 2 and you can zoom in you can
03:52 - make it smaller or bigger with the as
03:56 - you can see it's 13 10 by 14 so you have
03:59 - to make it 5 by 5 so as you can see you
04:02 - can use the mouse tool make it smaller
04:11 - it's about nine to nine by nine seven by
04:21 - seven six five six five by five as you
04:30 - can see we already have one up I already
04:33 - have one in my backpack I'm actually
04:38 - gonna use this sprite name it sparkles
04:42 - you can delete this one so I'm gonna use
04:46 - this one
04:48 - cool so we gotta make a bitter bowl and
04:54 - we have to call it speed you gotta click
04:59 - for this sprite only not for all sprites
05:02 - like you would normally do but for this
05:04 - sprite so we are we have our speed speed
05:08 - variable so so we're gonna so as you can
05:18 - see when when you shoot the firework
05:21 - there's just going to be like a glow for
05:25 - like a flash for like but for like a
05:29 - point one seconds so as you can see you
05:32 - can name that two flash can rename it so
05:40 - I'm gonna work on this sparkle sprite
05:43 - first so as you can see the sparkle
05:46 - sprite when it starts
05:49 - I'll always hide
05:52 - always hide beginning it will repeat 300
06:05 - times it'll create three hundred clones
06:09 - of itself and then a broadcast so we
06:24 - have to work on the rocket the rocket
06:25 - doesn't have that much code so when I
06:28 - receive ready it'll go forever it will
06:39 - wait until wait until the mouse is down
06:45 - so wherever your mouse is it will go
06:47 - through your mouse mouse is down so I
06:50 - know it goes whoo let's take that
06:55 - so negative 180s all the way in the
06:58 - bottom so if lie to your mouse or else
07:00 - if your new mouse of Y or the Y it'll
07:03 - spawn right where your mouse is so we've
07:06 - to do Mouse X though show I'll play
07:15 - sound anytime you want I'm gonna play
07:16 - the sound I already have it I'll play
07:26 - this down go you'll glide to your own
07:34 - wherever your mouse is look like one
07:37 - second like one second - it's your mouse
07:43 - X no sex and that's why and knit will
07:54 - high it will broadcast a new message
08:00 - cold
08:03 - bang screw this we also have to remember
08:10 - background visit the flash so when I
08:13 - received bang will switch the backdrop
08:17 - to flash for 0.1 seconds so it needs ear
08:21 - 0.1 seconds
08:24 - so if switch the backdrop to flat for
08:27 - 0.1 seconds it will switch back to the
08:29 - night the backdrop as you can see we do
08:38 - the sparkles gonna make it even cooler
08:46 - so the sparkles so when I receive this
08:52 - is for us when I receive bang um I'll
09:02 - set the speed to pick random 0.12 food
09:16 - so it will pick random how fast the
09:19 - final action that will set ghosts those
09:26 - receptors so goose effect to zero so you
09:33 - can't see it then you need a pen so you
09:37 - got there's some extra blocks you could
09:39 - take like video sentencing Texas Beach
09:40 - translate so a bunch of things you can
09:42 - take but you need pen for this one and
09:46 - you to put the pen at your side put it
09:50 - let's take the pen off right here so you
09:53 - can change the color effect 225 to make
09:56 - it like a glow I know put pan up and
10:03 - then you gotta go to the rocket rocket
10:10 - you know the pen down
10:15 - like it would draw like the lines so you
10:19 - need point indirection no pick random
10:25 - from negative 180 to positive 1 and so
10:46 - again well reset the time where you need
10:49 - the time to make like it looks better so
10:52 - you need to reset timer right here cuz
10:56 - it's always going as you can see if you
10:57 - if I turn on the timer it's always going
11:00 - so I've been playing this for 160
11:02 - seconds so the timer is always there so
11:07 - I gotta reset the timer each time you
11:09 - shoot up the rocket so repeat 50 times
11:17 - repeat 50 times and it will move speed
11:22 - steps so how quick could be it would
11:29 - change the Y by you need - speed not
11:43 - speed 0 you presume right here and by
11:49 - since a timer so you need another repeat
11:58 - 15 me another 150 also has to move speed
12:06 - steps and this repeat 50 is to make the
12:11 - sparkles slow down and disappear so
12:14 - it'll also change the ghost effect it
12:20 - also need a set speed in front the move
12:24 - speed steps
12:26 - speed to divide and I'm multiply speed
12:41 - by you go change the ghost effect first
12:53 - effect I read one day three so it will
13:04 - disappear or it will like fade so that
13:09 - if it does not fade away it will hide
13:13 - and erase everything sure that's a
13:17 - show/hide and erase oh so we're not done
13:25 - with the sparkle sprite yet so let's
13:29 - shred up your that
13:34 - [Music]
13:41 - as you can see that pirate doesn't have
13:44 - that much color as usual so let's take
13:48 - out the speed thing
13:50 - so when I receive Bank when I receive
13:56 - bang that will repeat a hundred times
14:03 - hundred times and it will change the
14:07 - color effect by two so let's see let's
14:20 - see you nut
14:21 - so with this has a little bit more color
14:24 - as you can see it's like as you can see
14:28 - it's like making more color than usual
14:30 - as you can see like the sparkles right
14:32 - here are changing color but that's not
14:34 - enough color
14:34 - we can also add when I receive Bang it
14:41 - will set the color effect to kick random
14:52 - negative 100 200 so as all this column
15:04 - around here
15:06 - so I please like share and subscribe
15:11 - like I told you earlier and put in the
15:13 - comment section what you want to see
15:15 - next have a great day everyone and we're
15:19 - done for the day and happy July 4th
15:22 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys with kids coding playground here and today we're back for another video since tomorrow is July 4th we will be making a firework display in scratch the player can click anywhere on the screen and a rocket shoot up in the sky and explode into a nice firework display you can find this game idea in the book called coding projects and stress you check out that book that's pretty cool you know so check out the really cool games so July 4th fireworks we're gonna be learning these following concepts in scratch broadcasting messages customs rights timer loops color effects and variable for this sprite only so I'm going to show you the demo for the game let's make the floor larger and you can see you start out with um oh we threw this backdrop and we also drew the rocket and it has like

name it sparkles you can delete this one so I'm gonna use this one cool so we gotta make a bitter bowl and we have to call it speed you gotta click for this sprite only not for all sprites like you would normally do but for this sprite so we are we have our speed speed variable so so we're gonna so as you can see when when you shoot the firework there's just going to be like a glow for like a flash for like but for like a point one seconds so as you can see you can name that two flash can rename it so I'm gonna work on this sparkle sprite first so as you can see the sparkle sprite when it
