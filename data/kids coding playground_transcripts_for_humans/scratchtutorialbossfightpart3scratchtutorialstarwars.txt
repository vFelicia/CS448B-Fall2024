00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:08 - kids coding click run today we'll be
00:11 - doing the last part of this video boss
00:14 - fight so in the last video we worked on
00:17 - the force attack the thrown saber the
00:20 - saber throw ring and the saber spin so
00:24 - I'll be going through these so like you
00:27 - guys see if you haven't are you if
00:30 - you're done with it so this is a code
00:34 - for the saber spin it's pretty simple
00:39 - ring this is the ring the ring saber
00:48 - throat pretty simple throne saber
00:55 - please don't say bird correct them see
01:02 - the code so this is throwing saber and
01:07 - force attack so I will be finishing up
01:13 - the force attack since we aren't done
01:15 - with it so we'll get one flat clicked if
01:20 - then touching the dart boss then
01:24 - touching the boss boss then we can
01:29 - change boss HP by negative 100 by
01:35 - negative 400 then we wait one second so
01:40 - you hit just give us painting the move
01:43 - next we'll want to get another one flag
01:45 - clicked forever repeat until repeat
01:55 - until Y position is equal to negative 60
02:00 - so this will automatically drop drop the
02:04 - cab if it's in the air and uses the
02:07 - force attack then we will automatically
02:10 - go down for our positions
02:12 - the negative 60 change Y by negative 10
02:16 - so this will keep on going down if you
02:19 - use the force attack in midair so as you
02:24 - can see her down so that's it for old
02:40 - attacks we are done with all the attacks
02:42 - now we're gonna have to work on the HP
02:44 - bars the fireball and the boss so let's
02:49 - work on the cat HP so this this is my
02:55 - cat age feed this thing this it's for
02:59 - the cat if you just put in the cat room
03:02 - flag clicked get a wait one second
03:06 - this is quite simple forever if then if
03:14 - then you know or statement if then HP is
03:19 - equal to 0 or less than 0 and HP which
03:24 - is the cat HP is less than or equal to 0
03:32 - 0 0 then we can broadcast a message
03:37 - called game over we will need game over
03:41 - for the other sprite soon something
03:44 - sperm counts game so we broadcasted the
03:50 - game over and since we broadcasted game
03:52 - over we need to let all the sprites
03:55 - receive it so so for the Sabre spin
04:00 - attack if it's game over when I receive
04:04 - game over when I receive game over and
04:13 - hide
04:17 - give this to all the sprites so they
04:20 - will all hide one game over you don't
04:31 - you don't have to give it to the health
04:32 - and health box or the boss the boss HP
04:36 - because you can still show them to show
04:39 - how much health you have life and stuff
04:42 - so you can just give it to all the
04:45 - sprites up to the horse attack you don't
04:48 - have to do it for these then the
04:49 - fireball yeah that's pretty much it so
04:54 - let's go to the work on the health bar
04:58 - for the cat so first we can set the X&Y
05:04 - position for the health box
05:06 - so one clicks go to this exposition in Y
05:12 - position somewhere in the corner here
05:15 - and show they're getting so and then
05:20 - health health flour now work or open the
05:23 - hub bar so one flat clicks we want to go
05:28 - to this x and y position negative 141 y
05:31 - 30 somewhere right here and show in the
05:35 - beginning and forever we want to set the
05:41 - color fret to zero set the color back to
05:46 - zero and then set size to HP so what
05:50 - this does is set whatever size it is to
05:53 - the HP so if you're at 100 HP it will
05:56 - set to 100 sauce if you're at like 70 HP
05:59 - then all sets of send me sighs so you
06:02 - want to set the size to the HP to the HP
06:08 - how much it depends how much health you
06:10 - are all set to what size and if then get
06:15 - it if then statement if then HP is less
06:18 - than 21 so if the variable HP which is
06:25 - the if it's if the HP for the cat is
06:29 - than 21 then we can change the color
06:31 - effect by 1 to 170 so it will turn red
06:35 - so show that you're critical on health
06:38 - you're low on health understand the B
06:43 - there's a red color if then if then
06:49 - statement if then or statement if then
06:52 - HP this is the same as the cat if then
06:55 - HP is equal or less than zero so if the
07:00 - HP is less than or equal to zero then oh
07:02 - hi so just turn the HP hide so that's
07:10 - the health bar code next we can work on
07:13 - the boss health bar which is here boss
07:16 - help one flock clicks we want to set the
07:19 - costume to the first costume switch
07:23 - costume to dark one so as you can see
07:28 - when the boss loses health it'll just
07:31 - lose color so we want to set it to full
07:36 - health in the beginning so next we want
07:40 - to set the exposition to here and 180 y
07:44 - 140 set the size to 40%
07:47 - I think it's already at it but if you
07:50 - haven't then kept a block and set it to
07:52 - 40% forever loop if then we knit and
08:00 - statement if then boss HP is less than
08:07 - if boss HP is less than 2500 boss HP is
08:17 - less than 2500 and boss HP is greater
08:21 - than 2000
08:22 - so in between 2000 and 2500 boss HP is
08:29 - greater than 2000 then we'll switch
08:32 - costume to talk to so that note it
08:35 - notifies you that it loses a little bit
08:38 - help will tell you that he lost a pet
08:41 - help so you
08:43 - which costume too dark too then we can
08:48 - duplicate this you'll need to do this
08:51 - for until the time to 0 so if boss HP is
08:55 - less than 2000 and boss HP is greater
09:02 - than 2000 and less then 1 out greater
09:05 - than 1500 in less than two dozen sorry
09:07 - um then it will change costume - Dirk 3
09:12 - and so on so this is between 1500 and
09:16 - 2000 nail changes costume to the third
09:18 - costume this one so you see so you can
09:24 - just duplicate this change this so if
09:30 - the boss HP is less than 1500 and
09:35 - greater than 1000 then switch costume
09:40 - too dark for there should be 1000 and
09:45 - 500
09:48 - we can switch the Tarte 5 to placate
09:53 - this so if the boss is 500 great less
10:00 - than 500 HP or greater than zero so in
10:03 - between 0 and 500
10:05 - let's switch costume to talk 6 and
10:08 - finally we'll need it or stings right
10:10 - here instead of an ad because it's
10:15 - either or not both which is and so if
10:19 - boss HP is less than 0 or or equal to 0
10:24 - so we'll need to get an equal sign it's
10:28 - boss HP is less than or equal to 0 then
10:32 - you can change the costumes at dark 7
10:34 - which is the new HP and I think this has
10:40 - to go to the back later go to back
10:49 - see now it's good so now it's with that
10:54 - you can just put it up here probably
10:57 - forgot to put it C when you lose help
11:02 - the HP bar goes down so we're not done
11:09 - with the code for the less HP yet so
11:13 - we'll work on that soon
11:14 - so for the boss we'll need to add some
11:16 - code one flag let's go to this x and y
11:20 - position I've put down 170 and they give
11:27 - 30 that's my original clear graphic
11:30 - effects plus when you hit it it will
11:32 - also change color if you haven't done
11:34 - this yet set size to 65% in the
11:39 - beginning show one flag clicked set boss
11:44 - HP to 3,000 so but we'll have 3000 HP
11:50 - 3000 HP show variable boss HP and
11:55 - forever point towards cut cat forever
12:00 - point towards cat so I'll always look
12:04 - look at it I'll face it and one flat
12:07 - clicked wait one second forever glide
12:18 - pick random you want to do pick random
12:20 - 0.5 to 2 seconds two seconds to pick a
12:28 - random negative 85 to 170 for the X 170
12:38 - and we can just keep the Y as negative
12:39 - 30 wait one second wait we're glad
12:45 - randomly see if you I didn't it will
12:48 - glide randomly to random positions so so
12:53 - next we see the boss is losing it you
12:55 - know here's a one its luster
12:59 - I'm out of HP and you can put this like
13:02 - this so it's easier to read and when it
13:05 - loses HP the HP bar will slowly drain
13:09 - down this is me try to get a bit lower
13:14 - so see the difference see it's losing HP
13:18 - we haven't done it throwing a fireball
13:21 - and so we'll work on that next
13:23 - as you can see the HP is slowly ending
13:26 - so that's what we have for now we'll
13:31 - have more code for the boss when collect
13:36 - with black lights
13:38 - wait one second get a forever loop
13:42 - forever if then touching we need to or
13:50 - statements so if it's touching either
13:56 - the saber spin the throne saber so the
14:03 - throne saber right here for the force
14:08 - attack force attack right here yeah so
14:13 - we need to repeat 10 times change color
14:16 - effects so as I told you it will change
14:19 - color effect when it's getting hit
14:21 - change color effect by 25 and you can
14:23 - clear graphic effects after it's done
14:25 - and get another if-then statement I
14:30 - think this a little smaller so I can see
14:32 - the top if then boss HP is less than or
14:38 - equal to 0 less than or equal to 0 0
14:51 - boss HP is less than or equal to 0 then
14:56 - we can hide so that that means he's dead
14:59 - I'm looking broadcast a message help win
15:04 - make a new message
15:08 - so we'll need to give all the sprites um
15:12 - when it wins don't hide it so here when
15:17 - I receive win win then hide I'm gonna
15:23 - just give it to all the sprites I'm
15:41 - gonna have to give it to the HP bars
15:43 - give it to the boss and I don't remember
15:50 - putting the virus Eve game over so let
15:54 - me hide it too so that's it for the boss
15:59 - now we can work on the windscreen and
16:02 - loose ring and the fireball so let's
16:06 - work on the fireball first so farm over
16:09 - here
16:11 - when flat clicked hi in the beginning
16:17 - wait one second
16:20 - forever wait pick random one two three
16:25 - seconds
16:29 - wait went pick random one two three
16:32 - seconds and has to go to the boss in the
16:34 - beginning boss and point towards the cat
16:38 - at all times so it will follow the cat
16:41 - it will go towards the cat so okay and
16:45 - show so we'll need to broadcast a
16:51 - message call fireball once it is ready
16:55 - fire fireball and repeat 60 times repeat
17:06 - 6 times move 10 steps this is just to go
17:09 - towards the cat move 10 steps and get an
17:15 - if-then statement if then touching the
17:18 - cat
17:21 - touching cat then weight 0.5 to 5
17:26 - seconds weight 0.25 seconds and hide
17:35 - just let it show that it hit the cat so
17:41 - next we'll want to get another if-then
17:43 - statement so if it's touching we need a
17:50 - lot of or statements so if it's touching
17:53 - either only 5 or state 3 or statements I
17:58 - think so 3 or statements if it's
18:02 - touching the edge touching the edge
18:07 - touching the force attack so if it's
18:14 - touching any of attacks it will also
18:16 - hide so all the attacks can also deflect
18:19 - it touching the throne saber or touching
18:24 - the saber spin saber spit then we can
18:33 - hide and get another if-then statement
18:38 - if the boss is that less than or equal
18:44 - to 0 health less than less than or equal
18:53 - to 0 if boss HP is less than or equal to
18:58 - 0 then we could stop the script cuz this
19:04 - script and I doesn't apply anymore once
19:07 - the boss is dead stop this script
19:16 - so next if we can work on the windscreen
19:19 - and loot straight so when clicked you
19:22 - want to go to zero zero and hide so when
19:29 - I receive win when then we can show and
19:37 - stop all to let you player know that
19:40 - they want stop all so next we can work
19:45 - on the loo screen it's similar
19:47 - so when flag clicked go to zero zero
19:52 - hide when I receive game over which is
19:58 - the losing game over then we can show
20:04 - and stop up so that's all the code for
20:08 - the whole game so now let's play it the
20:21 - boss will throw this barbell so so then
20:31 - you can just play it so in the previous
20:34 - video I forgot to add this show to
20:37 - that's why you saw the Sabre up the
20:40 - Sabre cat in the backward background so
20:43 - remember to add this right here the show
20:46 - to so go high and it'll show back to the
20:49 - rule
20:49 - so as you can see you can also perform
20:54 - barbels see that
20:57 - you're ataxic and don't like fireballs
20:59 - we can prevent any damage quite easily
21:05 - and you don't take any damage when
21:08 - you're using an attack so thank you guys
21:15 - for watching please like share and
21:18 - subscribe to our Channel and I'll see
21:21 - you guys in the next video
21:23 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding click run today we'll be doing the last part of this video boss fight so in the last video we worked on the force attack the thrown saber the saber throw ring and the saber spin so I'll be going through these so like you guys see if you haven't are you if you're done with it so this is a code for the saber spin it's pretty simple ring this is the ring the ring saber throat pretty simple throne saber please don't say bird correct them see the code so this is throwing saber and force attack so I will be finishing up the force attack since we aren't done with it so we'll get one flat clicked if then touching the dart boss then touching the boss boss then we can change boss HP by negative 100 by negative 400 then we wait one second so you hit just give us painting the move next we'll want to get another one flag clicked forever repeat until repeat until Y position is equal to negative 60 so this will automatically drop drop the cab if it's in the air and uses the force attack then we will automatically go down for our positions the negative 60 change Y by negative 10 so this will keep on going down if you use the force attack in midair so as you can see her down so that's it for old attacks we are done with all the attacks now we're gonna have to work on the HP bars the fireball and the boss so let's work on the cat HP so this this is my cat age feed this thing this it's for the cat if you just put in the cat room flag clicked get a wait one second this is quite simple forever if then if then you know or statement if then HP is equal to 0 or less than 0 and HP which is the cat HP is less than or equal to 0 0 0 then we can broadcast a message called game over we will need game over for the other sprite soon something sperm counts game so we broadcasted the game over and since we broadcasted game over we need to let all the sprites receive it so so for the Sabre spin attack if it's game over when I receive game over when I receive game over and hide give this to all the sprites so they will all hide one game over you don't you don't have to give it to the health and health box or the boss the boss HP because you can still show them to show how much health you have life and stuff so you can just give it to all the sprites up to the horse attack you don't have to do it for these then the fireball yeah that's pretty much it so let's go to the work on the health bar for the cat so first we can set the X&Y position for the health box so one clicks go to this exposition in Y position somewhere in the corner here and show they're getting so and then health health flour now work or open the hub bar so one flat clicks we want to go to this x and y position negative 141 y 30 somewhere right here and show in the beginning and forever we want to set the color fret to zero set the color back to zero and then set size to HP so what this does is set whatever size it is to the HP so if you're at 100 HP it will set to 100 sauce if you're at like 70 HP then all sets of send me sighs so you want to set the size to the HP to the HP how much it depends how much health you are all set to what size and if then get it if then statement if then HP is less than 21 so if the variable HP which is the if it's if the HP for the cat is than 21 then we can change the color effect by 1 to 170 so it will turn red so show that you're critical on health you're low on health understand the B there's a red color if then if then statement if then or statement if then HP this is the same as the cat if then HP is equal or less than zero so if the HP is less than or equal to zero then oh hi so just turn the HP hide so that's the health bar code next we can work on the boss health bar which is here boss help one flock clicks we want to set the costume to the first costume switch costume to dark one so as you can see when the boss loses health it'll just lose color so we want to set it to full health in the beginning so next we want to set the exposition to here and 180 y 140 set the size to 40% I think it's already at it but if you haven't then kept a block and set it to 40% forever loop if then we knit and statement if then boss HP is less than if boss HP is less than 2500 boss HP is less than 2500 and boss HP is greater than 2000 so in between 2000 and 2500 boss HP is greater than 2000 then we'll switch costume to talk to so that note it notifies you that it loses a little bit help will tell you that he lost a pet help so you which costume too dark too then we can duplicate this you'll need to do this for until the time to 0 so if boss HP is less than 2000 and boss HP is greater than 2000 and less then 1 out greater than 1500 in less than two dozen sorry um then it will change costume Dirk 3 and so on so this is between 1500 and 2000 nail changes costume to the third costume this one so you see so you can just duplicate this change this so if the boss HP is less than 1500 and greater than 1000 then switch costume too dark for there should be 1000 and 500 we can switch the Tarte 5 to placate this so if the boss is 500 great less than 500 HP or greater than zero so in between 0 and 500 let's switch costume to talk 6 and finally we'll need it or stings right here instead of an ad because it's either or not both which is and so if boss HP is less than 0 or or equal to 0 so we'll need to get an equal sign it's boss HP is less than or equal to 0 then you can change the costumes at dark 7 which is the new HP and I think this has to go to the back later go to back see now it's good so now it's with that you can just put it up here probably forgot to put it C when you lose help the HP bar goes down so we're not done with the code for the less HP yet so we'll work on that soon so for the boss we'll need to add some code one flag let's go to this x and y position I've put down 170 and they give 30 that's my original clear graphic effects plus when you hit it it will also change color if you haven't done this yet set size to 65% in the beginning show one flag clicked set boss HP to 3,000 so but we'll have 3000 HP 3000 HP show variable boss HP and forever point towards cut cat forever point towards cat so I'll always look look at it I'll face it and one flat clicked wait one second forever glide pick random you want to do pick random 0.5 to 2 seconds two seconds to pick a random negative 85 to 170 for the X 170 and we can just keep the Y as negative 30 wait one second wait we're glad randomly see if you I didn't it will glide randomly to random positions so so next we see the boss is losing it you know here's a one its luster I'm out of HP and you can put this like this so it's easier to read and when it loses HP the HP bar will slowly drain down this is me try to get a bit lower so see the difference see it's losing HP we haven't done it throwing a fireball and so we'll work on that next as you can see the HP is slowly ending so that's what we have for now we'll have more code for the boss when collect with black lights wait one second get a forever loop forever if then touching we need to or statements so if it's touching either the saber spin the throne saber so the throne saber right here for the force attack force attack right here yeah so we need to repeat 10 times change color effects so as I told you it will change color effect when it's getting hit change color effect by 25 and you can clear graphic effects after it's done and get another ifthen statement I think this a little smaller so I can see the top if then boss HP is less than or equal to 0 less than or equal to 0 0 boss HP is less than or equal to 0 then we can hide so that that means he's dead I'm looking broadcast a message help win make a new message so we'll need to give all the sprites um when it wins don't hide it so here when I receive win win then hide I'm gonna just give it to all the sprites I'm gonna have to give it to the HP bars give it to the boss and I don't remember putting the virus Eve game over so let me hide it too so that's it for the boss now we can work on the windscreen and loose ring and the fireball so let's work on the fireball first so farm over here when flat clicked hi in the beginning wait one second forever wait pick random one two three seconds wait went pick random one two three seconds and has to go to the boss in the beginning boss and point towards the cat at all times so it will follow the cat it will go towards the cat so okay and show so we'll need to broadcast a message call fireball once it is ready fire fireball and repeat 60 times repeat 6 times move 10 steps this is just to go towards the cat move 10 steps and get an ifthen statement if then touching the cat touching cat then weight 0.5 to 5 seconds weight 0.25 seconds and hide just let it show that it hit the cat so next we'll want to get another ifthen statement so if it's touching we need a lot of or statements so if it's touching either only 5 or state 3 or statements I think so 3 or statements if it's touching the edge touching the edge touching the force attack so if it's touching any of attacks it will also hide so all the attacks can also deflect it touching the throne saber or touching the saber spin saber spit then we can hide and get another ifthen statement if the boss is that less than or equal to 0 health less than less than or equal to 0 if boss HP is less than or equal to 0 then we could stop the script cuz this script and I doesn't apply anymore once the boss is dead stop this script so next if we can work on the windscreen and loot straight so when clicked you want to go to zero zero and hide so when I receive win when then we can show and stop all to let you player know that they want stop all so next we can work on the loo screen it's similar so when flag clicked go to zero zero hide when I receive game over which is the losing game over then we can show and stop up so that's all the code for the whole game so now let's play it the boss will throw this barbell so so then you can just play it so in the previous video I forgot to add this show to that's why you saw the Sabre up the Sabre cat in the backward background so remember to add this right here the show to so go high and it'll show back to the rule so as you can see you can also perform barbels see that you're ataxic and don't like fireballs we can prevent any damage quite easily and you don't take any damage when you're using an attack so thank you guys for watching please like share and subscribe to our Channel and I'll see you guys in the next video
