00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:09 - kids coding playground
00:10 - today we'll be working on the fourth
00:12 - part for the scrolling platformer
00:15 - and once again uh we have gone through
00:17 - this tutorial on griff patch's
00:19 - uh series to learn how to do it so a lot
00:22 - of this code comes from the project
00:24 - group patch made so please check out his
00:26 - platformer gaming
00:27 - series as well our channel focus is to
00:32 - learn the code ourselves
00:33 - share knowledge and resources to other
00:35 - kids who are interested to also learn
00:38 - i am sure you guys have heard this
00:39 - phrase once see one do and teach one
00:42 - so in order to fully understand
00:44 - everything we will
00:46 - we will have to do this don't be afraid
00:48 - to reteach something you have already
00:50 - learned
00:51 - other people you might you other people
00:54 - might want to learn
00:55 - and you can teach them that's how we all
00:57 - learn
01:00 - and finally we'll give a shout out to
01:02 - carrot cake99
01:05 - he told us to maybe make different skins
01:07 - for like
01:08 - different characters with different
01:09 - stats like number one
01:12 - is neutral number two is a bad runner
01:14 - but a good jumper
01:15 - and number three is a bad jumper but
01:17 - good runner we might add that
01:19 - in our future videos but for now
01:22 - let's get on to the project
01:26 - and also please check out his channel if
01:28 - you want to
01:29 - watch some funny animations okay so
01:33 - let's go here so i'm just gonna scroll
01:37 - around for a little
01:39 - just to show what we've done from last
01:42 - time
01:45 - so this is just like the x and y code
01:49 - the setup code
01:52 - position just to position the sprites
01:55 - and finally the tick
02:00 - custom block and then let's go to the
02:01 - platforms
02:05 - so we have all of this
02:10 - scroll down
02:15 - okay and also one more thing we only
02:18 - have one level
02:18 - that's why it only has one script right
02:20 - here so when we make more levels we will
02:23 - add
02:23 - more to this scripture here so now
02:27 - let's go to the player so let's start
02:30 - off
02:31 - with this script the define
02:35 - change player y by the speed y so
02:39 - we have all of this but we're going to
02:41 - add an
02:42 - if then statement in here
02:45 - so this is the player won't teleport
02:47 - through the top
02:48 - so from the last video i mentioned that
02:51 - when you jump the player can teleport
02:53 - through the bottom of the platform
02:55 - and you can go through platforms and you
02:57 - can like teleport to the top of our
02:59 - platform
03:00 - so to fix that we need to get it greater
03:02 - than simple
03:04 - so if the speed y is greater than zero
03:08 - then we can change the y
03:12 - by negative one actually you have to get
03:14 - an if else sorry
03:15 - if else statement if
03:19 - the sy is greater than zero change the y
03:22 - by negative one
03:25 - so this is um this is so it will go back
03:28 - down
03:29 - so if it's in the air then i'll go back
03:32 - down
03:33 - else it will push it back up one pixel
03:37 - so it will not glitch through the
03:38 - platform and we want to set the in air
03:41 - back to zero
03:42 - because it's not inside the air anymore
03:44 - just take this one
03:46 - because when it touches the ground we we
03:48 - have to set the in air back to zero
03:51 - then we put the position right here oops
03:53 - under here
03:55 - so yeah add this to your change player y
03:58 - by
03:59 - speed y script next we're going to be
04:02 - working on the speed x code so we don't
04:04 - have much code
04:05 - so we're going to add some more to this
04:08 - so
04:08 - we want to change the in air by one so
04:11 - what this
04:12 - script is for um this whole script
04:15 - in there so get an if then statement
04:21 - if touching platforms
04:24 - platforms then this is just to
04:27 - reposition
04:29 - the sprite as it moves along the
04:31 - platforms
04:32 - so if it touching the platforms then
04:35 - repeat
04:36 - 12 times
04:39 - change the y by one
04:42 - change y by one
04:46 - position reposition it so our position
04:50 - block right here i'll just position it
04:52 - to that
04:52 - scroll x and scroll y of the platforms
04:56 - so this is for the player reposition it
04:58 - if
05:02 - it's not touching the platform so if
05:04 - it's like in the air
05:06 - then we can stop the script
05:11 - stop the script we don't want to stop
05:13 - all because it stops the whole program
05:15 - stop the script if you have any
05:17 - confusion on this code
05:19 - then you should watch griff patch's
05:21 - tutorials because he's way better at
05:23 - explaining code than i am so
05:26 - if you have any confusion on this code
05:28 - please check out his videos
05:29 - on his youtube channel so next we want
05:32 - to change
05:33 - the y position by negative 12
05:40 - change y position by negative 12
05:46 - repeat until
05:50 - um oops i forgot to put this inside
05:54 - so drag the if then statement into the
05:57 - repeat
05:58 - accidentally put it in the wrong one and
06:00 - then you drag this under right here
06:04 - so now you want to get a repeat until
06:08 - repeat until not touching the platforms
06:14 - not touching platforms
06:18 - touching the platforms
06:22 - so get an if else statement so this is
06:25 - uh to prevent it from
06:27 - going into a wall so if it touches a
06:30 - wall this will
06:31 - make it go back so it will not go
06:33 - through the wall
06:34 - so before when we worked on this why
06:36 - this was to prevent it from
06:37 - jumping um glitching through uh
06:41 - ceiling this is for the walls so if
06:45 - the sx the speed x is greater than
06:49 - zero then we wanna
06:53 - change the x
06:57 - change the x by negative one
07:02 - else we want to change it by positive
07:03 - one so if it's
07:05 - touching if it's bumped into a wall on
07:07 - the right side it'll change it by
07:08 - negative one
07:09 - else it'll change it by positive one and
07:12 - you want to reposition it
07:14 - always so be same position
07:19 - this will result in the player not
07:21 - moving through a wall
07:23 - and now let's go to the tick script
07:25 - right here
07:27 - so we're gonna get at an if then
07:29 - statement
07:31 - if the speed y
07:35 - if the variable speed y
07:39 - is greater than negative 20
07:42 - then we want to change the sy
07:46 - by negative two so this is um in the
07:50 - beginning
07:51 - when the player starts it will drop from
07:53 - the middle
07:54 - down to the platform so this is what the
07:56 - script is for
07:58 - so adding this script will make it drop
08:00 - onto the platform
08:03 - next you'll want to get uh change player
08:06 - y
08:06 - by and change the player y by the speed
08:10 - y
08:12 - so set this custom block to the speed y
08:16 - it'll call the custom block and you want
08:18 - to set the scroll
08:19 - x to x so this is the x scrolling
08:24 - x and if
08:27 - okay so this is to prevent the scrolling
08:30 - to go too far
08:31 - so when the player gets past zero then
08:34 - we'll stop scrolling
08:35 - we can simply do this by adding an if
08:38 - then statement
08:39 - if the scroll x
08:42 - is less than zero so it's like in the
08:45 - negative
08:46 - numbers so if the scroll x is less than
08:49 - negative zero
08:50 - at less than zero so i want to set the
08:53 - scroll x
08:55 - set the scroll x to zero
08:59 - set the scroll x back to zero and
09:01 - reposition it
09:05 - if okay so this is for the depth
09:09 - so if the y position
09:14 - is less than the negative 180 so if it
09:17 - falls like somewhere down here
09:19 - if the y position
09:23 - then we can set the exit to dead
09:26 - to tell that the player is dead so
09:28 - obviously this variable won't
09:31 - exit won't do anything because we have
09:32 - not scripted that part yet
09:34 - so we will get onto that now let's make
09:38 - a new custom block
09:41 - we should call it player die
09:48 - player die click okay
09:53 - so we're going to define the player die
09:54 - real quick so this is just just like
09:57 - um blink make it blink when it dies
10:01 - so you want in the beginning want to set
10:03 - the exit to blank
10:05 - repeat five times this is just to make
10:08 - it blink
10:09 - and show again repeat five times
10:12 - hide
10:15 - wait 0.1 seconds
10:20 - and then we want to show again
10:26 - and then wait another 0.1 seconds
10:29 - add that right under here and then we
10:32 - want to hide again
10:34 - wait 0.5 seconds and then it will
10:36 - respawn again
10:39 - like that and then now you want to call
10:44 - this so in the play game
10:47 - script right here we want to add an if
10:50 - then statement
10:52 - so once we get the like the portal we'll
10:55 - need to change this to an if else
10:57 - for now we can just put an if-then
10:58 - statement if
11:01 - exit is equal to die if it's equal to
11:05 - dead
11:05 - if the exit is equal to dead
11:11 - then we can call the player die
11:15 - just make it blink all right
11:18 - so now save our project make it bigger
11:26 - so and remember
11:28 - um i messed up because of this i forgot
11:31 - to take out this
11:33 - take this out and throw in the trash put
11:35 - this back
11:36 - in so now it works
11:39 - and i also um added some extra code
11:42 - right here
11:43 - so your code might be different from
11:45 - mine so if you have not
11:47 - uh if this is not the same then you
11:50 - should
11:50 - copy all this down
11:54 - and now i will like
11:57 - scroll through to show you guys the
12:00 - whole tick
12:01 - script because i missed something right
12:08 - here
12:17 - okay so now let's run it
12:22 - we'll make it big so now
12:26 - earlier um it was glitching through the
12:29 - top
12:30 - it's because of that extra script there
12:33 - and now there's scrolling and
12:37 - you'll die if you fall into the bottom
12:39 - and it will stop scrolling
12:41 - after you pass
12:44 - zero like the negative numbers
12:47 - so we can add
12:50 - one more platform as well let's go to
12:54 - the platform scripts
12:55 - so we can just create another clone at
12:57 - 360.
13:00 - so now let's run it
13:03 - there you go now you have three of them
13:08 - um so now go to costumes so i just
13:11 - have these three
13:14 - and of course this game is not possible
13:16 - yet because i have not added wall
13:18 - jumping
13:19 - we might get onto wall jumping in the
13:21 - next video
13:22 - so you want to space them 360 apart and
13:26 - this y position would be the same
13:29 - so yeah that concludes our fourth part
13:32 - for the scrolling platformer
13:33 - thank you guys for watching don't forget
13:35 - to like share and subscribe
13:37 - and i'll see you guys in part 5 of the
13:39 - scrolling platformer
13:41 - thank you
13:50 - [Music]
13:52 - you

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today we'll be working on the fourth part for the scrolling platformer and once again uh we have gone through this tutorial on griff patch's uh series to learn how to do it so a lot of this code comes from the project group patch made so please check out his platformer gaming series as well our channel focus is to learn the code ourselves share knowledge and resources to other kids who are interested to also learn i am sure you guys have heard this phrase once see one do and teach one so in order to fully understand everything we will we will have to do this don't be afraid to reteach something you have already learned other people you might you other people might want to learn and you can teach them that's how we all learn and finally we'll give a shout out to carrot cake99 he told us to maybe make different skins for like different characters with different stats like number one is neutral number two is a bad runner but a good jumper and number three is a bad jumper but good runner we might add that in our future videos but for now let's get on to the project and also please check out his channel if you want to watch some funny animations okay so let's go here so i'm just gonna scroll around for a little just to show what we've done from last time so this is just like the x and y code the setup code position just to position the sprites and finally the tick custom block and then let's go to the platforms so we have all of this scroll down okay and also one more thing we only have one level that's why it only has one script right here so when we make more levels we will add more to this scripture here so now let's go to the player so let's start off with this script the define change player y by the speed y so we have all of this but we're going to add an if then statement in here so this is the player won't teleport through the top so from the last video i mentioned that when you jump the player can teleport through the bottom of the platform and you can go through platforms and you can like teleport to the top of our platform so to fix that we need to get it greater than simple so if the speed y is greater than zero then we can change the y by negative one actually you have to get an if else sorry if else statement if the sy is greater than zero change the y by negative one so this is um this is so it will go back down so if it's in the air then i'll go back down else it will push it back up one pixel so it will not glitch through the platform and we want to set the in air back to zero because it's not inside the air anymore just take this one because when it touches the ground we we have to set the in air back to zero then we put the position right here oops under here so yeah add this to your change player y by speed y script next we're going to be working on the speed x code so we don't have much code so we're going to add some more to this so we want to change the in air by one so what this script is for um this whole script in there so get an if then statement if touching platforms platforms then this is just to reposition the sprite as it moves along the platforms so if it touching the platforms then repeat 12 times change the y by one change y by one position reposition it so our position block right here i'll just position it to that scroll x and scroll y of the platforms so this is for the player reposition it if it's not touching the platform so if it's like in the air then we can stop the script stop the script we don't want to stop all because it stops the whole program stop the script if you have any confusion on this code then you should watch griff patch's tutorials because he's way better at explaining code than i am so if you have any confusion on this code please check out his videos on his youtube channel so next we want to change the y position by negative 12 change y position by negative 12 repeat until um oops i forgot to put this inside so drag the if then statement into the repeat accidentally put it in the wrong one and then you drag this under right here so now you want to get a repeat until repeat until not touching the platforms not touching platforms touching the platforms so get an if else statement so this is uh to prevent it from going into a wall so if it touches a wall this will make it go back so it will not go through the wall so before when we worked on this why this was to prevent it from jumping um glitching through uh ceiling this is for the walls so if the sx the speed x is greater than zero then we wanna change the x change the x by negative one else we want to change it by positive one so if it's touching if it's bumped into a wall on the right side it'll change it by negative one else it'll change it by positive one and you want to reposition it always so be same position this will result in the player not moving through a wall and now let's go to the tick script right here so we're gonna get at an if then statement if the speed y if the variable speed y is greater than negative 20 then we want to change the sy by negative two so this is um in the beginning when the player starts it will drop from the middle down to the platform so this is what the script is for so adding this script will make it drop onto the platform next you'll want to get uh change player y by and change the player y by the speed y so set this custom block to the speed y it'll call the custom block and you want to set the scroll x to x so this is the x scrolling x and if okay so this is to prevent the scrolling to go too far so when the player gets past zero then we'll stop scrolling we can simply do this by adding an if then statement if the scroll x is less than zero so it's like in the negative numbers so if the scroll x is less than negative zero at less than zero so i want to set the scroll x set the scroll x to zero set the scroll x back to zero and reposition it if okay so this is for the depth so if the y position is less than the negative 180 so if it falls like somewhere down here if the y position then we can set the exit to dead to tell that the player is dead so obviously this variable won't exit won't do anything because we have not scripted that part yet so we will get onto that now let's make a new custom block we should call it player die player die click okay so we're going to define the player die real quick so this is just just like um blink make it blink when it dies so you want in the beginning want to set the exit to blank repeat five times this is just to make it blink and show again repeat five times hide wait 0.1 seconds and then we want to show again and then wait another 0.1 seconds add that right under here and then we want to hide again wait 0.5 seconds and then it will respawn again like that and then now you want to call this so in the play game script right here we want to add an if then statement so once we get the like the portal we'll need to change this to an if else for now we can just put an ifthen statement if exit is equal to die if it's equal to dead if the exit is equal to dead then we can call the player die just make it blink all right so now save our project make it bigger so and remember um i messed up because of this i forgot to take out this take this out and throw in the trash put this back in so now it works and i also um added some extra code right here so your code might be different from mine so if you have not uh if this is not the same then you should copy all this down and now i will like scroll through to show you guys the whole tick script because i missed something right here okay so now let's run it we'll make it big so now earlier um it was glitching through the top it's because of that extra script there and now there's scrolling and you'll die if you fall into the bottom and it will stop scrolling after you pass zero like the negative numbers so we can add one more platform as well let's go to the platform scripts so we can just create another clone at 360. so now let's run it there you go now you have three of them um so now go to costumes so i just have these three and of course this game is not possible yet because i have not added wall jumping we might get onto wall jumping in the next video so you want to space them 360 apart and this y position would be the same so yeah that concludes our fourth part for the scrolling platformer thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe and i'll see you guys in part 5 of the scrolling platformer thank you you
