00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's K playground here
00:09 - today back with another video on Scratch
00:11 - and today we will be making the eighth
00:13 - and final part of the hero war game so
00:16 - if you haven't checked out the other
00:17 - parts for the hero war game it's in the
00:20 - description below and you can also check
00:22 - on our channel for the other seven
00:28 - parts so deathray all right so when the
00:34 - green flag is clicked for the death ray
00:36 - it'll
00:37 - hide but it'll go to front
00:39 - later so when I receive death
00:44 - ray deathray then it will
00:49 - show it will go to
00:52 - player has some life stealing
00:54 - capabilities it'll go to player then
00:57 - it'll Glide 1 second to zombie
01:03 - King and then it will broadcast beam
01:10 - touched beam
01:13 - touched you message beam
01:18 - touched and then it will hide so the
01:20 - beam touched thing has multiple things
01:24 - so let's go back to the
01:27 - player so when I receive beam touch
01:30 - it will change
01:33 - lives by minus 50 so it does 50 damage
01:37 - it'll steal 50 damage 50 Health from you
01:40 - and then gain 500 for himself so pretty
01:43 - greedy man so let's add that part over
01:47 - in the zombie
01:52 - King
01:53 - so when I
01:55 - receive beam touched it will switch
01:59 - costume the costume 4 which is the
02:01 - healing one it will change King
02:06 - HP King
02:10 - HP zombie King
02:13 - HP
02:16 - by
02:18 - 500 and then it'll wait one
02:22 - second then it'll switch costume back to
02:24 - costume
02:28 - one all all right let's make sure we
02:31 - don't have any more Siege things cuz we
02:34 - got this from The
02:35 - Siege let's make
02:38 - sure
02:41 - okay uh now let's work on the icons and
02:45 - the UN andu lose and we are basically
02:48 - done unless I'm forgetting
02:52 - something you know so let's go to the
02:56 - icons so icon one
03:01 - so when the green flag is clicked it
03:03 - will
03:06 - hide all right so when I receive start
03:11 - game start
03:15 - game then it will
03:19 - show and then if
03:23 - then we have to have it
03:26 - equals one if then hero select Ed is
03:30 - equal to one it will switch costume to
03:33 - costume one which is you know the arrow
03:36 - one so these are all the icons and it'll
03:38 - go to x I made it to a position where it
03:42 - will not uh overlap with the variable so
03:45 - let's actually do that 170
03:50 - 158 and then let's go if hero s this
03:52 - equal to two this switch costume to
03:54 - costume 2 and I'll go to x-
03:58 - 182 167 so just for reference this is 1
04:02 - 2 three just the three
04:05 - bodies and then
04:07 - now duplicate that again so if hero is
04:12 - equal to
04:14 - three three so costume
04:19 - three
04:21 - 187 six and 167 so let's move these all
04:25 - to
04:27 - Icon
04:28 - ah it's fine I don't have to move
04:31 - that think it's pretty laggy you know
04:34 - it's too much I'll I'll move it to the
04:37 - other ones so it's being kind of
04:38 - stubborn with the lagging so I actually
04:40 - moved it up one column so I can get it
04:43 - into the Sprites and then I'll move it
04:45 - back down
04:47 - so there's just too much Sprites you
04:50 - know so there you go icon one two three
04:53 - all right so now let's go to Icon
04:56 - 2 so the basically the same thing so
04:59 - when the green flag is
05:01 - clicked it will
05:03 - hide and then when I receive start game
05:06 - it'll show if then here's one blah blah
05:08 - blah and then this time it'll be
05:11 - 58 165 for the first one switch costume
05:15 - costume 2 oh but there's no costume two
05:17 - it's called lightning cuz you know I got
05:18 - it from the lightning so this is costume
05:20 - one two and then
05:22 - three and then switch costume to costume
05:25 - 2 which is basically costume three so
05:28 - yeah we have Nega 58 165 and then this
05:31 - is going to be
05:33 - 101
05:35 - 162 and then if hero s is equal to three
05:39 - then it switch costume 2 which is
05:41 - basically costume three if you get what
05:43 - I'm saying and then it'll point in
05:45 - Direction
05:47 - 90 then after that it will go to
05:51 - X
05:55 - -11 and then
05:58 - 160
06:00 - two so I do have a set size for these so
06:03 - the icon is actually going to be 20 for
06:05 - this one and for the first icon I have
06:10 - it at size 20 as well and the third
06:13 - one I have at size 25 so change
06:18 - that okay so now let's work on icon 3 so
06:22 - when the G flag is clicked it
06:25 - will um
06:27 - hide and then when I receive start game
06:31 - it will show then here's one it switch
06:33 - costume to Griffin a which I have over
06:36 - here Griffin
06:37 - a it will go to
06:43 - X4 163 so actually the Griffin's kind of
06:46 - big so actually for Griffin only it set
06:50 - size to
06:52 - 15% and now if your equal 2 you'll
06:55 - switch costume your costume one which is
06:59 - um The Apprentice
07:04 - so so The Apprentice and
07:08 - then if then hero selct is equal to
07:11 - three then it'll switch costume to the
07:14 - defender chip so actually have names for
07:16 - these so that's a lot easier but let's
07:18 - actually change the position so that's
07:19 - -41 163 right this
07:24 - is4 163 as
07:27 - well and then this
07:31 - is 143 those are the positions I got and
07:36 - then I actually got this set size 25%
07:40 - for this
07:41 - one I think which is already is and then
07:44 - a point in Direction
07:46 - 90 so that's just for the
07:50 - icons so the icon one is actually tilted
07:53 - for some reason so let's actually change
07:56 - icon one back to the direction it
08:00 - normally is at
08:05 - 82
08:07 - so yeah so all the icons as you can see
08:11 - are over
08:13 - here for some reason I don't know why
08:15 - this one's a little smaller let's
08:16 - actually take a look at
08:21 - it
08:24 - huh so now since we have all of that
08:26 - done um it's actually supposed to look
08:28 - like that deciding and then um let's
08:30 - hide all the variables so we have all
08:33 - these let's hide all
08:35 - these
08:37 - and let's see if it works as you can see
08:41 - all the power up things are over here so
08:44 - if you double click on this thing you
08:45 - can actually change it to a different
08:47 - form which it look like that so double
08:49 - click and then this is for power up
08:52 - two so and then we can move it like that
08:55 - and then this is for power up three so
08:59 - now we have the variables like that it
09:01 - will
09:02 - look more pleasing as you can
09:08 - see well that's a little
09:11 - far A little bit closer is
09:17 - good there we
09:20 - go yeah I think I have to change the
09:22 - position of some of these seems to be
09:25 - all the right positions but it's just a
09:27 - little off for some reason
09:30 - um move the score up here
09:33 - too just seems to be a little off I
09:35 - think if you full screen it'll be fine
09:40 - no yeah it's just a little off I think I
09:43 - have to move the heel um a little back
09:47 - so let's see how far we have to move
09:49 - this
09:51 - back that's
09:53 - good so whatever position that is it'll
09:57 - go to that now and then this icon
10:01 - to whatever position that
10:04 - [Music]
10:06 - is it
10:08 - will go to that
10:11 - instead and let's see if the other ones
10:13 - are also
10:17 - weird oh these are fine oh this one's a
10:20 - little off all right let's see how what
10:22 - position that
10:23 - is okay so let's see icon three so
10:27 - whatever position that is it'll go to
10:30 - x just like
10:33 - that and then now let's see the elf
10:36 - Warrior see if that's also
10:38 - fine oh no that's not fine all right so
10:41 - let's move this Arrow over
10:44 - here whatever position that
10:47 - is and then this Griffin
10:51 - guy and then change to whatever position
10:54 - that is so it should be all right now
10:58 - hopefully
10:59 - yeah all
11:02 - right I think this spectral Arrow should
11:05 - go down a little bit so let's yeah
11:07 - whatever position that
11:09 - is and yeah all right so now let's work
11:13 - on the you win you
11:16 - lose or game over as they call it
11:23 - spray so when the green flag is
11:27 - clicked it will go to front
11:32 - layer it will go to x00
11:37 - 0 then it will
11:41 - hide then it will when I
11:45 - receive game
11:48 - over so I think we actually have to make
11:50 - the game over thing so let's do that
11:52 - real quick yeah okay so we go to the
11:54 - player so when the green when if then so
11:59 - if then we need a or then lives is equal
12:04 - to
12:06 - zero lives is equal to
12:10 - zero
12:12 - or lives is less than
12:19 - zero then it will broadcast game
12:23 - over so let's make that
12:27 - game over
12:30 - let's add that over here just like that
12:33 - all
12:34 - right so now let's work on the game over
12:39 - again so have
12:41 - this when the G click it'll go to front
12:44 - layer then when I receive game
12:48 - over it will switch costume to costume
12:51 - one which is the game over
12:53 - thing and it'll
12:56 - show and then stop all
13:00 - then when I receive King
13:04 - Dead costume two which is basically you
13:07 - win because when the King dies he's the
13:08 - last boss it'll show and then stop
13:12 - all so I also made it so some Sprites
13:15 - hide when you win or you lose so I think
13:20 - I'll track down all the Sprites where I
13:22 - added that all right I forgot to add one
13:25 - thing for the um the old one so let's
13:28 - actually do this so when I receive old
13:31 - one dead so this is for all the enemies
13:34 - and stuff so when I receive old one dead
13:36 - it'll wait one second delete this clone
13:39 - then same with the Speedy enemy when I
13:41 - receive old one dead then same with the
13:44 - armored enemy oh
13:48 - crap let's restore that Sprite so I just
13:50 - restored the Sprite that was really
13:51 - scary just click edit and restore the
13:54 - Sprite
13:55 - so so let's move this back up that's
13:58 - really scary so when I receive old one
14:00 - dead and then same with the armored
14:02 - enemy receive old one
14:06 - dead
14:07 - and um
14:12 - yeah so the game should work now uh I
14:15 - want to make it so the enemies
14:18 - hide well when the game you win all
14:22 - right the game should work now I don't
14:24 - think I made any Sprites hide basically
14:27 - when when they're doing that so let's
14:30 - take a look at the game so I actually
14:32 - have some music for this game but we're
14:34 - not going to add that yet CU I have to
14:36 - download it and everything so you can
14:37 - just add music from the scratch profile
14:40 - and I'll have the music in the original
14:42 - game so I'll play the game and see how
14:44 - I'll tell you how it goes as I
14:48 - play so here I am fighting The Siege
14:51 - monster it seems to be working oh no
14:54 - he's summoning peons on me guys oh no
14:59 - let's see if we can use the Griffin bomb
15:01 - him
15:08 - Griffin so let's shoot him a few
15:13 - times oh no I lost okay it's
15:17 - fine I'll show you the game to test it
15:20 - out since I can't always win because
15:21 - this game is kind of hard not going to
15:23 - lie so I'm going to set the score to a
15:25 - th000 cuz I'm always like unpausing and
15:27 - pausing and stuff so
15:29 - and it takes time off my margin they're
15:30 - just attacking me while I do that let's
15:33 - just set my score to a
15:35 - th000 let's just select a hero and then
15:37 - set my score to a th000 all
15:41 - right
15:46 - so so there was a random zombie over
15:48 - here so I figured out why I don't even
15:51 - know why how The Siege monster dead
15:53 - thing got into here so let's actually
15:55 - just delete that so I don't know how any
15:59 - of the siege monster code even got into
16:00 - the Sprite and there's another piece of
16:02 - Siege monster code and it was showing
16:06 - the enemy so you actually want to set
16:07 - this to Hidden so I don't know how that
16:09 - even got into there cuz I don't remember
16:11 - putting it into there so anyway um it
16:14 - should work now so if you have any
16:16 - problems you can just check it out on
16:18 - our on my project and look at each piece
16:22 - of the game and see if it works so I'm
16:25 - going to give myself a th000 score and
16:26 - test it out real quick so I'm going to
16:29 - give myself some quick cheats so then I
16:31 - can show you the game a lot quicker just
16:34 - select
16:39 - alware oh I forgot to click on the
16:41 - cheats
16:43 - oops a let's do that
16:49 - start yeah I just use this guy wait no
16:52 - L4 is better uh where's the bomb yeah
16:56 - okay there we go start the
17:01 - game over here as you can see I have all
17:03 - these
17:05 - things let's do all that let's hit him
17:10 - all right I just gave myself some hacked
17:12 - power ups so I can show you the game so
17:15 - as you can
17:16 - see uh The Siege monster does work it's
17:18 - summoning its peons and um it's taking
17:21 - damage and everything so
17:23 - great and now we beat The Siege monster
17:27 - so now let's play until we get to the
17:29 - old
17:30 - one as you can see the old one's about
17:32 - to come out uh there we go he's

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's K playground here today back with another video on Scratch and today we will be making the eighth and final part of the hero war game so if you haven't checked out the other parts for the hero war game it's in the description below and you can also check on our channel for the other seven parts so deathray all right so when the green flag is clicked for the death ray it'll hide but it'll go to front later so when I receive death ray deathray then it will show it will go to player has some life stealing capabilities it'll go to player then it'll Glide 1 second to zombie King and then it will broadcast beam touched beam touched you message beam touched and then it will hide so the beam touched thing has multiple things so let's go back to the player so when I receive beam touch it will change lives by minus 50 so it does 50 damage it'll steal 50 damage 50 Health from you and then gain 500 for himself so pretty greedy man so let's add that part over in the zombie King so when I receive beam touched it will switch costume the costume 4 which is the healing one it will change King HP King HP zombie King HP by 500 and then it'll wait one second then it'll switch costume back to costume one all all right let's make sure we don't have any more Siege things cuz we got this from The Siege let's make sure okay uh now let's work on the icons and the UN andu lose and we are basically done unless I'm forgetting something you know so let's go to the icons so icon one so when the green flag is clicked it will hide all right so when I receive start game start game then it will show and then if then we have to have it equals one if then hero select Ed is equal to one it will switch costume to costume one which is you know the arrow one so these are all the icons and it'll go to x I made it to a position where it will not uh overlap with the variable so let's actually do that 170 158 and then let's go if hero s this equal to two this switch costume to costume 2 and I'll go to x 182 167 so just for reference this is 1 2 three just the three bodies and then now duplicate that again so if hero is equal to three three so costume three 187 six and 167 so let's move these all to Icon ah it's fine I don't have to move that think it's pretty laggy you know it's too much I'll I'll move it to the other ones so it's being kind of stubborn with the lagging so I actually moved it up one column so I can get it into the Sprites and then I'll move it back down so there's just too much Sprites you know so there you go icon one two three all right so now let's go to Icon 2 so the basically the same thing so when the green flag is clicked it will hide and then when I receive start game it'll show if then here's one blah blah blah and then this time it'll be 58 165 for the first one switch costume costume 2 oh but there's no costume two it's called lightning cuz you know I got it from the lightning so this is costume one two and then three and then switch costume to costume 2 which is basically costume three so yeah we have Nega 58 165 and then this is going to be 101 162 and then if hero s is equal to three then it switch costume 2 which is basically costume three if you get what I'm saying and then it'll point in Direction 90 then after that it will go to X 11 and then 160 two so I do have a set size for these so the icon is actually going to be 20 for this one and for the first icon I have it at size 20 as well and the third one I have at size 25 so change that okay so now let's work on icon 3 so when the G flag is clicked it will um hide and then when I receive start game it will show then here's one it switch costume to Griffin a which I have over here Griffin a it will go to X4 163 so actually the Griffin's kind of big so actually for Griffin only it set size to 15% and now if your equal 2 you'll switch costume your costume one which is um The Apprentice so so The Apprentice and then if then hero selct is equal to three then it'll switch costume to the defender chip so actually have names for these so that's a lot easier but let's actually change the position so that's 41 163 right this is4 163 as well and then this is 143 those are the positions I got and then I actually got this set size 25% for this one I think which is already is and then a point in Direction 90 so that's just for the icons so the icon one is actually tilted for some reason so let's actually change icon one back to the direction it normally is at 82 so yeah so all the icons as you can see are over here for some reason I don't know why this one's a little smaller let's actually take a look at it huh so now since we have all of that done um it's actually supposed to look like that deciding and then um let's hide all the variables so we have all these let's hide all these and let's see if it works as you can see all the power up things are over here so if you double click on this thing you can actually change it to a different form which it look like that so double click and then this is for power up two so and then we can move it like that and then this is for power up three so now we have the variables like that it will look more pleasing as you can see well that's a little far A little bit closer is good there we go yeah I think I have to change the position of some of these seems to be all the right positions but it's just a little off for some reason um move the score up here too just seems to be a little off I think if you full screen it'll be fine no yeah it's just a little off I think I have to move the heel um a little back so let's see how far we have to move this back that's good so whatever position that is it'll go to that now and then this icon to whatever position that is it will go to that instead and let's see if the other ones are also weird oh these are fine oh this one's a little off all right let's see how what position that is okay so let's see icon three so whatever position that is it'll go to x just like that and then now let's see the elf Warrior see if that's also fine oh no that's not fine all right so let's move this Arrow over here whatever position that is and then this Griffin guy and then change to whatever position that is so it should be all right now hopefully yeah all right I think this spectral Arrow should go down a little bit so let's yeah whatever position that is and yeah all right so now let's work on the you win you lose or game over as they call it spray so when the green flag is clicked it will go to front layer it will go to x00 0 then it will hide then it will when I receive game over so I think we actually have to make the game over thing so let's do that real quick yeah okay so we go to the player so when the green when if then so if then we need a or then lives is equal to zero lives is equal to zero or lives is less than zero then it will broadcast game over so let's make that game over let's add that over here just like that all right so now let's work on the game over again so have this when the G click it'll go to front layer then when I receive game over it will switch costume to costume one which is the game over thing and it'll show and then stop all then when I receive King Dead costume two which is basically you win because when the King dies he's the last boss it'll show and then stop all so I also made it so some Sprites hide when you win or you lose so I think I'll track down all the Sprites where I added that all right I forgot to add one thing for the um the old one so let's actually do this so when I receive old one dead so this is for all the enemies and stuff so when I receive old one dead it'll wait one second delete this clone then same with the Speedy enemy when I receive old one dead then same with the armored enemy oh crap let's restore that Sprite so I just restored the Sprite that was really scary just click edit and restore the Sprite so so let's move this back up that's really scary so when I receive old one dead and then same with the armored enemy receive old one dead and um yeah so the game should work now uh I want to make it so the enemies hide well when the game you win all right the game should work now I don't think I made any Sprites hide basically when when they're doing that so let's take a look at the game so I actually have some music for this game but we're not going to add that yet CU I have to download it and everything so you can just add music from the scratch profile and I'll have the music in the original game so I'll play the game and see how I'll tell you how it goes as I play so here I am fighting The Siege monster it seems to be working oh no he's summoning peons on me guys oh no let's see if we can use the Griffin bomb him Griffin so let's shoot him a few times oh no I lost okay it's fine I'll show you the game to test it out since I can't always win because this game is kind of hard not going to lie so I'm going to set the score to a th000 cuz I'm always like unpausing and pausing and stuff so and it takes time off my margin they're just attacking me while I do that let's just set my score to a th000 let's just select a hero and then set my score to a th000 all right so so there was a random zombie over here so I figured out why I don't even know why how The Siege monster dead thing got into here so let's actually just delete that so I don't know how any of the siege monster code even got into the Sprite and there's another piece of Siege monster code and it was showing the enemy so you actually want to set this to Hidden so I don't know how that even got into there cuz I don't remember putting it into there so anyway um it should work now so if you have any problems you can just check it out on our on my project and look at each piece of the game and see if it works so I'm going to give myself a th000 score and test it out real quick so I'm going to give myself some quick cheats so then I can show you the game a lot quicker just select alware oh I forgot to click on the cheats oops a let's do that start yeah I just use this guy wait no L4 is better uh where's the bomb yeah okay there we go start the game over here as you can see I have all these things let's do all that let's hit him all right I just gave myself some hacked power ups so I can show you the game so as you can see uh The Siege monster does work it's summoning its peons and um it's taking damage and everything so great and now we beat The Siege monster so now let's play until we get to the old one as you can see the old one's about to come out uh there we go he's summoning his Vineyards and he's going to try to hit me as you can see so let's shoot him and then that's the old one so actually I forgot to change this so go to the old one so this is actually switch costume to costume 2 there's a bunch of like small things so this actually the dead OTE the Dead one so this is when I received old one dead and then now we will go to the old ones Vin ball and this is actually when I receive old one spawn not old one dead so that's why I wasn't shooting anything either no King spawn old one spawn so I'm just testing for bugs here and finding these small bugs to put all right so let's restart that so let's give myself some powers and then now The Siege monster is out so let's just get rid of him real quick let's just Spam my hacked amount of things now the old ones here too so just get almost full screen this so as you can see old one is shooting Vine balls at me and he also has the vineard over there so yeah I'm just going to shoot him down and the poison effect as you can see like right there and then let's just take get rid of him real quick oh why is there a zombie on me okay let's just get rid of him real quick oh now the zombie King's out cuz I had a bunch of um things and then now the dude's going to come out and the mysterious man and then he's G give me some a th000 health and then this guy is summoning peons while also stealing my HP so that's not very nice of you yeah so let's just beat him easy okay I have infinite power ups I should be using these more I have the Griffin here spamming the first power up there we go do all that and then that and then that and that there's the U Win and that the end of the project so this is the end of the hero War series and and if you have

code if you have any like um you know any questions or anything just comment on my scratch project cuz I knew there was a bunch of like small things and bugs that happen once in a while because we're taking um scripts from different Sprites so anyway that's the hero war game so let me just delete this real quick and yeah so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below what
