00:02 - [Music]
00:11 - all right guys welcome back
00:13 - to the channel so uh this will be the
00:15 - last tutorial
00:17 - uh for the penguin flip game
00:20 - if you have not done the uh the
00:23 - the first one in the second one so i
00:26 - suggest you to do that first
00:29 - so after you work on the first one and
00:31 - the second one you can work on this last
00:33 - one
00:34 - this is the last uh and final change to
00:37 - the penguin game what we are going to
00:39 - make is we gonna make a
00:40 - fish that will fly up and down
00:44 - in here between the ice block and the
00:47 - iceberg here
00:48 - and the penguin can jump over while the
00:51 - fish is up in the air he can
00:54 - catch it if you catch it then you get
00:56 - some extra points so
00:58 - this is what we're going to be working
00:59 - on today
01:01 - all right let's get started so today
01:04 - so we're gonna add a fish first so we'll
01:07 - look for fish here
01:10 - so we'll type fish
01:13 - so we can take this fish actually this
01:15 - fish actually have a couple of different
01:17 - costumes
01:18 - we are going to use the uh costume
01:22 - number three here i mean this looks like
01:24 - he has some wings that he could fly
01:26 - up in the air so we'll be using this
01:28 - fish
01:29 - all right so we'll set up the gear
01:33 - the fish right now so uh
01:36 - we'll go back to the coal
01:40 - we'll drag in the event when start
01:44 - we always did that when the green flag
01:47 - is clicked
01:49 - we'll set the fish around 50
01:53 - so this fish is a little too big make it
01:56 - fifty percent and then we will point in
02:00 - direction
02:01 - um point in direction
02:04 - zero meaning that the fish will be
02:06 - pointing up
02:07 - so the fish will be rotated and then
02:10 - pointing up
02:12 - and if i run this you can see the fish
02:14 - is pointing up
02:15 - right that's how it will look like so
02:18 - you see the fish is pointing up with
02:20 - these two coat
02:21 - so next i will say hi so we don't want
02:24 - to show the fish
02:26 - when the game begin
02:29 - okay and we have to define a new uh
02:32 - function for the fish so what this do
02:36 - function we can use it um
02:38 - to uh to call the uh um
02:42 - different block we put different blocks
02:44 - in here and then we can make a call
02:46 - later on so we're gonna
02:49 - fish
02:53 - jump so this function is called fish
02:56 - jump so uh what we do is we
03:00 - will make the fish jump up into the air
03:02 - and then come right back down
03:04 - so we will need a loop here
03:07 - so repeat uh 20 times
03:12 - then we have to go into here say move
03:16 - random step basically we want to kind of
03:19 - make the fish kind of go
03:21 - higher or slower and we can use a uh
03:25 - operator here let's say pick a random
03:29 - we'll put 10 to let's say 15
03:32 - steps and then we will add this
03:36 - weight condition here 0.1
03:40 - so kind of make the fish
03:43 - slow down a bit when it's moving up
03:46 - then we have to change the direction
03:48 - again we want to point
03:50 - to 180 meaning the the fish is going
03:53 - back down
03:56 - so i will point downward so we'll repeat
03:59 - it again
04:02 - duplicate this code put this over here
04:06 - so now uh we'll do the same thing right
04:08 - so that
04:10 - it jumped all the way up into the air
04:12 - and then it turned around and then come
04:14 - back down
04:15 - that's what this code will do okay
04:19 - now that we have the code done here
04:23 - be sure to click on like share
04:26 - subscribe and click on this notification
04:29 - bell
04:30 - to receive all the latest updates from
04:33 - this channel
04:34 - thank you okay we'll make the fish
04:38 - jump by broadcasting uh some messages
04:42 - so that the fish once the fish receive
04:44 - some stop
04:45 - uh this message will start um
04:49 - making the jumping action so let's add
04:51 - this
04:52 - here so we'll add the broadcast message
04:55 - here
04:58 - at the end and we make it a new message
05:02 - called setup fish
05:06 - so this is setting up the fish for the
05:09 - for the for the
05:10 - game so what do we want to do when this
05:13 - uh setup fish
05:14 - is called i'll move this over here a
05:16 - little bit
05:20 - so we'll say when i receive
05:24 - set up when the fish is getting set up
05:26 - what i want to do
05:28 - i want to go
05:31 - here say uh go to a random
05:35 - call the x and y position so the y
05:39 - uh we will put it as negative 150 kinda
05:43 - a little bit in the bottom so as you can
05:46 - see if you move the fish you can see
05:47 - right
05:48 - what what it is so you can see this is
05:50 - negative 154 we put it around
05:52 - 150 right so and then we'll put a x
05:56 - position
05:58 - so what we want to do is we want to set
06:00 - up the fish between the
06:01 - ice block and the iceberg here so
06:05 - we'll have to to look into the position
06:08 - of the x of the iceberg
06:10 - okay so what we can do is this what is
06:13 - the way random
06:16 - we'll say pick it random instead of a 1
06:19 - to 10 will to change this to a negative
06:22 - 50.
06:22 - so negative 50 is somewhere around this
06:26 - area here so this is like kind of zero
06:29 - right so negative 50 is somewhere here
06:31 - so we want to
06:33 - keep the fish between here and somewhere
06:35 - here so we're gonna
06:36 - we will take the x position of this ice
06:39 - block
06:40 - and we will subtract some
06:43 - some some x value here so that make get
06:47 - between this
06:48 - this and this so what we have to do is
06:51 - we go to sensing
06:54 - uh we have to take this one
06:58 - and then we will have to also use
07:00 - operator
07:01 - uh minus so we'll drop this in here with
07:05 - the select the
07:07 - iceberg first and we'll say the
07:10 - exposition of the iceberg
07:11 - so you run this this explicit is 174.
07:16 - so you say okay i want a minus maybe 70
07:19 - right and then this whole thing
07:22 - if you do that minus 70 you see this 104
07:25 - so we'll
07:26 - pick a random between negative 50 and
07:28 - 104 that's what it means
07:30 - so oops
07:31 - [Music]
07:33 - so i am going to either zoom back out i
07:36 - think i zoomed in too
07:37 - much with a little bit more complex code
07:40 - here
07:41 - so we'll put this over here so i have
07:45 - this right now
07:46 - so it will be a no between this negative
07:48 - 50 and whatever the
07:50 - x value of the iceberg minus 70
07:53 - and the y is always in the bottom when
07:55 - the setting of the fish
07:57 - so we also have to say point the fish to
08:00 - the
08:01 - 90 degree just in case the fish is up in
08:03 - the air
08:04 - and the fish have to restart again with
08:07 - make sure to point the fish back up
08:10 - and then we have to say show
08:14 - showing the fish and we have to call our
08:17 - block called
08:18 - jump so when we call this
08:21 - a setup fish we'll call this method this
08:24 - method we'll call setup fish again so
08:26 - basically
08:27 - it's kind of like an infinite loop right
08:29 - so this calls this
08:30 - this one called stats and then we can
08:32 - trigger the setup fish
08:34 - broadcast somewhere else too so that
08:36 - when it start
08:37 - it can keep on going so the fish will
08:39 - kind of come up and down up and down
08:41 - here so we also have to set up another
08:46 - um event here
08:50 - so when um
08:54 - okay when i receive
08:59 - with another one set up fish what we are
09:01 - going to do is we're going to put
09:02 - another forever loop here
09:04 - so what we don't want to do we don't
09:06 - want to combine this together we don't
09:08 - let this do its own job and this one can
09:10 - also do its own thing because it's a
09:12 - forever loop here
09:13 - we don't want to cause any problem for
09:16 - this right we have to put it
09:17 - under inside underneath right it won't
09:19 - make sense so we'll
09:20 - keep it as a separate one so um we'll
09:23 - need an if condition here
09:27 - okay now if the uh if the fish
09:30 - uh touch the penguin or you said say
09:33 - penguin touch the fish is the same thing
09:35 - basically if the if they touch then
09:38 - you know we want to make him disappear
09:40 - and we're going to give some points to
09:42 - the uh
09:42 - to the player so we'll touch the penguin
09:46 - so we can say change the score
09:51 - so we will say change the score by let's
09:53 - say 50 points so we get 50 points to the
09:55 - player
09:57 - then we'll hide the fish
10:01 - so that after you catch the fish the
10:04 - fish disappear
10:05 - then it can the fish can come up again
10:08 - so because okay
10:12 - all right that's done for now um
10:15 - so what we need
10:18 - to do
10:24 - okay so we will actually have to wait
10:27 - until the
10:27 - iceberg finish setting the position
10:31 - then we have to set up the fish right
10:33 - because we don't know where the iceberg
10:35 - is going to
10:36 - uh generate so we have to wait until
10:39 - that's done
10:39 - first before we can set the fish so we
10:41 - have to go back to iceberg here
10:44 - so after the iceberg received get ready
10:46 - from the penguin right
10:48 - so it will set the position uh somewhere
10:51 - here
10:52 - so after this we have to call
10:55 - um broadcast a message say
11:00 - set up the fish so once this is done
11:03 - you the event will go back to the fish
11:06 - here
11:06 - so the fish here will have will run
11:09 - these two coals so we will find the
11:11 - position of the iceberg
11:13 - uh subtract uh 70 um
11:17 - because uh the when you find the percent
11:19 - iceberg is probably here in the middle
11:20 - right so you have to subtract 70 you
11:22 - kind of move it somewhere here
11:24 - so between that and and then 50 uh
11:28 - between somewhere here and here so we'll
11:30 - generate the fish
11:31 - after that cause the jump the jumbo call
11:34 - this set up fish again so it kind of the
11:36 - fish will jump up in the air down
11:38 - up down up down like this right so
11:41 - now that we have it ready let's uh kind
11:44 - of test this out and see how it works
11:47 - so let's start so as you can see the
11:50 - iceberg
11:51 - generated and then you see the fish
11:53 - coming down
11:55 - and the fish is coming back up so the
11:58 - fish should never uh you know kind of
12:00 - touch the iceberg
12:01 - so you see it's generating between here
12:03 - and here
12:04 - right so uh let's if we stop it again
12:09 - we'll stop it again we'll start again
12:10 - the iceberg will come in different
12:12 - locations
12:12 - and you can see the fish is kind of
12:14 - between that
12:16 - so you see the fish is between the
12:18 - iceberg and the
12:19 - in the penguin so he's always between
12:22 - that
12:22 - those two points so this gap here so
12:25 - because of this
12:26 - function here we're trying to find the
12:28 - position between the iceberg and the
12:31 - and the and his block here so the fish
12:34 - is always between that so we can jump up
12:36 - and catch the fish so let's see what
12:37 - happens if we
12:38 - jump up so you see we get the 50 points
12:42 - and then 61 because we landed on the ice
12:45 - block
12:46 - iceberg here so let's try again
12:50 - so so we got him so we got 54 for the
12:54 - fish
12:54 - and then 10 points for the uh the uh the
12:57 - iceberg here so total
12:59 - 60 and then so that's why you get 120.
13:02 - so you see we missed it we still got the
13:04 - fish
13:05 - but we did we missed the iceberg so only
13:07 - 50 points
13:10 - so um okay i'm
13:14 - not doing well in this game
13:17 - okay it's all right so game over
13:20 - so you see how we came over the fish is
13:23 - still kind of moving
13:24 - that's not what we want right we wanna
13:26 - when it's a game over the fish should be
13:28 - stopped moving right so we have to uh
13:32 - make some cool change too to fix that
13:35 - so what we have to do is we're going to
13:36 - go back to the penguin
13:39 - so here we see right touching blue color
13:43 - right so either he's standing on this
13:45 - eye block or he's
13:46 - hitting the edge we want to stop the
13:48 - fish so what we can do is broadcast
13:53 - a new message you say stop
13:57 - fish okay
14:01 - so when you do this it will it will
14:03 - broadcast the message and we can stop it
14:04 - so we will need this something similar
14:08 - so we will also want to touch the edge
14:11 - we also want to stop it
14:14 - say stop the fish all right
14:18 - so now we have the uh both the uh
14:22 - the fish um getting stopped here
14:26 - and then also here if it's touched the
14:29 - blue
14:29 - basically this iceberg here or if i
14:31 - touch the edge basically if it hit the
14:33 - top here the bottom of the c
14:36 - it will call this broadcaster's message
14:38 - so now we have to go back to the
14:42 - penguin
14:45 - so in the penguin so when we are not
14:47 - opinion so whether go back to the fish
14:49 - so when we go back to the fish
14:51 - um when we receive
14:55 - stop fish so we have to say um
15:00 - stop let's go back to control
15:04 - so what we want to do is say stop
15:07 - other script in the sprite basically
15:09 - we'll stop everything here
15:11 - or this guy here and then when the
15:14 - penguin get ready to launch again the
15:17 - fish will start again
15:18 - so let's try this now
15:22 - all right so the fish is up in the air
15:26 - so we catch it as you can see the fish
15:29 - didn't come out right
15:30 - until until i started back over here so
15:33 - let's say if i
15:34 - kind of lose on purpose
15:38 - right so you see the stop the fish
15:40 - stopped moving right until i
15:41 - started again right so
15:45 - so no more game over the fish stop
15:47 - moving right
15:48 - it should not be stop still moving right
15:50 - because we have this so we can stop the
15:52 - fish
15:53 - from moving or you can say you can also
15:55 - add here after this say hi to spry or
15:58 - something like that
15:59 - but that's up to you uh so pretty much
16:03 - this is how the game works so
16:05 - um so i think we got everything
16:09 - the penguin right we got the penguin
16:12 - the code for the penguin again i can
16:14 - show you here
16:15 - so we can go through it a little bit so
16:18 - you have the code here to
16:20 - to make the finger and flip this is
16:21 - making the pigment go back to the start
16:24 - this is the the green flex click we want
16:26 - to do something like this
16:27 - um what what we want to do with the
16:29 - penguin right we can
16:31 - go to the start position and this is
16:33 - when we receive the jump
16:35 - what are we doing here checking if it's
16:37 - touching here or touching the edge right
16:39 - and then we have pretty much uh then you
16:43 - understand this if you don't go back to
16:45 - the
16:45 - previous two video and trying to
16:47 - understand uh
16:48 - listen on it again basically this is
16:51 - kind of touching the
16:52 - blue color basically this uh spike here
16:55 - if you touch that you want to give them
16:58 - the point right
16:58 - making the position of the the penguin
17:01 - standing on top of the iceberg and
17:03 - all that and playing the sound and
17:05 - moving the finger back to the
17:06 - starting position if we touch the edge
17:10 - you stop the fish and then we minus the
17:13 - light right
17:13 - same thing here then the ice block is
17:16 - pretty simple right not
17:18 - much coal here we just kind of put them
17:20 - in the position
17:21 - iceberg we have one added one coal right
17:23 - this one is after the iceberg is
17:25 - generated we want to broadcast a message
17:28 - to tell the fish to be set up
17:30 - before that we don't want to set up the
17:31 - fish because we don't know where the
17:33 - iceberg will be
17:34 - generating from so after that
17:37 - then the arrow the arrow is pretty much
17:39 - the same as the
17:40 - before right we didn't change much uh
17:43 - when the when you click on the screen
17:44 - they will broadcast this jump
17:46 - which calls the penguin uh jump message
17:49 - here
17:49 - which will launch the penguin in the air
17:53 - and then the fish is uh the same
17:56 - we did that today for this lesson so
17:58 - this one is when the fish
18:00 - we created the uh the uh
18:03 - the definition of fish jump here uh
18:06 - we make the fish going up and down
18:08 - pointing zero
18:10 - uh when we point zero meaning it's
18:12 - pointing up
18:13 - uh 180 meaning pointing down right and
18:16 - then we have these two uh
18:17 - condition m2 event here what we want to
18:20 - do is calculate the ice bark
18:23 - iceberg and the position here between
18:25 - that before when the fish to move why
18:28 - this is setting up the fish to
18:29 - see if it catch it touch the penguin if
18:32 - it
18:32 - touch the pink when you give 50 points
18:34 - to the player
18:36 - so this is just making the fish uh
18:38 - smaller right in the beginning
18:39 - and this is stopping the fish basically
18:41 - once you catch the fish
18:43 - and you land it on here or the ocean you
18:45 - have to stop the fish
18:46 - from moving right so this is pretty much
18:50 - uh the video so uh please
18:53 - like subscribe to the channel and we
18:56 - will create more
18:58 - fun video alright thank you everyone
19:01 - have a good day bye
19:13 - you

Cleaned transcript:

all right guys welcome back to the channel so uh this will be the last tutorial uh for the penguin flip game if you have not done the uh the the first one in the second one so i suggest you to do that first so after you work on the first one and the second one you can work on this last one this is the last uh and final change to the penguin game what we are going to make is we gonna make a fish that will fly up and down in here between the ice block and the iceberg here and the penguin can jump over while the fish is up in the air he can catch it if you catch it then you get some extra points so this is what we're going to be working on today all right let's get started so today so we're gonna add a fish first so we'll look for fish here so we'll type fish so we can take this fish actually this fish actually have a couple of different costumes we are going to use the uh costume number three here i mean this looks like he has some wings that he could fly up in the air so we'll be using this fish all right so we'll set up the gear the fish right now so uh we'll go back to the coal we'll drag in the event when start we always did that when the green flag is clicked we'll set the fish around 50 so this fish is a little too big make it fifty percent and then we will point in direction um point in direction zero meaning that the fish will be pointing up so the fish will be rotated and then pointing up and if i run this you can see the fish is pointing up right that's how it will look like so you see the fish is pointing up with these two coat so next i will say hi so we don't want to show the fish when the game begin okay and we have to define a new uh function for the fish so what this do function we can use it um to uh to call the uh um different block we put different blocks in here and then we can make a call later on so we're gonna fish jump so this function is called fish jump so uh what we do is we will make the fish jump up into the air and then come right back down so we will need a loop here so repeat uh 20 times then we have to go into here say move random step basically we want to kind of make the fish kind of go higher or slower and we can use a uh operator here let's say pick a random we'll put 10 to let's say 15 steps and then we will add this weight condition here 0.1 so kind of make the fish slow down a bit when it's moving up then we have to change the direction again we want to point to 180 meaning the the fish is going back down so i will point downward so we'll repeat it again duplicate this code put this over here so now uh we'll do the same thing right so that it jumped all the way up into the air and then it turned around and then come back down that's what this code will do okay now that we have the code done here be sure to click on like share subscribe and click on this notification bell to receive all the latest updates from this channel thank you okay we'll make the fish jump by broadcasting uh some messages so that the fish once the fish receive some stop uh this message will start um making the jumping action so let's add this here so we'll add the broadcast message here at the end and we make it a new message called setup fish so this is setting up the fish for the for the for the game so what do we want to do when this uh setup fish is called i'll move this over here a little bit so we'll say when i receive set up when the fish is getting set up what i want to do i want to go here say uh go to a random call the x and y position so the y uh we will put it as negative 150 kinda a little bit in the bottom so as you can see if you move the fish you can see right what what it is so you can see this is negative 154 we put it around 150 right so and then we'll put a x position so what we want to do is we want to set up the fish between the ice block and the iceberg here so we'll have to to look into the position of the x of the iceberg okay so what we can do is this what is the way random we'll say pick it random instead of a 1 to 10 will to change this to a negative 50. so negative 50 is somewhere around this area here so this is like kind of zero right so negative 50 is somewhere here so we want to keep the fish between here and somewhere here so we're gonna we will take the x position of this ice block and we will subtract some some some x value here so that make get between this this and this so what we have to do is we go to sensing uh we have to take this one and then we will have to also use operator uh minus so we'll drop this in here with the select the iceberg first and we'll say the exposition of the iceberg so you run this this explicit is 174. so you say okay i want a minus maybe 70 right and then this whole thing if you do that minus 70 you see this 104 so we'll pick a random between negative 50 and 104 that's what it means so oops so i am going to either zoom back out i think i zoomed in too much with a little bit more complex code here so we'll put this over here so i have this right now so it will be a no between this negative 50 and whatever the x value of the iceberg minus 70 and the y is always in the bottom when the setting of the fish so we also have to say point the fish to the 90 degree just in case the fish is up in the air and the fish have to restart again with make sure to point the fish back up and then we have to say show showing the fish and we have to call our block called jump so when we call this a setup fish we'll call this method this method we'll call setup fish again so basically it's kind of like an infinite loop right so this calls this this one called stats and then we can trigger the setup fish broadcast somewhere else too so that when it start it can keep on going so the fish will kind of come up and down up and down here so we also have to set up another um event here so when um okay when i receive with another one set up fish what we are going to do is we're going to put another forever loop here so what we don't want to do we don't want to combine this together we don't let this do its own job and this one can also do its own thing because it's a forever loop here we don't want to cause any problem for this right we have to put it under inside underneath right it won't make sense so we'll keep it as a separate one so um we'll need an if condition here okay now if the uh if the fish uh touch the penguin or you said say penguin touch the fish is the same thing basically if the if they touch then you know we want to make him disappear and we're going to give some points to the uh to the player so we'll touch the penguin so we can say change the score so we will say change the score by let's say 50 points so we get 50 points to the player then we'll hide the fish so that after you catch the fish the fish disappear then it can the fish can come up again so because okay all right that's done for now um so what we need to do okay so we will actually have to wait until the iceberg finish setting the position then we have to set up the fish right because we don't know where the iceberg is going to uh generate so we have to wait until that's done first before we can set the fish so we have to go back to iceberg here so after the iceberg received get ready from the penguin right so it will set the position uh somewhere here so after this we have to call um broadcast a message say set up the fish so once this is done you the event will go back to the fish here so the fish here will have will run these two coals so we will find the position of the iceberg uh subtract uh 70 um because uh the when you find the percent iceberg is probably here in the middle right so you have to subtract 70 you kind of move it somewhere here so between that and and then 50 uh between somewhere here and here so we'll generate the fish after that cause the jump the jumbo call this set up fish again so it kind of the fish will jump up in the air down up down up down like this right so now that we have it ready let's uh kind of test this out and see how it works so let's start so as you can see the iceberg generated and then you see the fish coming down and the fish is coming back up so the fish should never uh you know kind of touch the iceberg so you see it's generating between here and here right so uh let's if we stop it again we'll stop it again we'll start again the iceberg will come in different locations and you can see the fish is kind of between that so you see the fish is between the iceberg and the in the penguin so he's always between that those two points so this gap here so because of this function here we're trying to find the position between the iceberg and the and the and his block here so the fish is always between that so we can jump up and catch the fish so let's see what happens if we jump up so you see we get the 50 points and then 61 because we landed on the ice block iceberg here so let's try again so so we got him so we got 54 for the fish and then 10 points for the uh the uh the iceberg here so total 60 and then so that's why you get 120. so you see we missed it we still got the fish but we did we missed the iceberg so only 50 points so um okay i'm not doing well in this game okay it's all right so game over so you see how we came over the fish is still kind of moving that's not what we want right we wanna when it's a game over the fish should be stopped moving right so we have to uh make some cool change too to fix that so what we have to do is we're going to go back to the penguin so here we see right touching blue color right so either he's standing on this eye block or he's hitting the edge we want to stop the fish so what we can do is broadcast a new message you say stop fish okay so when you do this it will it will broadcast the message and we can stop it so we will need this something similar so we will also want to touch the edge we also want to stop it say stop the fish all right so now we have the uh both the uh the fish um getting stopped here and then also here if it's touched the blue basically this iceberg here or if i touch the edge basically if it hit the top here the bottom of the c it will call this broadcaster's message so now we have to go back to the penguin so in the penguin so when we are not opinion so whether go back to the fish so when we go back to the fish um when we receive stop fish so we have to say um stop let's go back to control so what we want to do is say stop other script in the sprite basically we'll stop everything here or this guy here and then when the penguin get ready to launch again the fish will start again so let's try this now all right so the fish is up in the air so we catch it as you can see the fish didn't come out right until until i started back over here so let's say if i kind of lose on purpose right so you see the stop the fish stopped moving right until i started again right so so no more game over the fish stop moving right it should not be stop still moving right because we have this so we can stop the fish from moving or you can say you can also add here after this say hi to spry or something like that but that's up to you uh so pretty much this is how the game works so um so i think we got everything the penguin right we got the penguin the code for the penguin again i can show you here so we can go through it a little bit so you have the code here to to make the finger and flip this is making the pigment go back to the start this is the the green flex click we want to do something like this um what what we want to do with the penguin right we can go to the start position and this is when we receive the jump what are we doing here checking if it's touching here or touching the edge right and then we have pretty much uh then you understand this if you don't go back to the previous two video and trying to understand uh listen on it again basically this is kind of touching the blue color basically this uh spike here if you touch that you want to give them the point right making the position of the the penguin standing on top of the iceberg and all that and playing the sound and moving the finger back to the starting position if we touch the edge you stop the fish and then we minus the light right same thing here then the ice block is pretty simple right not much coal here we just kind of put them in the position iceberg we have one added one coal right this one is after the iceberg is generated we want to broadcast a message to tell the fish to be set up before that we don't want to set up the fish because we don't know where the iceberg will be generating from so after that then the arrow the arrow is pretty much the same as the before right we didn't change much uh when the when you click on the screen they will broadcast this jump which calls the penguin uh jump message here which will launch the penguin in the air and then the fish is uh the same we did that today for this lesson so this one is when the fish we created the uh the uh the definition of fish jump here uh we make the fish going up and down pointing zero uh when we point zero meaning it's pointing up uh 180 meaning pointing down right and then we have these two uh condition m2 event here what we want to do is calculate the ice bark iceberg and the position here between that before when the fish to move why this is setting up the fish to see if it catch it touch the penguin if it touch the pink when you give 50 points to the player so this is just making the fish uh smaller right in the beginning and this is stopping the fish basically once you catch the fish and you land it on here or the ocean you have to stop the fish from moving right so this is pretty much uh the video so uh please like subscribe to the channel and we will create more fun video alright thank you everyone have a good day bye you
