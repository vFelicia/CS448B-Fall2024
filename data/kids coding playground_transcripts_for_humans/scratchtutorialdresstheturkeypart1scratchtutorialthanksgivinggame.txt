00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids coding
00:09 - playground here today we're back for
00:11 - another video
00:12 - called dress the turkey we are making a
00:15 - thanksgiving themed game
00:17 - where the player can dress up the turkey
00:24 - dress the turkey we'll be learning these
00:25 - following concepts in scratch
00:28 - keys to control the sprite broadcast
00:30 - messages
00:31 - spread directions and when the sprite is
00:34 - clipped
00:36 - so i'm gonna go demo the game so let's
00:39 - go full screen
00:43 - so there's music in this game so
00:46 - i'm gonna demo the game so i play some
00:50 - music i don't know what this music is i
00:51 - just
00:52 - chose it randomly uh so there's a
00:56 - glasses
00:57 - a hat and a scarf and then these are
01:00 - like a neck scarf so you can change the
01:02 - glasses and when you click on this it'll
01:03 - turn into the other costumes for glasses
01:06 - in the other costume
01:07 - same as the hat and the car
01:13 - so you just have to you can even choose
01:15 - any scarf you want and then you can
01:17 - put it on the turkey and you can choose
01:20 - any hat you want you can also use the
01:22 - hat
01:23 - use any hat you want the glasses
01:28 - you can also change the glasses you can
01:31 - move the turkey around
01:34 - so as you could see a while ago when
01:37 - it's moving
01:38 - moving it doesn't look at you but when
01:40 - it when you stop clicking
01:41 - it looks at you and it'll stop but then
01:44 - when
01:44 - it's moving it it really
01:48 - does like a movement and
01:51 - i'm gonna put it and all the costumes
01:54 - and everything follow you
01:55 - so you can run here and then it will
01:57 - follow you and
01:58 - go wherever it is and then
02:02 - you can also do that you can change it
02:04 - up a little bit
02:05 - a little bit so that's basically what
02:07 - this game is
02:08 - so
02:09 - [Music]
02:13 - so i just started a new project here
02:16 - um so yeah if you have any questions you
02:20 - can join our studio
02:21 - ask for a request and we'll invite you
02:23 - to curator i'm normally the one who
02:24 - invites people to curator
02:26 - so yeah and we can also um
02:31 - you can also post any projects you want
02:34 - unless if it's inappropriate so anyways
02:36 - please like share subscribe and comment
02:38 - in the comment section below for what
02:39 - else content you want
02:41 - so let's get started so first you're
02:43 - going to name it
02:44 - name the project dress
02:48 - the turkey
02:53 - we're dressing the turkey and i do have
02:55 - this in my backpack
02:57 - and you can actually download our turkey
02:59 - and think but you can also make your own
03:00 - turkey
03:01 - so as you can see um right here rooster
03:06 - this is exactly the same thing as a
03:08 - turkey but i just retextured it a little
03:10 - bit
03:11 - i added another gobble to it and i took
03:15 - out the top i
03:16 - ungrouped it
03:20 - and then i took out this on top and then
03:23 - i just changed some colors so you gotta
03:24 - do this for all the
03:26 - all of them so um
03:31 - so i can just make it make this like a
03:34 - this color
03:39 - and i can just make like this this color
03:47 - and that's basically what this is and
03:49 - you also change this color
03:51 - and that's basically what is you know i
03:52 - also drew an extra gobble here because
03:55 - turkeys have two gobbles i think and you
03:58 - can just
03:58 - re raise texture a circle
04:02 - so you just re-texture a circle
04:06 - that like that and
04:09 - um you gotta do it for all of them so
04:11 - you can just duplicate it
04:12 - for all of them
04:17 - oh so sorry about that guys that's just
04:19 - the doorbell
04:20 - some dude was just stringing on your
04:22 - door now
04:24 - and uh you can re-texture this gobbler
04:29 - to make it a little bit different and
04:30 - you can just duplicate two gobblers so
04:33 - see i'm trying to retexture right here
04:41 - so i'm just re-texturing the sides to
04:46 - make it more even and then you can also
04:48 - duplicate this doppler to make two
04:50 - so ctrl c ctrl v and
04:53 - you can just turn it around click the
04:55 - mouse turn it around a little bit
04:58 - and do this so this one looks a little
05:01 - bit worse than my other one so
05:03 - and you also have to rename it to turkey
05:05 - so
05:06 - let's go yeah like that that's like a
05:09 - gobble
05:10 - and rooster b you gotta do it for russia
05:12 - b and c
05:13 - and c you gotta change it up a little
05:15 - bit because he's looking at you so
05:17 - um yeah i'm gonna delete the rooster
05:22 - so i also have some other things in my
05:25 - backpack
05:30 - uh as the the button but we will get to
05:33 - that
05:34 - maybe later so it's just
05:38 - the scarf the next button for the scarf
05:40 - the hat and the
05:41 - um glasses just to duplicate it and
05:43 - change it up
05:45 - so i'm going to show you how to draw the
05:47 - buttons
05:49 - so it's just a circle
05:53 - and then a um
05:59 - and then so we have a circle
06:03 - choose a color and put no outfield so no
06:06 - outline
06:07 - so uh
06:10 - this is the circle click shift to make a
06:13 - perfect circle
06:15 - and then center it and then
06:21 - you have to put a square and make it a
06:24 - darker color
06:33 - you want to make a darker square and
06:35 - also you can duplicate that
06:37 - and there's a trick you can cut half of
06:39 - it
06:41 - by clicking the reshape tool and then
06:43 - clicking the backup space and select the
06:45 - corner
06:46 - and then change it up a little bit and
06:47 - drag this over
06:49 - to make one of these um
06:52 - scarf buttons
06:56 - and the rest is easy just put a text
06:58 - called scarf
07:02 - on top choose a
07:05 - scarf and use any font you want but i
07:08 - use i think i use handwriting
07:10 - so handwriting
07:13 - so yeah you can also do that it's really
07:15 - easy that's how you make a button
07:17 - so we can duplicate all the buttons so
07:20 - let's do it right now
07:28 - so make three and then this one i'm
07:30 - going to change the costume
07:34 - so
07:37 - when i had my thing i the outer one
07:41 - was a lighter red
07:44 - so right here and the
07:47 - other one inside was a darker red so
07:50 - that's basically how i made the
07:53 - emoji i mean the square
08:04 - and then
08:08 - oh my god
08:11 - this and over there that's basically how
08:13 - you do it and you just drag the scarf
08:16 - pointer and then change the color
08:22 - there it's basically how you do it it's
08:26 - basically how you make a butt
08:34 - so you got to make the hat and glasses
08:36 - so
08:38 - hat
08:41 - center this
08:44 - and then we can this one was the other
08:46 - one and this one was the glasses
08:49 - so the glasses was a green so
08:52 - turn up turn down the saturation
08:59 - like that and then you can make the that
09:02 - thing
09:04 - then also turn up the center saturation
09:11 - and then you can make
09:23 - so um i'm gonna change the color
09:31 - just the scarf glasses
09:38 - and then i'm gonna drag that inside but
09:40 - first i'm gonna change the color
09:42 - to darker green
09:48 - maybe higher saturation do it
09:51 - and then we can also put the pointer the
09:53 - glasses inside
09:55 - center it correctly
09:58 - and there we're done with the glasses
09:59 - button
10:02 - and we can change the glasses choice
10:05 - and then minus the three and then
10:09 - the hat choice and minus the two so
10:13 - that's for these two things
10:17 - so and you also need the hat
10:23 - the scarf
10:30 - and the uh glasses
10:39 - so these are all the things that you
10:40 - have to decorate the turkey with
10:42 - so i'm gonna work on the turkey right
10:44 - now
10:45 - and um let's check this out and
10:54 - let's put these somewhere
11:03 - so let's put these somewhere else that's
11:05 - not touching the turkey so
11:08 - um let's start on the turkey so when the
11:11 - green flag is clicked
11:13 - it will oh yeah we can also do the
11:15 - backdrops right now so
11:18 - i use jungle i'm not sure if our turkeys
11:21 - live in the jungle
11:23 - but you know why not so when the green
11:26 - flag is clicked
11:27 - go to back layer
11:32 - and forever
11:36 - it will if then if then the key
11:40 - left arrows clicked because we can make
11:42 - a move
11:45 - then point in direction negative 90. so
11:47 - we got to set the
11:48 - rotation down left right it's already on
11:51 - so
11:52 - point in direction 90.
12:02 - so negative 90 and then move 10 steps
12:07 - broadcast which costume
12:11 - and wait
12:21 - and also yeah right arrow if then the
12:24 - right arrow
12:27 - is pressed we'll point in direction 90.
12:33 - so i forgot to add a weight 0.1 seconds
12:37 - over here
12:38 - so or second because it's only one in
12:40 - the point direction 90
12:41 - move 10 steps broadcast switch costume
12:44 - and weight and also
12:45 - wait 0.1 seconds
12:50 - so we're going to work on the scarf but
12:52 - we're not done with the turkey yet so we
12:54 - are going to work on the scarf in this
12:55 - part
12:56 - so the green flag is clicked it'll go
12:59 - forever
13:00 - and then if then it's not touching any
13:02 - heat press so
13:04 - not
13:08 - key and you pressed because when you're
13:11 - not
13:12 - holding a key down then it will
13:16 - look at you like he's saying bro or
13:18 - something so he's basically looking at
13:20 - you
13:21 - so switch costume to rooster c
13:26 - see this is rooster c rooster b rooster
13:28 - a
13:30 - so when the green flat i mean
13:34 - when when i receive switch costume and
13:37 - you need if then else
13:39 - if then else if the costume number
13:41 - equals one so
13:42 - costume number equals one so the costume
13:45 - number um
13:47 - thing is right here
13:50 - hustler number equals one so this is
13:53 - costume
13:54 - number one rooster a so costume number
13:57 - equals one
13:58 - i'll switch costume to rooster b because
14:00 - it's either one
14:02 - or the other because he's moving else
14:06 - it's rooster a
14:10 - so
14:14 - i'm gonna work on the scarf in this part
14:16 - so i'm gonna show you if it works or not
14:18 - because it probably does work
14:20 - because i coded it so
14:24 - so uh as you can see i'm moving him he's
14:28 - moving he's putting the two
14:30 - costumes swapping from those two
14:31 - costumes and the third costume
14:34 - is the one where he's looking at you so
14:36 - i'm not clicking any keys right now
14:38 - so it's like this
14:42 - so yeah
14:45 - and i'm gonna work on the scarf
14:48 - because um this part i think we're gonna
14:51 - do the scarf
14:54 - and uh and i think that's gonna be it
14:58 - for this part so
14:59 - when the green flag is it clicked i'll
15:01 - switch costume to scarf
15:04 - a and go to
15:08 - x 174 so i do have coordinates but this
15:11 - i just dragged it somewhere random so i
15:13 - wouldn't touch the turkey
15:14 - so i already have where it should go
15:17 - 174 why 110 go into front
15:21 - layer so always make sure it's on the
15:25 - front layer
15:26 - and then when i receive
15:29 - switch costume next costume
15:37 - so i was just kidding about this uh-huh
15:39 - i was actually wrong
15:40 - so the scarf choice and the scarf so i'm
15:43 - going to finish coating up this scarf
15:46 - so when the sprite is clicked
15:49 - you need it if then else
15:52 - if then else the
15:57 - direction of the turkey so this is the
15:59 - tricky block
16:05 - direction of the turkey is more than
16:08 - zero
16:09 - then it'll point in direction 90
16:16 - and glide one second to
16:24 - to um
16:25 - [Music]
16:29 - you need a plus so glide one second
16:32 - to x position i'll describe all this
16:35 - later and i'll show you what it means
16:38 - exposition where's the exposition of
16:40 - turkey
16:41 - right here so the other turkey block
16:45 - of turkey exposition is already there
16:49 - and then the y
16:52 - y position and inside here
16:56 - you have to write 30 so that's a
16:58 - coordinate
17:00 - so that's for that and then pointing
17:02 - direction
17:04 - negative 90 right here
17:08 - and it'll glide one second
17:13 - to x position
17:18 - minus
17:28 - minus 30
17:31 - and y position
17:35 - so feel free to pause the video whenever
17:37 - you need it
17:38 - and also you need it forever
17:44 - so i'm gonna change the rotation style
17:46 - to left right
17:48 - so right here and i'm gonna show you
17:50 - what this means
17:51 - so um as you can see i'm
17:55 - my turkey is walking and i'm pointing to
17:57 - the left side because i walk to the left
17:59 - side
18:00 - and then when i click on it it'll be on
18:02 - the left side
18:06 - so this is the left side code this is
18:09 - the left side code event and this is the
18:10 - right side code
18:11 - and then as you can see if i'm on the
18:13 - right side
18:14 - it will move to the right side
18:18 - and then if i'm pointing this way i'll
18:20 - move like this
18:22 - so that's basically what it is
18:26 - so i'm going to show you guys what i
18:27 - mean so i'm going to take out that block
18:32 - put this on top and
18:36 - as you can see the x position of turkey
18:40 - if you do not have that
18:42 - it will glide to knot on its neck
18:44 - because you want it to be on its neck
18:46 - because it's a scarf so
18:49 - that is why you need the plus 30 for the
18:53 - side
18:53 - so that's basically why you need it and
18:56 - see look it's not on it's on the tail
18:58 - who wears a scarf on a tail
19:00 - exactly if you wear the neck so that's
19:02 - why you need a plus 30
19:05 - for the x because plus 30 for the x will
19:07 - move around there
19:08 - so that's a coordinate so
19:12 - yeah so as you can see it doesn't work
19:14 - because i have to do negative 30
19:17 - because it's on the left side and left
19:19 - side is always negative so
19:23 - yeah so let's do this see
19:30 - and it doesn't work if you have positive
19:31 - 30.
19:35 - so i'm gonna um delete this script
19:39 - and then we're gonna keep on working so
19:41 - in the forever
19:43 - you need a if then else
19:48 - if then else the
19:51 - the direction of the turkey so
19:54 - just duplicate this the direction
19:58 - of the turkey is greater than zero
20:01 - then it'll point in direction 90 which
20:04 - is the right side
20:06 - um because 360 is a full circle
20:09 - full circle i think so it's
20:12 - pointing to the right side so set x
20:16 - and we'll set x to
20:20 - um you need minus so
20:23 - set x to uh
20:26 - x position
20:32 - plus let's say you set x
20:35 - to x position plus 30 mn not minus i
20:38 - meant
20:39 - plus a uh x position plus
20:42 - 30. so that's basically how you do it
20:45 - and then you can just duplicate this and
20:46 - do it on the right side so
20:48 - point in direction negative 90
20:53 - and then instead it's minus
21:00 - so we have it right here duplicate
21:04 - to minus x position of turkey and then
21:06 - it'll set y
21:12 - to y position of turkey
21:17 - so that's how you code the scarf so
21:20 - i'm i'm gonna post second part tomorrow
21:23 - so
21:26 - so i'm gonna do scarf choice in this
21:28 - part too to make it really quick
21:30 - so when this sprite is clicked
21:34 - it'll broadcast
21:37 - scarf choice
21:47 - and then when the green flag is clicked
21:50 - it will go to a coordinate i have
21:52 - already written down so
21:53 - go to x 155 y
21:58 - negative 139 so it's around the same
22:00 - spot but
22:01 - i already have it like that so and then
22:03 - when i receive
22:06 - when the scarf receives the message
22:11 - when i receive the message i'll go next
22:15 - costume
22:20 - so i'm gonna show you guys this project
22:22 - right now
22:23 - so i'm gonna show you the game so turkey
22:26 - walking frequently
22:28 - scarf changing so
22:32 - scarf changing click scarf change
22:36 - so that's basically how this game works
22:38 - right now because i don't have the
22:40 - glasses
22:40 - and the hat right now so
22:44 - yeah so on your own you can go
22:47 - you guys can try the cat and the glasses
22:49 - on your own
22:50 - it's a little bit different so it's
22:53 - pretty similar
22:54 - but just a little bit different and a
22:57 - number two could be going out tomorrow
23:00 - so please like
23:01 - share subscribe and comment in the
23:03 - comment section below for what else
23:04 - content you want
23:06 - see you guys
23:08 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here today we're back for another video called dress the turkey we are making a thanksgiving themed game where the player can dress up the turkey dress the turkey we'll be learning these following concepts in scratch keys to control the sprite broadcast messages spread directions and when the sprite is clipped so i'm gonna go demo the game so let's go full screen so there's music in this game so i'm gonna demo the game so i play some music i don't know what this music is i just chose it randomly uh so there's a glasses a hat and a scarf and then these are like a neck scarf so you can change the glasses and when you click on this it'll turn into the other costumes for glasses in the other costume same as the hat and the car so you just have to you can even choose any scarf you want and then you can put it on the turkey and you can choose any hat you want you can also use the hat use any hat you want the glasses you can also change the glasses you can move the turkey around so as you could see a while ago when it's moving moving it doesn't look at you but when it when you stop clicking it looks at you and it'll stop but then when it's moving it it really does like a movement and i'm gonna put it and all the costumes and everything follow you so you can run here and then it will follow you and go wherever it is and then you can also do that you can change it up a little bit a little bit so that's basically what this game is so so i just started a new project here um so yeah if you have any questions you can join our studio ask for a request and we'll invite you to curator i'm normally the one who invites people to curator so yeah and we can also um you can also post any projects you want unless if it's inappropriate so anyways please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below for what else content you want so let's get started so first you're going to name it name the project dress the turkey we're dressing the turkey and i do have this in my backpack and you can actually download our turkey and think but you can also make your own turkey so as you can see um right here rooster this is exactly the same thing as a turkey but i just retextured it a little bit i added another gobble to it and i took out the top i ungrouped it and then i took out this on top and then i just changed some colors so you gotta do this for all the all of them so um so i can just make it make this like a this color and i can just make like this this color and that's basically what this is and you also change this color and that's basically what is you know i also drew an extra gobble here because turkeys have two gobbles i think and you can just re raise texture a circle so you just retexture a circle that like that and um you gotta do it for all of them so you can just duplicate it for all of them oh so sorry about that guys that's just the doorbell some dude was just stringing on your door now and uh you can retexture this gobbler to make it a little bit different and you can just duplicate two gobblers so see i'm trying to retexture right here so i'm just retexturing the sides to make it more even and then you can also duplicate this doppler to make two so ctrl c ctrl v and you can just turn it around click the mouse turn it around a little bit and do this so this one looks a little bit worse than my other one so and you also have to rename it to turkey so let's go yeah like that that's like a gobble and rooster b you gotta do it for russia b and c and c you gotta change it up a little bit because he's looking at you so um yeah i'm gonna delete the rooster so i also have some other things in my backpack uh as the the button but we will get to that maybe later so it's just the scarf the next button for the scarf the hat and the um glasses just to duplicate it and change it up so i'm going to show you how to draw the buttons so it's just a circle and then a um and then so we have a circle choose a color and put no outfield so no outline so uh this is the circle click shift to make a perfect circle and then center it and then you have to put a square and make it a darker color you want to make a darker square and also you can duplicate that and there's a trick you can cut half of it by clicking the reshape tool and then clicking the backup space and select the corner and then change it up a little bit and drag this over to make one of these um scarf buttons and the rest is easy just put a text called scarf on top choose a scarf and use any font you want but i use i think i use handwriting so handwriting so yeah you can also do that it's really easy that's how you make a button so we can duplicate all the buttons so let's do it right now so make three and then this one i'm going to change the costume so when i had my thing i the outer one was a lighter red so right here and the other one inside was a darker red so that's basically how i made the emoji i mean the square and then oh my god this and over there that's basically how you do it and you just drag the scarf pointer and then change the color there it's basically how you do it it's basically how you make a butt so you got to make the hat and glasses so hat center this and then we can this one was the other one and this one was the glasses so the glasses was a green so turn up turn down the saturation like that and then you can make the that thing then also turn up the center saturation and then you can make so um i'm gonna change the color just the scarf glasses and then i'm gonna drag that inside but first i'm gonna change the color to darker green maybe higher saturation do it and then we can also put the pointer the glasses inside center it correctly and there we're done with the glasses button and we can change the glasses choice and then minus the three and then the hat choice and minus the two so that's for these two things so and you also need the hat the scarf and the uh glasses so these are all the things that you have to decorate the turkey with so i'm gonna work on the turkey right now and um let's check this out and let's put these somewhere so let's put these somewhere else that's not touching the turkey so um let's start on the turkey so when the green flag is clicked it will oh yeah we can also do the backdrops right now so i use jungle i'm not sure if our turkeys live in the jungle but you know why not so when the green flag is clicked go to back layer and forever it will if then if then the key left arrows clicked because we can make a move then point in direction negative 90. so we got to set the rotation down left right it's already on so point in direction 90. so negative 90 and then move 10 steps broadcast which costume and wait and also yeah right arrow if then the right arrow is pressed we'll point in direction 90. so i forgot to add a weight 0.1 seconds over here so or second because it's only one in the point direction 90 move 10 steps broadcast switch costume and weight and also wait 0.1 seconds so we're going to work on the scarf but we're not done with the turkey yet so we are going to work on the scarf in this part so the green flag is clicked it'll go forever and then if then it's not touching any heat press so not key and you pressed because when you're not holding a key down then it will look at you like he's saying bro or something so he's basically looking at you so switch costume to rooster c see this is rooster c rooster b rooster a so when the green flat i mean when when i receive switch costume and you need if then else if then else if the costume number equals one so costume number equals one so the costume number um thing is right here hustler number equals one so this is costume number one rooster a so costume number equals one i'll switch costume to rooster b because it's either one or the other because he's moving else it's rooster a so i'm gonna work on the scarf in this part so i'm gonna show you if it works or not because it probably does work because i coded it so so uh as you can see i'm moving him he's moving he's putting the two costumes swapping from those two costumes and the third costume is the one where he's looking at you so i'm not clicking any keys right now so it's like this so yeah and i'm gonna work on the scarf because um this part i think we're gonna do the scarf and uh and i think that's gonna be it for this part so when the green flag is it clicked i'll switch costume to scarf a and go to x 174 so i do have coordinates but this i just dragged it somewhere random so i wouldn't touch the turkey so i already have where it should go 174 why 110 go into front layer so always make sure it's on the front layer and then when i receive switch costume next costume so i was just kidding about this uhhuh i was actually wrong so the scarf choice and the scarf so i'm going to finish coating up this scarf so when the sprite is clicked you need it if then else if then else the direction of the turkey so this is the tricky block direction of the turkey is more than zero then it'll point in direction 90 and glide one second to to um you need a plus so glide one second to x position i'll describe all this later and i'll show you what it means exposition where's the exposition of turkey right here so the other turkey block of turkey exposition is already there and then the y y position and inside here you have to write 30 so that's a coordinate so that's for that and then pointing direction negative 90 right here and it'll glide one second to x position minus minus 30 and y position so feel free to pause the video whenever you need it and also you need it forever so i'm gonna change the rotation style to left right so right here and i'm gonna show you what this means so um as you can see i'm my turkey is walking and i'm pointing to the left side because i walk to the left side and then when i click on it it'll be on the left side so this is the left side code this is the left side code event and this is the right side code and then as you can see if i'm on the right side it will move to the right side and then if i'm pointing this way i'll move like this so that's basically what it is so i'm going to show you guys what i mean so i'm going to take out that block put this on top and as you can see the x position of turkey if you do not have that it will glide to knot on its neck because you want it to be on its neck because it's a scarf so that is why you need the plus 30 for the side so that's basically why you need it and see look it's not on it's on the tail who wears a scarf on a tail exactly if you wear the neck so that's why you need a plus 30 for the x because plus 30 for the x will move around there so that's a coordinate so yeah so as you can see it doesn't work because i have to do negative 30 because it's on the left side and left side is always negative so yeah so let's do this see and it doesn't work if you have positive 30. so i'm gonna um delete this script and then we're gonna keep on working so in the forever you need a if then else if then else the the direction of the turkey so just duplicate this the direction of the turkey is greater than zero then it'll point in direction 90 which is the right side um because 360 is a full circle full circle i think so it's pointing to the right side so set x and we'll set x to um you need minus so set x to uh x position plus let's say you set x to x position plus 30 mn not minus i meant plus a uh x position plus 30. so that's basically how you do it and then you can just duplicate this and do it on the right side so point in direction negative 90 and then instead it's minus so we have it right here duplicate to minus x position of turkey and then it'll set y to y position of turkey so that's how you code the scarf so i'm i'm gonna post second part tomorrow so so i'm gonna do scarf choice in this part too to make it really quick so when this sprite is clicked it'll broadcast scarf choice and then when the green flag is clicked it will go to a coordinate i have already written down so go to x 155 y negative 139 so it's around the same spot but i already have it like that so and then when i receive when the scarf receives the message when i receive the message i'll go next costume so i'm gonna show you guys this project right now so i'm gonna show you the game so turkey walking frequently scarf changing so scarf changing click scarf change so that's basically how this game works right now because i don't have the glasses and the hat right now so yeah so on your own you can go you guys can try the cat and the glasses on your own it's a little bit different so it's pretty similar but just a little bit different and a number two could be going out tomorrow so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below for what else content you want see you guys
