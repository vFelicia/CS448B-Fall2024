00:03 - [Music]
00:10 - so welcome back guys to kids coding
00:12 - playground
00:13 - today we'll be doing a christmas
00:14 - platformer in scratch
00:16 - um we decided to do a christmas
00:18 - platformer because christmas is coming
00:20 - up
00:20 - soon and it's basically a generic
00:23 - platformer use the arrow keys to move
00:24 - around
00:25 - you use the arrow keys or the wasd and
00:28 - then you jump over obstacles
00:30 - um to prevent dying and you want to get
00:32 - to the green flag to advance
00:33 - in the next level okay and then before
00:36 - we start
00:37 - we will want to learn these following
00:39 - concepts in scratch
00:41 - variables broadcasting messages custom
00:43 - blocks
00:45 - operators cloning and platformer logic
00:48 - and then we have two people we want to
00:50 - give a shout out to these two people
00:52 - gave us a suggestion to make a christmas
00:55 - platformer in scratch
00:57 - because christmas is coming up this uh
00:59 - first person
01:00 - gave us the idea first so big thanks
01:04 - to both of you for giving us the idea
01:06 - for making a christmas platformer
01:09 - so before we start please like share and
01:12 - subscribe
01:13 - okay now let's move on to the tutorial
01:15 - okay so
01:16 - now we have our project so we got a new
01:19 - project
01:19 - so we're gonna first rename our project
01:22 - so let's name it christmas
01:25 - black black former so
01:28 - first we're going to delete the scratch
01:29 - cat will not need that so we're going to
01:31 - upload some sprites
01:32 - from our backpack and we have these
01:34 - sprites in the google drive in the
01:36 - description below so you can just
01:37 - download them in the description so
01:40 - we're gonna upload them
01:41 - so we have the green flag we have the
01:44 - snow
01:46 - like the snow effect we have the ground
01:49 - so i already have all the costumes
01:52 - for the ground like right here we'll
01:54 - send we'll put a couple of them inside
01:56 - the google drive
01:58 - um so yeah this is like the ground
02:01 - and then we'll get the spikes we'll have
02:04 - this in the google drive you can draw
02:05 - your own as well if you want it's not
02:07 - that hard to draw
02:08 - and then we have the player actual
02:10 - player
02:11 - main character so the player and main
02:13 - character are different so you can name
02:14 - this
02:15 - the animated character like we taught
02:18 - inside the
02:18 - mangas platformer
02:23 - [Music]
02:25 - okay animated character and this is the
02:27 - main characters like this thing follows
02:29 - this thing
02:31 - and then we have the trampoline which is
02:34 - like the bounce pad thing like we have
02:37 - eight costumes for it it's in the
02:38 - description as well
02:39 - okay so now we have all our sprites
02:42 - let's get
02:43 - working onto the code and before we work
02:46 - on the code let's work
02:47 - and get a backdrop so for the backdrop
02:50 - i got this backdrop it was like oh i
02:53 - think it's like called snow or something
02:56 - it's no uh
02:59 - let me find it soon you can you can
03:02 - actually pick anything you want
03:04 - um it was winter yeah i found it okay so
03:06 - this one was the one i picked
03:08 - but what i did was um i deleted these
03:11 - trees
03:12 - so it was just basically a hill snowy
03:15 - hill
03:16 - and i made a um round right here
03:21 - so yeah so that's what i did for the
03:23 - backdrop
03:25 - okay so now let's start coding
03:28 - when when we start we want to uh get our
03:31 - one green flag clicked
03:34 - let's make it bigger this is in the main
03:36 - character by the way so we're
03:37 - we're going to be coding in the main
03:38 - character right now so when green flag
03:41 - is clicked
03:41 - we're going to set the size to 50 i'm
03:43 - pretty sure it is but if yours
03:45 - it's not then you want to set to 50
03:46 - because 100 is way too big
03:48 - and then we're going to set the ghost
03:50 - effect of the main character to 100
03:53 - because we will not be using it to show
03:57 - but we don't want to hide it as well
03:59 - because then it would just like not be
04:00 - able to feel anything
04:01 - we're going to make a ghost effect 100
04:04 - and then in the beginning
04:05 - let's make some uh variables so
04:09 - we already have two variables right here
04:11 - one is deviation one is jumping we'll
04:13 - need those later
04:14 - we will not need them right now so you
04:15 - can just ignore that for now we're gonna
04:17 - make a new
04:17 - a variable called level so this is for
04:20 - all sprites
04:22 - um level so this just to track what
04:25 - level you're on so in the beginning
04:27 - of course we want to set the level to
04:29 - one
04:32 - and then we're going to make a new
04:34 - custom block for resetting the player so
04:35 - we're going to name it reset
04:37 - player so this just to reset the player
04:40 - position and all that
04:41 - so um just write reset player or
04:45 - whatever you want reset and then click
04:46 - ok
04:47 - so now let's so we want to reset him at
04:51 - x negative 200
04:54 - y y0 that's what i did
04:58 - and then we're going to make another
04:59 - player so we're going to put a g
05:01 - in front of all the global variables so
05:03 - we're going to g
05:04 - is player dead so this just detect if
05:07 - the
05:08 - player is dead or not so is player dead
05:13 - g velocity we'll need these all of these
05:16 - um
05:17 - variables later but we'll not need them
05:19 - like right now
05:20 - we're just going to like reset them
05:22 - right here and then we're going to
05:24 - need g on ground so this is the detect
05:27 - it's on the ground
05:28 - the code in this um platformer is very
05:31 - similar
05:32 - to the among us platformer so you can
05:34 - use the among us platformer for
05:36 - reference
05:37 - and then g gravity
05:40 - g gravity and then
05:44 - we have jumping which we already made so
05:47 - anything that is um like without
05:50 - the g in front of it is not global
05:54 - so you want to make jumping as a um for
05:56 - the sprite only
05:58 - so we made jumping as a for the sprite
06:00 - only
06:01 - so gotta make this as for the sprite
06:03 - only
06:04 - okay so next we want to reset all the
06:07 - variables so
06:08 - let's set g is player dead
06:12 - to no because when the game starts he's
06:16 - not dead
06:17 - i'm going to set a lot of variables to
06:19 - zero so
06:20 - g velocity to zero
06:23 - duplicate another one set g on ground to
06:26 - zero
06:27 - and then set g of gravity to negative
06:29 - one the gravity is always going to be
06:31 - negative one
06:31 - it's going to be going down by negative
06:33 - one every time
06:35 - and then we're going to set the variable
06:37 - jumping
06:39 - to zero okay
06:42 - and then right here and this is what
06:43 - green flag clicked after we
06:45 - set all this we want to do reset player
06:48 - right here
06:50 - and then we're going to broadcast a
06:51 - message and then we're going to name it
06:54 - start game
06:57 - start game and then we're going to
06:59 - broadcast another message called start
07:00 - new level we need this later
07:03 - start new loud
07:07 - so start a new game and start new level
07:09 - so
07:11 - after you got start game and start new
07:12 - level let's work on the movement
07:16 - okay so for the movement we're going to
07:18 - make a new block
07:20 - so let's make a block let's name it
07:22 - movement control
07:25 - movement control
07:29 - okay so now we have our custom block oh
07:32 - yeah and also for the custom block
07:34 - don't forget to run screen without
07:36 - refresh so
07:37 - it will always const will be constantly
07:40 - updating so you want to check that
07:42 - okay so we have the custom block let's
07:44 - put that right here
07:46 - okay all right now let's define it so
07:50 - we're gonna do if go to control
07:54 - okay let's drag the if then block into
07:56 - here and then let's get it or
07:59 - so we're going to do if you can do the
08:01 - right arrow or the
08:03 - wasd so if key right arrow
08:07 - or key was d key d
08:10 - which is for the right is i will
08:14 - set the variable g
08:17 - speed x we're going to make a new
08:19 - variable called g
08:20 - speed x okay it's for all sprites
08:23 - remember all sprites
08:27 - all variables with the g in front is for
08:28 - all sprites
08:30 - so g speed x we're going to set the g
08:32 - speed x
08:33 - over here p speed x to 7 so this v is
08:37 - gonna be seven
08:38 - you can make it any speed you want but i
08:39 - preferred seven so let's duplicate this
08:42 - put that under here and then when the
08:43 - left arrow is being pressed or a
08:47 - then we're gonna do g speed x to
08:49 - negative seven so it's moving to the
08:50 - left
08:53 - and then we're gonna set so this is like
08:55 - the little
08:56 - um what's it called friction so those
08:59 - grip patches code
09:00 - we have the friction so we're gonna set
09:03 - the g speed x
09:05 - g speed x uh we're going to multiply it
09:09 - by 0.8 gcp dx multiplied by 0.8
09:12 - so yeah so let's go to operators get a
09:15 - multiplication symbol
09:18 - okay multiply it by 0.8 and then we
09:21 - could get the g speed x
09:24 - g speed x put that in here okay and
09:27 - after that we want to get an if then
09:28 - statement
09:29 - if um
09:33 - actually no let's do this later we're
09:35 - gonna have to make
09:36 - another custom block so this is like to
09:38 - actually actually
09:40 - move the player so we're gonna do
09:43 - another my block so let's name it move
09:46 - player
09:47 - player and then we're gonna make a new
09:49 - input let's name it speed
09:51 - x so it's going to be the new input okay
09:54 - so now you have to run it screen without
09:57 - refresh
09:58 - so it's always constantly updating okay
10:01 - so now we have this
10:02 - new custom block right here
10:06 - so let's define it right now let's okay
10:08 - so we're gonna
10:10 - go to we're gonna get to the go to uh
10:12 - chain
10:13 - sorry not go to change x so we want to
10:16 - change the x by speed x and right here
10:18 - we're going to call the speed x right
10:19 - here
10:20 - so if uh
10:24 - uh greater than symbol
10:27 - so if the absolute value of
10:31 - the g speed x
10:34 - g speed x is greater than 0.9
10:38 - then we're going to move the player to
10:39 - the round of the speed x
10:41 - move the player so we're going to be
10:43 - calling this that means it'll change the
10:45 - x
10:46 - by the round of t speed x so what this
10:49 - is just friction
10:50 - so we're gonna round g spx
10:55 - okay now let's try it out
10:58 - oh yeah and before we start we can't we
11:01 - can't this does not work yet
11:02 - so first we need to code something else
11:04 - so remember we broadcast in message
11:06 - start game so we're gonna go events
11:10 - when i receive start game we're gonna
11:12 - have to um
11:14 - get a show
11:18 - and we're gonna get a repeat until so
11:20 - we're gonna repeat until
11:22 - is player dead okay so
11:25 - so if the player dead is equal to yes
11:28 - the player
11:29 - is dead equals yes so if it's dead then
11:32 - we're gonna
11:33 - broadcast another message i'm gonna call
11:36 - it
11:36 - start all control
11:40 - so we're gonna need this to activate all
11:43 - the control
11:44 - control and then we're going to
11:46 - broadcast to other messages we will not
11:48 - need right now
11:49 - we'll need them in the future though so
11:51 - just pay attention so you know you'll
11:53 - remember that you will need these
11:55 - messages so we're going to check
11:58 - platform
12:00 - sorry platform detection
12:05 - so check platform detection okay and
12:08 - we're going to make one more
12:10 - uh let's name this one check player
12:13 - position so this checking
12:14 - pointer position
12:20 - okay so after this um we're gonna get
12:23 - one more thing so we're gonna get a um
12:27 - we're gonna get an start all control so
12:29 - when i receive
12:30 - start all control we're gonna
12:33 - call the movement control variable so
12:36 - i mean not variable custom block
12:38 - movement controls right here
12:40 - let's call that so then it'll run this
12:45 - okay so if you want this to show the
12:47 - character
12:48 - you have to take out the ghost effect so
12:50 - as you can see when you play
12:52 - it now the player can move around
12:55 - as you can see there's a bit friction as
12:56 - well
12:58 - so yeah this is the main character you
13:00 - can add the set ghost effect back
13:03 - so now we can make the ma the animated
13:06 - character go to
13:07 - the actual this thing animated character
13:11 - so i hope you have all of this done
13:15 - okay so once you're done with this we're
13:16 - gonna go to the animated character
13:19 - and then we're going to get a one green
13:20 - flag clicked go to front layer let's
13:22 - make this bigger
13:23 - when green flag clicked go to front
13:25 - layer as the animated character remember
13:28 - we're in the animated character sprite
13:30 - and then we're going to get a forever
13:31 - loop forever
13:34 - forever and we're gonna make this go to
13:37 - the main character
13:39 - name and i'm gonna make sure this is
13:41 - don't die
13:42 - left and right so remember to set this
13:44 - as rotation styles left to right
13:46 - so then it will not flip upside down
13:49 - okay so now let's get another one green
13:51 - flank clicked
13:52 - when green flag is clicked we're gonna
13:54 - get a forever loop
13:57 - if the key
14:00 - right or d is being pressed so key
14:05 - right
14:08 - key right arrow or
14:11 - uh d is being pressed then
14:14 - we can point in direction of 90
14:19 - and then we can just duplicate this if
14:21 - key left
14:24 - arrow or a is being pressed then a point
14:26 - direction of negative 90 so it's facing
14:28 - the left
14:30 - so as you can see now let's play it as
14:33 - you can see
14:34 - this player an animated character went
14:36 - to the
14:37 - main character and now when you move it
14:40 - you can see
14:41 - um the anime character is going to it
14:43 - and you can move around
14:45 - so yeah i think that should be it for
14:47 - this tutorial
14:49 - so this is going to be the first part of
14:51 - the
14:53 - christmas pokemon series so if you

14:59 - and

15:06 - guys bye
15:16 - you

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys to kids coding playground today we'll be doing a christmas platformer in scratch um we decided to do a christmas platformer because christmas is coming up soon and it's basically a generic platformer use the arrow keys to move around you use the arrow keys or the wasd and then you jump over obstacles um to prevent dying and you want to get to the green flag to advance in the next level okay and then before we start we will want to learn these following concepts in scratch variables broadcasting messages custom blocks operators cloning and platformer logic and then we have two people we want to give a shout out to these two people gave us a suggestion to make a christmas platformer in scratch because christmas is coming up this uh first person gave us the idea first so big thanks to both of you for giving us the idea for making a christmas platformer so before we start please like share and subscribe okay now let's move on to the tutorial okay so now we have our project so we got a new project so we're gonna first rename our project so let's name it christmas black black former so first we're going to delete the scratch cat will not need that so we're going to upload some sprites from our backpack and we have these sprites in the google drive in the description below so you can just download them in the description so we're gonna upload them so we have the green flag we have the snow like the snow effect we have the ground so i already have all the costumes for the ground like right here we'll send we'll put a couple of them inside the google drive um so yeah this is like the ground and then we'll get the spikes we'll have this in the google drive you can draw your own as well if you want it's not that hard to draw and then we have the player actual player main character so the player and main character are different so you can name this the animated character like we taught inside the mangas platformer okay animated character and this is the main characters like this thing follows this thing and then we have the trampoline which is like the bounce pad thing like we have eight costumes for it it's in the description as well okay so now we have all our sprites let's get working onto the code and before we work on the code let's work and get a backdrop so for the backdrop i got this backdrop it was like oh i think it's like called snow or something it's no uh let me find it soon you can you can actually pick anything you want um it was winter yeah i found it okay so this one was the one i picked but what i did was um i deleted these trees so it was just basically a hill snowy hill and i made a um round right here so yeah so that's what i did for the backdrop okay so now let's start coding when when we start we want to uh get our one green flag clicked let's make it bigger this is in the main character by the way so we're we're going to be coding in the main character right now so when green flag is clicked we're going to set the size to 50 i'm pretty sure it is but if yours it's not then you want to set to 50 because 100 is way too big and then we're going to set the ghost effect of the main character to 100 because we will not be using it to show but we don't want to hide it as well because then it would just like not be able to feel anything we're going to make a ghost effect 100 and then in the beginning let's make some uh variables so we already have two variables right here one is deviation one is jumping we'll need those later we will not need them right now so you can just ignore that for now we're gonna make a new a variable called level so this is for all sprites um level so this just to track what level you're on so in the beginning of course we want to set the level to one and then we're going to make a new custom block for resetting the player so we're going to name it reset player so this just to reset the player position and all that so um just write reset player or whatever you want reset and then click ok so now let's so we want to reset him at x negative 200 y y0 that's what i did and then we're going to make another player so we're going to put a g in front of all the global variables so we're going to g is player dead so this just detect if the player is dead or not so is player dead g velocity we'll need these all of these um variables later but we'll not need them like right now we're just going to like reset them right here and then we're going to need g on ground so this is the detect it's on the ground the code in this um platformer is very similar to the among us platformer so you can use the among us platformer for reference and then g gravity g gravity and then we have jumping which we already made so anything that is um like without the g in front of it is not global so you want to make jumping as a um for the sprite only so we made jumping as a for the sprite only so gotta make this as for the sprite only okay so next we want to reset all the variables so let's set g is player dead to no because when the game starts he's not dead i'm going to set a lot of variables to zero so g velocity to zero duplicate another one set g on ground to zero and then set g of gravity to negative one the gravity is always going to be negative one it's going to be going down by negative one every time and then we're going to set the variable jumping to zero okay and then right here and this is what green flag clicked after we set all this we want to do reset player right here and then we're going to broadcast a message and then we're going to name it start game start game and then we're going to broadcast another message called start new level we need this later start new loud so start a new game and start new level so after you got start game and start new level let's work on the movement okay so for the movement we're going to make a new block so let's make a block let's name it movement control movement control okay so now we have our custom block oh yeah and also for the custom block don't forget to run screen without refresh so it will always const will be constantly updating so you want to check that okay so we have the custom block let's put that right here okay all right now let's define it so we're gonna do if go to control okay let's drag the if then block into here and then let's get it or so we're going to do if you can do the right arrow or the wasd so if key right arrow or key was d key d which is for the right is i will set the variable g speed x we're going to make a new variable called g speed x okay it's for all sprites remember all sprites all variables with the g in front is for all sprites so g speed x we're going to set the g speed x over here p speed x to 7 so this v is gonna be seven you can make it any speed you want but i preferred seven so let's duplicate this put that under here and then when the left arrow is being pressed or a then we're gonna do g speed x to negative seven so it's moving to the left and then we're gonna set so this is like the little um what's it called friction so those grip patches code we have the friction so we're gonna set the g speed x g speed x uh we're going to multiply it by 0.8 gcp dx multiplied by 0.8 so yeah so let's go to operators get a multiplication symbol okay multiply it by 0.8 and then we could get the g speed x g speed x put that in here okay and after that we want to get an if then statement if um actually no let's do this later we're gonna have to make another custom block so this is like to actually actually move the player so we're gonna do another my block so let's name it move player player and then we're gonna make a new input let's name it speed x so it's going to be the new input okay so now you have to run it screen without refresh so it's always constantly updating okay so now we have this new custom block right here so let's define it right now let's okay so we're gonna go to we're gonna get to the go to uh chain sorry not go to change x so we want to change the x by speed x and right here we're going to call the speed x right here so if uh uh greater than symbol so if the absolute value of the g speed x g speed x is greater than 0.9 then we're going to move the player to the round of the speed x move the player so we're going to be calling this that means it'll change the x by the round of t speed x so what this is just friction so we're gonna round g spx okay now let's try it out oh yeah and before we start we can't we can't this does not work yet so first we need to code something else so remember we broadcast in message start game so we're gonna go events when i receive start game we're gonna have to um get a show and we're gonna get a repeat until so we're gonna repeat until is player dead okay so so if the player dead is equal to yes the player is dead equals yes so if it's dead then we're gonna broadcast another message i'm gonna call it start all control so we're gonna need this to activate all the control control and then we're going to broadcast to other messages we will not need right now we'll need them in the future though so just pay attention so you know you'll remember that you will need these messages so we're going to check platform sorry platform detection so check platform detection okay and we're going to make one more uh let's name this one check player position so this checking pointer position okay so after this um we're gonna get one more thing so we're gonna get a um we're gonna get an start all control so when i receive start all control we're gonna call the movement control variable so i mean not variable custom block movement controls right here let's call that so then it'll run this okay so if you want this to show the character you have to take out the ghost effect so as you can see when you play it now the player can move around as you can see there's a bit friction as well so yeah this is the main character you can add the set ghost effect back so now we can make the ma the animated character go to the actual this thing animated character so i hope you have all of this done okay so once you're done with this we're gonna go to the animated character and then we're going to get a one green flag clicked go to front layer let's make this bigger when green flag clicked go to front layer as the animated character remember we're in the animated character sprite and then we're going to get a forever loop forever forever and we're gonna make this go to the main character name and i'm gonna make sure this is don't die left and right so remember to set this as rotation styles left to right so then it will not flip upside down okay so now let's get another one green flank clicked when green flag is clicked we're gonna get a forever loop if the key right or d is being pressed so key right key right arrow or uh d is being pressed then we can point in direction of 90 and then we can just duplicate this if key left arrow or a is being pressed then a point direction of negative 90 so it's facing the left so as you can see now let's play it as you can see this player an animated character went to the main character and now when you move it you can see um the anime character is going to it and you can move around so yeah i think that should be it for this tutorial so this is going to be the first part of the christmas pokemon series so if you enjoyed this video be sure to leave a like and subscribe and comment in the comment section below on what you want to see next and thank you guys
