00:03 - [Music]
00:09 - hello guys welcome back to kids calling
00:11 - playground
00:12 - so today we're going to work on the
00:14 - center i
00:15 - run uh part six of the video
00:18 - so the last time we were working on the
00:21 - scrolling for the ground so i play the
00:24 - game you can see
00:25 - that you can kind of move the center and
00:28 - then they scroll forward
00:29 - so that's what we had last time uh what
00:32 - we're going to do is we're going to put
00:33 - some background scrolling
00:34 - on it so that will look a little bit
00:36 - better um
00:39 - these are the code for the main sprite
00:41 - here
00:42 - okay so uh you can quickly kind of
00:45 - get it down if you're missing anything
00:48 - okay
00:49 - if you missed anything just pause the
00:50 - video
00:52 - okay so that's all of it
00:55 - on this side and then this side this one
00:58 - is a little long for the movement
01:00 - okay and then this one is the
01:04 - jump and then if you guys miss anything
01:08 - always go back to the share project on
01:10 - scratch you can take a look over there
01:13 - as well okay all right and this is the
01:16 - animated character here okay
01:21 - all right and then the ground that's
01:24 - what we did last time
01:26 - and then we did the virtual ground as
01:28 - well
01:29 - okay so now let's do the scrolling
01:32 - background so i'm going to show you how
01:34 - that look
01:34 - so this one is the screen background you
01:36 - can just draw whatever you like
01:38 - if you want more you can draw more
01:39 - actually so i only have one
01:42 - uh what i'm going to do is i'm going to
01:43 - flip it over so that way you know it can
01:46 - look like it's different so now let's go
01:49 - to the code
01:51 - the scrolling uh code so what we can do
01:54 - we can take some of the stuff from the
01:55 - other
01:56 - uh code here uh so uh when we copy the
02:00 - stuff so
02:00 - so we're gonna have to have to create x
02:03 - and y variable for this as well
02:05 - but since when we can copy the code
02:07 - called map with create voice so as you
02:08 - can see
02:09 - in my go to scrolling it doesn't have
02:11 - the x and y variable
02:13 - so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
02:14 - drag all this over here
02:16 - okay first one
02:19 - second one
02:22 - [Music]
02:24 - okay the reset ground movement
02:28 - and then the setup so it might have been
02:33 - so there we go let's take a look so we
02:35 - have set up
02:37 - here movement put it here
02:40 - position let's put this here
02:44 - okay and then let's start so
02:48 - start backward on top okay so we're
02:50 - gonna have to change a little bit
02:52 - uh on this uh okay throw this away we
02:55 - don't need that
02:57 - let me zoom in on top a little bit so
03:00 - we'll do one at a time
03:01 - so here we're gonna put the show here
03:04 - okay
03:05 - uh let's see let me put the reset here
03:08 - where's the reset i'm using reset
03:13 - okay i'm missing reset so i need to
03:15 - reset to delete the clone so i missed
03:18 - that
03:19 - reset here okay
03:22 - all right there we go so reset
03:26 - right here okay all right so
03:29 - let me put the position here
03:35 - okay so for this one we actually don't
03:37 - need this so throw this away
03:40 - before i do that i'll take the show out
03:43 - put this here
03:44 - okay throw this away
03:48 - all right i want to place a clone here
03:52 - same thing here we're not doing the
03:53 - white scrolling so
03:55 - why same thing here click on myself no
03:58 - costume we don't have next custom
03:59 - because
04:00 - we only have one okay so throw that away
04:04 - now let's take a look at the setup so
04:07 - setup we're gonna do a little bit
04:08 - different
04:09 - uh here okay so
04:12 - um in the beginning that's correct level
04:15 - one that's correct so switch to costume
04:17 - one
04:18 - uh we don't need to go back later
04:19 - actually
04:22 - uh background scrolling that's the
04:26 - only yeah that's the costume okay
04:30 - so we'll select the background scrolling
04:32 - okay
04:35 - put this away so what i'm going to do is
04:37 - i'll make it face forward
04:39 - and then i can switch it around so that
04:41 - way you know so
04:43 - i'm going to put the first one and do
04:46 - like this
04:47 - and then we can say change the direction
04:50 - so make sure you're scrolling here
04:52 - uh make sure you select this okay so
04:55 - that doesn't move around and then just
04:57 - make the show okay so um
05:00 - if you want you can add this right uh
05:02 - rotation style
05:04 - okay and put that on top that will make
05:07 - sure that it always go to here
05:09 - but if not make sure you select this
05:11 - okay
05:13 - okay here say we're going to go negative
05:16 - 90.
05:18 - i'm going to place the clone here okay
05:22 - and then let's say we want we don't want
05:24 - to uh rotate
05:25 - the second time we'll put it like this
05:27 - and then let's say if you want to rotate
05:29 - third time
05:30 - you can put something else let's see
05:33 - oops drag this back to 90
05:37 - and then we can do the third time so you
05:39 - can just time it
05:40 - uh so we don't actually need exact same
05:43 - amount of uh
05:44 - clone that we have for the platform as a
05:46 - background
05:47 - so what we're going to do is we're going
05:48 - to make the background go slower
05:50 - so it depends you know um maybe i think
05:52 - four is enough
05:54 - so it depends when you play the game and
05:56 - we'll just watch
05:57 - how it goes so this is my uh level one
06:00 - so far okay i'm going to add this to the
06:03 - end
06:04 - okay and here we're going to change the
06:07 - movement a little bit
06:08 - so like i told you right we're going to
06:10 - make it slower
06:11 - so um so that looks better so you're
06:14 - going to use the division sign here
06:18 - okay take this guy out uh
06:21 - we're gonna use some math function here
06:23 - around
06:24 - okay so we're gonna round this guy
06:28 - and then we're gonna divide this by ten
06:31 - okay
06:32 - it will duplicate this here and put this
06:36 - here so you see
06:36 - round off g of x divided by 10
06:40 - same thing we'll do the for y but since
06:42 - y is zero doesn't really matter
06:46 - but you can just do it the same way so
06:48 - later you actually want to do something
06:51 - different with the scrolling you can do
06:53 - that oh i have this already
06:54 - sorry
06:58 - okay i need to round my back
07:01 - okay all right so you have this
07:04 - put that here you have this put this
07:07 - here
07:08 - okay so it looks like this so now let's
07:11 - save it
07:12 - let's try it out so you can see this is
07:14 - in here
07:15 - let's try it out i don't know it's gonna
07:16 - work so you see it's kind of in the
07:18 - front
07:19 - so i think when i created i didn't have
07:21 - the go to back
07:22 - uh because actually
07:26 - i was creating this the last sprite so
07:28 - let's try to put the back layer go to
07:29 - the back
07:30 - and see if that will help okay
07:34 - so go to
07:41 - back layer let's try so you can see
07:44 - looks okay so you can see the background
07:48 - so this is a background slope scrolling
07:50 - you can see that is
07:51 - moving so you can see the water right
07:54 - see
07:54 - there you go okay
07:57 - so you can see the background scrolling
08:01 - so you see it's kind of moving so if you
08:04 - want to make the background looks better
08:06 - you can have different costume and
08:08 - switch costume but
08:09 - that's good enough it looks it's just
08:12 - give a little visual effect
08:14 - so you see i have more than enough i
08:16 - need so
08:17 - so four is already more than enough
08:19 - because we're moving uh
08:20 - dividing by 10 right so we don't
08:22 - actually need that much costume
08:25 - okay all right
08:28 - so or you can put this outside here is
08:31 - fine as well
08:32 - doesn't matter okay um
08:36 - okay so that's what we have so far
08:39 - for this okay so we're gonna work on the
08:42 - sound a little bit
08:43 - okay um over here
08:47 - um we have the sound already if you
08:50 - don't have the sound you can have a
08:52 - different thing so it won't play forever
08:55 - uh sound play sound
08:59 - i think i have this one yep so i got
09:01 - this from the youtube
09:03 - studio you guys can pick that up uh from
09:05 - there i'll show you later how to do that
09:08 - um and then i say when i
09:12 - receive when i receive uh
09:16 - start sound i have something called
09:18 - starts down okay i don't have
09:20 - okay so i'm gonna go back to here to my
09:23 - main character that way i
09:24 - did all that so i go back to my main
09:27 - character where i did all this
09:29 - sound let's see let's go back over here
09:33 - go up on top with the broadcast okay
09:36 - here
09:36 - so let's stop this so
09:39 - broadcast after this
09:45 - new message start sound
09:49 - okay let's go back here
09:52 - say uh start sound
09:55 - so here what we're going to do is we're
09:57 - going to we're going to
09:59 - you remember when we jump right we put
10:01 - the um
10:02 - put the sound in here right here
10:06 - so you remember when we jump um
10:10 - we okay this is when it died right place
10:12 - number three
10:13 - so number three when it died number one
10:16 - when it jumped
10:16 - right so we put it on the arraylist here
10:19 - this list here so we're going to check
10:23 - okay so we'll say if
10:29 - go to variable i'll put this one first
10:32 - say
10:32 - equal for the variable
10:37 - um item so we want to pick the soundless
10:41 - stimulus if one
10:45 - of this is equal to one meaning is true
10:47 - it's on
10:48 - then we're gonna play the sound so we're
10:50 - gonna play
10:53 - uh say start sound and then
10:56 - take jump okay so number one is jump
10:59 - that we're doing
11:00 - and then after that we're gonna replace
11:01 - it with zero so that way we know that we
11:04 - play that it won't play again
11:05 - so let's say where's that replays using
11:08 - replace replace here
11:11 - select the sound okay with
11:15 - zero it's like that just like that so
11:17 - what you can do is
11:18 - duplicate this uh you can see already
11:22 - you can hear that sound right
11:23 - so two if it's two replace two with zero
11:26 - okay and then here we're gonna say ouch
11:29 - i haven't made that sound i recorded
11:31 - that
11:31 - so you guys wanna change your own sound
11:33 - put your own ouch sound just record it
11:36 - you know i'll do that i'm sure if not
11:38 - let me show you in a bit
11:40 - okay number three so let's just call it
11:43 - all up
11:44 - plunge that's when you fall into the
11:45 - water so that one
11:47 - is already came with the uh uh you know
11:50 - the sprite in the game
11:51 - uh we call it the scratch okay
11:55 - uh this is number four you can put one
11:58 - here again
12:00 - okay and then this number four i think i
12:03 - have a things down or something like
12:04 - that
12:05 - that's like when you collect the snow uh
12:08 - and then i have another thing
12:09 - sound for another snow so number five
12:12 - you can have many
12:13 - so as you can see i have five of them
12:16 - okay number number
12:20 - replace five sorry i forgot to change
12:23 - this
12:23 - four so just make sure you got it so
12:27 - one replacing one two three three
12:30 - four five okay good so far i think we
12:33 - got it correct
12:34 - okay so um
12:38 - so this this sound is all here right so
12:40 - you can go to the sound tab you can hear
12:42 - so thing two is this the thing one is
12:45 - this and then this is that the song that
12:48 - way long song
12:49 - this is the plunge it's the ouch and
12:51 - this is the jump
12:52 - okay so you want to record like the ouch
12:55 - and make an alt sound just
12:56 - click on this say record and then you
12:59 - can talk here
13:00 - you see it is recording like you could
13:02 - click on the record button
13:03 - it will talk and then record and you say
13:05 - stop so this is where you have it and
13:07 - you can cut it or whatever or you can
13:09 - save it so you save it you know record
13:11 - one
13:11 - just rename it to out share okay i'm
13:14 - gonna delete it
13:15 - for mine so that's how you get that uh
13:18 - you record your own sound and then for
13:20 - the
13:20 - other thing uh the music i'll show you
13:24 - guys how to do that
13:25 - you can get a lot of free music from
13:29 - your youtube studio so it's really good
13:33 - i think everybody has that if you have a
13:35 - youtube account you can create your own
13:37 - youtube studio i'll show you
13:40 - so here is our youtube channel so if you
13:44 - go here you can see
13:45 - right here on the side here you see this
13:47 - audio or library click on that
13:50 - so you see this audio library you have
13:52 - all this different music here
13:54 - uh you can play it or have a music and
13:57 - then you can click on this you say
13:59 - download
13:59 - so you can download your music and then
14:01 - whatever sound you like
14:03 - there's a lot of free music here really
14:05 - nice music you can download and then you
14:07 - can just upload it back to your
14:09 - um you know in your game so i'm sure you
14:12 - guys know how to upload but if not
14:14 - let me just show you one time so
14:17 - if you want to upload the sound right so
14:19 - go to your sound sprite go to the sound
14:21 - tab
14:21 - click on this say upload okay
14:25 - when you upload you you will see uh a
14:28 - sound right just select
14:29 - download like some sound or something
14:31 - like this some mp3 you see this
14:33 - you can just select and then let's say i
14:36 - want this
14:37 - select this open then you see this is 5
14:40 - mb so we're going to take a wall
14:42 - so click on this say open what it does
14:44 - it's gonna load to this
14:46 - here and then later you can use it in
14:48 - your code here okay
14:50 - so this is about uh this is about the
14:53 - the sound and then we did the background
14:55 - scrolling
14:56 - um this is about uh all the uh all the
14:59 - things that we're doing today it's a
15:00 - shorter
15:01 - video um so you can hear right you have
15:03 - sound
15:05 - so you can jump you see you have the
15:08 - jump sound so even if you hold down the
15:10 - jump it will not have like jump jump
15:12 - jump jump sound
15:14 - you see i only have one sound hook
15:17 - so it's a lot better with this way so
15:20 - that
15:20 - unlike the among us one right among us
15:24 - we when we
15:25 - [Music]
15:35 - so oh i have not caught it yet so in the
15:38 - plunger
15:39 - i think um i had to call that
15:44 - so i have the plunge sound over here
15:46 - already done
15:48 - so i'm not sure why it's not working
15:49 - correctly um
15:52 - let's see so
15:59 - replace item did i get all the g sound
16:02 - correct
16:03 - that looks correct oh sorry
16:06 - item three one no no that looks correct
16:09 - item three okay
16:12 - so we have some mistake uh so what you
16:15 - can do
16:16 - is uh you can open these uh variable to
16:18 - kind of check what happened
16:20 - okay so i'll show you guys how to i know
16:22 - what the mystic is but i'm going to show
16:24 - you guys how
16:25 - you could actually find your mistake so
16:26 - you can open the like the sound list
16:29 - right uh what you can do is you can
16:31 - disconnect this
16:33 - so let's see so uh let's say my
16:36 - character is here
16:38 - it's uh it's moving right you see when i
16:41 - jump
16:41 - it has the one over here right and then
16:44 - we play the one
16:45 - uh jump sound we'll replace it back to
16:47 - zero right
16:48 - so okay i put down the uh system sound a
16:52 - little bit it's hard to hear me
16:54 - if it sounds too high so as you can see
16:56 - um
16:57 - let's say we remove this we can see it
16:59 - so if i have this on
17:00 - right so if you let's say if i make a
17:04 - jump
17:05 - you can quickly see that uh that one to
17:07 - zero you cannot really see it right
17:09 - so just take this out just making sure
17:11 - that it is setting it correctly
17:13 - so let's say i'm moving my character
17:15 - right i jump you see there's a one
17:17 - let's set the one service one will play
17:19 - the jump sound set it back to zero right
17:21 - so let's just check the uh falling off
17:23 - the water if you can see right when i
17:25 - fought the water
17:26 - it did not set that number three which
17:29 - is the plunge
17:30 - cell so there's something wrong with
17:31 - that so what you can do is you can take
17:34 - a look right
17:35 - go back to my main character where
17:37 - they're falling you see
17:39 - this one is wrong so i put it into the
17:41 - wrong list so if this is the item list
17:43 - so that is incorrect
17:45 - you just select the sound list and
17:47 - select the sound list
17:48 - just like how we did it for the jump
17:51 - right so the jump is the soundless
17:53 - right so this is a plunge sound for the
17:55 - water also the soundless
17:57 - so let's save it now let's go back
18:01 - so let's say we disconnect this let's
18:03 - run this again
18:04 - so if i jump you see a one over there
18:08 - let's go over here if i fall off the
18:09 - water
18:11 - you see there's one here so it will play
18:14 - the sound now so let's
18:15 - test it again let's uh run it
18:19 - so you see you hear the the sound with
18:22 - the jump sound
18:24 - and then fall the water so you can hear
18:27 - the water drops down okay so that's
18:29 - it for this video be sure to like
18:33 - share and subscribe to our channel and
18:35 - uh give us a thumbs up if you enjoyed
18:36 - the video
18:37 - alright see you guys next time thank you
18:40 - bye
18:49 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome back to kids calling playground so today we're going to work on the center i run uh part six of the video so the last time we were working on the scrolling for the ground so i play the game you can see that you can kind of move the center and then they scroll forward so that's what we had last time uh what we're going to do is we're going to put some background scrolling on it so that will look a little bit better um these are the code for the main sprite here okay so uh you can quickly kind of get it down if you're missing anything okay if you missed anything just pause the video okay so that's all of it on this side and then this side this one is a little long for the movement okay and then this one is the jump and then if you guys miss anything always go back to the share project on scratch you can take a look over there as well okay all right and this is the animated character here okay all right and then the ground that's what we did last time and then we did the virtual ground as well okay so now let's do the scrolling background so i'm going to show you how that look so this one is the screen background you can just draw whatever you like if you want more you can draw more actually so i only have one uh what i'm going to do is i'm going to flip it over so that way you know it can look like it's different so now let's go to the code the scrolling uh code so what we can do we can take some of the stuff from the other uh code here uh so uh when we copy the stuff so so we're gonna have to have to create x and y variable for this as well but since when we can copy the code called map with create voice so as you can see in my go to scrolling it doesn't have the x and y variable so what i'm going to do is i'm going to drag all this over here okay first one second one okay the reset ground movement and then the setup so it might have been so there we go let's take a look so we have set up here movement put it here position let's put this here okay and then let's start so start backward on top okay so we're gonna have to change a little bit uh on this uh okay throw this away we don't need that let me zoom in on top a little bit so we'll do one at a time so here we're gonna put the show here okay uh let's see let me put the reset here where's the reset i'm using reset okay i'm missing reset so i need to reset to delete the clone so i missed that reset here okay all right there we go so reset right here okay all right so let me put the position here okay so for this one we actually don't need this so throw this away before i do that i'll take the show out put this here okay throw this away all right i want to place a clone here same thing here we're not doing the white scrolling so why same thing here click on myself no costume we don't have next custom because we only have one okay so throw that away now let's take a look at the setup so setup we're gonna do a little bit different uh here okay so um in the beginning that's correct level one that's correct so switch to costume one uh we don't need to go back later actually uh background scrolling that's the only yeah that's the costume okay so we'll select the background scrolling okay put this away so what i'm going to do is i'll make it face forward and then i can switch it around so that way you know so i'm going to put the first one and do like this and then we can say change the direction so make sure you're scrolling here uh make sure you select this okay so that doesn't move around and then just make the show okay so um if you want you can add this right uh rotation style okay and put that on top that will make sure that it always go to here but if not make sure you select this okay okay here say we're going to go negative 90. i'm going to place the clone here okay and then let's say we want we don't want to uh rotate the second time we'll put it like this and then let's say if you want to rotate third time you can put something else let's see oops drag this back to 90 and then we can do the third time so you can just time it uh so we don't actually need exact same amount of uh clone that we have for the platform as a background so what we're going to do is we're going to make the background go slower so it depends you know um maybe i think four is enough so it depends when you play the game and we'll just watch how it goes so this is my uh level one so far okay i'm going to add this to the end okay and here we're going to change the movement a little bit so like i told you right we're going to make it slower so um so that looks better so you're going to use the division sign here okay take this guy out uh we're gonna use some math function here around okay so we're gonna round this guy and then we're gonna divide this by ten okay it will duplicate this here and put this here so you see round off g of x divided by 10 same thing we'll do the for y but since y is zero doesn't really matter but you can just do it the same way so later you actually want to do something different with the scrolling you can do that oh i have this already sorry okay i need to round my back okay all right so you have this put that here you have this put this here okay so it looks like this so now let's save it let's try it out so you can see this is in here let's try it out i don't know it's gonna work so you see it's kind of in the front so i think when i created i didn't have the go to back uh because actually i was creating this the last sprite so let's try to put the back layer go to the back and see if that will help okay so go to back layer let's try so you can see looks okay so you can see the background so this is a background slope scrolling you can see that is moving so you can see the water right see there you go okay so you can see the background scrolling so you see it's kind of moving so if you want to make the background looks better you can have different costume and switch costume but that's good enough it looks it's just give a little visual effect so you see i have more than enough i need so so four is already more than enough because we're moving uh dividing by 10 right so we don't actually need that much costume okay all right so or you can put this outside here is fine as well doesn't matter okay um okay so that's what we have so far for this okay so we're gonna work on the sound a little bit okay um over here um we have the sound already if you don't have the sound you can have a different thing so it won't play forever uh sound play sound i think i have this one yep so i got this from the youtube studio you guys can pick that up uh from there i'll show you later how to do that um and then i say when i receive when i receive uh start sound i have something called starts down okay i don't have okay so i'm gonna go back to here to my main character that way i did all that so i go back to my main character where i did all this sound let's see let's go back over here go up on top with the broadcast okay here so let's stop this so broadcast after this new message start sound okay let's go back here say uh start sound so here what we're going to do is we're going to we're going to you remember when we jump right we put the um put the sound in here right here so you remember when we jump um we okay this is when it died right place number three so number three when it died number one when it jumped right so we put it on the arraylist here this list here so we're going to check okay so we'll say if go to variable i'll put this one first say equal for the variable um item so we want to pick the soundless stimulus if one of this is equal to one meaning is true it's on then we're gonna play the sound so we're gonna play uh say start sound and then take jump okay so number one is jump that we're doing and then after that we're gonna replace it with zero so that way we know that we play that it won't play again so let's say where's that replays using replace replace here select the sound okay with zero it's like that just like that so what you can do is duplicate this uh you can see already you can hear that sound right so two if it's two replace two with zero okay and then here we're gonna say ouch i haven't made that sound i recorded that so you guys wanna change your own sound put your own ouch sound just record it you know i'll do that i'm sure if not let me show you in a bit okay number three so let's just call it all up plunge that's when you fall into the water so that one is already came with the uh uh you know the sprite in the game uh we call it the scratch okay uh this is number four you can put one here again okay and then this number four i think i have a things down or something like that that's like when you collect the snow uh and then i have another thing sound for another snow so number five you can have many so as you can see i have five of them okay number number replace five sorry i forgot to change this four so just make sure you got it so one replacing one two three three four five okay good so far i think we got it correct okay so um so this this sound is all here right so you can go to the sound tab you can hear so thing two is this the thing one is this and then this is that the song that way long song this is the plunge it's the ouch and this is the jump okay so you want to record like the ouch and make an alt sound just click on this say record and then you can talk here you see it is recording like you could click on the record button it will talk and then record and you say stop so this is where you have it and you can cut it or whatever or you can save it so you save it you know record one just rename it to out share okay i'm gonna delete it for mine so that's how you get that uh you record your own sound and then for the other thing uh the music i'll show you guys how to do that you can get a lot of free music from your youtube studio so it's really good i think everybody has that if you have a youtube account you can create your own youtube studio i'll show you so here is our youtube channel so if you go here you can see right here on the side here you see this audio or library click on that so you see this audio library you have all this different music here uh you can play it or have a music and then you can click on this you say download so you can download your music and then whatever sound you like there's a lot of free music here really nice music you can download and then you can just upload it back to your um you know in your game so i'm sure you guys know how to upload but if not let me just show you one time so if you want to upload the sound right so go to your sound sprite go to the sound tab click on this say upload okay when you upload you you will see uh a sound right just select download like some sound or something like this some mp3 you see this you can just select and then let's say i want this select this open then you see this is 5 mb so we're going to take a wall so click on this say open what it does it's gonna load to this here and then later you can use it in your code here okay so this is about uh this is about the the sound and then we did the background scrolling um this is about uh all the uh all the things that we're doing today it's a shorter video um so you can hear right you have sound so you can jump you see you have the jump sound so even if you hold down the jump it will not have like jump jump jump jump sound you see i only have one sound hook so it's a lot better with this way so that unlike the among us one right among us we when we so oh i have not caught it yet so in the plunger i think um i had to call that so i have the plunge sound over here already done so i'm not sure why it's not working correctly um let's see so replace item did i get all the g sound correct that looks correct oh sorry item three one no no that looks correct item three okay so we have some mistake uh so what you can do is uh you can open these uh variable to kind of check what happened okay so i'll show you guys how to i know what the mystic is but i'm going to show you guys how you could actually find your mistake so you can open the like the sound list right uh what you can do is you can disconnect this so let's see so uh let's say my character is here it's uh it's moving right you see when i jump it has the one over here right and then we play the one uh jump sound we'll replace it back to zero right so okay i put down the uh system sound a little bit it's hard to hear me if it sounds too high so as you can see um let's say we remove this we can see it so if i have this on right so if you let's say if i make a jump you can quickly see that uh that one to zero you cannot really see it right so just take this out just making sure that it is setting it correctly so let's say i'm moving my character right i jump you see there's a one let's set the one service one will play the jump sound set it back to zero right so let's just check the uh falling off the water if you can see right when i fought the water it did not set that number three which is the plunge cell so there's something wrong with that so what you can do is you can take a look right go back to my main character where they're falling you see this one is wrong so i put it into the wrong list so if this is the item list so that is incorrect you just select the sound list and select the sound list just like how we did it for the jump right so the jump is the soundless right so this is a plunge sound for the water also the soundless so let's save it now let's go back so let's say we disconnect this let's run this again so if i jump you see a one over there let's go over here if i fall off the water you see there's one here so it will play the sound now so let's test it again let's uh run it so you see you hear the the sound with the jump sound and then fall the water so you can hear the water drops down okay so
