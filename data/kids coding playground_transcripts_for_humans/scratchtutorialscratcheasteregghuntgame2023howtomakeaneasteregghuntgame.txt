00:00 - [Music]
00:09 - thank you tell us what you think about
00:11 - our new intro and please comment your
00:13 - thoughts down below and also please
00:15 - check out our Easter game from last year
00:17 - which you can find in the video
00:19 - description and we hope you enjoyed that
00:21 - tutorial as well
00:23 - welcome back guys it's kids home
00:24 - playground here and today we're back
00:26 - with another video at scratch today
00:27 - we'll be making the Easter themed game
00:29 - because it's Easter Sunday today and we
00:33 - have our Easter game over here so
00:37 - there's some music playing and there's
00:39 - this rabbit find where I hide the three
00:40 - eggs so here there's gonna be an egg
00:43 - here there's gonna be an egg and here is
00:46 - going to be an egg so basically we're
00:47 - supposed to find or all three of the
00:49 - eggs are
00:51 - um where the rabbit has hidden them so
00:53 - there's one over here there's one over
00:55 - here and there's one over here so good
00:58 - job you found all three eggs so it's
01:00 - basically a memorization type game so
01:01 - then you can like find all the eggs and
01:04 - win
01:05 - so that's basically the game that we're
01:08 - working on today and it involves lists
01:10 - so
01:12 - of uh there has been some questions on
01:15 - Sprites on the usage of our projects uh
01:19 - so you can just come into my project
01:20 - I'll be sharing this project Easter egg
01:22 - hunt 2023 go to my profile gumballs098
01:26 - and then you can open your backpack like
01:28 - as so and drag the Sprites in so then
01:31 - you can use them on your own
01:33 - and also uh there has been a lot of
01:36 - requests for Google access for our
01:38 - Google Drive
01:40 - um and you should be using your personal
01:42 - account not your school account so we
01:43 - don't get all these requests but
01:46 - um there is a video on Google Drive and
01:49 - how to use it so we'll be linking that
01:51 - in the description so then you can also
01:54 - use the Google drive as well as
01:56 - you can also drag the Sprites so
01:59 - let's get started
02:07 - so I'm gonna get my Sprites here we only
02:09 - have two Sprites to this project which
02:11 - is the hair
02:14 - the hair and we also have
02:18 - no scratch cat goodbye and we also have
02:20 - the eggs
02:21 - so
02:23 - we have our two um Sprite situated and
02:27 - after that we have our backdrop which is
02:30 - actually going to be the Garden Rock
02:35 - this one so this is the thing that we
02:37 - used but we actually covered up the
02:40 - thing so it wouldn't cover up the rock
02:41 - so then it wouldn't be on the the eggs
02:44 - won't be on the grass so basically we
02:46 - just take a section of that
02:48 - and then we just like uh paste that
02:50 - control C control V
02:52 - and then just just try to cover up the
02:55 - rock as good as we can so then young the
02:57 - eggs will be on the rock for visual
03:00 - qualities
03:02 - and maybe take a snippet from the flower
03:07 - and we can just cover up the rock a
03:09 - little bit over there for visual quality
03:13 - so that's basically what we did to cover
03:15 - up the Garden Rock
03:17 - so
03:19 - when during the egg positionings
03:23 - during the egg positionings the egg was
03:25 - actually not on the same elevation as
03:28 - the rabbit so it didn't have the same so
03:31 - you would want to control C control V
03:33 - the hair
03:34 - to the egg and then try to align them as
03:38 - best as possible to
03:41 - um make it the best quality you can so
03:44 - the best alignment possible and then the
03:47 - egg does not have to be in the center
03:48 - it's just off to the side a little bit
03:51 - so now
03:54 - so it's basically down a little bit from
03:56 - the
03:57 - um
03:58 - Center
04:01 - so now
04:03 - let's get coding so first let's make our
04:06 - variables so for our rabbits we have an
04:11 - index for our rabbit and then this is
04:14 - for this Sprite only
04:16 - so we have that and now we also have egg
04:19 - found
04:21 - how much eggs you have found for all
04:23 - Sprites and then as well as rabbit
04:27 - finish talking oh just hold it right now
04:31 - talking
04:34 - so basically we need this rabbit
04:36 - finished talking variable so then
04:38 - um there's no cheating in the game
04:39 - because the rabbit will be going to each
04:41 - of the places where he's placing the egg
04:43 - so the rabbit finish talking is
04:46 - basically going to be so you can't click
04:49 - on that rabbit when he places the eggs
04:51 - so then you cannot cheat
04:53 - so let's get coding so I have the green
04:56 - flag is clicked
04:59 - when the green flag is clicked it will
05:01 - go to x I have coordinates so negative
05:04 - 190
05:06 - y
05:07 - 120.
05:09 - and it'll switch costume to the First
05:12 - costume which is hair a
05:14 - which is the sitting position like this
05:17 - and after that we need a list so
05:21 - we make a list over here and then we
05:24 - name it egg
05:25 - X location so this is what basically
05:29 - this decides where the egg will be
05:31 - located on the x coordinate plane so we
05:35 - have the egg X location
05:37 - so first it'll delete all of X location
05:40 - so then there won't be any extra like
05:43 - places where the eggs could be and then
05:45 - we'll also need an egg
05:47 - Y location
05:50 - like why
05:52 - so and also delete all of egg y
05:55 - locations so it's our two lists over
05:57 - here
05:59 - and basically it will do
06:01 - add
06:03 - thing so it'll add pick random
06:09 - negative
06:10 - 200 to negative 90 to X location
06:14 - so I'll explain this after when I'm done
06:16 - so we'll do this again and instead
06:19 - instead of pick random negative 200
06:20 - negative 90 will be negative 90 to
06:24 - 70.
06:27 - and then for this one
06:29 - we will have
06:30 - 70
06:33 - to 200. so basically this is determining
06:37 - the three zones so there's basically
06:40 - three zones to this map and that's where
06:43 - the eggs are going to be placed in
06:45 - either of these three zones so it the
06:49 - reason we did this is because the rabbit
06:51 - could select the same spot and not move
06:53 - at all and then say this is the second
06:56 - egg where it is and they're both in the
06:58 - same spot and it can get people very
06:59 - confused as they have only found two
07:01 - eggs not three so that's basically why
07:03 - we need the zones to separate the eggs
07:05 - so
07:07 - it's actually not confusing so they're
07:08 - like not right not next to each other
07:11 - so for y it's going to be different so
07:14 - since we already separated that X we
07:16 - need to repeat three
07:18 - uh and it'll add
07:22 - to use a ad it'll pick random negative
07:25 - 120
07:27 - 260
07:29 - and this is the egg Y location the egg Y
07:31 - location does not need three zones
07:33 - either because it would be it doesn't
07:36 - need three sets because it's only
07:38 - separated by the X so
07:41 - now we have say
07:44 - uh find
07:47 - find where I hide the three eggs
07:53 - remember the location
07:58 - find where I hide the three eggs
08:00 - remember the location for three seconds
08:02 - or more if you want and then it'll
08:04 - broadcast start game
08:09 - start
08:12 - okay so let's move on to this part so
08:15 - when I receive
08:18 - start game
08:21 - um those set
08:24 - egg found to zero because you have not
08:26 - found any eggs yet
08:27 - and then it'll go forever
08:32 - um and say if then if then the egg found
08:36 - is equal to three so operator equals
08:40 - egg found is equal to three
08:44 - um
08:46 - so if egg found is equal to three it
08:48 - will say
08:54 - good job
08:56 - good job you found
08:58 - who found all
09:01 - three eggs okay for three seconds so we
09:06 - have that and then it'll stop all so
09:08 - that's basically after when you win
09:11 - and after that we'll have uh when uh
09:15 - another start game so when I receive
09:16 - start game
09:19 - it will
09:20 - set
09:23 - rabbit top finish talking
09:26 - to n so basically the rabbit's not
09:30 - finished talking yet so you cannot cheat
09:32 - and we'll set the index to one
09:38 - and then after that it will repeat three
09:41 - times
09:45 - and it'll broadcast animate so it will
09:48 - go to three different spots for the X so
09:51 - repeat three times broadcast
09:54 - animate so show is basically running and
09:57 - to place each egg
10:00 - and then you'll Glide one second
10:02 - to where the list determines so Glide
10:05 - one oopsies collide one second to X so
10:11 - we need to go back to our list place
10:12 - over here and say item
10:17 - uh index item index of X location so it
10:22 - already determines where the x of Y
10:24 - locations are so basically this is
10:26 - telling them to go to the places
10:30 - I'll show you the list over here so we
10:33 - have this so this already determines
10:34 - where all the lists are
10:37 - and
10:38 - this only determines where the X and Y
10:40 - should be located
10:42 - and you see
10:45 - so now we're going to go back to here
10:47 - and then we're gonna have item
10:54 - of egg Y location
10:58 - and then so item index of egg Y location
11:01 - to go to the Y position of the Y
11:04 - location
11:06 - so and now we're gonna say here
11:11 - so I'm just going to say here
11:14 - for one second and then it would change
11:16 - index by one so basically going through
11:19 - a number counting type of thing so the
11:22 - first one go to the second one
11:24 - and then now under this you'll go switch
11:28 - costume to Hair A
11:31 - and it'll go to
11:35 - go to where it was originally at
11:38 - negative 190
11:40 - y120
11:42 - and then after that it'll say
11:49 - now tell me where
11:53 - I
11:55 - hid the eggs
11:58 - by clicking on oopsies so much typos the
12:02 - screen
12:05 - now tell me where I hit the X by
12:07 - clicking on the screen all right so now
12:09 - it's gonna be three seconds and then
12:12 - after that it will set
12:18 - set rabbit finish talking to Y so this
12:20 - is when it's done talking and then you
12:21 - can actually interact with the game
12:25 - so now we have over here
12:27 - when I receive animate so when it starts
12:30 - and this animation it's blocking thing
12:33 - it'll repeat four times
12:36 - four times and it'll switch costume
12:40 - to hair B
12:42 - and then wait 0.1 seconds
12:48 - and then switch costume to hair see
12:52 - and then wait 0.1 seconds now for that
12:55 - you'll switch costume back to Hair A
13:00 - basically the whole entire animation
13:02 - sequence thing
13:05 - uh I'm trying to put up these as best I
13:07 - can
13:08 - so basically this is all the code oh no
13:13 - basically this is all the code for the
13:15 - um hair determining where the list is
13:18 - and what placing the eggs so this is
13:21 - basically so I'm gonna play the game for
13:23 - you
13:24 - oh shama remove the list real quick
13:28 - and then so
13:30 - variables kind of blocking but it's
13:32 - saying something and after that you're
13:33 - going to where the eggs are
13:35 - and it'll go to where they are so
13:38 - basically it goes here here and here
13:40 - so
13:42 - you click on these and that will be
13:45 - uh where the eggs are gonna be so
13:49 - uh we're finished with the egg uh here
13:51 - so feel free to pause over here
13:54 - and now we're going to move on to the
13:56 - eggs
14:00 - so when the green flag is clicked
14:05 - it will hide
14:08 - and then when I receive
14:12 - start game
14:14 - it will set index so over here set index
14:19 - oh yeah we need an index because that
14:21 - one's for the hair so we actually have
14:23 - to write do another index do not skip
14:25 - this part for this Sprite only for the
14:28 - eggs as well
14:29 - and then you'll set the index to one
14:32 - as well as repeat when you repeat over
14:36 - here repeat
14:38 - length so length
14:41 - length of egg X location
14:44 - so there's three so it'll repeat that
14:47 - and then it'll create clone
14:51 - of myself you know also change the index
14:57 - by one
14:58 - and now over here
15:02 - uh we're gonna work on the when I
15:03 - started the clock
15:04 - so
15:07 - when I start as a cloud
15:10 - so when I started to close
15:13 - when I start as a clone it will go to
15:17 - X
15:20 - um
15:20 - item index so where is that
15:24 - item
15:26 - index
15:28 - of
15:29 - X location and then item index of egg Y
15:34 - location
15:35 - and then after that it will set
15:39 - ghost effect so basically it'll be
15:41 - hiding it but it's actually not hidden
15:43 - set ghost effect
15:46 - to 100.
15:49 - and then after that it'll show
15:52 - and then you'll wait until
15:55 - there's a big hunk wait until
15:58 - don't wait until you need two add
15:59 - operators
16:01 - so we did an end over here and then end
16:03 - up here
16:05 - so you did wait until
16:08 - um it's touching not spoiler and mouse
16:12 - is down so you click on it and your
16:14 - mouse is touching it and
16:17 - you need an equal side over here
16:20 - and
16:22 - rabbit finished talking
16:25 - is equal to Y so this is until you can
16:28 - carry you can get the eggs so basically
16:31 - you wait until it's touching the mouse
16:33 - pointer the mouse is down it's click on
16:35 - the thing and the rabbit is finished
16:36 - talking
16:38 - after that it will change the egg found
16:41 - by one
16:42 - and then set goes to effect to zero so
16:44 - you can see where
16:46 - see you got the egg so say ghost effect
16:50 - zero and then say you got it you got it
16:55 - over here
16:59 - for one second
17:01 - and then we'll also wait one second
17:04 - as well as it'll now delete this club
17:08 - so now we have the egg situation done
17:13 - so
17:14 - trying to get a big view of this
17:16 - so feel free to pause oops feel free to
17:18 - pause over here and copy down the code
17:21 - and now we're moving on to the backdrop
17:24 - so when the creative flag is clicked
17:26 - it's very straightforward
17:28 - um we're gonna pick a sound for this one
17:29 - I used eggs because it really matched
17:31 - the theme because the tags
17:34 - and you'll set volume
17:37 - set volume to 25 percent
17:40 - and forever
17:43 - it will place out eggs until done so
17:46 - that's basically the whole entire game
17:47 - we have over here except we have to hide
17:48 - the variables so uh for the hair you
17:51 - hide index we hide rabbit finish talking
17:54 - the egg we hide index we'll keep egg
17:57 - found and we'll move it up here so
17:59 - basically that's the game
18:01 - and
18:02 - so I'll demo it so let's say fine when I
18:05 - hide the three eggs from the location
18:07 - and then you'll stay here and hit it
18:10 - like over here and then hit a head over
18:12 - here so that's basically where the three
18:14 - eggs are so so I think there's one over
18:18 - here I'm not sure it might be one over
18:20 - here and over here now here okay so yeah
18:26 - so I found all three eggs and that's
18:28 - basically a whole game so everything is
18:30 - in order
18:32 - so please like share subscribe and
18:35 - comment in the comment section below
18:37 - what else games and you might uh end up
18:39 - on our channel one day we might make
18:40 - your project and uh comment in the
18:43 - comment section below if you celebrate
18:44 - Easter and uh if you went egg hunting or
18:48 - any of those really fun activities on
18:51 - Easter so anyway have a great Easter
18:54 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

thank you tell us what you think about our new intro and please comment your thoughts down below and also please check out our Easter game from last year which you can find in the video description and we hope you enjoyed that tutorial as well welcome back guys it's kids home playground here and today we're back with another video at scratch today we'll be making the Easter themed game because it's Easter Sunday today and we have our Easter game over here so there's some music playing and there's this rabbit find where I hide the three eggs so here there's gonna be an egg here there's gonna be an egg and here is going to be an egg so basically we're supposed to find or all three of the eggs are um where the rabbit has hidden them so there's one over here there's one over here and there's one over here so good job you found all three eggs so it's basically a memorization type game so then you can like find all the eggs and win so that's basically the game that we're working on today and it involves lists so of uh there has been some questions on Sprites on the usage of our projects uh so you can just come into my project I'll be sharing this project Easter egg hunt 2023 go to my profile gumballs098 and then you can open your backpack like as so and drag the Sprites in so then you can use them on your own and also uh there has been a lot of requests for Google access for our Google Drive um and you should be using your personal account not your school account so we don't get all these requests but um there is a video on Google Drive and how to use it so we'll be linking that in the description so then you can also use the Google drive as well as you can also drag the Sprites so let's get started so I'm gonna get my Sprites here we only have two Sprites to this project which is the hair the hair and we also have no scratch cat goodbye and we also have the eggs so we have our two um Sprite situated and after that we have our backdrop which is actually going to be the Garden Rock this one so this is the thing that we used but we actually covered up the thing so it wouldn't cover up the rock so then it wouldn't be on the the eggs won't be on the grass so basically we just take a section of that and then we just like uh paste that control C control V and then just just try to cover up the rock as good as we can so then young the eggs will be on the rock for visual qualities and maybe take a snippet from the flower and we can just cover up the rock a little bit over there for visual quality so that's basically what we did to cover up the Garden Rock so when during the egg positionings during the egg positionings the egg was actually not on the same elevation as the rabbit so it didn't have the same so you would want to control C control V the hair to the egg and then try to align them as best as possible to um make it the best quality you can so the best alignment possible and then the egg does not have to be in the center it's just off to the side a little bit so now so it's basically down a little bit from the um Center so now let's get coding so first let's make our variables so for our rabbits we have an index for our rabbit and then this is for this Sprite only so we have that and now we also have egg found how much eggs you have found for all Sprites and then as well as rabbit finish talking oh just hold it right now talking so basically we need this rabbit finished talking variable so then um there's no cheating in the game because the rabbit will be going to each of the places where he's placing the egg so the rabbit finish talking is basically going to be so you can't click on that rabbit when he places the eggs so then you cannot cheat so let's get coding so I have the green flag is clicked when the green flag is clicked it will go to x I have coordinates so negative 190 y 120. and it'll switch costume to the First costume which is hair a which is the sitting position like this and after that we need a list so we make a list over here and then we name it egg X location so this is what basically this decides where the egg will be located on the x coordinate plane so we have the egg X location so first it'll delete all of X location so then there won't be any extra like places where the eggs could be and then we'll also need an egg Y location like why so and also delete all of egg y locations so it's our two lists over here and basically it will do add thing so it'll add pick random negative 200 to negative 90 to X location so I'll explain this after when I'm done so we'll do this again and instead instead of pick random negative 200 negative 90 will be negative 90 to 70. and then for this one we will have 70 to 200. so basically this is determining the three zones so there's basically three zones to this map and that's where the eggs are going to be placed in either of these three zones so it the reason we did this is because the rabbit could select the same spot and not move at all and then say this is the second egg where it is and they're both in the same spot and it can get people very confused as they have only found two eggs not three so that's basically why we need the zones to separate the eggs so it's actually not confusing so they're like not right not next to each other so for y it's going to be different so since we already separated that X we need to repeat three uh and it'll add to use a ad it'll pick random negative 120 260 and this is the egg Y location the egg Y location does not need three zones either because it would be it doesn't need three sets because it's only separated by the X so now we have say uh find find where I hide the three eggs remember the location find where I hide the three eggs remember the location for three seconds or more if you want and then it'll broadcast start game start okay so let's move on to this part so when I receive start game um those set egg found to zero because you have not found any eggs yet and then it'll go forever um and say if then if then the egg found is equal to three so operator equals egg found is equal to three um so if egg found is equal to three it will say good job good job you found who found all three eggs okay for three seconds so we have that and then it'll stop all so that's basically after when you win and after that we'll have uh when uh another start game so when I receive start game it will set rabbit top finish talking to n so basically the rabbit's not finished talking yet so you cannot cheat and we'll set the index to one and then after that it will repeat three times and it'll broadcast animate so it will go to three different spots for the X so repeat three times broadcast animate so show is basically running and to place each egg and then you'll Glide one second to where the list determines so Glide one oopsies collide one second to X so we need to go back to our list place over here and say item uh index item index of X location so it already determines where the x of Y locations are so basically this is telling them to go to the places I'll show you the list over here so we have this so this already determines where all the lists are and this only determines where the X and Y should be located and you see so now we're going to go back to here and then we're gonna have item of egg Y location and then so item index of egg Y location to go to the Y position of the Y location so and now we're gonna say here so I'm just going to say here for one second and then it would change index by one so basically going through a number counting type of thing so the first one go to the second one and then now under this you'll go switch costume to Hair A and it'll go to go to where it was originally at negative 190 y120 and then after that it'll say now tell me where I hid the eggs by clicking on oopsies so much typos the screen now tell me where I hit the X by clicking on the screen all right so now it's gonna be three seconds and then after that it will set set rabbit finish talking to Y so this is when it's done talking and then you can actually interact with the game so now we have over here when I receive animate so when it starts and this animation it's blocking thing it'll repeat four times four times and it'll switch costume to hair B and then wait 0.1 seconds and then switch costume to hair see and then wait 0.1 seconds now for that you'll switch costume back to Hair A basically the whole entire animation sequence thing uh I'm trying to put up these as best I can so basically this is all the code oh no basically this is all the code for the um hair determining where the list is and what placing the eggs so this is basically so I'm gonna play the game for you oh shama remove the list real quick and then so variables kind of blocking but it's saying something and after that you're going to where the eggs are and it'll go to where they are so basically it goes here here and here so you click on these and that will be uh where the eggs are gonna be so uh we're finished with the egg uh here so feel free to pause over here and now we're going to move on to the eggs so when the green flag is clicked it will hide and then when I receive start game it will set index so over here set index oh yeah we need an index because that one's for the hair so we actually have to write do another index do not skip this part for this Sprite only for the eggs as well and then you'll set the index to one as well as repeat when you repeat over here repeat length so length length of egg X location so there's three so it'll repeat that and then it'll create clone of myself you know also change the index by one and now over here uh we're gonna work on the when I started the clock so when I start as a cloud so when I started to close when I start as a clone it will go to X um item index so where is that item index of X location and then item index of egg Y location and then after that it will set ghost effect so basically it'll be hiding it but it's actually not hidden set ghost effect to 100. and then after that it'll show and then you'll wait until there's a big hunk wait until don't wait until you need two add operators so we did an end over here and then end up here so you did wait until um it's touching not spoiler and mouse is down so you click on it and your mouse is touching it and you need an equal side over here and rabbit finished talking is equal to Y so this is until you can carry you can get the eggs so basically you wait until it's touching the mouse pointer the mouse is down it's click on the thing and the rabbit is finished talking after that it will change the egg found by one and then set goes to effect to zero so you can see where see you got the egg so say ghost effect zero and then say you got it you got it over here for one second and then we'll also wait one second as well as it'll now delete this club so now we have the egg situation done so trying to get a big view of this so feel free to pause oops feel free to pause over here and copy down the code and now we're moving on to the backdrop so when the creative flag is clicked it's very straightforward um we're gonna pick a sound for this one I used eggs because it really matched the theme because the tags and you'll set volume set volume to 25 percent and forever it will place out eggs until done so that's basically the whole entire game we have over here except we have to hide the variables so uh for the hair you hide index we hide rabbit finish talking the egg we hide index we'll keep egg found and we'll move it up here so basically that's the game and so I'll demo it so let's say fine when I hide the three eggs from the location and then you'll stay here and hit it like over here and then hit a head over here so that's basically where the three eggs are so so I think there's one over here I'm not sure it might be one over here and over here now here okay so yeah so I found all three eggs and that's basically a whole game so everything is in order so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below what else games and you might uh end up on our channel one day we might make your project and uh comment in the comment section below if you celebrate Easter and uh if you went egg hunting or any of those really fun activities on
