00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - so welcome back guys to the channel kids
00:09 - go to kalindra
00:09 - today we'll be continuing on the second
00:12 - episode of Endicott nice game so if you
00:15 - haven't seen the first one I suggest you
00:17 - to watch the first video first before
00:19 - going on to this one so this is the code
00:23 - we got from the first video I'm gonna
00:25 - drag through it and let you guys see
00:28 - look through the code and if you missed
00:32 - anything I suggest you guys to copy it
00:34 - right now you can pause the video and
00:36 - copy drag slow okay so that's all the
00:43 - code we have for now so next we'll be
00:45 - working on the turnstile this thing that
00:48 - turns around so all we want for this one
00:52 - it's pretty simple just drag it when
00:54 - flag clicked go to this position
00:57 - negative 195 Y negative 30 forever turn
01:04 - to the right one degree so we'll turn
01:08 - see look if I play it just going to turn
01:13 - kind of turn slowly so that's pretty
01:19 - much all the code for turnstile it's
01:21 - pretty simple let's do the whip tail
01:23 - this is the monster that moves around
01:25 - here and it can get the Indiana Jones
01:29 - Indy cat
01:31 - so um yesterday I mentioned in the first
01:34 - video to set it to size 40 so you if you
01:37 - haven't then set it to size 40 first
01:39 - okay so for this we want to track it one
01:43 - clicked when the flag clicked pointing
01:45 - direction of ninety so I'll point to the
01:47 - right in the beginning and we want it to
01:52 - go I have the coordinates written down
01:56 - so the coordinates I have are 190
02:00 - negative 197 negative 1 to 49 of course
02:06 - you guys can put any coordinate
02:07 - somewhere around here so that's fine
02:11 - and Warner forever loop glide five
02:18 - seconds again I have the coordinates
02:21 - written down to 171 171 and why negative
02:28 - 49
02:29 - so uh glide somewhere around here and
02:33 - then come back so we want it to come
02:36 - back we'll let it wait two seconds so
02:39 - the player can have some time to get up
02:41 - here and get the key wait two seconds
02:44 - one direction negative ninety so I'll
02:47 - look to the left say make him ninety
02:51 - then we can glide another five seconds
02:54 - back to the beginning of negative one 97
02:59 - and 197 y- 149 so next thing we want to
03:08 - wait another two seconds to let the
03:10 - player have a chance you'll toss the
03:13 - ball and point your action of 90 so turn
03:17 - to the right again and it'll repeat
03:20 - forever so as you can see when you play
03:22 - it it goes through glides glides it's a
03:27 - look right here wait two seconds then
03:29 - glides back and I'll stop right here and
03:34 - it will keep on doing it so yeah so
03:38 - that's the code for the whiptail so this
03:42 - top wall which is the top wall that it
03:46 - doesn't move for anything it's just like
03:48 - a trap so look if you touch it then you
03:51 - go back to the beginning so this strap
03:54 - will just do a well all the code we need
03:58 - is one clicked go to this position
04:01 - that's all we need for this this trap
04:06 - and then for the key this is the key and
04:11 - use the key to touch the lock and once
04:15 - you touch the lock a gate will open up
04:18 - so you can go into the exit
04:19 - so for the code we want to get it one
04:22 - clicks one flat click go to this x and y
04:25 - position 220 y 0 this position wanted to
04:32 - show in the beginning so we'll need the
04:38 - waiting till block wait until touching
04:40 - in the unique at the touching the in d
04:45 - cat
04:46 - in d cat and then I have the sound
04:50 - downloaded right here start sound
04:52 - afro string it comes with the when you
04:56 - download the sprite it should come with
04:58 - the sprite the sounds so we'll need a
05:02 - forever loop skip cook Patrol's forever
05:05 - loop go to indie cat if it's touching it
05:10 - so go to indie cat go to empty cat if
05:18 - then touching lock and it's touching
05:20 - this thing if then touching lock the
05:26 - lock then it'll start something afro
05:31 - string again this is just like sound
05:33 - effects you don't have to add it if you
05:34 - don't want to have some sound effects
05:36 - will broadcast gate open gate open
05:46 - broadcast gate open so this is a gate
05:50 - will receive this and you'll move and no
05:52 - hide if it's touches so that's the code
05:57 - you can copy it down so for the lock we
06:02 - we don't really need much code just a
06:05 - one click and set the x and y position
06:10 - pretty simple and yeah throw the gate we
06:14 - wanna when our receives gate open
06:17 - then we'll play the sound called dirty
06:19 -  this is just a sound effect
06:24 - is this the one I'm not sure so
06:33 - we I don't know if this is the one but
06:36 - I'll just put it I don't know why
06:38 - there's no name for it but I just put it
06:42 - right there oak like three seconds I
06:45 - have the coordinates written down
06:48 - collide 30 seconds to 192 192 negative
06:54 - 70 why
06:55 - so one 192 negative send me why would be
06:59 - somewhere around here
07:00 - but glide right here so then you can go
07:02 - okay so one click do we want to set the
07:05 - X&Y position of this is this is for the
07:09 - walk on these it's the lock sorry that's
07:14 - the gate this is the gate
07:15 - sorry I've actually coded in the lock so
07:18 - this is the gate and then we want to set
07:21 - the X&Y position to X 69 in Y negative
07:28 - 70 so that's it for the gate so for the
07:32 - gym so for the Jeff one or get a one
07:36 - clicked one flag clicked clear all
07:39 - graphic effects so it it will like
07:41 - change color chalk color in the game so
07:44 - in the beginning I want to clear all the
07:46 - color effects in forever under everyone
07:49 - forever loop change color effect by 25
07:53 - so change color to give it a little
07:55 - effects to make it look better
07:57 - and you'll need a when flag clicks go to
08:01 - this x and y position go to X negative
08:05 - 42 Y negative 48 right there and it'll
08:10 - show in the beginning show wait until
08:15 - it's touching the MU cap okay so when it
08:18 - touches the indie cat wait until
08:22 - touching in dica so when it's touching
08:25 - the endicott go start some called fairy
08:28 - dust I have it right here
08:30 - so start some fairy dust we can
08:33 - broadcast a new message called stone so
08:36 - what this one does is to alert the it
08:41 - will broadcast the stone and the stone
08:43 - will start gliding the
08:44 - start coming up and this strap will
08:47 - start sliding in so stow on skull stone
08:51 - call it anything you want stone and hide
08:54 - it hide so that's the gem so I see it
09:00 - seen and you play the gem changes color
09:03 - right now the defense's the traps don't
09:08 - work yet because we have not coded that
09:09 - part yet but I'll just go ahead and show
09:12 - you how this keyword see opening the
09:17 - gate will open and when we take it out
09:21 - play a song called fairness so that's
09:23 - all we have for now so next we can work
09:28 - on the wall left in the wall right
09:30 - so wall left will not move anywhere it
09:33 - will just be a one click set the x and y
09:36 - position you like some other spray set
09:40 - it to negative 48
09:41 - y 67 to this position and next all right
09:47 - all right we'll need quite some more
09:50 - code because this one would be gliding
09:52 - so when clicked you want to set the X
09:54 - and y position when clicked set the X
09:58 - and y position to 67 y and 67 X 67 y in
10:06 - 67 exercise right here and when it
10:09 - receives stone which is the message that
10:12 - um the gem the gem will broadcast it so
10:21 - this will receive it forever
10:23 - okay forever loop glide 2 seconds glide
10:28 - 2 seconds to negative 35 67 and then we
10:36 - can glide duplicate this and glide back
10:38 - to the home position of 67 67 so next we
10:45 - finally the last trap we can do it's not
10:48 - the last trap if still four more and as
10:50 - you can see for this trap in the last
10:52 - video it was two separate sprites so I
10:55 - combined them I combined them too
10:58 - right so you won't have to get to
11:01 - sprites just control-c control-v from
11:04 - the other sprite and copy paste it into
11:06 - the spray so now let's get out to the
11:09 - stone
11:11 - so when clicked we want to hide of
11:14 - course in the beginning we want to hide
11:18 - forever turn 15 degrees so that right so
11:24 - look like it's rolling that's like a
11:26 - rolling stone so when I receive stone it
11:30 - will when it receives the stone message
11:33 - it will get a forever loop it will go to
11:38 - this x and y position I writ I wrote
11:41 - down which is right here negative 32 I
11:45 - negative 39 sir 146 yeah so right here
11:49 - show it was show glide it will collide
11:55 - four seconds glide four seconds to 206 I
12:02 - wrote down these coordinates 206 one of
12:05 - 146 so applied to here and come back and
12:08 - then we'll hide so let go so as you can
12:15 - see I'll just cut the chin just get the
12:21 - gem rope I can show you guys what
12:22 - happens see the stone starts moving
12:38 - rolling stone from here never mind it
12:42 - rolls from this side to this side and
12:46 - actually you can do no you can do this I
12:51 - did this wrong I can for the wall left
12:55 - this should be in full right so it looks
12:58 - better if she'd be in here actually
13:03 - sorry
13:04 - so delete this yes II so now this
13:11 - one moves not this way so here we show
13:17 - you guys what happens so get the cable
13:22 - quick
13:27 - see now this one moves I started it in
13:31 - the other one so put it in the wall wall
13:36 - write the code and the stone appears to
13:39 - be rolling see like in the big boulder
13:44 - seen in the Indiana Jones movie so
13:48 - finally let's add the last trap so when
13:53 - clicked for the last trap this one one
13:57 - place we just want to go to this x and y
14:00 - position 182 y 72 and hide at the
14:04 - beginning going to receive stone which
14:07 - is the message which also goes to the
14:14 - spiky thing and the stone will need a
14:17 - forever loop hide hide hide wait two
14:23 - seconds and then show and then wait
14:27 - another two seconds so what this does is
14:30 - make it show and hide like it's coming
14:32 - out of the ground and wait another two
14:34 - seconds
14:38 - so right now I have all the traps done
14:43 - um and then finally we can add the
14:49 - script into the cat mu cat and we can
14:56 - also add some background music after
14:58 - this this script is gonna be pretty long
15:01 - zoom out a little so you know one
15:04 - clicked so this is if it's touching any
15:08 - of these things
15:09 - so if forever if then if we'll need a
15:18 - lot of or statements it's a really long
15:22 - one
15:26 - okay so if touching this is the sense if
15:33 - it's touching the UM traps so if it's
15:36 - touching the turnstile touching the the
15:42 - wall left touching the wall right
15:48 - touching the whiptail touching stone
15:58 - we'll need more or statements this is a
16:05 - very long one touching the stone
16:10 - touching the this is a sense stone trap
16:15 - or wall left
16:23 - well T yeah so this is all of it we zoom
16:28 - in a little
16:29 - so if it's touching any of these traps
16:32 - then we want to change the attempts by
16:35 - one so at the end will show that
16:37 - attempts number and then we'll go to
16:42 - this x and y position negative 205 why
16:46 - 150 or go back to the starting position
16:50 - if it gets hit and we'll use the my
16:53 - block again from the first video type
16:56 - words ouch ouch and say so we'll say it
17:02 - instead of thinking it and we can start
17:06 - a sound I have right here called cat oh
17:09 - just like make them yah sound so all
17:13 - right now let's add one more if-then
17:17 - statement to the Indiana Indy cat so we
17:22 - want to if then statement right here so
17:28 - if then touching the colored touching
17:33 - color
17:36 - you want to get this color is touching
17:40 - this color then we want to broadcast a
17:43 - message Club win so this is to detect
17:46 - the wind strip when the screen wind when
17:53 - so as you can see we still have a wind
17:56 - screen right here
17:57 - I made it says you won and I have it
18:02 - took you blank seconds and it took you
18:05 - blank attempts so for the code for this
18:08 - this is pretty simple so when it
18:11 - receives wind then go to the front layer
18:15 - it will alert the player that they won
18:19 - show show the variable timer should so
18:26 - show how fast you did the game in show
18:29 - the variable timer and show the variable
18:33 - for the variable attempts so show how
18:37 - much attempts you have and stop all and
18:39 - one clicked we want it to go to zero
18:42 - zero so shown the center and hide yeah
18:50 - and we can actually add some background
18:53 - music just get a one click forever
18:57 - forever loop sounds let's get one from
19:01 - the library go to loops I just get the
19:07 - cave sound forever place I'm cave until
19:13 - done
19:14 - so when you start type the instructions
19:18 - they're beginning
19:21 - so if you touch it you see ash and play
19:26 - me also so I'll show you how you can
19:56 - make it can make miss us you can make
19:59 - the speed of the obstacles so let me try
20:10 - again so I already had the gem obtained
20:18 - so it so you don't have to reflect the
20:21 - gem again
20:23 - right there so and you can position
20:28 - these you can double-click on this timer
20:33 - and drag right here and double click
20:39 - right here and put our here so it will
20:42 - say it took you how many seconds and it
20:45 - took you how many it sentence so this is
20:49 - pretty much the video so thank you guys
20:53 - for watching please like share and
20:56 - subscribe to our channel that would
20:59 - really help us for if you're a better
21:01 - Clinton then please like share and
21:03 - subscribe and definitely comment in the
21:06 - comment sections below to tell us what
21:08 - you think about this video thank you
21:10 - guys for watching and I'll see you guys
21:12 - in the next video
21:14 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys to the channel kids go to kalindra today we'll be continuing on the second episode of Endicott nice game so if you haven't seen the first one I suggest you to watch the first video first before going on to this one so this is the code we got from the first video I'm gonna drag through it and let you guys see look through the code and if you missed anything I suggest you guys to copy it right now you can pause the video and copy drag slow okay so that's all the code we have for now so next we'll be working on the turnstile this thing that turns around so all we want for this one it's pretty simple just drag it when flag clicked go to this position negative 195 Y negative 30 forever turn to the right one degree so we'll turn see look if I play it just going to turn kind of turn slowly so that's pretty much all the code for turnstile it's pretty simple let's do the whip tail this is the monster that moves around here and it can get the Indiana Jones Indy cat so um yesterday I mentioned in the first video to set it to size 40 so you if you haven't then set it to size 40 first okay so for this we want to track it one clicked when the flag clicked pointing direction of ninety so I'll point to the right in the beginning and we want it to go I have the coordinates written down so the coordinates I have are 190 negative 197 negative 1 to 49 of course you guys can put any coordinate somewhere around here so that's fine and Warner forever loop glide five seconds again I have the coordinates written down to 171 171 and why negative 49 so uh glide somewhere around here and then come back so we want it to come back we'll let it wait two seconds so the player can have some time to get up here and get the key wait two seconds one direction negative ninety so I'll look to the left say make him ninety then we can glide another five seconds back to the beginning of negative one 97 and 197 y 149 so next thing we want to wait another two seconds to let the player have a chance you'll toss the ball and point your action of 90 so turn to the right again and it'll repeat forever so as you can see when you play it it goes through glides glides it's a look right here wait two seconds then glides back and I'll stop right here and it will keep on doing it so yeah so that's the code for the whiptail so this top wall which is the top wall that it doesn't move for anything it's just like a trap so look if you touch it then you go back to the beginning so this strap will just do a well all the code we need is one clicked go to this position that's all we need for this this trap and then for the key this is the key and use the key to touch the lock and once you touch the lock a gate will open up so you can go into the exit so for the code we want to get it one clicks one flat click go to this x and y position 220 y 0 this position wanted to show in the beginning so we'll need the waiting till block wait until touching in the unique at the touching the in d cat in d cat and then I have the sound downloaded right here start sound afro string it comes with the when you download the sprite it should come with the sprite the sounds so we'll need a forever loop skip cook Patrol's forever loop go to indie cat if it's touching it so go to indie cat go to empty cat if then touching lock and it's touching this thing if then touching lock the lock then it'll start something afro string again this is just like sound effects you don't have to add it if you don't want to have some sound effects will broadcast gate open gate open broadcast gate open so this is a gate will receive this and you'll move and no hide if it's touches so that's the code you can copy it down so for the lock we we don't really need much code just a one click and set the x and y position pretty simple and yeah throw the gate we wanna when our receives gate open then we'll play the sound called dirty this is just a sound effect is this the one I'm not sure so we I don't know if this is the one but I'll just put it I don't know why there's no name for it but I just put it right there oak like three seconds I have the coordinates written down collide 30 seconds to 192 192 negative 70 why so one 192 negative send me why would be somewhere around here but glide right here so then you can go okay so one click do we want to set the X&Y position of this is this is for the walk on these it's the lock sorry that's the gate this is the gate sorry I've actually coded in the lock so this is the gate and then we want to set the X&Y position to X 69 in Y negative 70 so that's it for the gate so for the gym so for the Jeff one or get a one clicked one flag clicked clear all graphic effects so it it will like change color chalk color in the game so in the beginning I want to clear all the color effects in forever under everyone forever loop change color effect by 25 so change color to give it a little effects to make it look better and you'll need a when flag clicks go to this x and y position go to X negative 42 Y negative 48 right there and it'll show in the beginning show wait until it's touching the MU cap okay so when it touches the indie cat wait until touching in dica so when it's touching the endicott go start some called fairy dust I have it right here so start some fairy dust we can broadcast a new message called stone so what this one does is to alert the it will broadcast the stone and the stone will start gliding the start coming up and this strap will start sliding in so stow on skull stone call it anything you want stone and hide it hide so that's the gem so I see it seen and you play the gem changes color right now the defense's the traps don't work yet because we have not coded that part yet but I'll just go ahead and show you how this keyword see opening the gate will open and when we take it out play a song called fairness so that's all we have for now so next we can work on the wall left in the wall right so wall left will not move anywhere it will just be a one click set the x and y position you like some other spray set it to negative 48 y 67 to this position and next all right all right we'll need quite some more code because this one would be gliding so when clicked you want to set the X and y position when clicked set the X and y position to 67 y and 67 X 67 y in 67 exercise right here and when it receives stone which is the message that um the gem the gem will broadcast it so this will receive it forever okay forever loop glide 2 seconds glide 2 seconds to negative 35 67 and then we can glide duplicate this and glide back to the home position of 67 67 so next we finally the last trap we can do it's not the last trap if still four more and as you can see for this trap in the last video it was two separate sprites so I combined them I combined them too right so you won't have to get to sprites just controlc controlv from the other sprite and copy paste it into the spray so now let's get out to the stone so when clicked we want to hide of course in the beginning we want to hide forever turn 15 degrees so that right so look like it's rolling that's like a rolling stone so when I receive stone it will when it receives the stone message it will get a forever loop it will go to this x and y position I writ I wrote down which is right here negative 32 I negative 39 sir 146 yeah so right here show it was show glide it will collide four seconds glide four seconds to 206 I wrote down these coordinates 206 one of 146 so applied to here and come back and then we'll hide so let go so as you can see I'll just cut the chin just get the gem rope I can show you guys what happens see the stone starts moving rolling stone from here never mind it rolls from this side to this side and actually you can do no you can do this I did this wrong I can for the wall left this should be in full right so it looks better if she'd be in here actually sorry so delete this yes II so now this one moves not this way so here we show you guys what happens so get the cable quick see now this one moves I started it in the other one so put it in the wall wall write the code and the stone appears to be rolling see like in the big boulder seen in the Indiana Jones movie so finally let's add the last trap so when clicked for the last trap this one one place we just want to go to this x and y position 182 y 72 and hide at the beginning going to receive stone which is the message which also goes to the spiky thing and the stone will need a forever loop hide hide hide wait two seconds and then show and then wait another two seconds so what this does is make it show and hide like it's coming out of the ground and wait another two seconds so right now I have all the traps done um and then finally we can add the script into the cat mu cat and we can also add some background music after this this script is gonna be pretty long zoom out a little so you know one clicked so this is if it's touching any of these things so if forever if then if we'll need a lot of or statements it's a really long one okay so if touching this is the sense if it's touching the UM traps so if it's touching the turnstile touching the the wall left touching the wall right touching the whiptail touching stone we'll need more or statements this is a very long one touching the stone touching the this is a sense stone trap or wall left well T yeah so this is all of it we zoom in a little so if it's touching any of these traps then we want to change the attempts by one so at the end will show that attempts number and then we'll go to this x and y position negative 205 why 150 or go back to the starting position if it gets hit and we'll use the my block again from the first video type words ouch ouch and say so we'll say it instead of thinking it and we can start a sound I have right here called cat oh just like make them yah sound so all right now let's add one more
