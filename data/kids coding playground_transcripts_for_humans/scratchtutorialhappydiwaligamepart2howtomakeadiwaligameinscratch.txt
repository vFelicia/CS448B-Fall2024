00:00 - [Music]
00:08 - welcome back guys it's kids coding
00:10 - playground here
00:11 - and today we're back for the
00:14 - ball game so this is actually the second
00:17 - part so we can just
00:18 - name this the um the bali game so
00:24 - just like that seem a happy diwali
00:31 - that's all that correct yeah i think i
00:32 - did all right happy default
00:34 - and then um so we have some code from
00:38 - the last part
00:38 - so from part one so um
00:42 - here it is pause whenever you need to
00:44 - when the green flag is clicked
00:46 - just um you can just copy all this code
00:48 - this is the rocket currently
00:50 - and we're going to work on the sparkles
00:52 - in the backdrop in this um
00:54 - part so and the diwali candle so if you
00:57 - don't have anything
00:59 - uh any uh um
01:02 - if you don't have this code you can
01:03 - pause whenever you need it
01:05 - and rocket two basically the same as
01:08 - rocket one just a little bit
01:11 - and pause whenever you need to again and
01:14 - rocket
01:15 - three uh this is all the code for rocket
01:19 - three so pause whatever you need
01:21 - so before i start please like share
01:23 - subscribe and comment in the comment
01:24 - section below for what else content you
01:26 - want
01:27 - so anyways let's get started so we're
01:30 - gonna work on the backdrop first
01:32 - so when the green flag is clicked it
01:34 - will switch
01:35 - backdrop to
01:38 - the night city because it's the night
01:40 - city and this is the night city backdrop
01:43 - this is the flash backdrop so you have
01:45 - like a little fun effect
01:46 - uh after when you're done i think in the
01:49 - july 4th fireworks we also did that one
01:51 - so you can it's just a fun effect
01:55 - so we also have a sound it was dance
01:58 - around and remember you can find
02:02 - whatever sounds you want from the loop
02:06 - section
02:06 - up here so dance around at this code
02:10 - please i'll play dance around until done
02:14 - and now when i receive bang bang
02:17 - and switch costume switch
02:20 - backdrop to flash it'll wait point one
02:23 - second
02:27 - and switch costume switch backdrop
02:30 - to night city again
02:34 - so we're gonna work on the sparkles and
02:37 - the happy diwali as we
02:38 - as you guys saw in the demo so um in the
02:42 - in the um thing you saw
02:46 - in the demo you guys saw the
02:49 - code for the i mean not code
02:52 - the cool effect and the diwali happy
02:56 - diwali after when you blast the
02:57 - fireworks so
02:58 - you guys saw that so let's work on that
03:01 - code right now
03:03 - so when the green flag is clicked
03:08 - it will hide
03:13 - and repeat 300 times
03:19 - and create a clone of himself so myself
03:23 - not himself so that's how you basically
03:25 - do it and then when i receive
03:26 - bang it will repeat 100 times
03:33 - and change color effect
03:38 - by two
03:43 - we also need some other code so when i
03:46 - receive
03:46 - bang
03:49 - then it will set color effect
03:58 - to pick random
04:02 - negative 100
04:06 - to positive 100
04:11 - so doing this will make it more colorful
04:13 - and more joyful
04:15 - and this will make 300 sparkles of it
04:18 - uh themselves so make 300 sparkles
04:23 - of the thing so when i receive
04:28 - bang again then it will
04:32 - set speed to
04:36 - so we need a new variable called speed
04:40 - for this sprite only so it will not have
04:43 - any uh for any
04:45 - other ones like including sparkles 2 or
04:48 - sparkles 3 but we will get to that
04:50 - so a variable name speed already exists
04:53 - oh
04:53 - ok so there already is a speed i think
04:55 - this is
04:57 - already for the sprite itself so i put
05:01 - in the backpack
05:01 - so it's already there so so it will set
05:05 - speed to
05:08 - pick random point three
05:14 - two three zero point one
05:20 - the third now set ghost
05:28 - goes to zero which means it will be
05:30 - visible it goes to 100 will be invisible
05:32 - goes to zero
05:33 - it goes effect to zero is visible you
05:36 - know change color
05:38 - effect by 25 and i'll set pen
05:42 - so we have the pen if you didn't do that
05:43 - in the last part we have it
05:45 - over here so there's not a pen all these
05:47 - dudes makey makey
05:49 - all this stuff so we use pen and none of
05:51 - these other dudes
05:53 - so and it was pen it'll set pen color
05:57 - to green so we already have
06:00 - a green and
06:04 - let's put it as a out of green so it's
06:06 - getting more colorful
06:08 - and pen up even though my favorite color
06:10 - is blue it's green
06:12 - and because in the demo we use green so
06:15 - i'm going to use green and then i'll go
06:17 - to
06:19 - it it will pen
06:22 - down
06:29 - and it will point in direction
06:36 - where's that block point in direction
06:41 - pick random direction let's pick random
06:45 - negative 180 to positive
06:49 - 180 and it will show
06:56 - what it will also do is reset timer so
07:00 - we're using a timer to control the
07:02 - fireworks
07:03 - speed and stuff like that so i'll reset
07:06 - the timer
07:07 - and then it'll repeat
07:12 - 50 times oh move speed
07:16 - by steps so move
07:20 - speed steps
07:26 - and it will change the ghost i mean
07:29 - oh yeah i forgot to do something before
07:30 - that so let's set
07:33 - speed to
07:38 - speed divided by
07:45 - yeah so speed divided by um
07:51 - oh sorry about that guys so we were
07:53 - supposed to do the one before that
07:55 - so move speed steps we don't need the
07:57 - set speed yet
07:58 - so it will change y
08:03 - by zero
08:08 - minus so zero
08:13 - minus timer
08:18 - then we use this thing afterwards but
08:20 - it's going to be in a while so
08:22 - it's a timer and then we can just
08:24 - duplicate this because we need another
08:26 - repeat 50.
08:29 - add that on and you still have to move
08:32 - speed
08:32 - steps and then you need to set speed
08:37 - to speed divided by
08:43 - right here speed divided by
08:46 - [Music]
08:52 - 0.9
08:54 - and we'll move three steps we already
08:56 - did that because we duplicated
08:57 - that so if you do not have that put that
08:59 - right there and it will change
09:03 - ghost effect
09:06 - where's the change change
09:11 - ghost effect by
09:14 - pick random one
09:17 - two three
09:22 - no hide and erase all
09:26 - so this last block is to make it more
09:28 - colorful and
09:29 - it will make it hide in the end so we
09:32 - can also add uh so if you do not have
09:34 - this code
09:35 - you can do it you can um look at it
09:38 - right now
09:39 - so yeah
09:42 - so as you can see it will work and we'll
09:44 - do the rest of it
09:45 - so click on the candle bam bam bam these
09:49 - will explode into nothing because
09:51 - you don't have their kids yet so we can
09:55 - that's basically it and then um we need
09:57 - the rocket
09:58 - sparkles we can duplicate this and make
10:00 - sparkles too
10:02 - and then instead in sparkles two so
10:05 - instead of receiving bang you'll receive
10:07 - bang two
10:08 - and instead of receiving bang you'll
10:11 - receive bang two
10:12 - for everything basically and up here
10:18 - and then we decided to set the pen color
10:21 - to
10:22 - a different color i used purple
10:27 - and um pen up go to rocket 2 and set a
10:31 - regular
10:32 - rocket so you just may make some changes
10:34 - rocket two
10:35 - in the point direction but we got that
10:37 - correct
10:39 - and
10:42 - yeah that's basically all we need
10:47 - so as you can see it will work
10:50 - [Music]
10:52 - click on the candle bam bam lighted
10:56 - bam bam and the last one just goes into
10:59 - nothing because
11:00 - yet so let's code that right now and we
11:03 - just need to duplicate this
11:06 - and change some things instead it's bang
11:08 - three and this is bang
11:09 - three and this is bang three
11:14 - this is go to rocket three i think for
11:17 - the sparkles three we
11:18 - used um we used
11:22 - the yellow color so yellow
11:29 - and then it'll pen up go to rocket 3
11:34 - and that's basically all we have here so
11:37 - i think it will work
11:38 - so i'm just going to take out some
11:39 - variables so uh
11:42 - let's take out all these as you can see
11:45 - it will work frequently
11:47 - [Music]
11:50 - light them up
11:51 - [Music]
11:53 - yeah so it's working and then we can
11:56 - also
11:57 - um get our things so h
12:00 - is for happy diwali so right up here
12:05 - letters so h h
12:08 - h right here and i don't even know why h
12:12 - is not the first one
12:13 - in the when i search for h so a isn't
12:16 - even the first one
12:17 - anymore so let's go letters
12:20 - oh because it's blocking it's called
12:22 - block a
12:23 - and then p
12:27 - block p duplicate that p
12:32 - and then so and y
12:41 - [Music]
12:50 - so i
12:57 - w
13:04 - a looks like a jumbo right now
13:12 - l
13:15 - plus sprites
13:20 - i so it's all jumbled up so let's just
13:23 - break them and spell it out so
13:28 - uh there's this code is all the same for
13:31 - all of them so you can just keep on
13:34 - dragging it into them so i think i have
13:36 - two p's right there
13:38 - p p
13:43 - y and then
13:48 - duh d
13:52 - i
13:56 - w
14:00 - a
14:02 - l i
14:05 - perfect and for the h
14:09 - you just need all the same code for all
14:11 - of them so when the green flag is
14:12 - clicked
14:13 - clear graphic effects
14:18 - it'll hide when i receive happy diwali
14:26 - then i'll set color
14:31 - effect to pick random
14:36 - 1 to 300
14:42 - no show so all of them is the same code
14:44 - so you can just keep on dragging these
14:46 - so you shouldn't
14:47 - we'll we'll check them afterwards so
14:55 - we have them right here so
15:06 - so we have it for p2
15:10 - so let's keep on dragging so we have the
15:12 - p
15:23 - so we got two over here
15:26 - y
15:38 - d
15:41 - i
15:48 - oh i don't have one
15:54 - i w
16:06 - a
16:20 - oh
16:22 - hi
16:27 - i think that might be it so
16:30 - i'm gonna demo it to you i'm gonna show
16:33 - it as full screen
16:39 - [Music]
16:48 - and before i end this recording

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here and today we're back for the ball game so this is actually the second part so we can just name this the um the bali game so just like that seem a happy diwali that's all that correct yeah i think i did all right happy default and then um so we have some code from the last part so from part one so um here it is pause whenever you need to when the green flag is clicked just um you can just copy all this code this is the rocket currently and we're going to work on the sparkles in the backdrop in this um part so and the diwali candle so if you don't have anything uh any uh um if you don't have this code you can pause whenever you need it and rocket two basically the same as rocket one just a little bit and pause whenever you need to again and rocket three uh this is all the code for rocket three so pause whatever you need so before i start please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below for what else content you want so anyways let's get started so we're gonna work on the backdrop first so when the green flag is clicked it will switch backdrop to the night city because it's the night city and this is the night city backdrop this is the flash backdrop so you have like a little fun effect uh after when you're done i think in the july 4th fireworks we also did that one so you can it's just a fun effect so we also have a sound it was dance around and remember you can find whatever sounds you want from the loop section up here so dance around at this code please i'll play dance around until done and now when i receive bang bang and switch costume switch backdrop to flash it'll wait point one second and switch costume switch backdrop to night city again so we're gonna work on the sparkles and the happy diwali as we as you guys saw in the demo so um in the in the um thing you saw in the demo you guys saw the code for the i mean not code the cool effect and the diwali happy diwali after when you blast the fireworks so you guys saw that so let's work on that code right now so when the green flag is clicked it will hide and repeat 300 times and create a clone of himself so myself not himself so that's how you basically do it and then when i receive bang it will repeat 100 times and change color effect by two we also need some other code so when i receive bang then it will set color effect to pick random negative 100 to positive 100 so doing this will make it more colorful and more joyful and this will make 300 sparkles of it uh themselves so make 300 sparkles of the thing so when i receive bang again then it will set speed to so we need a new variable called speed for this sprite only so it will not have any uh for any other ones like including sparkles 2 or sparkles 3 but we will get to that so a variable name speed already exists oh ok so there already is a speed i think this is already for the sprite itself so i put in the backpack so it's already there so so it will set speed to pick random point three two three zero point one the third now set ghost goes to zero which means it will be visible it goes to 100 will be invisible goes to zero it goes effect to zero is visible you know change color effect by 25 and i'll set pen so we have the pen if you didn't do that in the last part we have it over here so there's not a pen all these dudes makey makey all this stuff so we use pen and none of these other dudes so and it was pen it'll set pen color to green so we already have a green and let's put it as a out of green so it's getting more colorful and pen up even though my favorite color is blue it's green and because in the demo we use green so i'm going to use green and then i'll go to it it will pen down and it will point in direction where's that block point in direction pick random direction let's pick random negative 180 to positive 180 and it will show what it will also do is reset timer so we're using a timer to control the fireworks speed and stuff like that so i'll reset the timer and then it'll repeat 50 times oh move speed by steps so move speed steps and it will change the ghost i mean oh yeah i forgot to do something before that so let's set speed to speed divided by yeah so speed divided by um oh sorry about that guys so we were supposed to do the one before that so move speed steps we don't need the set speed yet so it will change y by zero minus so zero minus timer then we use this thing afterwards but it's going to be in a while so it's a timer and then we can just duplicate this because we need another repeat 50. add that on and you still have to move speed steps and then you need to set speed to speed divided by right here speed divided by 0.9 and we'll move three steps we already did that because we duplicated that so if you do not have that put that right there and it will change ghost effect where's the change change ghost effect by pick random one two three no hide and erase all so this last block is to make it more colorful and it will make it hide in the end so we can also add uh so if you do not have this code you can do it you can um look at it right now so yeah so as you can see it will work and we'll do the rest of it so click on the candle bam bam bam these will explode into nothing because you don't have their kids yet so we can that's basically it and then um we need the rocket sparkles we can duplicate this and make sparkles too and then instead in sparkles two so instead of receiving bang you'll receive bang two and instead of receiving bang you'll receive bang two for everything basically and up here and then we decided to set the pen color to a different color i used purple and um pen up go to rocket 2 and set a regular rocket so you just may make some changes rocket two in the point direction but we got that correct and yeah that's basically all we need so as you can see it will work click on the candle bam bam lighted bam bam and the last one just goes into nothing because yet so let's code that right now and we just need to duplicate this and change some things instead it's bang three and this is bang three and this is bang three this is go to rocket three i think for the sparkles three we used um we used the yellow color so yellow and then it'll pen up go to rocket 3 and that's basically all we have here so i think it will work so i'm just going to take out some variables so uh let's take out all these as you can see it will work frequently light them up yeah so it's working and then we can also um get our things so h is for happy diwali so right up here letters so h h h right here and i don't even know why h is not the first one in the when i search for h so a isn't even the first one anymore so let's go letters oh because it's blocking it's called block a and then p block p duplicate that p and then so and y so i w a looks like a jumbo right now l plus sprites i so it's all jumbled up so let's just break them and spell it out so uh there's this code is all the same for all of them so you can just keep on dragging it into them so i think i have two p's right there p p y and then duh d i w a l i perfect and for the h you just need all the same code for all of them so when the green flag is clicked clear graphic effects it'll hide when i receive happy diwali then i'll set color effect to pick random 1 to 300 no show so all of them is the same code so you can just keep on dragging these so you shouldn't we'll we'll check them afterwards so we have them right here so so we have it for p2 so let's keep on dragging so we have the p so we got two over here y d i oh i don't have one i w a oh hi i think that might be it so i'm gonna demo it to you i'm gonna show it as full screen and before i end this recording please like
