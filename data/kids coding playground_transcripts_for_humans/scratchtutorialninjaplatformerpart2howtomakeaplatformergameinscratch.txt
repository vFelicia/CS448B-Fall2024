00:08 - hello and welcome back to kids calling
00:11 - playground Channel
00:13 - so we'll continue our ninja platformer
00:17 - game today going different background
00:21 - the the platform and then we can try to
00:24 - make the ninja move around and setting
00:27 - up the different things ok before we
00:31 - begin I would really appreciate if you
00:33 - could please subscribe to our Channel
00:37 - and give us a thumbs up on the video you
00:41 - like and comment down below okay alright
00:46 - so we'll begin where we have left off
00:49 - last time we have the Ninja made a ninja
00:54 - with different outfit we have some of
00:57 - the outfit here we're standing right
01:01 - wealthy and then we have different
01:04 - outfit that you know he is getting hurt
01:08 - right time then we have some of the
01:11 - outfit he's running and we have
01:14 - something that is jumping right so we'll
01:18 - be working with these different costume
01:22 - that he has okay and also we were
01:25 - looking into the costume for this sprite
01:29 - the platform that we were working on so
01:33 - I think I show last time how we could do
01:35 - that you can upload the platform tile
01:39 - into your sprite and then you can just
01:41 - copy and paste connect to a vector and
01:43 - move around for now to make things a
01:48 - little bit faster what I'm going to do
01:50 - is import the previous platform are a
01:54 - mate and we can also walk walk with one
01:57 - together as Elsa as put together as well
02:00 - okay all right let me upload this okay I
02:07 - export it for my previous game so as you
02:11 - can see I have a platform I made
02:14 - wonderful too but I think we can make
02:17 - one more level for level one maybe
02:20 - something easier so make these like
02:23 - three and four so when you can do is
02:25 - make sure you name your give you a
02:27 - custom like one two three so later you
02:29 - can switch costume so as you can see I
02:32 - have three here so I can use three so
02:34 - let's change this to 33 right now so
02:39 - this will be 33 so what we going to do
02:42 - we're gonna make platform number one
02:44 - which is a little easy so we already get
02:47 - this last time right so what we can do
02:49 - is we can copy this right and then we'll
02:53 - go back to our costume here we'll make
02:57 - this one or delete him or something and
03:00 - we'll put it here we'll rename this as
03:03 - one or maybe for easier for people let's
03:06 - rename this first two to three and this
03:11 - to I will make this as one so this is
03:17 - going to be our first level will make it
03:21 - really easy so that people can just move
03:27 - sorry I keep getting wrong so this is
03:31 - this is the bead and oh I can have three
03:39 - somewhere I guess somewhere down here
03:41 - maybe it's not allowed me to put three
03:45 - let me just delete all the other one
03:47 - just to not get into trouble with this
03:52 - naming thing
04:01 - okay so I have won the now till - till
04:07 - here this won't be - how the change is
04:11 - to something else first three three
04:14 - because you can have the same name this
04:17 - is three and we'll change this back to -
04:20 - okay so I have one two three so number
04:24 - one is like this what we can do is we
04:29 - can delete this right here - later and
04:31 - we don't need so for now again I am so
04:34 - we're working with platform one so
04:37 - platform one we're gonna make it really
04:39 - simple only the big kind of whole thing
04:45 - across or copy and paste again and hope
04:52 - I do something like this so we can move
04:58 - this around later so I was just maybe
05:02 - try to online with all your platform in
05:04 - one location so when you when you're
05:07 - doing the screen there will be all a
05:09 - similar fashion so what I'm going to do
05:12 - is gonna make duplicate this I think
05:14 - will be better actually because this
05:17 - will cause us some trouble with online
05:20 - it correctly so let's duplicate this
05:22 - actually okay so this is one sorry for
05:28 - confusion there guys we are going to
05:34 - make some changes to this so we have
05:37 - this here we're going to just copy this
05:43 - over what we can copy this as well
05:45 - doesn't matter copy put it here we are
05:55 - going to make it around the same area so
06:02 - in youth so gonna like this
06:11 - what to move this tree out of the way
06:13 - actually or like right here something we
06:20 - keep something simple for for player
06:23 - right now so that they can get used to
06:27 - jumping maybe we're gonna make this
06:31 - higher a bit like this so we get the
06:37 - user some idea how the game works
06:51 - so as you can see if you're making games
06:54 - for the platform it takes a lot of time
06:59 - this up there's same thing so these are
07:03 - tree and and the grass here the shrub I
07:06 - just took it from the from the other
07:10 - backgrounds of what you can do is you
07:12 - can always do this right you can go to
07:14 - the the tile and then you see PNG
07:19 - objects you you can just take some Bush
07:22 - in like let's say this one we want to
07:25 - use this so what you can do is just
07:27 - click on this about this one we can get
07:31 - a header to our our background we can
07:34 - make him smaller or something like that
07:37 - like maybe here covering this this
07:40 - ground here right so as you can see this
07:45 - is a little high right so what you can
07:47 - do is you can just kind of copy one more
07:49 - set and kind of cover it up so as you
07:59 - can see we have come at three level
08:02 - right the player can move maybe we'll
08:07 - move this one a little bit shorter lower
08:11 - can use the arrow key as well you want
08:14 - to adjust it so you can see well three
08:17 - level I just get the player familiar
08:21 - with it okay so we have the platform
08:27 - with the tree in the back you know it
08:31 - should be a little bit out more there's
08:33 - over here so anything you want SoDo
08:36 - usually the platform you want to get you
08:38 - or your objects comes right in here and
08:41 - then you can do something else later
08:44 - with the other one okay so this is dumb
08:48 - let's see if I I have any more fear
08:52 - anymore those specials right who could
08:55 - use some web rocks right yeah see we can
08:58 - even use mushroom so even first time I
09:00 - did the game I didn't even use this
09:02 - house trying to just get it working but
09:06 - now since we doing it again I can maybe
09:09 - add something else in here let's do that
09:13 - okay so I got some mushroom and then the
09:19 - trees down okay so we have a bunch of
09:23 - little things that we could add to our
09:25 - stuff so let's get the mushroom copy go
09:31 - back to our forest age or put some will
09:35 - come us make this small mushroom here
09:38 - doesn't matter where you put it so
09:40 - everything looks nice hmm the stone
09:43 - converts a vector on this personal so
09:49 - you can adjust it a little bit I mean
09:52 - right now we don't have any collision
09:53 - with the different objects here so you
09:55 - can kind of walk over and they're like
09:57 - in the background at the moment okay we
10:00 - have some stones here we can put another
10:03 - still so we need it's not where maybe no
10:10 - next to the mushroom
10:16 - so since I another move this mushroom
10:20 - somewhere here so the stone is covering
10:24 - the mushroom because I think I put the
10:26 - mushroom relate earlier and there's
10:29 - still one I did a pay so they have some
10:31 - order consistency but you can push him
10:33 - back and forth with this so let's say
10:35 - you want to go back just push it back so
10:38 - now the mushroom was in the front right
10:42 - okay so one more tree stump let's get
10:46 - one more this okay alright so well and
11:00 - then we'll get one more two more one
11:01 - more mushroom right last mushroom let's
11:04 - use it
11:09 - oops did on this wrong one not go back
11:13 - to one so we can do it later on the
11:16 - other one
11:27 - yeah put them here okay all right so
11:33 - this is our first stage will give the
11:35 - players a chance to kind of move around
11:37 - and yeah I didn't get the meal with the
11:40 - with the game okay okay we have first
11:44 - stage done okay we can delete this
11:48 - sprite you would only need that anymore
11:50 - so we have the first stage okay what we
11:54 - need we can add some sprite to the sign
11:57 - right here we want to get the sign up
12:00 - with the sign here and we can put the
12:04 - sign like maybe here this in here if you
12:07 - want telling the player you know they
12:10 - can get the move that way you can change
12:15 - the sign till maybe ninety ninety five
12:18 - dozen there 75 maybe okay so the ninja
12:27 - will kind of come and start from here oh
12:31 - and then what we can do is we can create
12:35 - a crate also for the crate we can create
12:39 - that like a having a gym means after you
12:41 - break the crate you know the portal open
12:44 - up so we can do something like that so
12:46 - what you can do is you can create your
12:49 - uploaded crane okay and in this crate go
12:57 - to the costume what I did I also added
13:00 - some mom some grass around the crate so
13:05 - let's say you want this okay what you
13:09 - can do click on this change it to copy
13:12 - that and put it on the crate itself so
13:20 - if you like so kind of hiding the crater
13:23 - little bit
13:30 - okay so I know the crate the crate is
13:33 - little big right now but we can always
13:35 - change it a little okay so we have our
13:40 - crate there so either we can change it
13:44 - here like this select the whole thing
13:45 - right and then just just change it to
13:49 - smaller or you can change it with the
13:51 - size here as well so we don't wind
13:54 - doesn't matter so we're changing it like
13:56 - this for now okay with our little box
13:59 - maybe a little bit smaller I think
14:02 - that's good enough okay so we have the
14:05 - crate and we're gonna put a place
14:09 - somewhere here for now okay okay so the
14:15 - player breaks this crate I will create a
14:18 - portal somewhere for the player to get
14:21 - in I didn't have too many background
14:24 - things you let me remove this rocks I'll
14:26 - put a portal here later okay let me go
14:29 - back to my platform let's remove this
14:32 - rocks okay
14:35 - it was too clever I think there's too
14:38 - many things here okay just back up front
14:49 - so as you can see if you try to make the
14:52 - background look real nice it takes a lot
14:54 - of time okay all right okay let's go
14:59 - back to the plate so we got the crate
15:01 - going so we can delete this costume but
15:04 - only tell anyone
15:12 - I think earlier I forgot to convert this
15:16 - to vector so what happened now you
15:18 - cannot move this individual thing it
15:20 - gets stuck right so that's my problem
15:23 - with that I forgot that earlier so what
15:26 - you can do you say you see I cannot move
15:28 - this grass anymore I want to move it
15:30 - down a little bit it would walk because
15:32 - I forgot to connect to vector let's
15:34 - trash this my bad so let's do it again
15:39 - so make sure you always convert to
15:41 - vector ok I'll go back region go here
15:48 - and push again
15:53 - so convert this to vector first convert
15:57 - this to vector then oh yeah click on
16:00 - this so when you have bitmap once you
16:03 - move the thing just get stuck there
16:07 - that's it you can't change anything else
16:09 - after that so I try to cover this okay
16:13 - all right this is good now that's making
16:17 - smaller in the center so okay sorry
16:26 - about that this is done so this is put a
16:33 - crate here okay done it's done okay now
16:41 - do the water so for the oh I have come I
16:46 - already uploaded I already downloaded my
16:49 - previous sprite water so what I can do
16:52 - is just add it here so what you can do
16:56 - is you can push the water in the back on
16:58 - the front since there's all land we
17:01 - shouldn't see any water right if you
17:04 - have any gap then you can put the water
17:06 - so what we can do is we can push this
17:08 - water back so when you go to the next
17:10 - stage you'll see the water and you will
17:12 - see the water in the first stage so what
17:17 - is 5th wheel is similar right you can
17:19 - just you can see yeah you cannot blow
17:21 - those things and you
17:22 - and just kind of move them around cook
17:25 - them and then just form your water I'm
17:26 - not gonna show you how to do that it's
17:28 - pretty easy it will take a lot of time
17:32 - for the video if you give the see here I
17:35 - in here
17:36 - PNG this object known object background
17:40 - tile you'll see water I just use these
17:43 - two image that's kind of laid them up
17:45 - like John Nash the water line and then
17:48 - you get your water okay so let's go back
17:54 - so what we can do for the water well
17:58 - let's just do some coal for now I know
18:01 - we haven't done anything yet
18:02 - I think we were just and mostly set up
18:04 - so let's do our first coat for the water
18:08 - we are going to make them go here this
18:11 - position for now
18:13 - wherever the position is and we are
18:15 - going to push into the back layer so
18:20 - that the next stage when we move will
18:22 - see the water so first stage when we run
18:25 - we don't see any water so just kind of
18:27 - lame right okay that's done for the
18:31 - water part okay what we're going to do
18:37 - is we're gonna create some variable so
18:39 - we created that one variable called
18:41 - level so that will determine like what
18:44 - is the level what you know the different
18:47 - platform we have and you know we have to
18:50 - create a variable later on as well like
18:54 - gravity and speed fall speed and jump
18:57 - speed but I think that never was the one
19:00 - that was looking for is already here so
19:02 - what I'm going to do is gonna show you
19:04 - how we you know well we touch the portal
19:09 - and we can go to the next level but I
19:12 - think how to make the ninja move first
19:14 - right okay so where to walk on the ninja
19:17 - moving first ok let's create our
19:21 - variable so the first one will do one
19:25 - run speed this is like how fast we can
19:29 - make the ninja run
19:32 - we can the jump speed well then we can't
19:41 - force so as you can see this is called
19:44 - camelcase and programming lowercase F
19:47 - capital S comes different to see
19:50 - different world so this is kind of
19:51 - standard programming when you're making
19:53 - variable you use the first lowercase and
19:56 - then if you have any more dots next to
19:58 - it you kind of put a capital first
20:01 - capital letter and no spaces in between
20:03 - when you're making variable okay so we
20:07 - have for speed jump speed run speed we
20:10 - don't have to show this we're gonna show
20:11 - level every one and now we have gonna
20:16 - make something called gravity and we
20:23 - acquainted something with us to the next
20:31 - will keep track of the running costume
20:45 - costume
20:49 - this is just a keeping track D customer
20:53 - we're doing a loop through since we're
20:55 - multiple objects in the multiple custom
21:02 - for the jump and run and we'll make
21:05 - another variable maybe no and then in
21:09 - just dying so we do not want to have any
21:12 - action when the india is dying
21:14 - you should not be moving or jumping so
21:16 - we'll made that bear probe check as well
21:17 - okay so for now we have all the
21:20 - necessary variable for now what we're
21:23 - going to do is we are going back to the
21:25 - ninja we are going to make a block we're
21:31 - gonna call this start again so this is
21:34 - our function as a custom block what we
21:38 - want to do is we put in different num
21:41 - different Col here so that will run
21:44 - every time this function is call so
21:46 - let's see here we can do showed so when
21:51 - I start I can gonna do show we're gonna
21:53 - switch to costume ah so what we want to
21:57 - do without switch to this custom I five
21:59 - right no it doesn't matter
22:01 - you can use one five so this is a custom
22:05 - that we start the ninjas that we can put
22:09 - them enjoy any position let's say you
22:11 - put on me here that matter
22:13 - so we're gonna make it McCallum drop
22:15 - down a little bit little test our
22:17 - gravity make sure that works so we'll
22:20 - put them right down right here okay so
22:24 - you can just drag that in and then we
22:28 - are going to make in point in direction
22:30 - ninety basically to the right and we are
22:34 - going to make him go to the front layer
22:38 - like in front of everything so that you
22:40 - don't get this sign or anything blocking
22:43 - him and then we are going to set some
22:46 - variable initialize a variable okay
22:50 - we're gonna set the end run speed so we
22:55 - have to run speed ten we're gonna okay
23:00 - this we are going to put jump speed so
23:08 - jump speed auto twelve and then we are
23:12 - going to set our fall speed for speed is
23:21 - how fast is falling or we'll use that
23:23 - later zero for now and we're going to
23:29 - use gravity we're gonna make it negative
23:32 - one so every time you know if this
23:34 -  up in there - one y value to make
23:38 - the ninja fall down and we are going to
23:43 - say set the running custom index is zero
23:53 - and we're going to set the jumping
23:57 - custom index is zero as well we are
24:01 - going to have one more our dying way
24:04 - just the player dying so I'll put it
24:09 - nope and okay so this is the turn of the
24:15 - initializing the variable someone we
24:19 - what we make the call so what we can do
24:23 - is we can say even when it's clicked
24:26 - we're gonna say we're gonna call this
24:29 - block so right now nothing much to go to
24:33 - it won't just initialize a variable
24:35 - nothing's fun is happening didn't is
24:37 - just standing there he's not even
24:39 - falling down so right now we just cannot
24:43 - get there
24:44 - meow setup we've got the platform setup
24:46 - we got the water we've got the crane
24:49 - that we made we have the sine and then
24:52 - we have a platform we have three
24:54 - different stages so these we can delete
24:57 - we don't need them anymore okay so we
25:03 - have three stages stage 1 stage 2 stage
25:06 - 3 ok so if you see if items change it
25:12 - you see this first stage you see this
25:14 - change to something else there's another
25:17 - one so what we can do later we're gonna
25:19 - make sure that the box is generated
25:22 - somewhere that within this stage that we
25:24 - want so the the box that many I said
25:27 - break this box and give a gym when the
25:30 - ninja touch to gym they open the portal
25:32 - right so what we need to do is we are
25:34 - going to depending on different stage we
25:36 - might move The Box to this location of
25:38 - this location right and we're on stage 3
25:42 - then we're to make sure that you know
25:44 - the box doesn't fall off the water it
25:45 - shouldn't be really hear it
25:47 - the box should be like I say right here
25:49 - up here or anything like that right so
25:51 - with a go in to make sure the box is
25:54 - generated correctly to the right
25:56 - position later okay so for now we'll
25:59 - stop here and we'll continue again on
26:02 - the next video thank you please like
26:05 - share and subscribe
26:06 - channel and I'll see you guys next time
26:08 - bye
26:10 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome back to kids calling playground Channel so we'll continue our ninja platformer game today going different background the the platform and then we can try to make the ninja move around and setting up the different things ok before we begin I would really appreciate if you could please subscribe to our Channel and give us a thumbs up on the video you like and comment down below okay alright so we'll begin where we have left off last time we have the Ninja made a ninja with different outfit we have some of the outfit here we're standing right wealthy and then we have different outfit that you know he is getting hurt right time then we have some of the outfit he's running and we have something that is jumping right so we'll be working with these different costume that he has okay and also we were looking into the costume for this sprite the platform that we were working on so I think I show last time how we could do that you can upload the platform tile into your sprite and then you can just copy and paste connect to a vector and move around for now to make things a little bit faster what I'm going to do is import the previous platform are a mate and we can also walk walk with one together as Elsa as put together as well okay all right let me upload this okay I export it for my previous game so as you can see I have a platform I made wonderful too but I think we can make one more level for level one maybe something easier so make these like three and four so when you can do is make sure you name your give you a custom like one two three so later you can switch costume so as you can see I have three here so I can use three so let's change this to 33 right now so this will be 33 so what we going to do we're gonna make platform number one which is a little easy so we already get this last time right so what we can do is we can copy this right and then we'll go back to our costume here we'll make this one or delete him or something and we'll put it here we'll rename this as one or maybe for easier for people let's rename this first two to three and this to I will make this as one so this is going to be our first level will make it really easy so that people can just move sorry I keep getting wrong so this is this is the bead and oh I can have three somewhere I guess somewhere down here maybe it's not allowed me to put three let me just delete all the other one just to not get into trouble with this naming thing okay so I have won the now till till here this won't be how the change is to something else first three three because you can have the same name this is three and we'll change this back to okay so I have one two three so number one is like this what we can do is we can delete this right here later and we don't need so for now again I am so we're working with platform one so platform one we're gonna make it really simple only the big kind of whole thing across or copy and paste again and hope I do something like this so we can move this around later so I was just maybe try to online with all your platform in one location so when you when you're doing the screen there will be all a similar fashion so what I'm going to do is gonna make duplicate this I think will be better actually because this will cause us some trouble with online it correctly so let's duplicate this actually okay so this is one sorry for confusion there guys we are going to make some changes to this so we have this here we're going to just copy this over what we can copy this as well doesn't matter copy put it here we are going to make it around the same area so in youth so gonna like this what to move this tree out of the way actually or like right here something we keep something simple for for player right now so that they can get used to jumping maybe we're gonna make this higher a bit like this so we get the user some idea how the game works so as you can see if you're making games for the platform it takes a lot of time this up there's same thing so these are tree and and the grass here the shrub I just took it from the from the other backgrounds of what you can do is you can always do this right you can go to the the tile and then you see PNG objects you you can just take some Bush in like let's say this one we want to use this so what you can do is just click on this about this one we can get a header to our our background we can make him smaller or something like that like maybe here covering this this ground here right so as you can see this is a little high right so what you can do is you can just kind of copy one more set and kind of cover it up so as you can see we have come at three level right the player can move maybe we'll move this one a little bit shorter lower can use the arrow key as well you want to adjust it so you can see well three level I just get the player familiar with it okay so we have the platform with the tree in the back you know it should be a little bit out more there's over here so anything you want SoDo usually the platform you want to get you or your objects comes right in here and then you can do something else later with the other one okay so this is dumb let's see if I I have any more fear anymore those specials right who could use some web rocks right yeah see we can even use mushroom so even first time I did the game I didn't even use this house trying to just get it working but now since we doing it again I can maybe add something else in here let's do that okay so I got some mushroom and then the trees down okay so we have a bunch of little things that we could add to our stuff so let's get the mushroom copy go back to our forest age or put some will come us make this small mushroom here doesn't matter where you put it so everything looks nice hmm the stone converts a vector on this personal so you can adjust it a little bit I mean right now we don't have any collision with the different objects here so you can kind of walk over and they're like in the background at the moment okay we have some stones here we can put another still so we need it's not where maybe no next to the mushroom so since I another move this mushroom somewhere here so the stone is covering the mushroom because I think I put the mushroom relate earlier and there's still one I did a pay so they have some order consistency but you can push him back and forth with this so let's say you want to go back just push it back so now the mushroom was in the front right okay so one more tree stump let's get one more this okay alright so well and then we'll get one more two more one more mushroom right last mushroom let's use it oops did on this wrong one not go back to one so we can do it later on the other one yeah put them here okay all right so this is our first stage will give the players a chance to kind of move around and yeah I didn't get the meal with the with the game okay okay we have first stage done okay we can delete this sprite you would only need that anymore so we have the first stage okay what we need we can add some sprite to the sign right here we want to get the sign up with the sign here and we can put the sign like maybe here this in here if you want telling the player you know they can get the move that way you can change the sign till maybe ninety ninety five dozen there 75 maybe okay so the ninja will kind of come and start from here oh and then what we can do is we can create a crate also for the crate we can create that like a having a gym means after you break the crate you know the portal open up so we can do something like that so what you can do is you can create your uploaded crane okay and in this crate go to the costume what I did I also added some mom some grass around the crate so let's say you want this okay what you can do click on this change it to copy that and put it on the crate itself so if you like so kind of hiding the crater little bit okay so I know the crate the crate is little big right now but we can always change it a little okay so we have our crate there so either we can change it here like this select the whole thing right and then just just change it to smaller or you can change it with the size here as well so we don't wind doesn't matter so we're changing it like this for now okay with our little box maybe a little bit smaller I think that's good enough okay so we have the crate and we're gonna put a place somewhere here for now okay okay so the player breaks this crate I will create a portal somewhere for the player to get in I didn't have too many background things you let me remove this rocks I'll put a portal here later okay let me go back to my platform let's remove this rocks okay it was too clever I think there's too many things here okay just back up front so as you can see if you try to make the background look real nice it takes a lot of time okay all right okay let's go back to the plate so we got the crate going so we can delete this costume but only tell anyone I think earlier I forgot to convert this to vector so what happened now you cannot move this individual thing it gets stuck right so that's my problem with that I forgot that earlier so what you can do you say you see I cannot move this grass anymore I want to move it down a little bit it would walk because I forgot to connect to vector let's trash this my bad so let's do it again so make sure you always convert to vector ok I'll go back region go here and push again so convert this to vector first convert this to vector then oh yeah click on this so when you have bitmap once you move the thing just get stuck there that's it you can't change anything else after that so I try to cover this okay all right this is good now that's making smaller in the center so okay sorry about that this is done so this is put a crate here okay done it's done okay now do the water so for the oh I have come I already uploaded I already downloaded my previous sprite water so what I can do is just add it here so what you can do is you can push the water in the back on the front since there's all land we shouldn't see any water right if you have any gap then you can put the water so what we can do is we can push this water back so when you go to the next stage you'll see the water and you will see the water in the first stage so what is 5th wheel is similar right you can just you can see yeah you cannot blow those things and you and just kind of move them around cook them and then just form your water I'm not gonna show you how to do that it's pretty easy it will take a lot of time for the video if you give the see here I in here PNG this object known object background tile you'll see water I just use these two image that's kind of laid them up like John Nash the water line and then you get your water okay so let's go back so what we can do for the water well let's just do some coal for now I know we haven't done anything yet I think we were just and mostly set up so let's do our first coat for the water we are going to make them go here this position for now wherever the position is and we are going to push into the back layer so that the next stage when we move will see the water so first stage when we run we don't see any water so just kind of lame right okay that's done for the water part okay what we're going to do is we're gonna create some variable so we created that one variable called level so that will determine like what is the level what you know the different platform we have and you know we have to create a variable later on as well like gravity and speed fall speed and jump speed but I think that never was the one that was looking for is already here so what I'm going to do is gonna show you how we you know well we touch the portal and we can go to the next level but I think how to make the ninja move first right okay so where to walk on the ninja moving first ok let's create our variable so the first one will do one run speed this is like how fast we can make the ninja run we can the jump speed well then we can't force so as you can see this is called camelcase and programming lowercase F capital S comes different to see different world so this is kind of standard programming when you're making variable you use the first lowercase and then if you have any more dots next to it you kind of put a capital first capital letter and no spaces in between when you're making variable okay so we have for speed jump speed run speed we don't have to show this we're gonna show level every one and now we have gonna make something called gravity and we acquainted something with us to the next will keep track of the running costume costume this is just a keeping track D customer we're doing a loop through since we're multiple objects in the multiple custom for the jump and run and we'll make another variable maybe no and then in just dying so we do not want to have any action when the india is dying you should not be moving or jumping so we'll made that bear probe check as well okay so for now we have all the necessary variable for now what we're going to do is we are going back to the ninja we are going to make a block we're gonna call this start again so this is our function as a custom block what we want to do is we put in different num different Col here so that will run every time this function is call so let's see here we can do showed so when I start I can gonna do show we're gonna switch to costume ah so what we want to do without switch to this custom I five right no it doesn't matter you can use one five so this is a custom that we start the ninjas that we can put them enjoy any position let's say you put on me here that matter so we're gonna make it McCallum drop down a little bit little test our gravity make sure that works so we'll put them right down right here okay so you can just drag that in and then we are going to make in point in direction ninety basically to the right and we are going to make him go to the front layer like in front of everything so that you don't get this sign or anything blocking him and then we are going to set some variable initialize a variable okay we're gonna set the end run speed so we have to run speed ten we're gonna okay this we are going to put jump speed so jump speed auto twelve and then we are going to set our fall speed for speed is how fast is falling or we'll use that later zero for now and we're going to use gravity we're gonna make it negative one so every time you know if this up in there one y value to make the ninja fall down and we are going to say set the running custom index is zero and we're going to set the jumping custom index is zero as well we are going to have one more our dying way just the player dying so I'll put it nope and okay so this is the turn of the initializing the variable someone we what we make the call so what we can do is we can say even when it's clicked we're gonna say we're gonna call this block so right now nothing much to go to it won't just initialize a variable nothing's fun is happening didn't is just standing there he's not even falling down so right now we just cannot get there meow setup we've got the platform setup we got the water we've got the crane that we made we have the sine and then we have a platform we have three different stages so these we can delete we don't need them anymore okay so we have three stages stage 1 stage 2 stage 3 ok so if you see if items change it you see this first stage you see this change to something else there's another one so what we can do later we're gonna make sure that the box is generated somewhere that within this stage that we want so the the box that many I said break this box and give a gym when the ninja touch to gym they open the portal right so what we need to do is we are going to depending on different stage we might move The Box to this location of this location right and we're on stage 3 then we're to make sure that you know the box doesn't fall off the water it shouldn't be really hear it the box should be like I say right here up here or anything like that right so with a go in to make sure the box is generated correctly to the right position later okay so for now we'll stop here and we'll continue again on the next video thank you
