00:00 - [Music]
00:08 - hello guys and welcome back to kids
00:10 - calling playground
00:11 - so today we'll be working on part six of
00:14 - our among us platformer game
00:16 - where we left off last time was uh we
00:19 - did the laser and the spike
00:20 - today we'll probably work on the
00:23 - imposter
00:25 - if we have enough time then we can work
00:27 - on the smasher if not we'll do that
00:29 - pick up that on the next lesson so this
00:31 - is what we had last time for the code
00:33 - i think i explained it many times so i
00:36 - just gonna scroll around
00:37 - just in case you guys miss anything so
00:40 - just
00:41 - feel free press the uh pause button
00:44 - and then just make sure that you get all
00:46 - the code okay
00:48 - all right so that was the main uh
00:52 - main character okay and what the
00:55 - animated character here okay
00:58 - for the coat all right and then where
01:01 - the ground the ground is pretty
01:03 - simple trampoline
01:06 - like that okay the spike
01:09 - [Music]
01:10 - pretty simple and then the laser was a
01:13 - little bit more cool
01:14 - with it yesterday um
01:18 - so let's move it down a little bit
01:21 - so that we could try to fit everything
01:23 - in one small screen here
01:26 - okay all right so that was the laser
01:30 - co pretty much okay so let's work on the
01:34 - among us
01:35 - um the uh
01:38 - we're gonna use the in parts i already
01:40 - have it but basically
01:42 - it is just the animated uh character
01:45 - that we had
01:46 - sims color stem costume
01:50 - you know same thing right these guys
01:52 - same
01:53 - so exactly the same so what we are going
01:55 - to do is
01:56 - we are going to make it like a move and
01:58 - stuff like that patrolling around and
02:00 - stuff like that
02:01 - okay all right uh what we can do is we
02:04 - can take some of the code from the
02:05 - trampoline or spike doesn't matter don't
02:07 - take the laser laser
02:08 - a little bit more complicated so let's
02:10 - just go with this one
02:11 - let's take all this over here first
02:15 - and then we are going to make some
02:16 - change to the code
02:20 - okay so this and then
02:23 - this okay all right let's kind of spread
02:27 - them out a little bit
02:30 - set up the clone and then the high okay
02:33 - so let's go start this
02:37 - i will set the rotation style to uh left
02:40 - and right
02:40 - so that it won't flip around or you can
02:42 - just use this here
02:44 - make sure you select the center okay
02:47 - all right and then what we're going to
02:49 - do is
02:50 - uh to delete a reset same thing that is
02:53 - fine
02:54 - okay okay
02:57 - so let me move this thing down take that
03:00 - out
03:00 - okay all right uh what we're going to do
03:03 - is we're going to create another um
03:04 - custom block here i'll make a new block
03:08 - called drawing
03:12 - around okay
03:15 - [Music]
03:16 - you can leave this one here you don't
03:18 - need to check it uh so this is
03:20 - not needed okay
03:23 - okay let's work on this
03:25 - [Music]
03:28 - move down here uh we're gonna use the
03:31 - forever loop
03:32 - here okay let's see
03:35 - however loop i'm gonna repeat
03:39 - um 25 times
03:44 - okay motion i'm gonna put in direction
03:47 - point and direction 90 basically going
03:49 - to the right
03:51 - and then we can say uh change x
03:56 - by five step okay
04:00 - and then we are going to use the look
04:04 - uh next costume
04:07 - okay and then we're gonna duplicate this
04:10 - but uh
04:11 - i'm gonna switch it back to idle in the
04:13 - back here after 25 steps
04:16 - and we are going to put a little bit of
04:18 - weight here
04:19 - so that he kind of stops and then turn
04:22 - around counting
04:23 - 0.5 and put this back here i'm gonna do
04:28 - like a
04:28 - negative 90 and we're gonna change
04:32 - x by minus five
04:35 - and then at the end we will also change
04:38 - that back
04:39 - to our idle costume
04:42 - and we're going to put a little weight
04:43 - again also
04:45 - after that so 0.5
04:49 - so this is pretty much the patrolling
04:51 - around basically it's going to move
04:53 - around here
04:54 - back and forth you can do that and then
04:58 - go back up here or we start as a clone
05:03 - we can change its color so you can use
05:06 - this chain color effect
05:09 - okay and then you can pick at random
05:15 - and you can say like maybe uh doesn't
05:17 - matter 25
05:18 - or two you know 175 or 200 or whatever
05:25 - okay and then after that
05:29 - we don't need this anymore um
05:34 - we are going to move it to another place
05:35 - later i mean not another play will
05:37 - create another clone but we just put on
05:38 - the side here for now
05:40 - okay so for this one what we're going to
05:42 - do is we're going to call this new block
05:43 - that we just created
05:46 - uh patrolling around okay so this
05:49 - patrolling around we'll call this block
05:51 - here okay
05:53 - and then we have the clone so not the
05:55 - trampoline okay
05:56 - just that's the walk one or something
05:59 - like that
06:01 - and then i'll create a clone myself
06:03 - that's good
06:05 - so this will change it later different
06:07 - position that we
06:08 - want to put this character so this is a
06:11 - moving the character
06:12 - right and then we will want to do do
06:15 - another
06:16 - uh when clone when i saw this clone
06:20 - remove that uh what i'm going to do is
06:22 - going to see
06:23 - kind of change the play the walking
06:25 - sound just like what we had for the
06:27 - other
06:28 - other sprite uh you know it has the
06:31 - sound right walking
06:32 - so we want to play that whenever we you
06:35 - know hit the
06:36 - 56 costume or something so what you can
06:39 - do is get this forever loop here
06:42 - put this under here and then i'll take
06:44 - this
06:45 - if condition put this here
06:50 - and then go to operator take the equal
06:55 - and then go back over here and look
06:59 - there's a costume number right just drag
07:02 - that here
07:03 - we just say six whatever and then we are
07:07 - going to play the sound
07:08 - walk until done okay so this one doesn't
07:11 - block these other forever loops so you
07:13 - don't want to put this together with
07:14 - this so
07:15 - never will do that create two different
07:17 - um um
07:19 - broadcast message and receive
07:20 - broadcasting session through your stuff
07:22 - okay that will actually be better so we
07:25 - need another one when i start as a clone
07:29 - okay
07:33 - uh what we want to do with this here is
07:35 - we're going to check if the
07:37 - play actually touched the main character
07:39 - okay
07:41 - so we'll put this under here
07:44 - we're going to broadcast die okay
07:48 - so basically when it starts the clone so
07:50 - you see this three
07:51 - clone so when it start as a clone we'll
07:53 - do this code this code
07:54 - and this code okay all right so let's
07:57 - kind of zoom out a little bit
07:59 - so make sure we've got o co so this is
08:02 - the reset on the part
08:03 - top okay so level one we will not have
08:06 - him
08:07 - maybe level two let's see what level two
08:09 - looks like
08:10 - um go over here maybe we'll put them
08:13 - like right here or something like that
08:15 - right so let's go to level two so let's
08:18 - set our main character to level two for
08:21 - testing okay
08:23 - set it over here let's go back to the
08:26 - imposter
08:27 - okay so for level two
08:31 - let me see i'm going to put them
08:33 - somewhere so let me just start first
08:36 - so this is level two i'm gonna put
08:37 - somewhere right here maybe i push the
08:39 - control f i mean push the letter n
08:42 - so give me the position uh
08:45 - let's just say um maybe 150
08:48 - and then i don't know we can't adjust it
08:51 - okay just trying to adjust it and see
08:53 - so let's put this here oops
08:57 - so you say level 2 i want to put it at
09:01 - you know 150
09:04 - 97 i don't know about 97 i think
09:07 - 90 is actually better i think this price
09:11 - a little bit bigger
09:12 - so let's run it
09:15 - so you see he's a little bit further
09:18 - farther away right we want to make him a
09:20 - little closer uh you can do like maybe
09:22 - 140 or something
09:24 - so let's start again so 140 is still
09:28 - pretty far he run off a little bit off
09:30 - the screen no let's do
09:33 - 120 i don't know let's see
09:35 - [Music]
09:38 - so even 120 is it's still 100 let's just
09:41 - put in
09:41 - 100.
09:44 - oh let's just put them in 90 okay let's
09:46 - try 9 i think 90 will be better actually
09:49 - so
09:50 - you see a moving yeah 90 is good so it
09:53 - doesn't go off the screen
09:54 - so you see how he run all the way over
09:56 - there stop let's change it
09:58 - turn around and run the other way so we
10:01 - and then every time we
10:02 - start the yeah then it has a different
10:05 - color
10:05 - so because of this change color effect
10:08 - okay so let's just try it if we touch it
10:11 - does it die or not okay
10:13 - just wait here sorry
10:17 - that's it yeah so i die and then i come
10:20 - back over here
10:21 - so that is working fine
10:24 - so as you can see it's working fine okay
10:27 - so we'll get the other one we'll get the
10:31 - the smasher okay the smashers you can
10:34 - just draw it yourself
10:36 - so i drew it like with some gray and
10:38 - then white and then i draw the box here
10:41 - small box and then some spike i took it
10:43 - from here just flipped it around put it
10:45 - here
10:46 - i'll give you guys the sprite too uh if
10:49 - you want you can download it or you can
10:50 - just make your own okay way easy
10:53 - okay all right so we have the smasher
10:55 - here
10:57 - so uh let's work on this the smasher so
11:00 - the smasher is also
11:01 - similar to like you know the other clone
11:03 - that we've been doing
11:04 - so we'll try to do that
11:08 - so for the smasher i have a sound here
11:10 - like a crushing metal sound
11:13 - i'll provide the sound you can upload it
11:15 - here okay you know how to upload the
11:16 - samurai just click on this say upload
11:18 - and then select the uh
11:19 - your mp3 or whatever wav file okay
11:23 - so let's just play this
11:27 - so it's like kind of like the metal
11:28 - falling down okay
11:30 - all right so let's just take it from the
11:34 - trampoline like we're using trampoline
11:35 - earlier same thing let's just take this
11:38 - bracket here take this
11:42 - drag in here like this drag it here
11:46 - this and this
11:49 - okay all right let's separate them out
11:54 - reset here the setup here the clone here
11:58 - okay and then my custom block here
12:01 - and this is my function okay
12:04 - all right okay let's look at the
12:07 - one of the level that we have something
12:09 - that we can crush it down
12:12 - i think level four has it so what we
12:14 - want to do is we can put it up here and
12:15 - then crush it down
12:17 - and also if you're doing the crusher
12:19 - right because since this is the ground
12:21 - it has it on top so make sure that you
12:23 - don't have any sprite
12:25 - any blocks like these blocks shouldn't
12:27 - be around here
12:28 - if you have it here that one will not
12:30 - smash down so what we're gonna do is
12:32 - we're gonna make it smash down until we
12:33 - touch the ground sprite which is
12:36 - this part here or any of the part here
12:38 - on this grass right
12:39 - so make sure you don't have anything on
12:40 - this side you're making the smasher down
12:42 - okay
12:43 - all right so let's go to the number four
12:47 - let's start with number four here we'll
12:49 - change it to four so that when we start
12:51 - you know we have the smasher on number
12:52 - four okay
12:54 - and uh we can do the mouse here so
12:57 - somewhere around here
12:59 - you see two 200 and 150 something like
13:01 - that we'll adjust it okay accordingly
13:04 - okay let's stop this so let's go back to
13:07 - the smasher
13:09 - we just copy all the code over right
13:11 - okay so these two
13:12 - should be good um so what we're going to
13:15 - do is we're going to create another
13:16 - custom block
13:18 - here call smash
13:22 - down or whatever you like to call okay
13:26 - and now you can leave that unchecked
13:28 - that's fine so smash down basically
13:30 - we're gonna move the uh this uh smasher
13:32 - down let's put it down here
13:36 - okay so smash down
13:39 - we are going to use a forever loop
13:43 - and then we're going to use a repeat
13:46 - until
13:48 - let me zoom in one time and then you can
13:52 - use the uh
13:53 - sensing say
13:56 - touching ground so basically this ground
13:58 - sprite whatever sprite background here
14:00 - we have okay and then we are going to
14:05 - say change y
14:08 - by negative two so basically coming down
14:13 - okay and then when it until it touched
14:15 - the ground what we're going to do
14:17 - is we're going to broadcast a message so
14:19 - what we don't want to do is we don't
14:21 - want to put this on
14:22 - here because that will mess up the thing
14:24 - will play the sound that will move up
14:26 - so what we're going to do is we're going
14:27 - to use a broadcast message okay so we'll
14:30 - block the uh
14:31 - the event so let's say new message
14:37 - play smash sound
14:40 - okay so they'll play the smashing sound
14:45 - so we'll create that um so when i
14:47 - receive
14:51 - um was it play smash sound okay
14:55 - so you can have the sound here we can
14:58 - set the volume also
15:00 - set the volume let's say 50 we don't
15:02 - want to be too loud
15:05 - and then we can say play the sound until
15:07 - done okay
15:11 - okay over here you're gonna put like the
15:13 - weight
15:14 - one second and what we want to do will
15:18 - make the
15:19 - thing go back up okay so we say repeat
15:22 - let's repeat
15:26 - repeat and then you can use the operator
15:31 - greater than okay
15:37 - okay so i forgot um i have to add one
15:40 - variable so what we're going to do is
15:42 - we're going to take the
15:43 - where we're doing the clone we're going
15:45 - to take that and then we can
15:47 - pass it down so that the smash down can
15:50 - go back
15:50 - up to the position that it was started
15:52 - okay
15:53 - so let's edit this you can edit
15:56 - and you can add one variable called y
16:01 - okay y variable put that there
16:04 - uh you can say now go to the
16:07 - here you can check the y position and
16:11 - if it's greater than this okay repeat
16:15 - until this
16:15 - and then we are going to move change y
16:20 - by positive five so make it move back up
16:22 - [Music]
16:24 - okay let's stop this i don't wanna run
16:27 - okay so and then
16:31 - here where we're placing the uh the
16:33 - clown uh the the clone
16:36 - um so when i start as a clone right here
16:39 - right
16:39 - this uh there was the old one right that
16:41 - we have the bounce for the thing we'll
16:43 - trash all that okay so we'll
16:47 - just call this new block and we're gonna
16:50 - pass in this
16:51 - variable sorry okay so pass in that
16:54 - variable
16:56 - so this will call this one okay and then
16:58 - it will
16:59 - call this and then this will show this
17:02 - smasher and then we'll come down
17:04 - okay just make sure you open the open
17:06 - the smash up
17:07 - or you can just say when the start you
17:10 - know high right
17:11 - so when it when it when it come down set
17:14 - up
17:15 - where to fix the setup so this is not
17:17 - correct
17:18 - so let's delete this let's make this
17:21 - number four
17:23 - so number four we were looking at the
17:25 - position right here right so something
17:27 - like that
17:28 - uh we can say like maybe two
17:32 - or six i don't know two five to six
17:35 - and let's just go i think uh higher
17:40 - uh let's try 50
17:44 - because snatcher is a little bit higher
17:46 - on here right so
17:47 - 150 is kind of high i think it's
17:48 - probably start here okay so 50 should be
17:51 - good and then
17:54 - um okay let's just test it out
17:58 - i don't know if i miss any code uh let's
18:01 - see
18:01 - okay let's see so you can see
18:05 - so the smashing sound you see go back up
18:08 - so go up it's a little bit faster
18:10 - because we're using five
18:12 - coming down a little bit slower we use a
18:14 - negative two okay
18:15 - so you can see the smasher right
18:19 - but if this hit this we also want to
18:21 - kill the
18:22 - the player so we need to do that
18:26 - okay so grab another one of these uh
18:28 - when i start as a clone
18:31 - here okay so you don't want to mess with
18:34 - this
18:35 - you always want to get another one so
18:37 - that way these can run and this also can
18:39 - run
18:39 - independently okay use a forever loop
18:42 - here
18:44 - and i think i deleted the other one i
18:46 - shouldn't have deleted it
18:48 - i can just use this right duplicate this
18:52 - let's put it here trash this now so here
18:56 - we can put it down here okay so when it
18:59 - when they touch it this the main
19:01 - character and broadcast die
19:03 - okay let's test it out okay so when
19:06 - level four
19:10 - okay
19:14 - so as you can see i got killed by the
19:17 - spike right
19:18 - so if i don't get killed by the spike
19:21 - then i can go to the next level
19:23 - right so that looks all fine
19:26 - looks like the spike is uh the smasher
19:28 - is working fine
19:30 - so i added some more uh some more
19:34 - like uh
19:37 - stage for this so um
19:40 - if you have more stage right just make
19:43 - sure you
19:44 - you change this uh code okay where we
19:46 - have the uh
19:47 - the ground so change that you know if
19:50 - you have five stage
19:52 - we have to do negative six so if you
19:54 - have nine stage
19:55 - nine different costume here right nine
19:58 - then you do
19:59 - ten here okay um also
20:03 - uh come back to the main character
20:06 - i think the main character so well we
20:08 - have this level set also right to
20:10 - increase the level
20:11 - so you can say uh less than nine so nine
20:14 - of them so that one is ten so this one
20:17 - if we do less than ten this one you do
20:20 - less than nine okay and then we can
20:23 - start at number one
20:25 - go back to one or whatever you like and
20:28 - now you need to do like let's say
20:30 - um let's say you want to get more of the
20:33 - this is number four right number four
20:36 - and let's say
20:37 - now if i pass four i should be able to
20:39 - go to five and six
20:40 - so earlier i cannot go to spy uh six
20:43 - right after i go past number five
20:46 - so now it should allow me to do that
20:48 - okay let's see
20:49 - yeah so as you can see i have not coated
20:52 - this one
20:53 - but you can easily put that putting the
20:55 - uh
20:56 - the laser just like how we did last time
20:59 - right
20:59 - the laser here so you just say okay it's
21:02 - six
21:03 - and you want to like put a different
21:05 - position
21:07 - um push m here let's say 50 you see
21:09 - negative 50 and then
21:11 - 120 or something like that you can do
21:14 - that so
21:15 - let's say you do here let's say this is
21:17 - one number six
21:19 - and i want it to be negative 50
21:22 - 120 right and then you can start the
21:25 - character here number six so when you're
21:27 - making
21:28 - changes to your code you can make sure
21:30 - that you can move it to the
21:32 - to the location that you want so number
21:34 - six see
21:35 - and let's say you want number six you
21:36 - want to have this uh guy patrol here
21:38 - number six
21:40 - then you can adjust it so here just like
21:42 - that
21:43 - we do number six right so duplicate this
21:47 - oops sorry put that
21:51 - level six okay and then here
21:55 - a level six you can just adjust it so
21:57 - let's say
21:58 - uh i mean i already have some of the
22:00 - coordinate down earlier but if you don't
22:02 - just mess it just put something
22:03 - different and then you'll see so
22:05 - negative 90 was here right so we wanted
22:07 - him to go up here
22:08 - so uh what i had in
22:13 - so let's say number six let's see how
22:15 - number six work now so you see
22:17 - he's actually running over there if you
22:19 - if you adjust it incorrectly just adjust
22:21 - the
22:21 - left and right and then you'll find it
22:23 - okay so now this six is done
22:27 - [Music]
22:29 - so number six is done number seven right
22:31 - you need a jump pad let's say you need a
22:33 - jump pad here
22:34 - then click on this little m
22:38 - mouse right this is 1 7 72 117
22:42 - right so this is number seven so you can
22:45 - just come back over here
22:48 - right so you can just duplicate this
22:51 - and put number seven
22:54 - oops number seven and you can put like
22:58 - let's say
23:00 - 72 i don't know 17.
23:04 - it might not be exactly correct right
23:06 - just test it out so
23:08 - you can change your main character go to
23:09 - number seven right level seven
23:12 - so you see yep looks okay yeah it's okay
23:17 - so and then you can put like a spike
23:19 - here if you want let's say you want to
23:20 - put some spikey if they've missed if
23:22 - they die then you can do that
23:25 - right this is level seven so you say
23:28 - okay
23:30 - level seven i want to put spike at this
23:32 - location
23:33 - right ctrl them this is set um
23:38 - so about 110 181 or something
23:42 - okay sorry i'm gonna hit them over there
23:45 - so you put 101
23:50 - i think 97 is correct uh i think all
23:52 - these are 97 so 101.97
23:54 - let's just check it out okay let's see
23:58 - oops that's not correct how i move this
24:01 - high
24:02 - sorry put it back okay so
24:05 - you see i need to move it a little bit
24:06 - further actually uh 1
24:09 - 15. 115.
24:13 - see 120 130
24:17 - maybe so see 130 is good
24:20 - so as you can see this 130 looks great
24:24 - so so if you want another smasher here
24:27 - so same thing right with this here
24:32 - and where we have the smasher right so
24:34 - move this down
24:36 - duplicate this this is number eight
24:40 - right so
24:41 - [Music]
24:43 - so here i think it's in the middle so
24:45 - like zero or two or whatever
24:47 - so let's just say two and then fifty
24:50 - so you can test it out number eight go
24:52 - back here change it to eight
24:55 - let's stop this and you can see oh yep
24:58 - that's coming down correctly so you need
25:01 - a jump pad here to get upgrade
25:03 - so you can put the jump pad so
25:06 - jump pad let's say uh click on this
25:10 - somewhere 140 right
25:13 - take this out duplicate this
25:17 - this is eight oops
25:21 - put um 140
25:26 - uh let's say negative 97. i think that
25:29 - is correct
25:30 - so let's start here so you see the jump
25:32 - pads there
25:33 - right okay so you can
25:37 - jump over this so there you go
25:40 - that's the end so you cannot go any
25:42 - further
25:43 - and that's everything so this is pretty
25:46 - much the
25:46 - game uh so this is
25:50 - too high i cannot get up uh so
25:53 - maybe i'll move this down a little bit i
25:54 - think originally it's different
25:56 - so um anyway oh you can put a jump pad
25:59 - and make him jump up okay
26:00 - please like share and subscribe to our
26:02 - channel
26:03 - and give us a thumbs up on the video
26:05 - okay and share with your friend that
26:07 - will be great
26:08 - thank you very much and see you guys
26:10 - next time bye

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys and welcome back to kids calling playground so today we'll be working on part six of our among us platformer game where we left off last time was uh we did the laser and the spike today we'll probably work on the imposter if we have enough time then we can work on the smasher if not we'll do that pick up that on the next lesson so this is what we had last time for the code i think i explained it many times so i just gonna scroll around just in case you guys miss anything so just feel free press the uh pause button and then just make sure that you get all the code okay all right so that was the main uh main character okay and what the animated character here okay for the coat all right and then where the ground the ground is pretty simple trampoline like that okay the spike pretty simple and then the laser was a little bit more cool with it yesterday um so let's move it down a little bit so that we could try to fit everything in one small screen here okay all right so that was the laser co pretty much okay so let's work on the among us um the uh we're gonna use the in parts i already have it but basically it is just the animated uh character that we had sims color stem costume you know same thing right these guys same so exactly the same so what we are going to do is we are going to make it like a move and stuff like that patrolling around and stuff like that okay all right uh what we can do is we can take some of the code from the trampoline or spike doesn't matter don't take the laser laser a little bit more complicated so let's just go with this one let's take all this over here first and then we are going to make some change to the code okay so this and then this okay all right let's kind of spread them out a little bit set up the clone and then the high okay so let's go start this i will set the rotation style to uh left and right so that it won't flip around or you can just use this here make sure you select the center okay all right and then what we're going to do is uh to delete a reset same thing that is fine okay okay so let me move this thing down take that out okay all right uh what we're going to do is we're going to create another um custom block here i'll make a new block called drawing around okay you can leave this one here you don't need to check it uh so this is not needed okay okay let's work on this move down here uh we're gonna use the forever loop here okay let's see however loop i'm gonna repeat um 25 times okay motion i'm gonna put in direction point and direction 90 basically going to the right and then we can say uh change x by five step okay and then we are going to use the look uh next costume okay and then we're gonna duplicate this but uh i'm gonna switch it back to idle in the back here after 25 steps and we are going to put a little bit of weight here so that he kind of stops and then turn around counting 0.5 and put this back here i'm gonna do like a negative 90 and we're gonna change x by minus five and then at the end we will also change that back to our idle costume and we're going to put a little weight again also after that so 0.5 so this is pretty much the patrolling around basically it's going to move around here back and forth you can do that and then go back up here or we start as a clone we can change its color so you can use this chain color effect okay and then you can pick at random and you can say like maybe uh doesn't matter 25 or two you know 175 or 200 or whatever okay and then after that we don't need this anymore um we are going to move it to another place later i mean not another play will create another clone but we just put on the side here for now okay so for this one what we're going to do is we're going to call this new block that we just created uh patrolling around okay so this patrolling around we'll call this block here okay and then we have the clone so not the trampoline okay just that's the walk one or something like that and then i'll create a clone myself that's good so this will change it later different position that we want to put this character so this is a moving the character right and then we will want to do do another uh when clone when i saw this clone remove that uh what i'm going to do is going to see kind of change the play the walking sound just like what we had for the other other sprite uh you know it has the sound right walking so we want to play that whenever we you know hit the 56 costume or something so what you can do is get this forever loop here put this under here and then i'll take this if condition put this here and then go to operator take the equal and then go back over here and look there's a costume number right just drag that here we just say six whatever and then we are going to play the sound walk until done okay so this one doesn't block these other forever loops so you don't want to put this together with this so never will do that create two different um um broadcast message and receive broadcasting session through your stuff okay that will actually be better so we need another one when i start as a clone okay uh what we want to do with this here is we're going to check if the play actually touched the main character okay so we'll put this under here we're going to broadcast die okay so basically when it starts the clone so you see this three clone so when it start as a clone we'll do this code this code and this code okay all right so let's kind of zoom out a little bit so make sure we've got o co so this is the reset on the part top okay so level one we will not have him maybe level two let's see what level two looks like um go over here maybe we'll put them like right here or something like that right so let's go to level two so let's set our main character to level two for testing okay set it over here let's go back to the imposter okay so for level two let me see i'm going to put them somewhere so let me just start first so this is level two i'm gonna put somewhere right here maybe i push the control f i mean push the letter n so give me the position uh let's just say um maybe 150 and then i don't know we can't adjust it okay just trying to adjust it and see so let's put this here oops so you say level 2 i want to put it at you know 150 97 i don't know about 97 i think 90 is actually better i think this price a little bit bigger so let's run it so you see he's a little bit further farther away right we want to make him a little closer uh you can do like maybe 140 or something so let's start again so 140 is still pretty far he run off a little bit off the screen no let's do 120 i don't know let's see so even 120 is it's still 100 let's just put in 100. oh let's just put them in 90 okay let's try 9 i think 90 will be better actually so you see a moving yeah 90 is good so it doesn't go off the screen so you see how he run all the way over there stop let's change it turn around and run the other way so we and then every time we start the yeah then it has a different color so because of this change color effect okay so let's just try it if we touch it does it die or not okay just wait here sorry that's it yeah so i die and then i come back over here so that is working fine so as you can see it's working fine okay so we'll get the other one we'll get the the smasher okay the smashers you can just draw it yourself so i drew it like with some gray and then white and then i draw the box here small box and then some spike i took it from here just flipped it around put it here i'll give you guys the sprite too uh if you want you can download it or you can just make your own okay way easy okay all right so we have the smasher here so uh let's work on this the smasher so the smasher is also similar to like you know the other clone that we've been doing so we'll try to do that so for the smasher i have a sound here like a crushing metal sound i'll provide the sound you can upload it here okay you know how to upload the samurai just click on this say upload and then select the uh your mp3 or whatever wav file okay so let's just play this so it's like kind of like the metal falling down okay all right so let's just take it from the trampoline like we're using trampoline earlier same thing let's just take this bracket here take this drag in here like this drag it here this and this okay all right let's separate them out reset here the setup here the clone here okay and then my custom block here and this is my function okay all right okay let's look at the one of the level that we have something that we can crush it down i think level four has it so what we want to do is we can put it up here and then crush it down and also if you're doing the crusher right because since this is the ground it has it on top so make sure that you don't have any sprite any blocks like these blocks shouldn't be around here if you have it here that one will not smash down so what we're gonna do is we're gonna make it smash down until we touch the ground sprite which is this part here or any of the part here on this grass right so make sure you don't have anything on this side you're making the smasher down okay all right so let's go to the number four let's start with number four here we'll change it to four so that when we start you know we have the smasher on number four okay and uh we can do the mouse here so somewhere around here you see two 200 and 150 something like that we'll adjust it okay accordingly okay let's stop this so let's go back to the smasher we just copy all the code over right okay so these two should be good um so what we're going to do is we're going to create another custom block here call smash down or whatever you like to call okay and now you can leave that unchecked that's fine so smash down basically we're gonna move the uh this uh smasher down let's put it down here okay so smash down we are going to use a forever loop and then we're going to use a repeat until let me zoom in one time and then you can use the uh sensing say touching ground so basically this ground sprite whatever sprite background here we have okay and then we are going to say change y by negative two so basically coming down okay and then when it until it touched the ground what we're going to do is we're going to broadcast a message so what we don't want to do is we don't want to put this on here because that will mess up the thing will play the sound that will move up so what we're going to do is we're going to use a broadcast message okay so we'll block the uh the event so let's say new message play smash sound okay so they'll play the smashing sound so we'll create that um so when i receive um was it play smash sound okay so you can have the sound here we can set the volume also set the volume let's say 50 we don't want to be too loud and then we can say play the sound until done okay okay over here you're gonna put like the weight one second and what we want to do will make the thing go back up okay so we say repeat let's repeat repeat and then you can use the operator greater than okay okay so i forgot um i have to add one variable so what we're going to do is we're going to take the where we're doing the clone we're going to take that and then we can pass it down so that the smash down can go back up to the position that it was started okay so let's edit this you can edit and you can add one variable called y okay y variable put that there uh you can say now go to the here you can check the y position and if it's greater than this okay repeat until this and then we are going to move change y by positive five so make it move back up okay let's stop this i don't wanna run okay so and then here where we're placing the uh the clown uh the the clone um so when i start as a clone right here right this uh there was the old one right that we have the bounce for the thing we'll trash all that okay so we'll just call this new block and we're gonna pass in this variable sorry okay so pass in that variable so this will call this one okay and then it will call this and then this will show this smasher and then we'll come down okay just make sure you open the open the smash up or you can just say when the start you know high right so when it when it when it come down set up where to fix the setup so this is not correct so let's delete this let's make this number four so number four we were looking at the position right here right so something like that uh we can say like maybe two or six i don't know two five to six and let's just go i think uh higher uh let's try 50 because snatcher is a little bit higher on here right so 150 is kind of high i think it's probably start here okay so 50 should be good and then um okay let's just test it out i don't know if i miss any code uh let's see okay let's see so you can see so the smashing sound you see go back up so go up it's a little bit faster because we're using five coming down a little bit slower we use a negative two okay so you can see the smasher right but if this hit this we also want to kill the the player so we need to do that okay so grab another one of these uh when i start as a clone here okay so you don't want to mess with this you always want to get another one so that way these can run and this also can run independently okay use a forever loop here and i think i deleted the other one i shouldn't have deleted it i can just use this right duplicate this let's put it here trash this now so here we can put it down here okay so when it when they touch it this the main character and broadcast die okay let's test it out okay so when level four okay so as you can see i got killed by the spike right so if i don't get killed by the spike then i can go to the next level right so that looks all fine looks like the spike is uh the smasher is working fine so i added some more uh some more like uh stage for this so um if you have more stage right just make sure you you change this uh code okay where we have the uh the ground so change that you know if you have five stage we have to do negative six so if you have nine stage nine different costume here right nine then you do ten here okay um also uh come back to the main character i think the main character so well we have this level set also right to increase the level so you can say uh less than nine so nine of them so that one is ten so this one if we do less than ten this one you do less than nine okay and then we can start at number one go back to one or whatever you like and now you need to do like let's say um let's say you want to get more of the this is number four right number four and let's say now if i pass four i should be able to go to five and six so earlier i cannot go to spy uh six right after i go past number five so now it should allow me to do that okay let's see yeah so as you can see i have not coated this one but you can easily put that putting the uh the laser just like how we did last time right the laser here so you just say okay it's six and you want to like put a different position um push m here let's say 50 you see negative 50 and then 120 or something like that you can do that so let's say you do here let's say this is one number six and i want it to be negative 50 120 right and then you can start the character here number six so when you're making changes to your code you can make sure that you can move it to the to the location that you want so number six see and let's say you want number six you want to have this uh guy patrol here number six then you can adjust it so here just like that we do number six right so duplicate this oops sorry put that level six okay and then here a level six you can just adjust it so let's say uh i mean i already have some of the coordinate down earlier but if you don't just mess it just put something different and then you'll see so negative 90 was here right so we wanted him to go up here so uh what i had in so let's say number six let's see how number six work now so you see he's actually running over there if you if you adjust it incorrectly just adjust the left and right and then you'll find it okay so now this six is done so number six is done number seven right you need a jump pad let's say you need a jump pad here then click on this little m mouse right this is 1 7 72 117 right so this is number seven so you can just come back over here right so you can just duplicate this and put number seven oops number seven and you can put like let's say 72 i don't know 17. it might not be exactly correct right just test it out so you can change your main character go to number seven right level seven so you see yep looks okay yeah it's okay so and then you can put like a spike here if you want let's say you want to put some spikey if they've missed if they die then you can do that right this is level seven so you say okay level seven i want to put spike at this location right ctrl them this is set um so about 110 181 or something okay sorry i'm gonna hit them over there so you put 101 i think 97 is correct uh i think all these are 97 so 101.97 let's just check it out okay let's see oops that's not correct how i move this high sorry put it back okay so you see i need to move it a little bit further actually uh 1 15. 115. see 120 130 maybe so see 130 is good so as you can see this 130 looks great so so if you want another smasher here so same thing right with this here and where we have the smasher right so move this down duplicate this this is number eight right so so here i think it's in the middle so like zero or two or whatever so let's just say two and then fifty so you can test it out number eight go back here change it to eight let's stop this and you can see oh yep that's coming down correctly so you need a jump pad here to get upgrade so you can put the jump pad so jump pad let's say uh click on this somewhere 140 right take this out duplicate this this is eight oops put um 140 uh let's say negative 97. i think that is correct so let's start here so you see the jump pads there right okay so you can jump over this so there you go that's the end so you cannot go any further and that's everything so this is pretty much the game uh so this is too high i cannot get up uh so maybe i'll move this down a little bit i think originally it's different so um anyway oh you can put a jump pad and make him jump up okay please like share and subscribe to our channel and give us a thumbs up on the video okay and share with your friend that will be great thank you very much and see you guys next time bye
