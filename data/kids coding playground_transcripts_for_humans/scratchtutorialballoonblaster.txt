00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids coming
00:09 - playground here and today we're back for
00:12 - another video on scratch and today we'll
00:14 - be making this really fun game called
00:16 - balloon blaster so um
00:20 - uh so we haven't recorded lately because
00:22 - of school and uh since it just started
00:25 - back up again so and now now we don't
00:27 - have that much time anymore so but today
00:30 - i just decided to
00:31 - make a recording and i'm going to click
00:34 - go so as you can see you have 10 seconds
00:36 - to pop all the balloons here and then
00:39 - you have um 30 balloons to pop always
00:41 - 30. so then and then they're all
00:44 - different colors so it says if you don't
00:46 - make it up in time you lose
00:48 - so you can get multiple balloons at once
00:51 - that
00:58 - home your missiles okay okay i lost
01:00 - again but uh so you can hold your
01:02 - missiles and like
01:04 - make them in mid air so that's what i
01:06 - thought was pretty cool so then i could
01:08 - like
01:09 - home it and it looks more it's more cool
01:12 - and i have four more seconds left number
01:14 - balloon zero
01:15 - and then you win so
01:17 - yeah so it's just pretty fun concept
01:22 - so yeah um anyways let's get started
01:26 - so
01:27 - first let's make a new project
01:31 - so um
01:32 - so
01:35 - let's get started so first let's rename
01:37 - this project to uh balloon back blaster
01:42 - so hey
01:46 - and then
01:48 - delete the scratch yeah of course we
01:49 - never need to scratch it oh yeah we also
01:51 - want to pick a backdrop real quick
01:54 - uh
01:56 - blue sky
01:57 - delete that so
02:01 - first thing we do is um go to the
02:03 - backpack i actually have everything in
02:05 - store actually get the balloon first
02:07 - let's get the balloon so we have the
02:08 - balloon it's in the stretch thing
02:10 - balloon
02:11 - and then we also get a dart
02:16 - so uh
02:18 - feel free to pause here and try to make
02:20 - a similar concept it's just a rectangle
02:23 - with two lines hold shift down
02:25 - uh there's the feathers which is just a
02:28 - rectangle
02:30 - reshaped
02:32 - you can use rectangle or circle for the
02:34 - feathers but i decided to use circle and
02:37 - then a little tip like an arrow line and
02:40 - then a triangle
02:42 - just delete one half of a square so
02:45 - i'll show you how to make the triangle
02:47 - it's not that
02:49 - hard just
02:50 - make a square
02:52 - hold shift down so it's perfect
02:54 - and then you go to reshape tools select
02:56 - one of the corners backup space or
02:59 - delete or whatever you're on and then
03:01 - delete and then rotate it
03:03 - and then you
03:04 - have it
03:05 - so
03:07 - yeah um
03:09 - so okay i'm gonna do a reshape real
03:10 - quick and
03:11 - do the feathers so um
03:16 - i'll teach you how to do the feather so
03:17 - you start with the circle
03:19 - kind of like an oval-shaped ellipse
03:20 - maybe and then you drag out drag in
03:25 - drag out dragon
03:27 - drag out drag in
03:31 - and drag out and it's like a hand type
03:33 - of shape and you put that on the back
03:37 - some fine reshaping will do it like that
03:39 - and
03:40 - we have that
03:42 - done
03:43 - and this done so now let's get started
03:47 - so you want to draw your dart pointing
03:49 - to the right side because if you like um
03:54 - because if you uh
03:57 - and you want to point it direction zero
03:58 - because if you point it up
04:00 - it will and you want to make it move
04:02 - steps it'll move to the right side not
04:04 - the left side so that just messes
04:06 - everything up and now we have to make
04:08 - i'll make the u n later first let's just
04:11 - focus on the blue
04:12 - so the balloon um
04:16 - let's get started so
04:19 - the first thing we do on the balloon
04:21 - is
04:23 - is the my block so
04:25 - define
04:26 - create balloon
04:31 - and then you want to add an input
04:34 - one
04:35 - input you put an x on the first input
04:37 - second input put a y oh i put a h y
04:40 - and then we have x
04:43 - and y
04:44 - okay so we have our define x y so we can
04:46 - drag out the x
04:48 - and you can drag out the y so
04:50 - it'll go to x
04:55 - x and y
04:56 - y wherever it
04:58 - is
05:00 - so and we have to make create clone of
05:03 - myself because you want to
05:05 - create
05:06 - a nice clone for itself
05:09 - so when i start as a clone
05:12 - uh
05:13 - set color effect
05:16 - set color effect uh what's that to
05:20 - pick random one to three hundred so
05:22 - there's a variety of colors that you can
05:24 - pick from uh
05:26 - oh i just didn't see it so that's like
05:28 - some type of electric green there so
05:31 - that's what we're having here and then
05:33 - you have a wait until
05:36 - it's touching the dart because the
05:38 - balloon
05:39 - will hide once it touches the dart right
05:40 - so
05:41 - wait until touching
05:44 - and then uh start sound pop so every
05:47 - single spray has a pop sound so it
05:49 - should be easy to find and then change
05:55 - number of balloons so we're going to
05:56 - make a variable
05:58 - number
06:00 - of
06:01 - balloons
06:06 - and then we okay this
06:09 - and then we have
06:11 - change change var change variable
06:14 - number of balloons
06:16 - by
06:17 - negative one
06:19 - so
06:20 - the every single time uh the dart hits
06:23 - the balloon it will go down one of the
06:26 - balloon uh little filters here will go
06:28 - down by one so let me drag this down
06:31 - so that's what we're having here and
06:33 - then um hide because the
06:36 - clone will hide
06:40 - and then if then
06:45 - if then the number of balloons equals
06:47 - zero
06:49 - which means if all the balloons are gone
06:52 - broadcast you win
06:56 - i'm actually gonna make that you win
06:57 - sprite real quick
06:59 - uh
07:01 - and the you lose sprite
07:04 - so
07:06 - i'm gonna don't mind me while i make
07:08 - this so
07:09 - text uh let's start with you lose
07:11 - because it's already on the red color
07:13 - so
07:15 - lose
07:17 - and then just yeah you know the deal
07:23 - so then yeah you have this
07:26 - and then
07:27 - you duplicate it
07:29 - and make you
07:30 - win but then you
07:33 - so now i'm going to make the wins bright
07:35 - so we want to take this whole thing
07:38 - go over here
07:39 - change it to a green color and now we
07:42 - have the you win and then you lose
07:44 - finish ready so go back to the balloon
07:48 - and then if number of balloons equals
07:51 - zero
07:52 - oh yeah we need to go back to the
07:53 - balloons real quick number of balloons
07:55 - equals zero then broadcast you win so
07:59 - after you popped all the balloons you
08:01 - would
08:03 - let's work on you win later on in this
08:06 - video when we start coding the dart and
08:09 - everything so yeah let's have you win or
08:12 - on the side for right now and then when
08:14 - the green flag is clicked
08:17 - it will set number of balloons to 30.
08:21 - so i have 30 balloons here so
08:24 - yes
08:26 - and show
08:30 - and then repeat number of balloons so we
08:32 - just take this
08:34 - go to variables number of balloons
08:36 - because there's 30 balloons a number of
08:38 - bullets and then create balloon
08:42 - so this is the hard part
08:45 - so i'm going to move this over a little
08:46 - bit
08:48 - all right so now we have some despair
08:50 - space for this oh so the create balloon
08:53 - um
08:54 - we'll pick random
08:59 - so pick a random position because
09:02 - but it's near the top so negative 200
09:05 - to 200
09:07 - which is the x here so negative 200 back
09:10 - here
09:11 - and
09:12 - negat positive 200 over here so the
09:15 - balloons can be
09:16 - over over here to over here but we don't
09:19 - want that to we don't want balloons to
09:21 - like spawn in the dark or like over here
09:23 - or here because you can't get those so
09:25 - we have to have
09:26 - a pick random
09:32 - 50
09:33 - to
09:34 - 135 that's the um
09:37 - x that l y that we're using here so
09:40 - 50
09:41 - to 135 so it's like around this area
09:45 - that the balloons can start spawning at
09:48 - so we have the balloons done once we
09:50 - have this hide let's see
09:52 - so we got multi-colored balloons tons of
09:55 - them so yeah so now we're gonna start
09:57 - working on
10:00 - oh yeah and the balloons are too big so
10:02 - let's just change the size 50 yay
10:05 - now let's play it
10:07 - now
10:08 - we still multi-colored
10:10 - right now the dart hasn't coded yet so
10:12 - we have to code the dart so
10:16 - when the green flag is clicked it will
10:18 - show
10:23 - oh so because you always want to show it
10:25 - and then we're not using clones for this
10:27 - one
10:28 - because we thought it'd be
10:30 - uh more compatible with the other things
10:32 - so go to x0 negative 110 that's around
10:35 - this area and then point in direction
10:37 - zero remember when i told you when you
10:40 - have to put the dart to the right side
10:42 - you want to point it up right because
10:44 - it's more compatible because if you want
10:45 - to if you make the dart go
10:48 - precisely up and you want to make it
10:50 - move steps it'll go right so you want to
10:52 - make it point in direction zero so that
10:54 - you'll go up instead of right so and now
10:57 - you go to forever
11:01 - and then we need if then
11:04 - if the left arrow key is
11:06 - oh oh yeah also if you prefer um
11:10 - using wasd or something like that uh i
11:13 - don't mind you
11:14 - changing this to a or d so when the when
11:18 - the key left arrow is pressed it will
11:20 - change x
11:21 - by 10.
11:23 - where is that
11:24 - because it will keep on going up and up
11:26 - and
11:27 - or negative 10.
11:31 - yeah so you can move it back and forth
11:34 - because negative 10 is this way
11:36 - positive 10 is this way so
11:39 - yeah and we just have to duplicate this
11:41 - do some time fine tuning and
11:44 - key right arrow
11:47 - then it will change x by 10 so there we
11:49 - have it
11:50 - and now we have to have the space key
11:52 - and all of that finished so when the
11:55 - space key is pressed
11:57 - you want to
12:00 - repeat until
12:07 - so um
12:09 - when the space key is pressed it will
12:11 - repeat until
12:13 - it's touching the edge wait wait this is
12:15 - the tricky part you need to end i'll
12:18 - explain it and then touching edge
12:23 - and
12:24 - y position
12:31 - is greater than 150.
12:37 - where's my position
12:39 - you want to know why because um
12:41 - if you want to home your dark and you
12:45 - accidentally scroll to the left or the
12:47 - right it'll delete right because it'll
12:49 - repeat until touching the edge but you
12:51 - have to make it until it's
12:53 - over y position 150 and it will delete
12:57 - and 150 is around here right so
13:00 - if
13:01 - you
13:02 - put the dart and then you move it up
13:05 - it'll delete only if it's greater than
13:08 - 150
13:10 - so it's around here
13:13 - all throughout here so then
13:15 - because if you did on the right side or
13:17 - the left side it would just if you want
13:19 - to home it you'll just delete right
13:20 - there so that is really bad if you want
13:23 - that if you don't want that to happen
13:26 - copy the code down and now we move 20
13:28 - steps because remember we uh point the
13:30 - direction to zero because it's pointing
13:33 - the up because we made it right side and
13:36 - if we don't want to make it go right
13:38 - then we have to point make it go this
13:40 - way and then we change the direction to
13:42 - zero and then it'll start going up so
13:43 - move 20 steps per yeah so we'll move 20
13:46 - steps and then it will hide
13:50 - and wait 0.2 seconds
13:53 - because there's a small weight because
13:55 - we don't want you like overlapping darts
13:58 - and
13:58 - it'll go to
14:01 - x 0
14:03 - y negative 110 and it will
14:06 - show
14:07 - so we have that done now our last thing
14:09 - we have to code next is that you win you
14:12 - lose sprite so
14:14 - you win
14:15 - when the green flag is clicked
14:19 - it will hide
14:22 - and it will go to x zero zero because
14:25 - you know you didn't win or lose yet so
14:27 - you go to the middle and you'll hide so
14:30 - and then when i receive you win
14:37 - you have to switch costume to costume
14:41 - two because that's the winning costume
14:43 - and then it will show
14:47 - you the winning costume and
14:50 - uh stop all
14:54 - we have some extra code for the backdrop
14:56 - i literally forgot about it it's about
14:58 - if you lose so when the green flag is
15:01 - clicked
15:02 - i
15:04 - uh
15:05 - you want to
15:06 - set time
15:07 - new variable
15:10 - time
15:12 - the set time
15:14 - to 10 seconds so you have 10 seconds
15:17 - and repeat 10 times
15:19 - because you have 10 of that variable
15:22 - and then i'll wait one second and
15:23 - decrease by one every single time so
15:26 - when you run out of time you lose
15:28 - so set time oh never mind no change shot
15:31 - change time always forget change
15:34 - change
15:35 - time by minus one
15:37 - so
15:38 - every second time will go down
15:41 - because
15:42 - yeah every single second your time goes
15:44 - down so when the green flag is clicked
15:46 - it'll go forever
15:48 - and then if then the time equals zero
15:54 - then you lose
15:58 - new broadcast
16:03 - new message here
16:05 - a new broadcast message
16:07 - broadcast
16:10 - you
16:11 - lose
16:17 - so we have that and then um
16:19 - feel free to pause if you haven't caught
16:21 - up yet and then you go back to the you
16:23 - win sprite
16:24 - and then when you receive you lose
16:29 - you switch costume to costume one
16:31 - because that's the you lose bright show
16:33 - and stuff so let's see my project here
16:38 - so uh i forgot to
16:40 - move the top okay
16:42 - get out of here
16:43 - move the time down here
16:45 - and yeah and i'd also like to add some
16:47 - music
16:48 - because i haven't added the music um
16:54 - uh so
16:55 - that's the music
17:00 - yeah i just get the sound
17:02 - uh let's just pick a random loop
17:05 - i'm gonna chill
17:09 - that chill that one sounds pretty good
17:11 - and play sound chill until done
17:14 - and then
17:16 - set no you don't actually have to
17:18 - i no
17:20 - you don't actually have to set the
17:21 - volume but you know since i'm talking
17:23 - and stuff you know said it's 25 or
17:25 - something
17:26 - so yeah uh let's
17:28 - get started and let's see if it works or
17:30 - not i moved the time to the bottom if
17:32 - you didn't notice and look the time is
17:34 - decreasing by the seconds and um
17:38 - uh you can launch your dart and it's
17:39 - obviously popping the balloons and the
17:42 - you lose works like i lost
17:45 - and then number of balloons 30 if you
17:47 - want to win you gotta
17:49 - break all the balloons in time so let's
17:51 - see what i have here no i'm gonna lose
17:53 - off no yeah once okay so you win and
17:56 - then number of balloons equals zero so
17:58 - you win so please like share subscribe
18:02 - and comment in the comment section below
18:03 - what else videos you want and remember
18:06 - um
18:07 - see you guys next time
18:10 - [Music]
18:19 - you

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's kids coming playground here and today we're back for another video on scratch and today we'll be making this really fun game called balloon blaster so um uh so we haven't recorded lately because of school and uh since it just started back up again so and now now we don't have that much time anymore so but today i just decided to make a recording and i'm going to click go so as you can see you have 10 seconds to pop all the balloons here and then you have um 30 balloons to pop always 30. so then and then they're all different colors so it says if you don't make it up in time you lose so you can get multiple balloons at once that home your missiles okay okay i lost again but uh so you can hold your missiles and like make them in mid air so that's what i thought was pretty cool so then i could like home it and it looks more it's more cool and i have four more seconds left number balloon zero and then you win so yeah so it's just pretty fun concept so yeah um anyways let's get started so first let's make a new project so um so let's get started so first let's rename this project to uh balloon back blaster so hey and then delete the scratch yeah of course we never need to scratch it oh yeah we also want to pick a backdrop real quick uh blue sky delete that so first thing we do is um go to the backpack i actually have everything in store actually get the balloon first let's get the balloon so we have the balloon it's in the stretch thing balloon and then we also get a dart so uh feel free to pause here and try to make a similar concept it's just a rectangle with two lines hold shift down uh there's the feathers which is just a rectangle reshaped you can use rectangle or circle for the feathers but i decided to use circle and then a little tip like an arrow line and then a triangle just delete one half of a square so i'll show you how to make the triangle it's not that hard just make a square hold shift down so it's perfect and then you go to reshape tools select one of the corners backup space or delete or whatever you're on and then delete and then rotate it and then you have it so yeah um so okay i'm gonna do a reshape real quick and do the feathers so um i'll teach you how to do the feather so you start with the circle kind of like an ovalshaped ellipse maybe and then you drag out drag in drag out dragon drag out drag in and drag out and it's like a hand type of shape and you put that on the back some fine reshaping will do it like that and we have that done and this done so now let's get started so you want to draw your dart pointing to the right side because if you like um because if you uh and you want to point it direction zero because if you point it up it will and you want to make it move steps it'll move to the right side not the left side so that just messes everything up and now we have to make i'll make the u n later first let's just focus on the blue so the balloon um let's get started so the first thing we do on the balloon is is the my block so define create balloon and then you want to add an input one input you put an x on the first input second input put a y oh i put a h y and then we have x and y okay so we have our define x y so we can drag out the x and you can drag out the y so it'll go to x x and y y wherever it is so and we have to make create clone of myself because you want to create a nice clone for itself so when i start as a clone uh set color effect set color effect uh what's that to pick random one to three hundred so there's a variety of colors that you can pick from uh oh i just didn't see it so that's like some type of electric green there so that's what we're having here and then you have a wait until it's touching the dart because the balloon will hide once it touches the dart right so wait until touching and then uh start sound pop so every single spray has a pop sound so it should be easy to find and then change number of balloons so we're going to make a variable number of balloons and then we okay this and then we have change change var change variable number of balloons by negative one so the every single time uh the dart hits the balloon it will go down one of the balloon uh little filters here will go down by one so let me drag this down so that's what we're having here and then um hide because the clone will hide and then if then if then the number of balloons equals zero which means if all the balloons are gone broadcast you win i'm actually gonna make that you win sprite real quick uh and the you lose sprite so i'm gonna don't mind me while i make this so text uh let's start with you lose because it's already on the red color so lose and then just yeah you know the deal so then yeah you have this and then you duplicate it and make you win but then you so now i'm going to make the wins bright so we want to take this whole thing go over here change it to a green color and now we have the you win and then you lose finish ready so go back to the balloon and then if number of balloons equals zero oh yeah we need to go back to the balloons real quick number of balloons equals zero then broadcast you win so after you popped all the balloons you would let's work on you win later on in this video when we start coding the dart and everything so yeah let's have you win or on the side for right now and then when the green flag is clicked it will set number of balloons to 30. so i have 30 balloons here so yes and show and then repeat number of balloons so we just take this go to variables number of balloons because there's 30 balloons a number of bullets and then create balloon so this is the hard part so i'm going to move this over a little bit all right so now we have some despair space for this oh so the create balloon um we'll pick random so pick a random position because but it's near the top so negative 200 to 200 which is the x here so negative 200 back here and negat positive 200 over here so the balloons can be over over here to over here but we don't want that to we don't want balloons to like spawn in the dark or like over here or here because you can't get those so we have to have a pick random 50 to 135 that's the um x that l y that we're using here so 50 to 135 so it's like around this area that the balloons can start spawning at so we have the balloons done once we have this hide let's see so we got multicolored balloons tons of them so yeah so now we're gonna start working on oh yeah and the balloons are too big so let's just change the size 50 yay now let's play it now we still multicolored right now the dart hasn't coded yet so we have to code the dart so when the green flag is clicked it will show oh so because you always want to show it and then we're not using clones for this one because we thought it'd be uh more compatible with the other things so go to x0 negative 110 that's around this area and then point in direction zero remember when i told you when you have to put the dart to the right side you want to point it up right because it's more compatible because if you want to if you make the dart go precisely up and you want to make it move steps it'll go right so you want to make it point in direction zero so that you'll go up instead of right so and now you go to forever and then we need if then if the left arrow key is oh oh yeah also if you prefer um using wasd or something like that uh i don't mind you changing this to a or d so when the when the key left arrow is pressed it will change x by 10. where is that because it will keep on going up and up and or negative 10. yeah so you can move it back and forth because negative 10 is this way positive 10 is this way so yeah and we just have to duplicate this do some time fine tuning and key right arrow then it will change x by 10 so there we have it and now we have to have the space key and all of that finished so when the space key is pressed you want to repeat until so um when the space key is pressed it will repeat until it's touching the edge wait wait this is the tricky part you need to end i'll explain it and then touching edge and y position is greater than 150. where's my position you want to know why because um if you want to home your dark and you accidentally scroll to the left or the right it'll delete right because it'll repeat until touching the edge but you have to make it until it's over y position 150 and it will delete and 150 is around here right so if you put the dart and then you move it up it'll delete only if it's greater than 150 so it's around here all throughout here so then because if you did on the right side or the left side it would just if you want to home it you'll just delete right there so that is really bad if you want that if you don't want that to happen copy the code down and now we move 20 steps because remember we uh point the direction to zero because it's pointing the up because we made it right side and if we don't want to make it go right then we have to point make it go this way and then we change the direction to zero and then it'll start going up so move 20 steps per yeah so we'll move 20 steps and then it will hide and wait 0.2 seconds because there's a small weight because we don't want you like overlapping darts and it'll go to x 0 y negative 110 and it will show so we have that done now our last thing we have to code next is that you win you lose sprite so you win when the green flag is clicked it will hide and it will go to x zero zero because you know you didn't win or lose yet so you go to the middle and you'll hide so and then when i receive you win you have to switch costume to costume two because that's the winning costume and then it will show you the winning costume and uh stop all we have some extra code for the backdrop i literally forgot about it it's about if you lose so when the green flag is clicked i uh you want to set time new variable time the set time to 10 seconds so you have 10 seconds and repeat 10 times because you have 10 of that variable and then i'll wait one second and decrease by one every single time so when you run out of time you lose so set time oh never mind no change shot change time always forget change change time by minus one so every second time will go down because yeah every single second your time goes down so when the green flag is clicked it'll go forever and then if then the time equals zero then you lose new broadcast new message here a new broadcast message broadcast you lose so we have that and then um feel free to pause if you haven't caught up yet and then you go back to the you win sprite and then when you receive you lose you switch costume to costume one because that's the you lose bright show and stuff so let's see my project here so uh i forgot to move the top okay get out of here move the time down here and yeah and i'd also like to add some music because i haven't added the music um uh so that's the music yeah i just get the sound uh let's just pick a random loop i'm gonna chill that chill that one sounds pretty good and play sound chill until done and then set no you don't actually have to i no you don't actually have to set the volume but you know since i'm talking and stuff you know said it's 25 or something so yeah uh let's get started and let's see if it works or not i moved the time to the bottom if you didn't notice and look the time is decreasing by the seconds and um uh you can launch your dart and it's obviously popping the balloons and the you lose works like i lost and then number of balloons 30 if you want to win you gotta break all the balloons in time so let's see what i have here no i'm gonna lose off no yeah once okay so you win and then number of balloons equals zero so you win so
