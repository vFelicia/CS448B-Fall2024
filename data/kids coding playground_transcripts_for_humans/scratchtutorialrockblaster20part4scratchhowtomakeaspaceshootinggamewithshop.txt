00:26 - without further ado let's start on the
00:27 - video
00:28 - so uh we're gonna start out on the
00:31 - enemies
00:32 - so we're gonna be broadcasting a message
00:34 - at the bottom because this is
00:36 - if it's touching the rocket ship so
00:38 - let's broadcast a message called game
00:40 - over
00:42 - so the player can actually die when it's
00:43 - touching the enemies
00:46 - so i am going to go to the um
00:50 - uh the um player
00:54 - and then in the player i'm gonna do um
00:56 - what uh when i received game over
00:58 - [Music]
01:00 - game over stop other scripts in this
01:03 - break
01:07 - and then um also we're going to go back
01:09 - to the
01:10 - enemies uh when i receive game over we
01:13 - are also going to stop
01:14 - other scripts in the sprite so then the
01:17 - rocks
01:18 - and enemies will not move so stop other
01:20 - scripts in the spring
01:24 - so now we have the code so now the
01:26 - player
01:27 - can actually die and then we have to do
01:29 - go to the game over
01:31 - we have to go to the game over um sprite
01:33 - we have the game over sprite here so
01:35 - uh when i receive game over
01:39 - game over so we have to go into the um
01:42 - game over sprite and when i receive game
01:45 - over
01:45 - i want to show uh and then stop
01:49 - all stop all and then we want to do a
01:52 - one flank clicked
01:54 - go to the front layer go to the front
01:58 - layer
01:59 - we wanted to go to zero zero because
02:00 - that's the center of the screen
02:02 - and then we won't hide from the
02:03 - beginning
02:06 - okay so now we have all of the uh code
02:09 - done here and you can also play some
02:11 - sounds
02:12 - like the losing sound play lose until
02:14 - done
02:15 - um so then it'll let the player know
02:17 - that he lost
02:18 - he or she lost so now we can work on
02:21 - other buttons so this button right here
02:24 - so this button all it does is you can
02:26 - change it back to the original skin
02:28 - and before we continue to the other um
02:31 - sprites
02:31 - there's one bug we need to fix so as you
02:34 - can see
02:34 - if after you die you can still
02:38 - shoot so to get rid of that let's go to
02:40 - the laser
02:42 - and then we want to do when i receive
02:46 - um when i receive game over then we want
02:48 - to stop other scripts in the sprite
02:50 - so i'm going to try it now and now you
02:52 - cannot shoot
02:57 - as you can see you can't shoot anymore
03:00 - um so next we want to work on the
03:03 - buttons so as i said
03:04 - let's move on to the other buttons so
03:06 - what what this one does is just
03:08 - switch it back to the normal skin so now
03:10 - let's add some code
03:11 - for the um buttons so let's get up when
03:14 - i receive start game
03:17 - when i receive start game let's switch
03:19 - the costume costume one
03:21 - costume one which is the um regular
03:24 - costume and this one's like
03:25 - one selected costume so you want to keep
03:27 - it on the first costume
03:29 - and then you want to hide in the
03:30 - beginning and then get a one flag
03:33 - clicked
03:34 - zoom in a little bit when flag clicked
03:36 - we want to hide
03:39 - and then switch costume to costume one
03:42 - um so reset everything as well in the
03:44 - beginning and then when i receive game
03:47 - over we want to hide the sprite
03:50 - game over we want to hide this sprite
03:55 - and then when i receive open shop
03:58 - we have to um we can just get it from
04:01 - here actually
04:02 - just drag and drop this code into the
04:06 - the yellow one so this is the sprite so
04:09 - you can select back
04:10 - so we will not need to purchase anything
04:14 - so all the code is the same except for
04:16 - the x and y position
04:18 - so i set it at negative 175
04:21 - and y is 80. that's where i set it you
04:24 - can set it anywhere you want
04:26 - if i set it over there and then um
04:29 - instead of uh this one we gotta switch
04:32 - we have to make a new message
04:33 - called switch to
04:36 - red spaceship
04:40 - switch to red spaceship so i'll switch
04:43 - back to the default
04:44 - skin and so yeah that's it for the um
04:49 - this one and then we have to go back to
04:51 - the player
04:52 - um not the player the uh laser sorry
04:55 - about that we have to go
04:56 - back here and add one a little bit of
04:59 - code so when i receive pause game we
05:02 - want to actually
05:03 - stop all stop other scripts in the
05:05 - sprite
05:07 - and delete this clone
05:11 - so when you pause the game you can't
05:12 - shoot anything
05:14 - so it'll delete the clones and stop
05:16 - other scripts in the spring
05:18 - when it's paused game so next
05:21 - let's work on the um other purchase
05:23 - buttons
05:24 - so for the player we need to switch the
05:26 - color for the spaceships
05:28 - so in the beginning um we already
05:30 - switched it to the red costume
05:32 - so when you when i receive
05:36 - when i receive switch the red costume
05:38 - red spaceship
05:40 - then we want to switch costume to the
05:42 - red costume
05:43 - [Music]
05:45 - red costume and so that's
05:49 - uh the thing and then we need to do one
05:51 - more thing when i receive pause game
05:55 - then we want to stop other scripts in
05:56 - the sprite
06:01 - okay so now we have that let's move on
06:04 - to the other skins
06:05 - and um force field so for the
06:09 - cool spaceship right here we need to
06:12 - make
06:12 - some new variables so we will make a
06:16 - one new variable called cool spaceship
06:18 - purchase status
06:24 - rules space ship
06:27 - purchase stat
06:30 - pass like we did to the other spaceship
06:35 - we did the same thing
06:37 - so for the uh for here we can just drag
06:41 - and drop the same code
06:42 - into here and we can also drag and drop
06:47 - this piece of code right here and here
06:50 - we just have to change some stuff
06:51 - up and then we can drag and drop
06:54 - this this
06:59 - and this we just have to uh change the
07:02 - code
07:03 - uh a lot so let's move i'm just gonna
07:06 - separate everything
07:08 - [Music]
07:09 - so let's do that and then for here we
07:12 - need a new x and y position so
07:14 - for me i did uh excess 75
07:17 - in the ys80 um you can do whatever you
07:21 - want of course
07:22 - and then instead of check spaceship
07:24 - purchase right here we have to make a
07:26 - new
07:26 - message called check cool
07:30 - space ship purchase
07:33 - so then it'll switch the costume to the
07:36 - cool spaceship
07:37 - and then for here we're going to have to
07:40 - uh when i receive
07:41 - a check cool spaceship purchase right
07:44 - here
07:45 - and then instead of right here we're
07:46 - going to use the new variable cool
07:47 - spaceship purchase status
07:50 - and then instead right here we're going
07:51 - to broadcast switch to cool
07:53 - spaceship purchase status strictly cool
07:56 - uh
07:56 - spaceship new message switch
08:01 - switch to cool spaceship new
08:05 - message
08:09 - new message and then you stop the script
08:11 - that's all the same
08:13 - and then i made the price instead of 1
08:14 - 000 to 2 500 to buy the skin
08:17 - because it looks a bit cooler so we're
08:19 - going to change the price
08:21 - and instead of negative 1 000 we're
08:23 - going to negative 2
08:24 - 500. and then instead right here we're
08:27 - going to change it to
08:28 - cool spaceship status to unlock switch
08:31 - costume costume 2
08:32 - and instead right here we're going to do
08:34 - switch to cool spaceship
08:37 - switch to spaceship
08:40 - else we want to set the uh cool
08:42 - spaceship purchase status
08:44 - and switch costume to one and right here
08:48 - instead we're gonna have to use
08:49 - uh the checks spaceship
08:53 - purchase check cool spaceship purchase
08:56 - okay
08:57 - um and right here we're gonna have to do
09:00 - the cool spaceship purchase status
09:02 - for the variable and
09:05 - this has to change as well
09:08 - to this cool spaceship purchase status
09:12 - so yeah now we have we just changed
09:14 - everything in here
09:15 - let's go back to the player so for the
09:18 - player we're gonna have to like
