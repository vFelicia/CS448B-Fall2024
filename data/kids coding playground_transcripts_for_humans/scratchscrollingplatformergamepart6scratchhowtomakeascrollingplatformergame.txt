00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:09 - kids coding playground
00:11 - so today we'll be doing um the uh we're
00:14 - going to be doing the collectibles
00:16 - and the portal and we'll add some more
00:19 - levels
00:20 - so as the last time in the last episode
00:24 - so we got the wall jumping
00:29 - you can jump around you can die if you
00:31 - fall off
00:34 - and you can also die when you touch
00:35 - spikes
00:38 - so yeah that's what we had from last
00:40 - time but the problem is
00:42 - we need more levels and there isn't a
00:44 - portal at the end
00:45 - and we also need collectibles so today
00:47 - we'll be adding that stuff
00:50 - so for my collectibles i downloaded some
00:53 - fruits or online
00:55 - uh you guys can actually just draw a
00:57 - coin or something
00:58 - just like draw a simple circle and then
01:01 - also
01:02 - drag this in the portal portal is
01:06 - actually quite simple to
01:08 - do i just draw i just drew two portals
01:12 - so you need a closed portal a closed
01:14 - portal is when
01:15 - there's still um when you haven't
01:17 - collected all the collectibles
01:19 - you can probably do like a black circle
01:21 - and then you need an open portal
01:23 - to let the player know that they have
01:26 - collected all the collectibles and they
01:27 - can go
01:28 - and advance to the next level and you
01:30 - can also
01:31 - use uh so i did the fading
01:34 - as you can see there um i did i clicked
01:37 - this one
01:38 - you can swap the colors and click
01:40 - whatever color you want
01:42 - i just did like a blue and white fade
01:44 - color i did and i also did a border
01:46 - outline for it
01:48 - and then i drew it all inside of one big
01:51 - blue circle
01:52 - and then i grouped it and then for the
01:54 - close portal it's similar just
01:56 - duplicate the open portal and then just
01:59 - uh
02:00 - you can just make it another color or
02:01 - something like that
02:04 - so now let's go on to the collectibles
02:06 - so
02:07 - collectibles has similar code to the
02:10 - danger
02:11 - so you can drag the position in it
02:15 - drag the clone
02:19 - drag the reset and drag the green flag
02:25 - you can drag actually drag everything
02:27 - and we will add code to some of the
02:29 - parts
02:32 - let me separate it now
02:37 - okay so now it's separated so for the
02:40 - cologne
02:41 - clone at x and y um
02:44 - we have to add another part so
02:48 - put this out for a second uh we want to
02:50 - change the collected max by one
02:53 - at the end of here so the collected max
02:56 - is the maximum amount of coins or
02:59 - collectibles you can collect
03:01 - and then if you have if you have a
03:03 - costume
03:04 - i'm gonna throw this away if if you have
03:06 - like costumes like my fruits i have
03:08 - different type of fruits
03:09 - then you wanna get a switch costume
03:13 - switch costume pick random one to eight
03:15 - because i have eight costumes if you
03:18 - don't have any costumes
03:19 - you will not need this code so i have
03:20 - eight costumes and then i will add this
03:23 - create a clone myself at the end
03:26 - so now let's get on to here tick
03:30 - when i receive tick you want to get it
03:32 - if touching player
03:34 - if touching the player
03:39 - then we want to change the collected by
03:41 - one
03:43 - which is the amount of collectibles
03:44 - there are
03:46 - so if the collected is equal to the
03:50 - collected max
03:51 - so let's say the number of collectibles
03:54 - you collected
03:54 - is equal to the maximum amount of
03:56 - collectibles you can collect
03:59 - then we can broadcast the new message
04:02 - called open portal so this the portal
04:05 - will receive this
04:07 - open portal let's open portal
04:15 - and then we want to delete the club at
04:17 - the end
04:18 - right here delete this clone and then
04:22 - so yeah that's the code for the uh
04:26 - collectibles and also this is just
04:29 - we've changed this out so remember we
04:32 - did the
04:33 - mouse thing in our backdrop when you
04:34 - press m
04:37 - it'll go to the position the x and y
04:39 - position
04:40 - coordinates up here of your mouse so
04:43 - wherever you want to put a collectible
04:44 - like say right here
04:48 - or something then you press m and then
04:50 - you just go into your
04:52 - uh collectibles sprite and then you
04:54 - enter the x and y position
04:57 - of where the m is
05:00 - so that's how you um make your x y
05:03 - position
05:04 - but i have different coordinates so i
05:06 - did
05:08 - negative 170
05:11 - uh 100 uh and then 10 right here
05:16 - and then 100 and why 40.
05:19 - so oh yeah and don't forget the code the
05:22 - m code is inside the backdrop
05:25 - and i will demonstrate one time how you
05:27 - do it so
05:29 - i have so i will go like
05:32 - you have to run the game and let's say
05:35 - you want to put a collectible
05:37 - right here you press m
05:40 - so 887 negative 14.
05:43 - so i will go to the collectibles and i
05:45 - will set a clone
05:48 - set a clone at 887 negative fourteen
05:54 - and negative fourteen right here so
05:57 - the collectible will appear somewhere
05:59 - around here
06:01 - so i'm gonna play it and show you guys
06:10 - so it wasn't working earlier probably
06:13 - because i did
06:14 - change right here and you have to set
06:15 - the collectible
06:17 - place so instead of change you want to
06:19 - put set
06:23 - and you want to put the set the um
06:26 - x and y to the corresponding
06:30 - up here x and y
06:35 - so now let's see if it works and one
06:38 - last thing
06:39 - before testing it we have to actually
06:41 - add set the collectibles
06:44 - to collect it to zero and set the
06:46 - collected max
06:48 - back to zero in the setup
06:52 - so i just put some positions right here
06:56 - let's see so i have this
06:59 - the fruits
07:04 - so we have the fruits so you saw that
07:07 - i couldn't collect the last collectible
07:10 - it's because
07:11 - um i did not set in griff patch's video
07:15 - he explained
07:16 - that uh you have to move the original of
07:20 - of the clones so you want to set the x
07:22 - back to negative 99999
07:24 - so then it'll go out of the screen and
07:26 - it won't show
07:28 - so that's why it couldn't be collected
07:30 - the two clones were on top of each other
07:32 - that's why i couldn't collect it so be
07:36 - sure to add the set x to negative nine
07:38 - nine nine nine
07:38 - nine um just do something really big
07:42 - and then um i will add some extra clones
07:46 - for the collectibles
07:47 - so you guys can add it as well
07:51 - so i have one
07:55 - so i'm just gonna add some clones
08:00 - let's duplicate this put this right here
08:06 - remember you have to use the mouse thing
08:08 - you press m
08:10 - that's how you know where you put your
08:12 - clones
08:16 - 7 30 50.
08:20 - these are the positions for me it might
08:22 - not be the same for you
08:33 - okay so now i will show you guys
08:36 - so as you can see when you press m it's
08:39 - not going to be
08:40 - completely accurate but it's about the
08:42 - same position as the first collectible
08:44 - there it is so let me just collect it it
08:47 - can disappear
08:48 - and if i press m on this strawberry it's
08:51 - also about the same
08:53 - x and y position 139 and 140
08:57 - it's about the same thing
09:01 - and oops accidentally died there
09:05 - same with the apple over here let's
09:08 - press m
09:10 - the x and y position almost match up
09:15 - so 3 11 and 60 about the same thing and
09:22 - then i position these like this
09:25 - and then i have them press m so it got 6
09:28 - 11 21 6 6
09:32 - 10 6 11 about about the same thing
09:35 - more or less but remember to use the m
09:38 - and this last collectible is at 1025
09:42 - or about the same thing so you remember
09:45 - to use the m button
09:46 - to um know where you want to put your
09:48 - collectibles
09:50 - so now we will work on the portal
09:54 - so let's go to the portal so i have
09:57 - already have
09:58 - the portal i already have the portal in
10:00 - my backpack
10:01 - but i already told you guys you can draw
10:03 - it if you want to
10:04 - i just draw like a circle so i'm gonna
10:07 - duplicate
10:09 - this code into here
10:13 - and duplicate this as well
10:18 - duplicate this and this
10:23 - so for the portal for the
10:26 - uh this thing we will only need this top
10:30 - part
10:31 - just delete those two and i'll
10:34 - zoom in okay so you want to put this
10:37 - actually you don't even need the clone
10:39 - because
10:40 - we only have one portal on each level so
10:43 - you do not have to clone any
10:45 - so this is all the same thing and now we
10:48 - will
10:49 - get this thing so
10:53 - so you can go like so if you want to put
10:57 - portal somewhere you can go to the end
10:59 - just go to the end
11:01 - you don't have to collect all the
11:02 - collectibles actually just go to the end
11:05 - and press m where you want to put your
11:08 - portal maybe like right here
11:10 - press m and then you set the clone right
11:12 - there
11:13 - but i already have the coordinates for
11:15 - my portal
11:18 - so i uh you just have to set the
11:21 - collected to zero in the beginning take
11:23 - out the collected max
11:25 - set the x and y to zero we can
11:28 - make it hide let's put that up here
11:33 - i just realized we already set the
11:36 - collectibles right here so
11:37 - take that out we don't need to reset it
11:41 - so if the level is equal to one
11:44 - we have to in the beginning we always
11:46 - want to set change the costume
11:49 - to the closed portal so i have two c
11:52 - portals the close portal and the open
11:54 - portal
11:55 - close portal open to portal and then um
11:58 - we can take out the um set x thing we
12:01 - will not need that because we don't
12:02 - we're not dealing with any clones
12:05 - and i only need one of these so i have
12:08 - the coordinate where i put it from last
12:10 - time i put it at
12:13 - 1110
12:15 - and y is negative five
12:18 - so you can just place anywhere by just
12:20 - pressing m
12:23 - and now we want to get
12:26 - um when i receive open portal
12:30 - open portal then we want to switch the
12:31 - costume
12:34 - to open portal so remember we
12:36 - broadcasted the open portal right here
12:39 - if collected is equal to the collected
12:41 - max then we open portal
12:43 - broadcast open portal and then when i
12:46 - receive
12:47 - tick when i receive tick
12:50 - i think we have it in here drag and drop
12:53 - this
12:53 - into the portal
12:57 - oops so tick we will need the
13:02 - we'll need this this part um we will not
13:05 - need the
13:06 - this inside so you can just throw this
13:08 - away
13:09 - if you can use costume number
13:13 - and costume or costume name
13:16 - either one so if you were to do a
13:18 - costume number so if
13:21 - costume number
13:26 - is equal to
13:30 - 2 or you can use costume name so you can
13:34 - either use costume number name
13:36 - so i'm going to use name so if costume
13:38 - name is equal to open portal
13:40 - so remember if you're going to do
13:42 - costume name you have to write it to the
13:43 - same costume name as the
13:45 - portal or else it will not work
13:48 - so if if uh it's costume name if the
13:51 - costume name is equal to open portal
13:53 - and it's touching the player then we
13:57 - want to set the exit to win
14:01 - set the exit to win
14:04 - so remember the exit was from the player
14:08 - exit right here so for here we will need
14:11 - some
14:12 - other code so remember to put this into
14:14 - the tick area
14:16 - drag that in so now i will play it
14:23 - we will add the if else condition right
14:25 - here
14:26 - to signal if is dead or not so we have
14:29 - to put it
14:30 - in a player get an if else statement
14:33 - if the exit is equal to win
14:38 - then we want a player
14:41 - if we want a player die down here so if
14:43 - the x is equal to win
14:45 - then we want to do a player win
14:49 - so for player win we have the code in
14:52 - the player
14:54 - so we have to make a new cost custom
14:57 - block
14:59 - name it player win
15:04 - player win repeat 50 times
15:10 - and this is just to make it like spin
15:12 - into the portal this is what griff patch
15:14 - taught so it will make your game a
15:17 - little better
15:18 - will definitely make your game look
15:19 - cooler so you want to make it point
15:22 - towards
15:24 - the player i mean the portal exit
15:28 - and you have to remember to make it
15:30 - don't rotate or else it'll start
15:31 - flipping upside down when it's turning
15:36 - turn 65 degrees 65 degrees
15:41 - move
15:44 - move the
15:47 - exit divided by two steps this just to
15:50 - make it
15:51 - kind of spin into the portal so you have
15:54 - to
15:55 - go to the distance of the portal so the
15:57 - distance of the portal
15:59 - is like the center how long it is from
16:02 - the distance
16:03 - like the center of the portal so the
16:06 - exit
16:08 - the distance direction
16:11 - so distance
16:19 - sorry guys i got the wrong one it's
16:21 - supposed to be distance this one
16:24 - distance to the um exit
16:27 - divide by two
16:31 - and you want to change the size by one
16:35 - so shrink it'll get smaller as it goes
16:38 - into the portal
16:40 - change the ghost effect
16:43 - change ghost effect ghost
16:46 - effect by two to make it like uh
16:50 - fade away i guess hide
16:54 - right here and then you want to change
16:56 - the level by one we don't have
16:58 - more than one level yet but when we get
17:01 - onto more levels
17:02 - we will actually have to use this
17:05 - and then wait one second
17:09 - and then next up here
17:12 - we have to go back up here to the exit
17:15 - win
17:16 - so if x is equal to when then we want to
17:19 - run the player win
17:20 - else it'll be player die and in the
17:24 - beginning we have all set
17:25 - up let's save our project
17:30 - and actually let's add one more level
17:34 - so let's duplicate this if it's equal to
17:36 - level two
17:37 - we want to switch the costume to level
17:40 - two one i believe level
17:44 - two one right here and then
17:47 - uh i created a clone at 150
17:52 - 200 y200 so you remember you can always
17:56 - use the m
17:57 - mouse to find out where you want it to
17:59 - go
18:00 - we have not done vertical scrolling yet
18:02 - so this
18:03 - is not gonna um scroll up yet
18:07 - so i will just save the game
18:11 - make it bigger let's run it
18:15 - so when i did this earlier there were
18:17 - some bugs with it
18:18 - so when you went in the portal it will
18:20 - um keep on
18:21 - going into the portal to fix that you
18:24 - add this
18:25 - to the code you just put this into the
18:26 - front so if the level is less than two
18:30 - and if the level is equal to one then we
18:32 - want to switch the cost from the closed
18:34 - portal
18:34 - create the clone at that position and
18:36 - set the x back at negative nine nine
18:38 - nine nine nine or whatever
18:40 - to make it go off the screen again
18:42 - because we're dealing with clones
18:44 - and for the platforms we need to add
18:47 - this
18:48 - at the end we have not done the y
18:51 - scrolling so when i jump up i will not
18:53 - scroll
18:53 - on the y position and you have to add
18:57 - remember to add the set x to the
18:58 - negative 99999
19:00 - i think i believe i told you guys to do
19:02 - this but if i haven't then add this
19:05 - so let me close all the variables now
19:08 - and i'll show you
19:15 - [Music]
19:17 - and take that out
19:22 - so number one you can collect the
19:25 - collectibles now
19:27 - [Music]
19:28 - you can collect all these collectibles
19:30 - and when you get all the collectibles
19:32 - the portal opens and you go in
19:35 - and you go on to the next level so yeah
19:37 - that's what we did for today
19:39 - there's no y scrolling yet so you cannot
19:41 - scroll why yet
19:43 - but we will do that in another video
19:46 - so guys thank you guys for watching
19:48 - please like
19:49 - share and subscribe and ring the
19:51 - notification bell to see all the latest
19:53 - updates on this channel
19:55 - see you guys

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground so today we'll be doing um the uh we're going to be doing the collectibles and the portal and we'll add some more levels so as the last time in the last episode so we got the wall jumping you can jump around you can die if you fall off and you can also die when you touch spikes so yeah that's what we had from last time but the problem is we need more levels and there isn't a portal at the end and we also need collectibles so today we'll be adding that stuff so for my collectibles i downloaded some fruits or online uh you guys can actually just draw a coin or something just like draw a simple circle and then also drag this in the portal portal is actually quite simple to do i just draw i just drew two portals so you need a closed portal a closed portal is when there's still um when you haven't collected all the collectibles you can probably do like a black circle and then you need an open portal to let the player know that they have collected all the collectibles and they can go and advance to the next level and you can also use uh so i did the fading as you can see there um i did i clicked this one you can swap the colors and click whatever color you want i just did like a blue and white fade color i did and i also did a border outline for it and then i drew it all inside of one big blue circle and then i grouped it and then for the close portal it's similar just duplicate the open portal and then just uh you can just make it another color or something like that so now let's go on to the collectibles so collectibles has similar code to the danger so you can drag the position in it drag the clone drag the reset and drag the green flag you can drag actually drag everything and we will add code to some of the parts let me separate it now okay so now it's separated so for the cologne clone at x and y um we have to add another part so put this out for a second uh we want to change the collected max by one at the end of here so the collected max is the maximum amount of coins or collectibles you can collect and then if you have if you have a costume i'm gonna throw this away if if you have like costumes like my fruits i have different type of fruits then you wanna get a switch costume switch costume pick random one to eight because i have eight costumes if you don't have any costumes you will not need this code so i have eight costumes and then i will add this create a clone myself at the end so now let's get on to here tick when i receive tick you want to get it if touching player if touching the player then we want to change the collected by one which is the amount of collectibles there are so if the collected is equal to the collected max so let's say the number of collectibles you collected is equal to the maximum amount of collectibles you can collect then we can broadcast the new message called open portal so this the portal will receive this open portal let's open portal and then we want to delete the club at the end right here delete this clone and then so yeah that's the code for the uh collectibles and also this is just we've changed this out so remember we did the mouse thing in our backdrop when you press m it'll go to the position the x and y position coordinates up here of your mouse so wherever you want to put a collectible like say right here or something then you press m and then you just go into your uh collectibles sprite and then you enter the x and y position of where the m is so that's how you um make your x y position but i have different coordinates so i did negative 170 uh 100 uh and then 10 right here and then 100 and why 40. so oh yeah and don't forget the code the m code is inside the backdrop and i will demonstrate one time how you do it so i have so i will go like you have to run the game and let's say you want to put a collectible right here you press m so 887 negative 14. so i will go to the collectibles and i will set a clone set a clone at 887 negative fourteen and negative fourteen right here so the collectible will appear somewhere around here so i'm gonna play it and show you guys so it wasn't working earlier probably because i did change right here and you have to set the collectible place so instead of change you want to put set and you want to put the set the um x and y to the corresponding up here x and y so now let's see if it works and one last thing before testing it we have to actually add set the collectibles to collect it to zero and set the collected max back to zero in the setup so i just put some positions right here let's see so i have this the fruits so we have the fruits so you saw that i couldn't collect the last collectible it's because um i did not set in griff patch's video he explained that uh you have to move the original of of the clones so you want to set the x back to negative 99999 so then it'll go out of the screen and it won't show so that's why it couldn't be collected the two clones were on top of each other that's why i couldn't collect it so be sure to add the set x to negative nine nine nine nine nine um just do something really big and then um i will add some extra clones for the collectibles so you guys can add it as well so i have one so i'm just gonna add some clones let's duplicate this put this right here remember you have to use the mouse thing you press m that's how you know where you put your clones 7 30 50. these are the positions for me it might not be the same for you okay so now i will show you guys so as you can see when you press m it's not going to be completely accurate but it's about the same position as the first collectible there it is so let me just collect it it can disappear and if i press m on this strawberry it's also about the same x and y position 139 and 140 it's about the same thing and oops accidentally died there same with the apple over here let's press m the x and y position almost match up so 3 11 and 60 about the same thing and then i position these like this and then i have them press m so it got 6 11 21 6 6 10 6 11 about about the same thing more or less but remember to use the m and this last collectible is at 1025 or about the same thing so you remember to use the m button to um know where you want to put your collectibles so now we will work on the portal so let's go to the portal so i have already have the portal i already have the portal in my backpack but i already told you guys you can draw it if you want to i just draw like a circle so i'm gonna duplicate this code into here and duplicate this as well duplicate this and this so for the portal for the uh this thing we will only need this top part just delete those two and i'll zoom in okay so you want to put this actually you don't even need the clone because we only have one portal on each level so you do not have to clone any so this is all the same thing and now we will get this thing so so you can go like so if you want to put portal somewhere you can go to the end just go to the end you don't have to collect all the collectibles actually just go to the end and press m where you want to put your portal maybe like right here press m and then you set the clone right there but i already have the coordinates for my portal so i uh you just have to set the collected to zero in the beginning take out the collected max set the x and y to zero we can make it hide let's put that up here i just realized we already set the collectibles right here so take that out we don't need to reset it so if the level is equal to one we have to in the beginning we always want to set change the costume to the closed portal so i have two c portals the close portal and the open portal close portal open to portal and then um we can take out the um set x thing we will not need that because we don't we're not dealing with any clones and i only need one of these so i have the coordinate where i put it from last time i put it at 1110 and y is negative five so you can just place anywhere by just pressing m and now we want to get um when i receive open portal open portal then we want to switch the costume to open portal so remember we broadcasted the open portal right here if collected is equal to the collected max then we open portal broadcast open portal and then when i receive tick when i receive tick i think we have it in here drag and drop this into the portal oops so tick we will need the we'll need this this part um we will not need the this inside so you can just throw this away if you can use costume number and costume or costume name either one so if you were to do a costume number so if costume number is equal to 2 or you can use costume name so you can either use costume number name so i'm going to use name so if costume name is equal to open portal so remember if you're going to do costume name you have to write it to the same costume name as the portal or else it will not work so if if uh it's costume name if the costume name is equal to open portal and it's touching the player then we want to set the exit to win set the exit to win so remember the exit was from the player exit right here so for here we will need some other code so remember to put this into the tick area drag that in so now i will play it we will add the if else condition right here to signal if is dead or not so we have to put it in a player get an if else statement if the exit is equal to win then we want a player if we want a player die down here so if the x is equal to win then we want to do a player win so for player win we have the code in the player so we have to make a new cost custom block name it player win player win repeat 50 times and this is just to make it like spin into the portal this is what griff patch taught so it will make your game a little better will definitely make your game look cooler so you want to make it point towards the player i mean the portal exit and you have to remember to make it don't rotate or else it'll start flipping upside down when it's turning turn 65 degrees 65 degrees move move the exit divided by two steps this just to make it kind of spin into the portal so you have to go to the distance of the portal so the distance of the portal is like the center how long it is from the distance like the center of the portal so the exit the distance direction so distance sorry guys i got the wrong one it's supposed to be distance this one distance to the um exit divide by two and you want to change the size by one so shrink it'll get smaller as it goes into the portal change the ghost effect change ghost effect ghost effect by two to make it like uh fade away i guess hide right here and then you want to change the level by one we don't have more than one level yet but when we get onto more levels we will actually have to use this and then wait one second and then next up here we have to go back up here to the exit win so if x is equal to when then we want to run the player win else it'll be player die and in the beginning we have all set up let's save our project and actually let's add one more level so let's duplicate this if it's equal to level two we want to switch the costume to level two one i believe level two one right here and then uh i created a clone at 150 200 y200 so you remember you can always use the m mouse to find out where you want it to go we have not done vertical scrolling yet so this is not gonna um scroll up yet so i will just save the game make it bigger let's run it so when i did this earlier there were some bugs with it so when you went in the portal it will um keep on going into the portal to fix that you add this to the code you just put this into the front so if the level is less than two and if the level is equal to one then we want to switch the cost from the closed portal create the clone at that position and set the x back at negative nine nine nine nine nine or whatever to make it go off the screen again because we're dealing with clones and for the platforms we need to add this at the end we have not done the y scrolling so when i jump up i will not scroll on the y position and you have to add remember to add the set x to the negative 99999 i think i believe i told you guys to do this but if i haven't then add this so let me close all the variables now and i'll show you and take that out so number one you can collect the collectibles now you can collect all these collectibles and when you get all the collectibles the portal opens and you go in and you go on to the next level so yeah that's what we did for today there's no y scrolling yet so you cannot scroll why yet but we will do that in another video so guys thank you guys for
