00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:09 - kids coding playground
00:10 - this is the second part for the
00:12 - two-player fighting game
00:14 - so if you haven't watched the first part
00:16 - then i recommend you to watch that first
00:18 - before continuing on to this one so as
00:21 - we left off we dragged all the code into
00:23 - the
00:24 - player one
00:27 - so we really don't need the treasure
00:28 - hunter anymore you can just delete it
00:32 - we will make some new variables
00:35 - we can delete some of them
00:38 - like the
00:42 - so actually we actually have all the
00:44 - variables so
00:45 - sorry about the confusion so if you
00:48 - don't have any of these variables
00:50 - and we don't need score actually we can
00:51 - just delete this if you don't have these
00:54 - we don't need level so if you don't have
00:57 - any of these uh variables
00:58 - i'd recommend you to get them so all
01:01 - these variables starting with player
01:05 - like these are all specifically
01:08 - are specifically made for the player as
01:11 - you can see it says player one in the
01:12 - front
01:14 - and i think his double jump is also for
01:17 - it
01:20 - yeah player one is double jump you can
01:22 - actually rename it so it'll be easier to
01:24 - read
01:25 - so is player
01:30 - double jump so
01:33 - you want to get all these variables
01:39 - to make a variable for this sprite only
01:42 - you want to click on the make variable
01:44 - then there's these two for all sprites
01:46 - and for the sprite only
01:48 - you want to tick for the sprite only and
01:51 - type the variable name
01:53 - um so yeah
01:56 - so
02:00 - first we'll need to rename all these
02:03 - variables
02:05 - so for this run costume index
02:10 - we can change it to player run player
02:13 - run costume index
02:16 - player run costume index
02:22 - so we can rename this index
02:27 - player run costume index we want to
02:29 - change it
02:31 - so as you can see all of this changed
02:35 - run player run costume index
02:38 - you want it to be player run costume
02:40 - index because
02:42 - we want a specific variable for this uh
02:44 - character because
02:46 - when there's a second player um then it
02:48 - might get confused
02:50 - so we'll need two variables one for each
02:54 - so we'll need to change it to player
02:58 - run costume index there we have it
03:01 - so we gotta change these each
03:05 - sprite will control its own set of
03:06 - variables
03:08 - so we'll need to change this to player
03:11 - run costume index
03:14 - player run costume index
03:18 - player run costume index so there's a
03:20 - new function and just right click on it
03:22 - it'll give you all the variables you can
03:23 - just click player run costume index just
03:26 - right click on it
03:28 - and it'll show them all player run
03:30 - custom index
03:33 - and change this
03:39 - okay so now we have it all done for the
03:42 - run control
03:43 - and one more thing actually we gotta
03:45 - make a new format
03:47 - so you put a join right here i'll just
03:50 - duplicate this so i'll show you guys so
03:53 - you
03:54 - join the
03:57 - so the costume index is the number
04:01 - the index is the number so it will
04:05 - join the player one character
04:09 - so we don't have that yet so we make it
04:12 - player one
04:18 - oops player one
04:22 - costume index
04:28 - player one character sorry
04:31 - so player one character
04:34 - so now let's press okay so player one
04:38 - character
04:40 - we should um put it right here
04:43 - so player one character we have to set
04:45 - it in the beginning so get it when flat
04:47 - clicked
04:48 - it's a set set it
04:53 - player one character we this is just
04:55 - temporary for testing yeah
04:58 - so let's send it set it to ng
05:01 - so as you can see in the costumes ng is
05:04 - the ninja girl
05:06 - ng stands for ninja girl and the drg
05:08 - stands for the dragon
05:10 - this is just for testing so if you can
05:12 - just put any one in there
05:14 - so that means this means ng
05:18 - so you put this in so you
05:22 - when flight is clicked click on this ng
05:25 - run zero that means it will switch the
05:27 - costume
05:28 - to ninja girl run zero to this one so
05:31 - set it back
05:32 - to the first running costume
05:35 - so all you do is just throw this out
05:39 - and put this in
05:47 - so now we have to do it for each of
05:49 - these joints
05:51 - so you just do duplicate it
05:54 - you can just duplicate it
05:58 - oops wrong word just duplicate it
06:02 - and duplicate it but this one instead of
06:04 - run you have to be careful
06:07 - you have to you have to put slide
06:09 - instead of run because
06:10 - this one's sliding so you put slide
06:15 - slide and then underscore so as you can
06:18 - see
06:20 - slide ng
06:24 - ng slide 0 so when i click on this
06:29 - it's ng slide 4 right now currently the
06:31 - costume
06:32 - index is four
06:36 - and we can throw away this
06:39 - and we can set this to wasd
06:43 - arrow keys keybinds because we'll have
06:45 - two players so first we can set the left
06:47 - arrow would be a
06:50 - right arrow would be d and down arrow
06:53 - will be s
06:57 - s right here okay
07:01 - so that's all the editing we have to do
07:04 - for the run control for now
07:07 - so for the start again right here
07:10 - we'll need to reset some variables so
07:13 - we'll need to set
07:14 - a new variable called is the double jump
07:17 - present like the
07:18 - is is player double jump in the
07:20 - beginning we want to set it to false
07:22 - because it's not jumping in the
07:24 - beginning we can set we can keep the run
07:26 - speed and
07:27 - jump speed as is the fall speed we have
07:30 - to change the player fall speed
07:34 - and player fall speed is right here the
07:37 - run
07:38 - there's player run costume index we'll
07:41 - change the run costume and next a player
07:43 - run costume index
07:45 - the jump costume indexed a player jump
07:47 - costume index
07:49 - chum costume i don't think we have it so
07:52 - we can just rename this one
07:54 - this player jump costume uh we can just
07:58 - rename it
07:59 - and add index to the end
08:03 - player jump index yep and then
08:06 - action in progress to end so it's no
08:09 - um so that's the start so for the
08:13 - jumping
08:13 - today we're gonna also make a double
08:15 - jump control
08:17 - so we're gonna in the beginning we have
08:20 - to set it to player
08:22 - jump costume index and repeat 10 times
08:26 - we have to change this join also take
08:29 - this out
08:31 - put a join get another join
08:36 - so you join the player one character
08:40 - player one character
08:44 - with the join with the um
08:49 - jump jump and then jump costume
08:53 - index yeah so if you if i took this out
08:58 - so you have to change this to player
09:00 - jump costume index forgot about that
09:03 - so player jump costume index so if i
09:06 - were to take this out
09:08 - and click it it would be ng jump zero
09:11 - so that seems right
09:14 - now to change this to player jump
09:16 - costume index
09:20 - uh right there and
09:23 - yeah this is right so now we can
09:26 - work on the double jump
09:30 - so we'll get a if w
09:34 - if the w key is pressed
09:38 - so we already have it right here so we
09:40 - can just change it to w
09:42 - so w we'll take out the jump control for
09:44 - right now
09:45 - we'll add some code and then we'll add
09:47 - the jump control back at the end
09:49 - so jump control is just calling this
09:51 - chunk of code right here
09:53 - so we'll get an if else statement
09:59 - so if it's touching we'll need it and
10:04 - so if it's touching the platforms yeah
10:06 - we can just duplicate this
10:07 - it is touching the platforms and that or
10:11 - we can get another or statement because
10:13 - sometimes when you jump
10:14 - you can get through the first layer so
10:18 - touching this or just duplicate it
10:21 - and you can just go here
10:24 - sometimes when you jump and it should be
10:27 - the first
10:27 - first layer the white layer cream layer
10:31 - so if it's touching either of those then
10:34 - set the
10:35 - player fall speed to jump speed so
10:38 - you'll set the fall speed to the jump
10:39 - speed so you can jump again
10:40 - in the air set the
10:44 - player fall speed
10:48 - player fall speed to the jump speed
10:54 - so this is the first jump when you're on
10:56 - the platform
10:57 - then now we'll make the double jump okay
11:00 - if then statement
11:03 - and get an equal equal operator
11:07 - so if the is double
11:11 - player jump is the player double jumped
11:13 - is equal to false
11:17 - false then we can set the player fall
11:20 - speed
11:22 - set the player fall speed to the jump
11:24 - speed just duplicate this put it under
11:26 - here
11:27 - set the plan set is player double jump
11:33 - is player double jump to true because
11:36 - this is this so this is the second time
11:38 - in the air
11:39 - so this defines it lets you double jump
11:42 - and then we add the jump control back on
11:44 - the bottom
11:47 - so now right now we are not done with it
11:50 - so we still have some code to add like
11:52 - the gravity code
11:55 - simulate gravity we have to change some
11:57 - variables as well
11:59 - so the fall speed we have to change it
12:01 - to player fall speed
12:03 - speed and this fall speed also has to be
12:05 - changed to the player
12:07 - spell fall speed sorry um
12:11 - this has to be changed to the player
12:13 - fall speed
12:15 - and we'll add some code to the bottom
12:16 - get an if then statement
12:19 - so this is to prevent the bug so when
12:22 - the ninja girl jumps up
12:23 - double jumps and is touched and it goes
12:26 - up here
12:27 - it'll prevent it from keep on double
12:28 - jumping because it's touching the cream
12:30 - color
12:31 - so we'll get an if-then statement if
12:33 - it's not
12:34 - not touching touching the
12:38 - brown color we can just duplicate it
12:40 - from here sorry
12:42 - not touching that brown color then set
12:44 - the is player double jump
12:48 - back to the false yes
12:52 - set the player is player double jumped
12:55 - back to false
12:56 - to reset it oops
13:01 - false so now we have the
13:04 - last so right here
13:08 - we have to change this so this
13:12 - will have to add an or statement to this
13:15 - we can add it so
13:17 - this is just to double check it so if
13:19 - the fall speed is
13:21 - less than or equal to zero
13:25 - the fall speed is less than or equal to
13:30 - zero full speed
13:34 - less than or equal to zero then we have
13:36 - to get a join
13:37 - get a join we join the player one
13:40 - character
13:42 - the player one character
13:43 - [Music]
13:46 - with the idle one zero
13:50 - so when you click on this it's ng idle
13:54 - zero so
13:54 - set it back to ng idle zero and when
13:57 - you're moving when you're done
13:58 - moving when flag clicked we have to set
14:01 - this to player
14:02 - full speed and i believe that is it
14:08 - now we will delete some useless
14:10 - variables
14:12 - that we don't need
14:18 - so we forgot to change one last part we
14:20 - were supposed to change this to player
14:22 - fall speed
14:25 - scroll scroll down player
14:29 - full speed
14:32 - so now
14:35 - let's i'm go we're going to check if
14:36 - there's any more
14:39 - that we need to change
14:44 - i don't think there's any more
14:48 - and we have to change those oh yeah we
14:51 - have to still change these
14:54 - player fall speed
14:58 - duplicate it and we'll put it there we
15:00 - can delete this
15:02 - i forgot these now we can delete the
15:04 - fall speed we don't need that
15:10 - and we can delete the idle costume index
15:17 - what else can we delete i think we can
15:19 - delete the
15:20 - drum costume index jump
15:23 - we can keep the jump speed keep we can
15:25 - keep everything
15:27 - with the player in front we can delete
15:28 - the run costume index because we already
15:30 - have the player one
15:34 - so that's all the variables we need we
15:37 - deleted some useless ones
15:40 - now we can just uncheck all these
15:42 - variables so you guys can see
15:43 - make it full so now when you slide it
15:47 - switches back to the normal
15:49 - thing you can double jump i hope this
15:52 - all works to you guys
15:54 - if it's not then you probably did
15:55 - something wrong you can slide
15:57 - you can you can double jump you can walk
16:01 - so earlier i forgot to record the
16:03 - sliding not the not sliding for the
16:05 - dragon
16:06 - so i will quickly finish that up right
16:08 - now so all we want to do is just get an
16:10 - if-then statement
16:13 - put the um knot
16:16 - put a knot so if
16:20 - the dragon so he equal so if
16:23 - not equal to the player one character
16:26 - is equal to the drg which is the dragon
16:32 - so if it's not equal to the dragon
16:35 - then we'll wrap this around here
16:39 - so it only if it's not equal to the
16:40 - dragon it will be able to slide
16:43 - so yeah this is the code
16:46 - so as you can see when you play it the
16:48 - dragon cannot slide now
16:50 - i'm holding down the s key is not
16:53 - sliding
16:54 - you can still double jump everything is
16:56 - still functioning correctly
17:01 - so thank you guys for watching
17:04 - and please like share and subscribe and
17:07 - i'll see you guys in the next video part
17:09 - three of the two player fighting game
17:12 - thank you guys for watching
17:21 - [Music]
17:24 - you

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground this is the second part for the twoplayer fighting game so if you haven't watched the first part then i recommend you to watch that first before continuing on to this one so as we left off we dragged all the code into the player one so we really don't need the treasure hunter anymore you can just delete it we will make some new variables we can delete some of them like the so actually we actually have all the variables so sorry about the confusion so if you don't have any of these variables and we don't need score actually we can just delete this if you don't have these we don't need level so if you don't have any of these uh variables i'd recommend you to get them so all these variables starting with player like these are all specifically are specifically made for the player as you can see it says player one in the front and i think his double jump is also for it yeah player one is double jump you can actually rename it so it'll be easier to read so is player double jump so you want to get all these variables to make a variable for this sprite only you want to click on the make variable then there's these two for all sprites and for the sprite only you want to tick for the sprite only and type the variable name um so yeah so first we'll need to rename all these variables so for this run costume index we can change it to player run player run costume index player run costume index so we can rename this index player run costume index we want to change it so as you can see all of this changed run player run costume index you want it to be player run costume index because we want a specific variable for this uh character because when there's a second player um then it might get confused so we'll need two variables one for each so we'll need to change it to player run costume index there we have it so we gotta change these each sprite will control its own set of variables so we'll need to change this to player run costume index player run costume index player run costume index so there's a new function and just right click on it it'll give you all the variables you can just click player run costume index just right click on it and it'll show them all player run custom index and change this okay so now we have it all done for the run control and one more thing actually we gotta make a new format so you put a join right here i'll just duplicate this so i'll show you guys so you join the so the costume index is the number the index is the number so it will join the player one character so we don't have that yet so we make it player one oops player one costume index player one character sorry so player one character so now let's press okay so player one character we should um put it right here so player one character we have to set it in the beginning so get it when flat clicked it's a set set it player one character we this is just temporary for testing yeah so let's send it set it to ng so as you can see in the costumes ng is the ninja girl ng stands for ninja girl and the drg stands for the dragon this is just for testing so if you can just put any one in there so that means this means ng so you put this in so you when flight is clicked click on this ng run zero that means it will switch the costume to ninja girl run zero to this one so set it back to the first running costume so all you do is just throw this out and put this in so now we have to do it for each of these joints so you just do duplicate it you can just duplicate it oops wrong word just duplicate it and duplicate it but this one instead of run you have to be careful you have to you have to put slide instead of run because this one's sliding so you put slide slide and then underscore so as you can see slide ng ng slide 0 so when i click on this it's ng slide 4 right now currently the costume index is four and we can throw away this and we can set this to wasd arrow keys keybinds because we'll have two players so first we can set the left arrow would be a right arrow would be d and down arrow will be s s right here okay so that's all the editing we have to do for the run control for now so for the start again right here we'll need to reset some variables so we'll need to set a new variable called is the double jump present like the is is player double jump in the beginning we want to set it to false because it's not jumping in the beginning we can set we can keep the run speed and jump speed as is the fall speed we have to change the player fall speed and player fall speed is right here the run there's player run costume index we'll change the run costume and next a player run costume index the jump costume indexed a player jump costume index chum costume i don't think we have it so we can just rename this one this player jump costume uh we can just rename it and add index to the end player jump index yep and then action in progress to end so it's no um so that's the start so for the jumping today we're gonna also make a double jump control so we're gonna in the beginning we have to set it to player jump costume index and repeat 10 times we have to change this join also take this out put a join get another join so you join the player one character player one character with the join with the um jump jump and then jump costume index yeah so if you if i took this out so you have to change this to player jump costume index forgot about that so player jump costume index so if i were to take this out and click it it would be ng jump zero so that seems right now to change this to player jump costume index uh right there and yeah this is right so now we can work on the double jump so we'll get a if w if the w key is pressed so we already have it right here so we can just change it to w so w we'll take out the jump control for right now we'll add some code and then we'll add the jump control back at the end so jump control is just calling this chunk of code right here so we'll get an if else statement so if it's touching we'll need it and so if it's touching the platforms yeah we can just duplicate this it is touching the platforms and that or we can get another or statement because sometimes when you jump you can get through the first layer so touching this or just duplicate it and you can just go here sometimes when you jump and it should be the first first layer the white layer cream layer so if it's touching either of those then set the player fall speed to jump speed so you'll set the fall speed to the jump speed so you can jump again in the air set the player fall speed player fall speed to the jump speed so this is the first jump when you're on the platform then now we'll make the double jump okay if then statement and get an equal equal operator so if the is double player jump is the player double jumped is equal to false false then we can set the player fall speed set the player fall speed to the jump speed just duplicate this put it under here set the plan set is player double jump is player double jump to true because this is this so this is the second time in the air so this defines it lets you double jump and then we add the jump control back on the bottom so now right now we are not done with it so we still have some code to add like the gravity code simulate gravity we have to change some variables as well so the fall speed we have to change it to player fall speed speed and this fall speed also has to be changed to the player spell fall speed sorry um this has to be changed to the player fall speed and we'll add some code to the bottom get an if then statement so this is to prevent the bug so when the ninja girl jumps up double jumps and is touched and it goes up here it'll prevent it from keep on double jumping because it's touching the cream color so we'll get an ifthen statement if it's not not touching touching the brown color we can just duplicate it from here sorry not touching that brown color then set the is player double jump back to the false yes set the player is player double jumped back to false to reset it oops false so now we have the last so right here we have to change this so this will have to add an or statement to this we can add it so this is just to double check it so if the fall speed is less than or equal to zero the fall speed is less than or equal to zero full speed less than or equal to zero then we have to get a join get a join we join the player one character the player one character with the idle one zero so when you click on this it's ng idle zero so set it back to ng idle zero and when you're moving when you're done moving when flag clicked we have to set this to player full speed and i believe that is it now we will delete some useless variables that we don't need so we forgot to change one last part we were supposed to change this to player fall speed scroll scroll down player full speed so now let's i'm go we're going to check if there's any more that we need to change i don't think there's any more and we have to change those oh yeah we have to still change these player fall speed duplicate it and we'll put it there we can delete this i forgot these now we can delete the fall speed we don't need that and we can delete the idle costume index what else can we delete i think we can delete the drum costume index jump we can keep the jump speed keep we can keep everything with the player in front we can delete the run costume index because we already have the player one so that's all the variables we need we deleted some useless ones now we can just uncheck all these variables so you guys can see make it full so now when you slide it switches back to the normal thing you can double jump i hope this all works to you guys if it's not then you probably did something wrong you can slide you can you can double jump you can walk so earlier i forgot to record the sliding not the not sliding for the dragon so i will quickly finish that up right now so all we want to do is just get an ifthen statement put the um knot put a knot so if the dragon so he equal so if not equal to the player one character is equal to the drg which is the dragon so if it's not equal to the dragon then we'll wrap this around here so it only if it's not equal to the dragon it will be able to slide so yeah this is the code so as you can see when you play it the dragon cannot slide now i'm holding down the s key is not sliding you can still double jump everything is still functioning correctly so
