02:01 - now we'll continue the third game first
02:02 - i gotta rename it really important
02:06 - so it's a more marvel thor game so
02:11 - i think some marvel thor boss fight not

02:22 - so this is part two yeah this is part
02:24 - two of our video
02:26 - so i'm gonna give you a quick a quick
02:29 - recap of what we did in part one
02:31 - so this is what we did for thor
02:34 - so if you you guys can copy that off
02:38 - feel free to pause whenever you need it
02:41 - so yeah hammer throw attack
02:44 - and lightning so yeah feel free to pause
02:47 - remember
02:48 - the hammer not much code
02:52 - maybe one more zoom out you can see it
02:53 - all yeah
02:55 - so this is all we have when green flag
02:57 - is clicked tied
02:58 - yeah this is when the when you click two
03:00 - and the hammer goes
03:01 - dragon walking which is the dragon
03:06 - so if he comes to your elven stone you
03:08 - die so
03:10 - yeah this is all we have
03:13 - like touching the hammer um attack
03:16 - dragon stuff like that
03:18 - lightning we don't have all the code yet
03:19 - because we haven't even coded the bugs
03:21 - yet
03:21 - so just of the lightning gif
03:27 - rocks so we have rocks um
03:30 - a go-to and a go to back layer that's it
03:34 - not much like you can see this right you
03:36 - can see this right
03:37 - you can see this clear right duh alright
03:40 - son we don't have anything so
03:43 - we will do some things for the sun and
03:46 - now
03:46 - we're gonna work on the bug
03:50 - so i think she's called the bug
03:54 - ladybug two yes great so
03:58 - the first thing we're to work on on
03:59 - ladybug 2
04:01 - is when the green flag is clicked
04:04 - clear all graphic effects so then
04:08 - because they're going to be coming in
04:10 - different sizes and shapes
04:11 - no not sizes but probably shapes because
04:13 - we're gonna do that send um
04:15 - clear graphic effects make clones so
04:19 - we're gonna make a new my block
04:22 - like always when we always duplicate
04:24 - these type of things to make clones of
04:26 - it
04:26 - so yeah make clone and then what define
04:30 - make clones so first i need to put make
04:32 - clone right here so it defines this to
04:33 - here
04:34 - define me clone repeat five times
04:41 - create clone of myself so i'll create
04:44 - five clones at um
04:45 - one time so great we have that finished
04:48 - hi
04:51 - and then next we have to do when i start
04:54 - as a clone
04:59 - uh where's that yes here when i start as
05:02 - a clone
05:03 - so this is a big hunk of code we have to
05:05 - do i'll go to front layer
05:14 - so go to front layer so where is that
05:17 - all right here so right there and set
05:20 - rotation style
05:21 - to the left right so we have it
05:24 - right here set rotation style left right
05:28 - so it will not flip over but once you
05:31 - kill the bugs they will flip over to
05:32 - give
05:32 - extra zest and animation to it like a
05:36 - cherry on ice cream
05:37 - so yeah that's basically uh so later we
05:40 - have to
05:41 - set the rotation style to all around and
05:44 - then now
05:45 - uh change color effect because they'll
05:47 - come in different
05:48 - shapes and colors not shapes and sizes
05:51 - um
05:53 - change color effect by pick random one
05:56 - to 300 so there would be so much
05:58 - uh variety of colors from ranging from
06:01 - like red to like
06:03 - brown to like gray to the you know the
06:05 - colors yeah basically magenta
06:07 - blue light blue okay yeah let's let's
06:10 - continue
06:11 - and then set x so we have to make
06:14 - x and y
06:17 - for this sprite only okay you hear me
06:21 - for this sprite only if you don't
06:24 - you screwed it up okay i'm just kidding
06:27 - but you have to do it for this fight
06:29 - only so
06:30 - it will work so this is where it's
06:33 - really important
06:34 - so we're going to make x y
06:38 - with a spread only so
06:41 - yeah great there's a big part you should
06:44 - not skip this
06:45 - and then set x so that's why people are
06:48 - sometimes complaining in the comments
06:50 - sometimes they just do it not and from
06:53 - from the sprite only so
06:54 - yeah so set x to pick random 0 to 200.
07:02 - so feel free to pause yeah
07:06 - and then set y
07:10 - to pick random negative 150
07:16 - to positive 150
07:23 - and then go to x go to y so
07:27 - it's um i don't really understand that
07:30 - so go to x
07:31 - x go to y y so it's going to be x x
07:34 - y y y over here and there
07:38 - so x x and y y and then show
07:45 - um point towards door
07:48 - so it will point towards thor just as it
07:51 - says
07:52 - look directly at it it'll go forever
07:59 - um oh wait a pic random of seconds
08:06 - one two three before
08:10 - it will collide to one second
08:15 - glide to one second to
08:18 - the tricky block so the tricky block
08:20 - right here
08:23 - so in there and in there
08:26 - oh no so here and there
08:29 - always change the back you guys probably
08:31 - know the deal by now
08:33 - so exposition of thor and
08:36 - y position of thor so you guys
08:41 - are following along if not
08:44 - feel free to pause i can't believe i'm
08:46 - saying this like the fifth time
08:47 - but yeah because this is a big hunk of
08:49 - code i don't want anybody to get lost
08:51 - so if then if touching thor
08:55 - thor then
08:58 - it will broadcast attack for
09:02 - attack i'm gonna make a new broadcast
09:06 - message
09:07 - oh no no no no attack no uh
09:11 - attack thor do i already have that no i
09:13 - do not so
09:14 - because the bugs attack them the dragon
09:16 - just is lightning immune just
09:18 - walks closer every time if it hits the
09:21 - elven stone
09:22 - you get so that's how it is and then
09:25 - broadcast attack four
09:27 - hide and i'll set x
09:31 - to
09:35 - pick random zero to two hundred so
09:40 - yeah zero to two hundred
09:43 - and we can duplicate this block and just
09:46 - change it to
09:46 - y instead and do instead pick random
09:50 - negative of 150
09:52 - to positive 150.
09:55 - it'll go to x go to y so go to x
09:59 - y down here
10:03 - go to x go to y so hope you guys are
10:07 - following along
10:08 - we're almost done with the big hunk of
10:09 - code hide i mean show
10:12 - not hide show
10:16 - no wait i'll pick random of
10:20 - one to three seconds
10:24 - so great we're done with this gigantic
10:27 - hunka code
10:28 - so i'm gonna zoom out a little bit i i
10:30 - don't believe that you guys can see this
10:32 - that well
10:33 - but if you zoom in your computer you
10:35 - probably can probably see this
10:36 - or chromebook or whatever you're on so
10:38 - yeah um
10:39 - it's really long really really long
10:43 - so yeah and then now we
10:46 - have to go back to thor
10:50 - and do some code with it so
10:54 - and then so thor so thor has a 125 hp
10:59 - that's decently enough amount for me to
11:02 - win i mean like
11:04 - if you can't win that easily then i
11:06 - advise you to put more health
11:08 - but if you can win really and you want a
11:10 - really big challenge you probably feel
11:11 - like 50 or 40 health
11:13 - well i probably that's i think that's
11:15 - possible but it's just really hard
11:17 - and then um so when i receive attack
11:19 - thor
11:20 - it'll change hp by -5 so that's
11:25 - negative five
11:29 - so um i just tested the game and it
11:32 - looks like it's fine so
11:34 - i'm gonna be on the bug so when
11:37 - when i receive kill bogs because thor
11:39 - broadcast
11:40 - kill bugs if i do not have that yet
11:44 - kill bugs
11:48 - i didn't make that in the first part i
11:49 - think i i think so
11:52 - stop other scripts in this sprite
11:54 - because you killed the bug
11:56 - of course and it'll start back later
11:58 - because
11:59 - of the block so
12:03 - uh set rotation styles are all around so
12:06 - that's when it flips over and dies
12:09 - sadly oh i mean not sadly that's that's
12:12 - not that that's
12:13 - good that's good if they die that's good
12:15 - because they're blocked they want to
12:16 - kill you too so
12:17 - that's good point in direction negative
12:22 - 90.
12:25 - um glide 0.5 seconds
12:31 - to x
12:35 - negative by so i'm going to drag x real
12:37 - quick so
12:38 - put y to negative 150
12:42 - x and then wait one second
12:45 - just one second not that long
12:49 - and then broadcast create clone again
12:56 - so when we broadcast create clone again
12:58 - we have some code to do so
13:00 - broadcast new message
13:05 - create oh no
13:09 - clone again so start all over again
13:14 - so create clone again
13:20 - oh my god this is cursed oh my god did i
13:23 - turn on caps blocks
13:24 - i might uh turn off cast blocks oh yeah
13:27 - i did turn on clap clock sorry guys
13:29 - so create clone again
13:32 - so this should be fine yeah create clone
13:34 - again and delete this clone
13:38 - so yeah and then when i receive create
13:42 - clone
13:46 - create clone again it will wait one
13:48 - second
13:49 - and then start all over again by putting
13:52 - the block
13:53 - make clone so then it will give all the
13:56 - way back here
13:57 - and then define this and then it'll
13:59 - start all over again so
14:01 - that's great so yeah let's try it
14:04 - so we got to make the you and you lose
14:06 - sprite but first i'm going to work on
14:07 - the sound because i feel like
14:09 - that will help a lot to enhance the
14:12 - great games
14:14 - um things because if you make the sound
14:17 - and
14:17 - just add a simple amount of music it can
14:20 - just enhance
14:21 - the game by a lot so movie two
14:28 - okay yeah great so yeah put that in um
14:32 - until done and then now we have to
14:36 - do the uh you win you lose sprite
14:40 - so let's just write it out so i'm using
14:43 - handwriting so
14:45 - so it's different so first i'm gonna go
14:48 - to
14:48 - um you win sprite so i'm gonna make it
14:52 - a tinge of dark green
14:55 - type of greenish and yeah
14:58 - that should be great uh and i'm gonna
15:01 - type
15:02 - you win
15:05 - oh it's not handwriting i wanna make
15:07 - handwriting
15:10 - you win
15:13 - win so let's make this
15:17 - like this big no that's not big enough
15:23 - maybe this big yeah that should be great
15:27 - and then you lose it's just the same
15:28 - thing but change it to
15:31 - i centered it and then i'm gonna
15:34 - this thing's off the board so i'm gonna
15:36 - set it to zero zero afterwards
15:38 - you lose so yeah easy costumes
15:41 - and then now we have to work on the code
15:43 - of you when you lose
15:45 - so when the green flag is clicked it
15:47 - will go to
15:48 - zero zero i'm gonna see if it's too big
15:52 - and high
15:58 - oh i made a hide make a show and see if
16:00 - it's
16:01 - i think it might be too big
16:04 - yeah it's too big i'm gonna make it a
16:06 - little bit more smaller sorry guys i'm
16:08 - gonna make it just a little bit more
16:09 - smaller so you guys don't make it as
16:10 - large as mine
16:11 - so guys um we're gonna work on i just
16:15 - finished it so
16:16 - looks great um yeah so when i receive
16:20 - you win you win because you won you win
16:22 - you won
16:23 - yeah i'll go to the front layer so it'll
16:26 - go in front of
16:27 - everything so it won't hide behind the
16:30 - sun
16:30 - or anything um and it'll switch costume
16:33 - to costume one
16:38 - and next it will show
16:41 - and stop and then you can just duplicate
16:45 - it
16:47 - instead use you lose true blues
16:50 - you go to front layers which costume the
16:52 - costume two
16:54 - because it's the second costume which i
16:56 - made you lose and the first costume
16:57 - wishes you win
16:58 - so yeah uh
17:01 - uh yeah um so
17:05 - i'm gonna do that and then show and stop
17:07 - all so let's do this
17:09 - [Music]
17:11 - so as you can see the bugs are attacking
17:13 - me great
17:14 - and um they're back there so i'm gonna
17:16 - electrify them see if they're dead
17:18 - and then you come in in charge of the
17:20 - dragon
17:21 - the dragon isn't that hard because
17:24 - the bugs are the only problem in this
17:26 - game in my opinion
17:28 - you might think the dragon is hard but
17:30 - in my opinion
17:32 - honestly the um the uh
17:35 - dragon i'm not sure if you can hear me
17:37 - right now
17:39 - the live indian the dragon is way easier
17:42 - than the fog
17:43 - [Music]
17:45 - so ah more dps let's go dps
17:48 - and then uh i'm sure if you guys can
17:50 - hear me actually
17:57 - like the you lose is working great and
18:00 - then we can also
18:01 - make the you win i'm gonna try to win
18:03 - okay guys
18:04 - so guys um i'm gonna be hiding these two
18:08 - useless bear i mean not useless but like
18:11 - useful variables
18:12 - away because it just enhances the
18:14 - gameplay
18:15 - because you know i always do that stuff
18:18 - yeah let's move this to the corner
18:23 - it's not saving that well okay there we
18:25 - go oh no what happened
18:28 - a normal readout great and then look
18:33 - and i'm gonna try to win so
18:36 - guys i lost okay i'll be right back i'll
18:38 - try to win this time
18:39 - guys i lost again because it glitched
18:42 - for one second and i just lost like 20
18:44 - hp
18:45 - i'll try to win i totally did not just
18:48 - pause the game
18:49 - and make a you win come out
18:53 - yeah so you can win okay i'm gonna try
18:56 - to win for real okay
18:58 - um i'm gonna lower down the dragon's hp
19:01 - so then i can win really easily
19:02 - so i'm gonna hide this sprite um i'm
19:05 - gonna make the dragon
19:06 - wait a second i just deleted two zeros
19:09 - and let's try
19:10 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here and today we're back for another video of scratch of course but first we need to get a shout out so some people in our channel who's been subscribed to us for a really really long time asked for a shout out so the number one person i'm gonna get a shout out for is scratch world he said can i have a shout out yeah sure we'll make the next video so scratchboro uh is a um uh a scratch youtuber so he makes really cool content and gaming with core i am your 300th sub can i get a shout out um so yeah this is a shout out gaming with core thanks for being our 300th subscriber cool scratcher your channel's growth is impressive thanks it is slowing down a bit now compared to a few months ago so cool scratcher makes really cool skits and scratch projects they always make me laugh and they're always really funny you guys should check out his channel and help him get to some get some subs uh code boy hi kids coding playground can i have a shout out um we said yeah so uh yeah uh he asked for a shout out so he's also a coding youtuber i i think so so yeah these two i think that are coding youtubers because of the name scratch world code boy of course and then ssn kozop said also can you give me a shout out please i'm trying to grow my channel it'll be amazing if you give me a boost here's your boost okay so please check out all these channels uh all these channels like scratch world gaming with core uh he might have a channel like i have content i'm not sure but cool scratcher code boy and ssn cozop so guys please check out their channels and thank you now we'll continue the third game first i gotta rename it really important so it's a more marvel thor game so i think some marvel thor boss fight not mistake so yeah more marvel marvel thor boss fight so you guys uh so this is part two yeah this is part two of our video so i'm gonna give you a quick a quick recap of what we did in part one so this is what we did for thor so if you you guys can copy that off feel free to pause whenever you need it so yeah hammer throw attack and lightning so yeah feel free to pause remember the hammer not much code maybe one more zoom out you can see it all yeah so this is all we have when green flag is clicked tied yeah this is when the when you click two and the hammer goes dragon walking which is the dragon so if he comes to your elven stone you die so yeah this is all we have like touching the hammer um attack dragon stuff like that lightning we don't have all the code yet because we haven't even coded the bugs yet so just of the lightning gif rocks so we have rocks um a goto and a go to back layer that's it not much like you can see this right you can see this right you can see this clear right duh alright son we don't have anything so we will do some things for the sun and now we're gonna work on the bug so i think she's called the bug ladybug two yes great so the first thing we're to work on on ladybug 2 is when the green flag is clicked clear all graphic effects so then because they're going to be coming in different sizes and shapes no not sizes but probably shapes because we're gonna do that send um clear graphic effects make clones so we're gonna make a new my block like always when we always duplicate these type of things to make clones of it so yeah make clone and then what define make clones so first i need to put make clone right here so it defines this to here define me clone repeat five times create clone of myself so i'll create five clones at um one time so great we have that finished hi and then next we have to do when i start as a clone uh where's that yes here when i start as a clone so this is a big hunk of code we have to do i'll go to front layer so go to front layer so where is that all right here so right there and set rotation style to the left right so we have it right here set rotation style left right so it will not flip over but once you kill the bugs they will flip over to give extra zest and animation to it like a cherry on ice cream so yeah that's basically uh so later we have to set the rotation style to all around and then now uh change color effect because they'll come in different shapes and colors not shapes and sizes um change color effect by pick random one to 300 so there would be so much uh variety of colors from ranging from like red to like brown to like gray to the you know the colors yeah basically magenta blue light blue okay yeah let's let's continue and then set x so we have to make x and y for this sprite only okay you hear me for this sprite only if you don't you screwed it up okay i'm just kidding but you have to do it for this fight only so it will work so this is where it's really important so we're going to make x y with a spread only so yeah great there's a big part you should not skip this and then set x so that's why people are sometimes complaining in the comments sometimes they just do it not and from from the sprite only so yeah so set x to pick random 0 to 200. so feel free to pause yeah and then set y to pick random negative 150 to positive 150 and then go to x go to y so it's um i don't really understand that so go to x x go to y y so it's going to be x x y y y over here and there so x x and y y and then show um point towards door so it will point towards thor just as it says look directly at it it'll go forever um oh wait a pic random of seconds one two three before it will collide to one second glide to one second to the tricky block so the tricky block right here so in there and in there oh no so here and there always change the back you guys probably know the deal by now so exposition of thor and y position of thor so you guys are following along if not feel free to pause i can't believe i'm saying this like the fifth time but yeah because this is a big hunk of code i don't want anybody to get lost so if then if touching thor thor then it will broadcast attack for attack i'm gonna make a new broadcast message oh no no no no attack no uh attack thor do i already have that no i do not so because the bugs attack them the dragon just is lightning immune just walks closer every time if it hits the elven stone you get so that's how it is and then broadcast attack four hide and i'll set x to pick random zero to two hundred so yeah zero to two hundred and we can duplicate this block and just change it to y instead and do instead pick random negative of 150 to positive 150. it'll go to x go to y so go to x y down here go to x go to y so hope you guys are following along we're almost done with the big hunk of code hide i mean show not hide show no wait i'll pick random of one to three seconds so great we're done with this gigantic hunka code so i'm gonna zoom out a little bit i i don't believe that you guys can see this that well but if you zoom in your computer you probably can probably see this or chromebook or whatever you're on so yeah um it's really long really really long so yeah and then now we have to go back to thor and do some code with it so and then so thor so thor has a 125 hp that's decently enough amount for me to win i mean like if you can't win that easily then i advise you to put more health but if you can win really and you want a really big challenge you probably feel like 50 or 40 health well i probably that's i think that's possible but it's just really hard and then um so when i receive attack thor it'll change hp by 5 so that's negative five so um i just tested the game and it looks like it's fine so i'm gonna be on the bug so when when i receive kill bogs because thor broadcast kill bugs if i do not have that yet kill bugs i didn't make that in the first part i think i i think so stop other scripts in this sprite because you killed the bug of course and it'll start back later because of the block so uh set rotation styles are all around so that's when it flips over and dies sadly oh i mean not sadly that's that's not that that's good that's good if they die that's good because they're blocked they want to kill you too so that's good point in direction negative 90. um glide 0.5 seconds to x negative by so i'm going to drag x real quick so put y to negative 150 x and then wait one second just one second not that long and then broadcast create clone again so when we broadcast create clone again we have some code to do so broadcast new message create oh no clone again so start all over again so create clone again oh my god this is cursed oh my god did i turn on caps blocks i might uh turn off cast blocks oh yeah i did turn on clap clock sorry guys so create clone again so this should be fine yeah create clone again and delete this clone so yeah and then when i receive create clone create clone again it will wait one second and then start all over again by putting the block make clone so then it will give all the way back here and then define this and then it'll start all over again so that's great so yeah let's try it so we got to make the you and you lose sprite but first i'm going to work on the sound because i feel like that will help a lot to enhance the great games um things because if you make the sound and just add a simple amount of music it can just enhance the game by a lot so movie two okay yeah great so yeah put that in um until done and then now we have to do the uh you win you lose sprite so let's just write it out so i'm using handwriting so so it's different so first i'm gonna go to um you win sprite so i'm gonna make it a tinge of dark green type of greenish and yeah that should be great uh and i'm gonna type you win oh it's not handwriting i wanna make handwriting you win win so let's make this like this big no that's not big enough maybe this big yeah that should be great and then you lose it's just the same thing but change it to i centered it and then i'm gonna this thing's off the board so i'm gonna set it to zero zero afterwards you lose so yeah easy costumes and then now we have to work on the code of you when you lose so when the green flag is clicked it will go to zero zero i'm gonna see if it's too big and high oh i made a hide make a show and see if it's i think it might be too big yeah it's too big i'm gonna make it a little bit more smaller sorry guys i'm gonna make it just a little bit more smaller so you guys don't make it as large as mine so guys um we're gonna work on i just finished it so looks great um yeah so when i receive you win you win because you won you win you won yeah i'll go to the front layer so it'll go in front of everything so it won't hide behind the sun or anything um and it'll switch costume to costume one and next it will show and stop and then you can just duplicate it instead use you lose true blues you go to front layers which costume the costume two because it's the second costume which i made you lose and the first costume wishes you win so yeah uh uh yeah um so i'm gonna do that and then show and stop all so let's do this so as you can see the bugs are attacking me great and um they're back there so i'm gonna electrify them see if they're dead and then you come in in charge of the dragon the dragon isn't that hard because the bugs are the only problem in this game in my opinion you might think the dragon is hard but in my opinion honestly the um the uh dragon i'm not sure if you can hear me right now the live indian the dragon is way easier than the fog so ah more dps let's go dps and then uh i'm sure if you guys can hear me actually like the you lose is working great and then we can also make the you win i'm gonna try to win okay guys so guys um i'm gonna be hiding these two useless bear i mean not useless but like useful variables away because it just enhances the gameplay because you know i always do that stuff yeah let's move this to the corner it's not saving that well okay there we go oh no what happened a normal readout great and then look and i'm gonna try to win so guys i lost okay i'll be right back i'll try to win this time guys i lost again because it glitched for one second and i just lost like 20 hp i'll try to win i totally did not just pause the game and make a you win come out yeah so you can win okay i'm gonna try to win for real okay um i'm gonna lower down the dragon's hp so then i can win really easily so i'm gonna hide this sprite um i'm gonna make the dragon wait a second i just deleted two zeros and let's try okay look one hammer you win easy okay change this back to five thousand so it does work okay guys so
