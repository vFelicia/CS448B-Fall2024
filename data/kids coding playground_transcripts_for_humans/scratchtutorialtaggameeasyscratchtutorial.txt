00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids coding
00:09 - playground here
00:10 - and today we're working on a new video i
00:12 - know i haven't posted in like a week
00:14 - but today are going to be working on
00:16 - this game in scratch the objective of
00:17 - this game is to tag each other
00:19 - the cat with the red eyes is it
00:21 - originally this name
00:22 - this game was is made by my cousin jalen
00:25 - but there are some bugs so he fixed and
00:28 - featured his project in our channel i
00:30 - hope you guys like this game
00:35 - so tag game we will be learning these
00:37 - following contests
00:39 - scratch variables loops broadcast
00:42 - messages and sensing
00:45 - so we have a shout out so this is to my
00:47 - cousin
00:48 - jalen so he made he originally made the
00:50 - tag game
00:51 - and we have this um also a youtuber
00:55 - that makes really cool games that's one
00:57 - of our subscribers
00:59 - called 5782 a n and he makes really cool
01:02 - um games too so you can check out his
01:04 - channel if you want to
01:05 - i personally like these two videos in
01:07 - the front and they're really cool
01:09 - so i'm just gonna go right here and
01:12 - this is my the original game by my
01:15 - cousin
01:16 - jalen seven and we are gonna be
01:19 - on demoing this game so my brother is
01:22 - busy right now so i have my dad
01:24 - hi so okay so
01:28 - so originally in the original game both
01:31 - cats are orange so that's going to be a
01:34 - hard one
01:34 - in my game i made i made them blue so
01:36 - then you can
01:37 - see which ones which so i i'm the one on
01:40 - the right
01:41 - and the one on the right and uh my dad
01:44 - is the one with the
01:46 - red eyes so you just have to stay there
01:48 - for long enough and get them
01:49 - but if you stay on each other for too
01:51 - long there's like this
01:52 - bug and just keeps them flashing through
01:54 - each other which i
01:56 - personally do not like you can sometimes
01:58 - get stuck
01:59 - here we fix
02:02 - all these bugs um so it comes oxy
02:05 - see the only way to get out is go
02:08 - so that's going to be the demo for this
02:11 - game
02:12 - my um cousin's game and then we can move
02:15 - on to this game
02:16 - and then so i'm the blue cat
02:20 - and i'm already it and you can pass it
02:23 - down you can see it's more smoother
02:25 - like you need to stay for like one
02:27 - second see it's more smoother but
02:29 - in this game it kept like going off and
02:30 - on so you can um
02:32 - if you stay on you can't just do it like
02:34 - that and
02:36 - i got blue and the blue one my dad's the
02:40 - yellow one this teleporter portal right
02:42 - here
02:43 - can teleport you up so it's like an easy
02:46 - access to
02:47 - up so then you can tag your enemy
02:51 - so that's going to be it for the demo
02:55 - so i'm going to move on i'm going to
02:57 - make a
02:58 - a new one projects
03:01 - so we can normally keep the sprite but
03:04 - i'm going to delete it because i have
03:05 - some things in my backpack
03:07 - i have this regular sprite cat
03:11 - which already has all the costumes so
03:13 - you see all these cat a infect
03:15 - you can just change it to cat infected
03:17 - and like make it to red and then
03:19 - run so now i got the first cat in my
03:22 - backpack
03:23 - and i can also put in the backdrop this
03:26 - is originally the backdrop
03:28 - i also have the portal here which always
03:31 - means we'll code the we'll do the um
03:33 - other cat later let's close the backpack
03:37 - and then i guess that's regular size tip
03:40 - that's regular size
03:41 - so let's move it back up we're gonna
03:43 - start coating and we're gonna make uh
03:45 - variables for this sprite only so i have
03:47 - to make my first variable
03:50 - can path you have to click this
03:54 - for this sprite only thing right here so
03:56 - that's really important
03:57 - not this do not click on the cloud
03:59 - variable and then you can just make it
04:01 - and then you got another one you just
04:03 - rename this
04:06 - cancel yeah because it's already you can
04:09 - just change this
04:10 - for this sprite only and change it to
04:12 - got
04:14 - tagged
04:17 - so we made those two um sprites i mean
04:20 - variables
04:24 - let's just make that lowercase
04:28 - and then um
04:32 - let's move on so we can also go on the
04:34 - backdrop
04:35 - and make the sound so
04:39 - i think i
04:43 - used i'm not sure i think it's elec
04:47 - piano loop
04:53 - i like piano loop
05:00 - [Music]
05:08 - until done so we can work on the cat
05:13 - and if green flag is clipped
05:19 - i'm gonna go for the costumes this is
05:21 - just basically duplicated of these two
05:23 - but then it has red eyes you just have
05:25 - to change it to red eyes
05:26 - so we can just start in the code so when
05:29 - the green flag is clicked let's make it
05:31 - a little bit bigger i think this is
05:33 - good enough maybe and then
05:36 - set got tagged
05:40 - to end because this cat is like in the
05:43 - beginning he isn't tagged
05:45 - so and set can tag
05:53 - you need to go to the motion point in
05:56 - direction 90.
06:02 - so we just put on that it's already on
06:05 - right so
06:07 - you can just go go to
06:10 - so and then so go to
06:15 - you can make it go to anywhere you want
06:16 - but i'm gonna make it go to here
06:20 - and then i'll broadcast a new message
06:23 - called
06:25 - start game so start
06:30 - [Music]
06:32 - game
06:34 - so when green flag is clicked it'll go
06:37 - forever
06:39 - if then it's touching
06:43 - the portal so that means i'll just
06:45 - teleport it back up
06:47 - it'll go to let's say around
06:50 - here so i think maybe a little bit
06:54 - lower
06:58 - like around here right here so go to
07:02 - this and then
07:06 - we have we still have to encode the cat
07:09 - so when the green flag is clicked
07:18 - i'm just going to move that right there
07:20 - and then just work on the thing
07:22 - up there so when the green flag is
07:24 - clicked
07:25 - it'll go forever and have it if then
07:29 - loop
07:31 - if then l because
07:35 - else it's going to be infected or it's
07:37 - not going to be infected
07:38 - so you need the equal sign
07:43 - if it equals to y that means if if if
07:46 - got tagged equals y that means if he is
07:48 - infected
07:50 - that means it'll switch costume
07:56 - to cat a infected
08:00 - then i'll wait 0.05 seconds
08:07 - seconds and
08:11 - switch costume the cat be infected
08:15 - so else it'll switch cat costume to cat
08:18 - a
08:19 - you just duplicate that energy change
08:22 - the infection thing
08:26 - cat a infected and dead cat
08:29 - be infected
08:32 - i meant not infected just regular cat
08:34 - and cat b
08:36 - so i'm just to hide these variables for
08:40 - now
08:41 - and i'm going to run the game as you can
08:44 - see the
08:45 - the cat is we didn't call the
08:48 - um the moving yet so we can show that
08:52 - later
08:56 - so i'm gonna go change this to cut tag
08:59 - to y
09:00 - so you can see the red eyes and then
09:04 - start it so it's red eyes as you can see
09:08 - we can change this back to n
09:11 - and change back to n
09:15 - and let's move on so there's some more
09:18 - code for the cat
09:21 - um and when i receive
09:26 - start game
09:30 - forever
09:35 - if then just a regular
09:39 - thing
09:43 - the key
09:49 - w because this one's wasd
09:53 - w
09:56 - is clicked so change y
10:01 - by head
10:04 - and then also need another if then loop
10:08 - inside of it if then it's touching
10:13 - touching color so we got to see it check
10:16 - if that's the right color first
10:18 - let's select this color so that's a
10:20 - little bit different
10:21 - so touching color then it'll
10:24 - change
10:27 - y by negative 10.
10:32 - and then you just keep on doing it for
10:36 - all of them
10:37 - you just duplicate this and then change
10:40 - it to
10:42 - i think it's s yet
10:46 - s yeah that's the bottom change y
10:49 - by first you gotta do this you make that
10:54 - s i'm gonna make that
10:57 - i'm gonna change this to negative 10
11:01 - and then change this to positive 10.
11:05 - and just keep on duplicating these
11:08 - but instead of gonna change this to
11:09 - change x
11:11 - and point in direction 90 so let's
11:13 - change this to d first
11:16 - [Music]
11:18 - d first
11:24 - so change x
11:29 - by 10 instead but you also need a point
11:31 - in direction 90
11:33 - before that so then it'll point in that
11:34 - direction and then
11:36 - if then is touching that color then
11:38 - it'll change x
11:43 - by negative 10.
11:49 - i'm going to put that right there
11:55 - and then we can just duplicate this
11:56 - again and make this the
11:58 - a key it's the a key
12:01 - a key a point in direction
12:04 - negative 90 remember to make this
12:08 - up here to click this button right here
12:10 - so it won't turn around
12:12 - so it won't go upside down and then
12:15 - they'll change x by negative 10 instead
12:19 - and then change x by 10 if it's touching
12:23 - that
12:27 - let's move on to another chunk of code
12:32 - so when i receive start game
12:40 - then it'll go forever
12:41 - [Music]
12:44 - if then
12:48 - you need to and the outside
12:52 - okay equals
12:57 - the can tag if it can tag is equals y
13:03 - and touching cat 2
13:10 - so we don't even have the cat 2 yet
13:13 - so we can just place that in right now
13:18 - it doesn't have any code yet so um
13:21 - touching cat 2
13:27 - cat 2 and then it will broadcast
13:31 - and wait and wait
13:36 - then you have to make a new um message
13:39 - so you can just
13:40 - message tag
13:44 - and wait
13:48 - you're still on the cat so when i
13:51 - receive
13:52 - tag if then
13:56 - else
14:01 - so when i receive tag if then
14:07 - else it equals can tag
14:11 - if can tag equals to y
14:16 - it will set
14:19 - got tagged to end
14:26 - oh wait one second
14:30 - oh set
14:35 - can tag
14:41 - this is exactly the same code almost
14:43 - exactly
14:44 - i'm just saying almost exactly y
14:48 - i'm going to say that's y so
14:52 - this is y and
14:57 - we have to work on the cat too now so
14:59 - it's basically almost the same code so
15:01 - this is the code
15:02 - and all so it's basically the same
15:05 - code so we can just drag this inside
15:10 - here
15:12 - and drag this let's just drag everything
15:14 - in first
15:16 - i'm touching that
15:21 - right there
15:26 - that's too big of a block right there
15:30 - okay you have to change it a little bit
15:33 - but i'm just going to drag everything in
15:35 - there first
15:38 - it's already did these three um this one
15:44 - this one
15:47 - and this one so did i get those three
15:54 - so this one this one this one
16:00 - this one this one
16:03 - so
16:06 - i'm gonna go count so i think
16:10 - there's there's
16:14 - there's six right here
16:20 - six right here and on the cat the other
16:22 - one
16:23 - there's let's minimize it
16:26 - one two three four five six yes six so
16:29 - they got he got all the code
16:32 - so we can just change it a little bit to
16:35 - y
16:39 - one and then instead of touching
16:43 - cat two you have to do touching
16:47 - cat and you also do tend to do a
16:48 - different starting place
16:51 - and this to negative 90. so we also have
16:54 - to check
16:55 - this is right here if it's already on
16:57 - it's already on
16:58 - so we can also go to
17:03 - see where we can make it go to let's say
17:04 - five
17:08 - and negative ninety seven
17:13 - so still some changing you have to do
17:18 - instead of w you have to do
17:21 - up arrow um
17:25 - s is down arrow
17:29 - d is right arrow
17:34 - and a
17:37 - is locked arrow so we also have to
17:42 - also the portal and also code the portal
17:45 - so if then flag clicked
17:49 - um it will go to
17:53 - x 106 negative 16866
17:57 - and it'll go forever
18:02 - next costume
18:08 - so i have my brother to play with me
18:10 - hello so this is the tag game make it
18:12 - bigger
18:14 - so i'm wasd arrow keys okay but he's it
18:18 - so as you can see you can see so
18:21 - so it's tagging really smoothly so
18:24 - i'm gonna go tag you
18:27 - [Music]
18:31 - and you can also go through the portal
18:33 - as you can see right here and
18:35 - all touching the ground so
18:38 - that's basically a demo please like
18:41 - share
18:42 - subscribe and comments in the comment
18:45 - section below
18:46 - where do you want to what next
18:49 - what projects you want next so anyways
18:52 - bye everyone
18:58 - [Music]
19:04 - you

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here and today we're working on a new video i know i haven't posted in like a week but today are going to be working on this game in scratch the objective of this game is to tag each other the cat with the red eyes is it originally this name this game was is made by my cousin jalen but there are some bugs so he fixed and featured his project in our channel i hope you guys like this game so tag game we will be learning these following contests scratch variables loops broadcast messages and sensing so we have a shout out so this is to my cousin jalen so he made he originally made the tag game and we have this um also a youtuber that makes really cool games that's one of our subscribers called 5782 a n and he makes really cool um games too so you can check out his channel if you want to i personally like these two videos in the front and they're really cool so i'm just gonna go right here and this is my the original game by my cousin jalen seven and we are gonna be on demoing this game so my brother is busy right now so i have my dad hi so okay so so originally in the original game both cats are orange so that's going to be a hard one in my game i made i made them blue so then you can see which ones which so i i'm the one on the right and the one on the right and uh my dad is the one with the red eyes so you just have to stay there for long enough and get them but if you stay on each other for too long there's like this bug and just keeps them flashing through each other which i personally do not like you can sometimes get stuck here we fix all these bugs um so it comes oxy see the only way to get out is go so that's going to be the demo for this game my um cousin's game and then we can move on to this game and then so i'm the blue cat and i'm already it and you can pass it down you can see it's more smoother like you need to stay for like one second see it's more smoother but in this game it kept like going off and on so you can um if you stay on you can't just do it like that and i got blue and the blue one my dad's the yellow one this teleporter portal right here can teleport you up so it's like an easy access to up so then you can tag your enemy so that's going to be it for the demo so i'm going to move on i'm going to make a a new one projects so we can normally keep the sprite but i'm going to delete it because i have some things in my backpack i have this regular sprite cat which already has all the costumes so you see all these cat a infect you can just change it to cat infected and like make it to red and then run so now i got the first cat in my backpack and i can also put in the backdrop this is originally the backdrop i also have the portal here which always means we'll code the we'll do the um other cat later let's close the backpack and then i guess that's regular size tip that's regular size so let's move it back up we're gonna start coating and we're gonna make uh variables for this sprite only so i have to make my first variable can path you have to click this for this sprite only thing right here so that's really important not this do not click on the cloud variable and then you can just make it and then you got another one you just rename this cancel yeah because it's already you can just change this for this sprite only and change it to got tagged so we made those two um sprites i mean variables let's just make that lowercase and then um let's move on so we can also go on the backdrop and make the sound so i think i used i'm not sure i think it's elec piano loop i like piano loop until done so we can work on the cat and if green flag is clipped i'm gonna go for the costumes this is just basically duplicated of these two but then it has red eyes you just have to change it to red eyes so we can just start in the code so when the green flag is clicked let's make it a little bit bigger i think this is good enough maybe and then set got tagged to end because this cat is like in the beginning he isn't tagged so and set can tag you need to go to the motion point in direction 90. so we just put on that it's already on right so you can just go go to so and then so go to you can make it go to anywhere you want but i'm gonna make it go to here and then i'll broadcast a new message called start game so start game so when green flag is clicked it'll go forever if then it's touching the portal so that means i'll just teleport it back up it'll go to let's say around here so i think maybe a little bit lower like around here right here so go to this and then we have we still have to encode the cat so when the green flag is clicked i'm just going to move that right there and then just work on the thing up there so when the green flag is clicked it'll go forever and have it if then loop if then l because else it's going to be infected or it's not going to be infected so you need the equal sign if it equals to y that means if if if got tagged equals y that means if he is infected that means it'll switch costume to cat a infected then i'll wait 0.05 seconds seconds and switch costume the cat be infected so else it'll switch cat costume to cat a you just duplicate that energy change the infection thing cat a infected and dead cat be infected i meant not infected just regular cat and cat b so i'm just to hide these variables for now and i'm going to run the game as you can see the the cat is we didn't call the um the moving yet so we can show that later so i'm gonna go change this to cut tag to y so you can see the red eyes and then start it so it's red eyes as you can see we can change this back to n and change back to n and let's move on so there's some more code for the cat um and when i receive start game forever if then just a regular thing the key w because this one's wasd w is clicked so change y by head and then also need another if then loop inside of it if then it's touching touching color so we got to see it check if that's the right color first let's select this color so that's a little bit different so touching color then it'll change y by negative 10. and then you just keep on doing it for all of them you just duplicate this and then change it to i think it's s yet s yeah that's the bottom change y by first you gotta do this you make that s i'm gonna make that i'm gonna change this to negative 10 and then change this to positive 10. and just keep on duplicating these but instead of gonna change this to change x and point in direction 90 so let's change this to d first d first so change x by 10 instead but you also need a point in direction 90 before that so then it'll point in that direction and then if then is touching that color then it'll change x by negative 10. i'm going to put that right there and then we can just duplicate this again and make this the a key it's the a key a key a point in direction negative 90 remember to make this up here to click this button right here so it won't turn around so it won't go upside down and then they'll change x by negative 10 instead and then change x by 10 if it's touching that let's move on to another chunk of code so when i receive start game then it'll go forever if then you need to and the outside okay equals the can tag if it can tag is equals y and touching cat 2 so we don't even have the cat 2 yet so we can just place that in right now it doesn't have any code yet so um touching cat 2 cat 2 and then it will broadcast and wait and wait then you have to make a new um message so you can just message tag and wait you're still on the cat so when i receive tag if then else so when i receive tag if then else it equals can tag if can tag equals to y it will set got tagged to end oh wait one second oh set can tag this is exactly the same code almost exactly i'm just saying almost exactly y i'm going to say that's y so this is y and we have to work on the cat too now so it's basically almost the same code so this is the code and all so it's basically the same code so we can just drag this inside here and drag this let's just drag everything in first i'm touching that right there that's too big of a block right there okay you have to change it a little bit but i'm just going to drag everything in there first it's already did these three um this one this one and this one so did i get those three so this one this one this one this one this one so i'm gonna go count so i think there's there's there's six right here six right here and on the cat the other one there's let's minimize it one two three four five six yes six so they got he got all the code so we can just change it a little bit to y one and then instead of touching cat two you have to do touching cat and you also do tend to do a different starting place and this to negative 90. so we also have to check this is right here if it's already on it's already on so we can also go to see where we can make it go to let's say five and negative ninety seven so still some changing you have to do instead of w you have to do up arrow um s is down arrow d is right arrow and a is locked arrow so we also have to also the portal and also code the portal so if then flag clicked um it will go to x 106 negative 16866 and it'll go forever next costume so i have my brother to play with me hello so this is the tag game make it bigger so i'm wasd arrow keys okay but he's it so as you can see you can see so so it's tagging really smoothly so i'm gonna go tag you and you can also go through the portal as you can see right here and all touching the ground so that's basically a demo please like share subscribe and comments in the comment section below where do you want to what next what projects you want next so anyways bye everyone you
