00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids coding
00:08 - playground here
00:09 - today we'll be making another tutorial
00:12 - today we'll be doing a tank game in
00:13 - scratch
00:14 - so basically i'm going to i'll show you
00:16 - how it works
00:18 - so um
00:20 - [Music]
00:21 - all right um so basically use the tank
00:24 - and then you use the mount use the
00:26 - wasd or arrow keys to move the
00:32 - [Music]
00:40 - [Music]
00:48 - once you lose all your lives by this
00:50 - time i'll try to beat it
00:52 - so once you kill the boss
01:02 - [Music]
01:08 - also the boss does one more damage than
01:11 - the regular
01:13 - [Music]
01:18 - [Music]
01:24 - enemies
01:29 - [Music]
01:38 - oh god i died again okay i'm gonna have
01:40 - to change the boss lives
01:42 - so you show you how it's like so let's
01:45 - uh
01:46 - change the boss five for now all right
01:56 - so once you kill the boss they'll say
01:58 - you win so
01:59 - killing the boss will basically make you
02:01 - win okay so i'm gonna set it back to 20
02:03 - lives
02:03 - and this back to a thousand so basically
02:06 - a boss will only
02:07 - appear when you get a thousand score all
02:09 - right
02:10 - so let's start a new project
02:14 - alright so let's rename our game and
02:16 - name it tank
02:17 - game um and then we're gonna delete the
02:20 - scratch cat because it will not need it
02:22 - and then we got the tank sprite and uh
02:26 - cannon so the cannon is a whole separate
02:28 - sprite
02:29 - so basically in the tank what i did was
02:31 - draw a blue square
02:33 - at rectangle light blue rectangle and
02:35 - then a dark blue rectangle in the middle
02:38 - and that i drew like the black line to
02:41 - like
02:41 - show that's like the little um the
02:43 - wheels
02:44 - or like the belt or something i don't
02:46 - know what it's called but and then i
02:47 - just
02:48 - drew a liner here to show that this is
02:49 - the front of the tank
02:51 - the cannon is just a simple line so yeah
02:53 - that's pretty much it
02:54 - also the cannon you doesn't have to be
02:56 - centered you want to make it so it
02:58 - kind of matches the tank all right
03:01 - and then the boss osprey it's just
03:04 - a big circle and i drew like
03:08 - like some like a crack in his head or
03:10 - something i don't know
03:12 - uh just some like some red and
03:15 - it's like a one of her regular enemies
03:18 - like the zombies
03:21 - the regular zombie which is just a
03:23 - smaller version of it except and it's
03:24 - green
03:25 - the boss is just bigger so
03:29 - boss and enemies and then we have the
03:32 - decoration
03:34 - so if you want these we will put them in
03:36 - the description of the video
03:39 - right all right and then our backdrop
03:44 - let me get that real quick all right so
03:46 - now i have the backdrop let's
03:48 - um get the backdrop
03:51 - okay let me open it back back up again
03:53 - all right there it is let's get the
03:55 - backdrop and drag this in here
03:56 - boom we got the backdrop it's pretty
03:59 - simple it's just like
04:00 - this nothing really it's just like
04:04 - something online yeah so let's go to the
04:08 - tank
04:08 - let's start coding here so inside the
04:11 - tank we're going to get a one green flag
04:13 - clicked
04:14 - and then in the beginning we want to
04:16 - make
04:17 - two new variables so we're gonna do
04:20 - lives
04:21 - for all sprites and then we're going to
04:23 - make another variable called score
04:25 - for all sprites as well so in the
04:28 - beginning i'm going to set the lives
04:30 - to 3 and i'm going to set the score
04:33 - score 0 in the beginning and then i'm
04:36 - going to make the tank go
04:37 - to 0 negative 100 so this is basically
04:42 - uh somewhere down here
04:45 - near the bottom all right and then we're
04:48 - gonna make
04:48 - and take point direction of zero
04:52 - if you know zeros it's up so we make a
04:54 - point off in the beginning
04:56 - all right and then we're going to do the
04:57 - movement right now
04:59 - so control forever if
05:04 - the up arrow or wasd is pressed the w is
05:07 - pressed so if the up
05:10 - if key up or
05:14 - i'm gonna do w because that's what it
05:16 - usually is so w
05:18 - sorry that is w then if that's pressed
05:20 - then we're gonna move
05:21 - five steps forward
05:26 - let's duplicate this so
05:29 - when down error is pressed
05:32 - or the key s
05:35 - is pressed we're going to move negative
05:38 - five steps
05:40 - so you can move backwards and then we're
05:42 - going to duplicate this
05:46 - if the left arrow key or
05:50 - key a is pressed then we're going to
05:52 - rotate
05:54 - five degrees left so we're going to use
05:57 - the
05:57 - a d or the left and right arrow keys to
05:59 - rotate the tank
06:01 - and then right here we're going to do
06:02 - this again and then when the right arrow
06:04 - is pressed
06:06 - or key d
06:11 - then we're going to turn five degrees to
06:13 - the right
06:17 - and then we're going to
06:20 - play it so as you can see the movement
06:24 - and we're going to make the cannon go to
06:26 - the tank so then it'll actually stay on
06:28 - there so as you can see you can move
06:29 - around
06:32 - yeah so that's what we have so far let's
06:34 - go to the um cannon sprite
06:37 - so this is the cannon let's get i want
06:39 - to drink my clicked we want this to go
06:41 - to the front layer
06:43 - go to front layer go to the front layer
06:47 - down here
06:49 - all right so after this we want to make
06:51 - it point direction of 90.
06:55 - because we're facing this way i'm going
06:57 - to put a direction of 90 to
06:59 - match it correctly we're making the line
07:01 - sideways all right and then after that
07:03 - we're going to forever
07:05 - uh go to the tank sprite
07:09 - go to tank sprite the tank and then
07:12 - we're going to point the direction
07:13 - of the mouse pointer so let's play it
07:16 - now
07:17 - as you can see it's following the mouse
07:19 - you can move around
07:21 - it always follows the tank so yeah
07:25 - nice and then we'll make the trees go to
07:28 - the front layer so then
07:30 - everything will go under it next we want
07:33 - to get
07:34 - a um another sprite so we're going to
07:36 - paint this
07:38 - so basically in scratch to make
07:40 - something like
07:41 - let's say you want to click to shoot
07:43 - we're going to make a whole separate
07:44 - spread so when you click this sprite
07:46 - it will shoot so we're just going to
07:47 - make a really large box
07:51 - so let's not put any outline
07:54 - just a box like
07:57 - not that big all right and then the code
08:00 - is pretty simple all we're just going to
08:02 - do is
08:02 - make it go to the ghost effect so we're
08:05 - going to
08:06 - one thing if i clicked so we're going to
08:09 - get 135 clips so we have to make the
08:11 - white box a little bit bigger than the
08:13 - stage is
08:14 - and then we're gonna make it go to zero
08:16 - zero so it's centered
08:20 - and then we're going to set the ghost
08:21 - effect to a hundred percent
08:23 - so if you hide it it will actually not
08:25 - activate any of this code so that's why
08:27 - i got to set the ghost
08:28 - to 100 so then it's gone
08:31 - kind of so then we're going to have
08:33 - forever loop
08:34 - forever um if
08:39 - then touching mouse pointer and mouse
08:42 - down
08:43 - so if it's touching the mouse pointer
08:45 - and mouse down
08:48 - mouse down then we have to get a sprite
08:50 - called the laser we're gonna name it
08:52 - we're gonna name this click
08:55 - click and then we're gonna get a sprite
08:56 - from the sprite library like the button
08:59 - button the this one i'm gonna be using
09:02 - the orange one because orange one looks
09:04 - better
09:04 - more like a laser so using the orange
09:07 - one we're going to go back to the click
09:09 - so if it's like that then we're going to
09:11 - create a clone
09:14 - create a clone of the laser
09:18 - laser button tool well we can rename the
09:20 - button to
09:21 - laser
09:25 - laser so go back to the click and then
09:27 - we're gonna wait until
09:29 - not um mouse down
09:32 - so then you can't just spam losers so
09:35 - wait until not
09:36 - mouse down all right
09:40 - all right so now let's go to the laser
09:42 - so we're gonna code for the shooting at
09:43 - the laser
09:44 - so let's click play for a second yes and
09:46 - then
09:48 - put the white there i'll show you that
09:50 - again a ghost effect so it's gone
09:52 - as you can see and then so inside the
09:55 - laser when i start as a clone
09:58 - we're going to go to the cannon
10:02 - and we're going to point in direction
10:05 - point direction
10:07 - and then we're going to sensing and then
10:08 - we're going to get this one so there's a
10:10 - trick to this you have to like select
10:12 - the
10:12 - back and the second one first before we
10:14 - get select the first one so you're going
10:15 - to select the canon
10:17 - and then we're going to do direction of
10:18 - the cannon and then we're going to move
10:20 - 20 steps so then it's
10:21 - kind of in the front and like somewhere
10:25 - and so it's not like down here maybe
10:27 - like somewhere up here
10:29 - uh we're going to move 20 steps so it's
10:31 - more centered
10:33 - and then we're going to show after
10:36 - showing we're going to
10:38 - repeat until it's touching the edge
10:42 - until touching edge
10:45 - and then we're going to move 10 steps
10:48 - repeating on touching edge and then
10:49 - we're going to delete this clone
10:52 - delete and then oops
10:56 - and then when green light clicked we're
10:57 - going to and then if i clicked
11:00 - forever we're gonna hide in the
11:02 - beginning
11:04 - and forever go to canon
11:07 - so it's gonna always go to the canon
11:13 - all right so now as you can see oh yeah
11:16 - i forgot to resize this thing as well
11:18 - so in the laser i'm probably going to do
11:20 - 10 size i find that that's the perfect
11:22 - size
11:23 - so as you can see you can actually shoot
11:26 - out lasers
11:28 - by clicking so you can move around shoot
11:31 - out lasers by clicking
11:33 - all right so that's all we have for now
11:37 - what else can we add oh yeah
11:43 - add the enemies code so we're going to
11:44 - code the enemies
11:46 - today so in the enemies we're going to
11:50 - make a new variable first first of all
11:52 - we have to like put something in the
11:53 - tank to set up we're going to make a new
11:54 - variable called
11:56 - tank tape and damage
12:00 - tank taking damage that's for all
12:01 - sprites let's hide it for now
12:03 - so let's go back to the tank for a
12:04 - second so inside the tank we're going to
12:07 - set the tank
12:08 - taking damage to end in the beginning
12:12 - and so this is just variable to detect
12:16 - if the tank
12:16 - is taking any damage
12:20 - all right so inside the enemies we're
12:22 - going to get a one green flag clicked
12:27 - point reflect clips we're going to set
12:29 - the rotation styles all around
12:31 - i think it already is that but we can do
12:34 - it again
12:35 - and then we're going to show
12:38 - and then we're going to set the size to
12:40 - 100 and
12:42 - repeat three times so we can make three
12:45 - clones at a time at any given time so
12:48 - we're gonna
12:48 - have create cloner myself and
12:52 - hide and when i start as a clone
12:57 - we're going to start with a clone and
12:59 - we're going to
13:00 - go to we're going to go to somewhere up
13:04 - here so the zombies are going to spawn
13:06 - in the top so we're going to go to x
13:09 - pick random negative 240 to 240
13:13 - negative 242 to 240
13:17 - and then in the y i'm going to put 150
13:18 - which is near the top
13:20 - and then i'm going to get a forever loop
13:22 - forever
13:25 - forever uh we're going to point towards
13:29 - the tank so it's always going to go
13:31 - towards the tank and we're going to move
13:34 - one step so it's going to be pretty slow
13:37 - one step right
13:40 - and we're going to do an if-then segment
13:43 - if
13:44 - this is touching the tank
13:48 - if the zombie is touching the tank then
13:50 - we will
13:51 - get an infant statement so if tank
13:54 - taking damage is equal to no
13:57 - equal to n then we're going to
14:01 - broadcast the message and we're going to
14:04 - name the message
14:05 - tank taking damage
14:11 - taking damage and then we're going to do
14:13 - an if that seaman
14:14 - if uh
14:17 - touching laser if touching laser
14:24 - if it's if the oops if the thing is
14:27 - touching the laser then we're going to
14:30 - just
14:31 - play the sound zoom i already have it
14:32 - here and play this sound
14:34 - whatever this sounds like it sounds like
14:36 - this
14:38 - yeah something like that all right and
14:39 - then we're going to broadcast
14:41 - enemy gots hit after
14:44 - it's touching the laser we're going to
14:45 - broadcast
14:49 - and then we're going to change the score
14:51 - by 100
14:58 - and then we're going to hide and then
15:00 - we're going to wait 0.5 seconds
15:02 - before setting up another clone up there
15:04 - so we're going to wait
15:06 - a 0.5 second delay
15:10 - before doing this again so we can just
15:12 - duplicate this
15:14 - it's not a note duplicate
15:17 - take this put this under here and show
15:23 - all right so let's play it
15:28 - as you can see the bullets are piercing
15:32 - the enemies and we don't want that so
15:35 - this is how you
15:35 - fix it so let's go to the tank i mean
15:37 - not the tank let's go to the laser
15:40 - all right so the laser remember in the
15:42 - enemies we broadcast the enemy got hit
15:43 - so inside the laser
15:45 - we're going to broadcast when i receive
15:47 - enemy got hit we're going to delete this
15:49 - one so it's a really easy fix
15:52 - now let's play it you can see that
15:55 - the lasers do not pierce the enemies
16:01 - so yeah that's exactly what we want so
16:04 - we will actually code the
16:05 - damage taking um after this so let's
16:09 - code the damage taking let's go to our
16:11 - tank
16:12 - so in our tank inside the enemies
16:14 - remember we broadcast the message taking
16:16 - damage
16:17 - so inside here we are going to when i
16:19 - receive
16:20 - taking damage then we're going to get an
16:23 - if statement
16:24 - if if taking damage is equal to no
16:30 - equal to n taking damage
16:34 - team taking damage then we're gonna set
16:36 - it to y which is yes
16:39 - [Music]
16:40 - and then we're going to change the lives
16:42 - by negative one
16:46 - and we're gonna play the sound crunch or
16:49 - whatever the sound is i just haven't
16:51 - so then after that we're going to repeat
16:52 - three times and then we're going to
16:54 - change the color to make sure
16:55 - make the player notified player that
16:57 - your tank is getting hit
16:59 - so we're going to change color effect by
17:00 - 25 repeat three times and then we can
17:03 - clear all graphic effects after that and
17:05 - we're gonna wait one second
17:07 - so you don't we put this weight so that
17:10 - the zombies can't keep on attacking you
17:11 - over and over again so we're gonna put
17:13 - the weight
17:13 - and after that we're going to set tank
17:16 - taking damage to no
17:18 - back to end all right so save it
17:25 - as you can see you can kill the zombies
17:28 - now let's touch it see as you can see
17:30 - you're losing lives
17:31 - and you change color well we haven't
17:33 - coded the loss so we'll do that right
17:34 - now so let's kill the loss
17:36 - so at the end right here at the end of
17:38 - this chunk we're going to get
17:40 - if that statement if
17:43 - um lives is less than or equal to zero
17:47 - so
17:47 - less than or equal to zero
17:54 - lives less than or equal to zero
17:58 - then we will broadcast game over
18:06 - over and then i'm gonna broadcast game
18:09 - over
18:10 - we're gonna make a new sprite actually
18:14 - for now we will just make it
18:16 - we'll do that in the next episode but
18:18 - for now we'll just do
18:20 - stop all so when you lose all your lives
18:22 - it'll stop all right
18:25 - make this go to the front layer so then
18:26 - this thing won't show up so it's good
18:29 - good front there oh yeah this is already
18:32 - going to the front layer this one
18:33 - but it's okay let's start the game
18:37 - as you can see kill the zombies let's
18:40 - get close
18:41 - get hit as you can see when you get zero
18:44 - lives
18:44 - you'll stop everything all right
18:48 - once we add the game over this should
18:50 - not happen we have it'll show up game
18:52 - over when you lose
18:53 - so yeah that's pretty much it for this
18:55 - episode don't forget to like
18:56 - share and subscribe and i'll see you
18:58 - guys in the next tutorial
19:02 - [Music]
19:08 - bye
19:11 - you

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here today we'll be making another tutorial today we'll be doing a tank game in scratch so basically i'm going to i'll show you how it works so um all right um so basically use the tank and then you use the mount use the wasd or arrow keys to move the once you lose all your lives by this time i'll try to beat it so once you kill the boss also the boss does one more damage than the regular enemies oh god i died again okay i'm gonna have to change the boss lives so you show you how it's like so let's uh change the boss five for now all right so once you kill the boss they'll say you win so killing the boss will basically make you win okay so i'm gonna set it back to 20 lives and this back to a thousand so basically a boss will only appear when you get a thousand score all right so let's start a new project alright so let's rename our game and name it tank game um and then we're gonna delete the scratch cat because it will not need it and then we got the tank sprite and uh cannon so the cannon is a whole separate sprite so basically in the tank what i did was draw a blue square at rectangle light blue rectangle and then a dark blue rectangle in the middle and that i drew like the black line to like show that's like the little um the wheels or like the belt or something i don't know what it's called but and then i just drew a liner here to show that this is the front of the tank the cannon is just a simple line so yeah that's pretty much it also the cannon you doesn't have to be centered you want to make it so it kind of matches the tank all right and then the boss osprey it's just a big circle and i drew like like some like a crack in his head or something i don't know uh just some like some red and it's like a one of her regular enemies like the zombies the regular zombie which is just a smaller version of it except and it's green the boss is just bigger so boss and enemies and then we have the decoration so if you want these we will put them in the description of the video right all right and then our backdrop let me get that real quick all right so now i have the backdrop let's um get the backdrop okay let me open it back back up again all right there it is let's get the backdrop and drag this in here boom we got the backdrop it's pretty simple it's just like this nothing really it's just like something online yeah so let's go to the tank let's start coding here so inside the tank we're going to get a one green flag clicked and then in the beginning we want to make two new variables so we're gonna do lives for all sprites and then we're going to make another variable called score for all sprites as well so in the beginning i'm going to set the lives to 3 and i'm going to set the score score 0 in the beginning and then i'm going to make the tank go to 0 negative 100 so this is basically uh somewhere down here near the bottom all right and then we're gonna make and take point direction of zero if you know zeros it's up so we make a point off in the beginning all right and then we're going to do the movement right now so control forever if the up arrow or wasd is pressed the w is pressed so if the up if key up or i'm gonna do w because that's what it usually is so w sorry that is w then if that's pressed then we're gonna move five steps forward let's duplicate this so when down error is pressed or the key s is pressed we're going to move negative five steps so you can move backwards and then we're going to duplicate this if the left arrow key or key a is pressed then we're going to rotate five degrees left so we're going to use the a d or the left and right arrow keys to rotate the tank and then right here we're going to do this again and then when the right arrow is pressed or key d then we're going to turn five degrees to the right and then we're going to play it so as you can see the movement and we're going to make the cannon go to the tank so then it'll actually stay on there so as you can see you can move around yeah so that's what we have so far let's go to the um cannon sprite so this is the cannon let's get i want to drink my clicked we want this to go to the front layer go to front layer go to the front layer down here all right so after this we want to make it point direction of 90. because we're facing this way i'm going to put a direction of 90 to match it correctly we're making the line sideways all right and then after that we're going to forever uh go to the tank sprite go to tank sprite the tank and then we're going to point the direction of the mouse pointer so let's play it now as you can see it's following the mouse you can move around it always follows the tank so yeah nice and then we'll make the trees go to the front layer so then everything will go under it next we want to get a um another sprite so we're going to paint this so basically in scratch to make something like let's say you want to click to shoot we're going to make a whole separate spread so when you click this sprite it will shoot so we're just going to make a really large box so let's not put any outline just a box like not that big all right and then the code is pretty simple all we're just going to do is make it go to the ghost effect so we're going to one thing if i clicked so we're going to get 135 clips so we have to make the white box a little bit bigger than the stage is and then we're gonna make it go to zero zero so it's centered and then we're going to set the ghost effect to a hundred percent so if you hide it it will actually not activate any of this code so that's why i got to set the ghost to 100 so then it's gone kind of so then we're going to have forever loop forever um if then touching mouse pointer and mouse down so if it's touching the mouse pointer and mouse down mouse down then we have to get a sprite called the laser we're gonna name it we're gonna name this click click and then we're gonna get a sprite from the sprite library like the button button the this one i'm gonna be using the orange one because orange one looks better more like a laser so using the orange one we're going to go back to the click so if it's like that then we're going to create a clone create a clone of the laser laser button tool well we can rename the button to laser laser so go back to the click and then we're gonna wait until not um mouse down so then you can't just spam losers so wait until not mouse down all right all right so now let's go to the laser so we're gonna code for the shooting at the laser so let's click play for a second yes and then put the white there i'll show you that again a ghost effect so it's gone as you can see and then so inside the laser when i start as a clone we're going to go to the cannon and we're going to point in direction point direction and then we're going to sensing and then we're going to get this one so there's a trick to this you have to like select the back and the second one first before we get select the first one so you're going to select the canon and then we're going to do direction of the cannon and then we're going to move 20 steps so then it's kind of in the front and like somewhere and so it's not like down here maybe like somewhere up here uh we're going to move 20 steps so it's more centered and then we're going to show after showing we're going to repeat until it's touching the edge until touching edge and then we're going to move 10 steps repeating on touching edge and then we're going to delete this clone delete and then oops and then when green light clicked we're going to and then if i clicked forever we're gonna hide in the beginning and forever go to canon so it's gonna always go to the canon all right so now as you can see oh yeah i forgot to resize this thing as well so in the laser i'm probably going to do 10 size i find that that's the perfect size so as you can see you can actually shoot out lasers by clicking so you can move around shoot out lasers by clicking all right so that's all we have for now what else can we add oh yeah add the enemies code so we're going to code the enemies today so in the enemies we're going to make a new variable first first of all we have to like put something in the tank to set up we're going to make a new variable called tank tape and damage tank taking damage that's for all sprites let's hide it for now so let's go back to the tank for a second so inside the tank we're going to set the tank taking damage to end in the beginning and so this is just variable to detect if the tank is taking any damage all right so inside the enemies we're going to get a one green flag clicked point reflect clips we're going to set the rotation styles all around i think it already is that but we can do it again and then we're going to show and then we're going to set the size to 100 and repeat three times so we can make three clones at a time at any given time so we're gonna have create cloner myself and hide and when i start as a clone we're going to start with a clone and we're going to go to we're going to go to somewhere up here so the zombies are going to spawn in the top so we're going to go to x pick random negative 240 to 240 negative 242 to 240 and then in the y i'm going to put 150 which is near the top and then i'm going to get a forever loop forever forever uh we're going to point towards the tank so it's always going to go towards the tank and we're going to move one step so it's going to be pretty slow one step right and we're going to do an ifthen segment if this is touching the tank if the zombie is touching the tank then we will get an infant statement so if tank taking damage is equal to no equal to n then we're going to broadcast the message and we're going to name the message tank taking damage taking damage and then we're going to do an if that seaman if uh touching laser if touching laser if it's if the oops if the thing is touching the laser then we're going to just play the sound zoom i already have it here and play this sound whatever this sounds like it sounds like this yeah something like that all right and then we're going to broadcast enemy gots hit after it's touching the laser we're going to broadcast and then we're going to change the score by 100 and then we're going to hide and then we're going to wait 0.5 seconds before setting up another clone up there so we're going to wait a 0.5 second delay before doing this again so we can just duplicate this it's not a note duplicate take this put this under here and show all right so let's play it as you can see the bullets are piercing the enemies and we don't want that so this is how you fix it so let's go to the tank i mean not the tank let's go to the laser all right so the laser remember in the enemies we broadcast the enemy got hit so inside the laser we're going to broadcast when i receive enemy got hit we're going to delete this one so it's a really easy fix now let's play it you can see that the lasers do not pierce the enemies so yeah that's exactly what we want so we will actually code the damage taking um after this so let's code the damage taking let's go to our tank so in our tank inside the enemies remember we broadcast the message taking damage so inside here we are going to when i receive taking damage then we're going to get an if statement if if taking damage is equal to no equal to n taking damage team taking damage then we're gonna set it to y which is yes and then we're going to change the lives by negative one and we're gonna play the sound crunch or whatever the sound is i just haven't so then after that we're going to repeat three times and then we're going to change the color to make sure make the player notified player that your tank is getting hit so we're going to change color effect by 25 repeat three times and then we can clear all graphic effects after that and we're gonna wait one second so you don't we put this weight so that the zombies can't keep on attacking you over and over again so we're gonna put the weight and after that we're going to set tank taking damage to no back to end all right so save it as you can see you can kill the zombies now let's touch it see as you can see you're losing lives and you change color well we haven't coded the loss so we'll do that right now so let's kill the loss so at the end right here at the end of this chunk we're going to get if that statement if um lives is less than or equal to zero so less than or equal to zero lives less than or equal to zero then we will broadcast game over over and then i'm gonna broadcast game over we're gonna make a new sprite actually for now we will just make it we'll do that in the next episode but for now we'll just do stop all so when you lose all your lives it'll stop all right make this go to the front layer so then this thing won't show up so it's good good front there oh yeah this is already going to the front layer this one but it's okay let's start the game as you can see kill the zombies let's get close get hit as you can see when you get zero lives you'll stop everything all right once we add the game over this should not happen we have it'll show up game over when you lose so yeah that's pretty much it for this episode don't forget to like share and subscribe and i'll see you guys in the next tutorial bye you
