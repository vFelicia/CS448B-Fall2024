00:00 - thank you
00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - welcome back guys it's kids from the
00:08 - playground here and today we're back for
00:10 - another video on Scratch and today we'll
00:12 - be making a Lunar New Year game project
00:14 - because it is almost a Lunar New Year
00:17 - Lunar New Year is on January 22nd 20
00:20 - 22nd 2023 yep so this is our game for
00:24 - Lunar New Year and
00:27 - there's some music that's a little bit
00:30 - loud
00:31 - so uh we have some music and this Lunar
00:35 - New Year the um
00:38 - it is a rabbit so we use the rabbit for
00:42 - this project and basically there's this
00:44 - wooden barricade that slides up and down
00:45 - in a random position and you have to try
00:47 - to get the red envelopes which would
00:49 - basically have money inside so uh
00:54 - you the purpose of the game is trying to
00:56 - get these without hitting the barricade
00:58 - and losing all of your lives so let's
01:00 - try so you see I got a red envelope over
01:02 - there it makes a little sound it goes
01:04 - somewhere random on this section but it
01:06 - might have been a little bit close oh if
01:08 - I hit the barricade there's a stunned
01:10 - rabbit and I lost a life but I have one
01:13 - money right now so I can do that again
01:15 - and get another one and then now the
01:17 - envelopes at a different place and your
01:19 - objective is try to get a high score for
01:22 - this project
01:24 - and if you lose all your lives on the
01:26 - barricade the game ends and it says game
01:29 - over
01:30 - so that is our game that we have today
01:36 - so we started our new game and now we're
01:38 - gonna load all our Sprites so Sprite
01:41 - um scratch has a
01:44 - um Sprite called the hair which is a
01:46 - rabbit that we're basically using here's
01:48 - rabbit same thing so we have our hair
01:50 - over here
01:52 - and uh you might have noticed from our
01:54 - demo that we had two hairs because it it
01:58 - uh so it's in like an infinite Loop
02:00 - there's a another hair that's right
02:01 - behind that goes in front so to do that
02:05 - we will have to
02:07 - do uh select that group
02:10 - and Ctrl C Ctrl V and put it somewhere
02:13 - in the neighborhood behind the hair
02:16 - so now we have that finished so that's
02:20 - just the representation here it and now
02:24 - we get another hair
02:27 - and we can just rename this hair to The
02:29 - Dashing here because this hair will be
02:31 - dashing
02:33 - it's the Clone basically and
02:36 - it's the one that tries to get the
02:38 - envelopes
02:39 - and so we have to get some Stars so just
02:44 - to make the stunned version of the
02:47 - rabbit so we're gonna do that group Ctrl
02:50 - C go to the dash in here Ctrl V Ctrl V
02:53 - Ctrl V and get three of them but we
02:56 - don't have to shrink it because it is
02:58 - quite large so we're gonna put it like
03:01 - that
03:03 - like that
03:06 - like that so yeah we got our three stars
03:10 - for our stunned rabbit and we still have
03:12 - these two costumes which are basically
03:14 - running hairs so and we have our Dash in
03:19 - here now we are going to add our red Red
03:22 - Envelope there's no Red Envelope
03:24 - um Sprite on scratch sadly so you have
03:27 - to uh get our own from online we you can
03:30 - get it from online or just come to my
03:32 - project Gumball zero nine eight now just
03:35 - come to my profile it's Gumball 098 and
03:37 - I will have a project up there uh that
03:39 - is this game and you can get this Red
03:41 - Envelope just export it or you can go
03:43 - online find your own or use carrots if
03:46 - you do not want to use red envelopes and
03:48 - we have our barricade which basically
03:50 - blocks it and we drew this by ourselves
03:52 - and our game over text so that's our
03:55 - that is all of our Sprites and this
03:58 - project
04:00 - so
04:02 - let's start out and get the backdrop
04:07 - so now we're going to drag in our
04:08 - backdrop for this project so it's just a
04:10 - hay field and we have our very custom
04:12 - made backdrop so we're gonna make a
04:15 - quick representation on how to make this
04:18 - backdrop so you click choose a backdrop
04:20 - and
04:22 - um we chose the hay field
04:24 - and this looks very different from the
04:26 - other one but this is what we did so
04:28 - first we converted the bitmap and then
04:31 - we took a large portion of that place
04:34 - Ctrl C Ctrl V and move it a little bit
04:37 - more up so then we make sure the hair is
04:39 - not floating in the sky so we just do
04:41 - this repeat
04:43 - and as needed until you basically cover
04:47 - the whole entire place with hay
04:50 - so that's a lot of hay so you have all
04:54 - your hay over here and this is basically
04:56 - our backdrop and you might have noticed
04:58 - on our other hey field that we have we
05:00 - have also added uh flowers and and we
05:03 - also have a grasshoppers which are
05:05 - available in the Sprite library and our
05:08 - flowers are just pretty easy to draw or
05:11 - you can just uh we have some projects
05:13 - that you can find with flowers in them
05:15 - and before you duplicate any
05:18 - grasshoppers or any of that you have to
05:20 - get to your backdrop and from bitmap you
05:22 - convert back to vector and then you can
05:25 - use this and then get
05:27 - um any Sprite you want so let's just get
05:30 - a grasshopper
05:32 - and
05:33 - we can just go to the costumes and
05:36 - duplicate it to our backdrop
05:39 - you can use any costume you want
05:41 - and basically just add it to your
05:43 - backdrop shrink it a little bit group it
05:45 - and yeah basically add some decoration
05:48 - to your project
05:50 - and we're now going to delete our
05:52 - backdrop and our grasshopper right there
05:56 - so
05:57 - I have a whole entire thing set up so
06:00 - now we're gonna get onto the wooden
06:02 - barricade and teach you how to draw it
06:03 - so this part you can draw this pretty
06:06 - simply just by creating uh so let's just
06:10 - make a new costume so Ctrl V so that's
06:13 - just a rectangle if you ungroup that I'm
06:16 - going to put that apart it's just a uh a
06:19 - reshaped rectangle and the top is I
06:22 - swear so let's just those are the colors
06:24 - and
06:26 - uh we have a little rectangle over here
06:29 - and then just reshape it a little bit
06:31 - and you have basically
06:36 - um a cylinder more like
06:38 - maybe and for the little cone you have
06:41 - up there you have to get these colors or
06:44 - you can use other colors if you want
06:45 - make a square no outline then you could
06:48 - click the reshape Tool uh click one on
06:51 - the corners delete move that one to the
06:53 - top and then you have basically your
06:56 - little cone over here which you can add
06:58 - to your
06:59 - cylinder
07:01 - so now we have that
07:04 - uh you group it and then you can control
07:06 - C control V and copy paste as needed
07:11 - or you can just come to my Sprite or
07:13 - increase some size and you can come to
07:16 - my project Gumball zero nine eight and
07:19 - just duplicate my wooden barricade I
07:21 - will have shared up in for you
07:25 - and we have also have some extra logs so
07:28 - that's just uh
07:30 - um
07:31 - oopsies so that's just a rectangle
07:35 - like that so we're just going to ungroup
07:37 - that for you just a rectangle it's kind
07:39 - of reshaped and a circle and and a
07:44 - lighter Circle so that's basically our
07:46 - wooden log for
07:49 - group it and then we can just that's our
07:51 - basically our added decoration for the
07:54 - barricade
07:56 - just make that go to the back and you
07:58 - basically have already built your
08:00 - barricade so
08:02 - just add another log if you want
08:05 - and yeah
08:06 - pretty cool barricade
08:10 - yep
08:13 - so yep so this is how you draw your
08:16 - barricade
08:18 - and pretty simple and we're going to
08:21 - delete that we're just gonna use our old
08:22 - one
08:25 - okay so we might
08:28 - move this one
08:31 - to the back because it just looks better
08:33 - with contrast with others so
08:36 - now we will be starting our code
08:42 - and we're going to the hair first
08:45 - so when the green flag is clicked
08:48 - we do everything for the hair first
08:50 - set rotation style left right just in
08:53 - case it doesn't flip in all that crazy
08:55 - stuff that might happen
08:57 - and then switch costume to Hair A which
09:01 - is the standing here which looks like
09:03 - that because we already added another
09:06 - rabbit to there and then we're gonna go
09:09 - to a certain position so let's just go
09:11 - to here and go forever
09:15 - we're gonna go to
09:18 - X
09:21 - negative 176 so that's where we are and
09:24 - Y Mouse y so that's just basically
09:28 - so it's just gonna go up and down with
09:31 - your mouse
09:32 - and if then so we need if then right
09:35 - real quick if then Mouse down so if you
09:40 - click
09:41 - then switch costume to hair B
09:46 - which is this one
09:49 - please put that back here and
09:53 - broadcast Dash forward
10:02 - Dash or
10:07 - now we have that
10:08 - we wait 0.2 seconds
10:14 - and switch costume back to Hair A
10:16 - act like nothing happened and there's a
10:18 - new hair for us to use
10:21 - and then we have another green flag so
10:24 - when the green flag is clicked
10:26 - so we will create two new variables
10:28 - first money so that's just collecting
10:31 - your money
10:33 - uh so we're gonna set money to zero
10:34 - because you don't start off any money
10:36 - and then lives
10:39 - and then set lives to three
10:42 - you can add more or less if you want to
10:44 - make it more challenging or easier
10:46 - and then we will go to control get a
10:49 - forever Loop and then if then
10:53 - you need to ore
10:56 - so if then lives are equal to zero
11:00 - lives are equal to zero like
11:03 - or lives are less than zero
11:12 - then it will broadcast game over
11:14 - basically you lost all your lives
11:19 - and you need to restart
11:21 - so we are done with the hair
11:25 - so now we're going to move on to the
11:26 - dashing here
11:28 - so when the green flag is clicked zoom
11:30 - in a little bit it's gonna hide because
11:31 - we just want the regular hair to show in
11:34 - the beginning not The Dashing one and
11:36 - then when I receive Dash forward which
11:39 - is the broadcast that we received from
11:41 - the hair to move and then we'll create
11:44 - clone of myself
11:46 - and then when I start as a clone
11:49 - we'll set rotation Style
11:52 - where is it that left right and then go
11:56 - to hair so it'll just
11:59 - go to the hair when it starts out
12:02 - and then it will show
12:07 - and then it'll start sound Gallop so we
12:09 - might have to get that from the Sprite
12:15 - like yep perfect
12:17 - cover gallop oh yeah and
12:21 - um we thought it was a little long so we
12:23 - increased the Gallup speed
12:26 - and made it faster
12:28 - it's because it's just better It just
12:30 - fits in more with the project so we're
12:32 - gonna actually start sound gallop
12:36 - and we're going to have a repeat until
12:40 - I'll explain this in a minute repeat
12:43 - until you need to or
12:46 - repeat until touching Red Envelope or
12:51 - envelope whatever we call it
12:53 - touching Red Envelope so basically the
12:56 - rabbit will disappear when it touches
12:58 - the Red Envelope or
13:01 - need a greater sign where's the greater
13:03 - sign
13:05 - yeah there we go so or
13:08 - the X position
13:11 - is greater than 225.
13:15 - basically if it reaches this end it will
13:18 - disappear basically the X position of
13:20 - 225 back here
13:22 - and we cannot use and then it'll move 15
13:24 - Steps we cannot use touching Edge
13:27 - because you can drive your rabbet all
13:29 - the way up to the edge and we do not
13:31 - want it to disappear and stuff so and
13:33 - then you need a if then if then touching
13:37 - wooden barricade
13:40 - please
13:41 - wooden barricade
13:43 - it will stop other scripts in the Sprite
13:49 - so stop other strips in the Sprite and
13:52 - it will switch costume
13:55 - to Hair A
13:58 - which is the stunned one so basically if
14:00 - you hit the wooden barricade it'll be a
14:01 - stunned rabbit
14:03 - and weight 0.2 seconds
14:12 - 0.2 seconds and delete this quote
14:17 - and then delete this one
14:20 - so now we have another thing to use so
14:22 - I'm going to zoom out real quick see if
14:24 - you can copy down this code feel free to
14:26 - pause
14:28 - and then we're gonna put a when I start
14:30 - as a clone
14:31 - it'll go to the front layer
14:34 - I'm gonna have to move that soon
14:37 - go to the front layer and then switch
14:39 - costume to hair
14:42 - B
14:45 - this one so it's basically running
14:49 - and then
14:50 - we have to repeat until
14:54 - move a little bit over here repeat until
14:57 - you know or again
15:05 - so we're going to repeat until and use
15:07 - this over here and put that in here oops
15:13 - put that in here
15:14 - and then we're gonna go switch costume
15:18 - to hair B
15:21 - and wait 0.1 seconds
15:29 - and then switch costume
15:32 - to here C
15:34 - so it's basically Galloping back and
15:36 - forth between these two
15:40 - and
15:41 - you might ask why don't I just put that
15:46 - 0.1 seconds over here why don't I just
15:47 - put that over here so wait to do block
15:50 - the
15:52 - the other scripts in the Sprite because
15:53 - of the small weight so that is not going
15:57 - to be good so you have to make it a
15:59 - different separate
16:01 - place
16:02 - and now we have that done with we are
16:05 - done with the hair so I'm gonna try to
16:09 - group up these code if you can see it
16:13 - so feel free to pause right here oh not
16:16 - here here so yeah basically all the code
16:19 - for the dashing here
16:24 - so now we're moving on to the red
16:26 - envelope envelope
16:29 - so when the green flag is clicked
16:33 - we will go to
16:36 - go to this position you can do whatever
16:38 - position starts out with it'll go
16:40 - forever
16:43 - show
16:47 - go to and you need this one
16:51 - go to x210
16:53 - which is over here so that's the 210x
16:56 - and then y so it was just pick random
16:59 - from negative 135y all the way down here
17:03 - but positive 135y all the way up there
17:06 - so it has a lot of
17:08 - um differences in where the envelope is
17:11 - going to be
17:12 - and then we're going to put wait until
17:16 - touching dashing here
17:20 - touching Dash and hair
17:22 - so just wait until it gets touched and
17:26 - then it will change the money
17:30 - money if I pick random one to ten
17:36 - cool and now we're gonna play a quick
17:39 - sound a coin sound pretty sure you can
17:41 - find this in the Sprite Library
17:43 - just right there and you should sell a
17:46 - quick little coin sound so we will use
17:49 - play sound coin until done
17:52 - and then hide
17:55 - then wait 0.2 seconds
18:03 - so yep feel free to pause right here
18:09 - and we'll be moving on to the wooden
18:13 - barricade
18:15 - and so when the green flag is clicked
18:20 - oopsies I don't know why I always zooms
18:23 - out like that and grief like is clicked
18:25 - I'll go to whatever position
18:28 - you wanted to start out at
18:30 - probably gonna make a start out over
18:31 - here because that looks like a little
18:33 - too far
18:34 - and then
18:38 - let's actually make yeah I think that's
18:40 - good
18:43 - maybe up here it doesn't really matter
18:45 - but
18:46 - let's just put it over here and then go
18:48 - forever
18:50 - it'll Glide
18:53 - use this one
18:54 - Glide 0.5 seconds
18:58 - to okay so I'm gonna make it Glide 0.5
19:01 - seconds to x 100 make this one 102 so
19:05 - it's matching and why pick random
19:08 - negative 180 all the way to the bottom
19:12 - all the way to positive 180 all the way
19:16 - to the top
19:17 - and we're gonna wait
19:20 - wait pick random
19:24 - 0.5
19:26 - to 1 second before it starts moving
19:29 - again
19:30 - and then after that we will have when
19:32 - the green flag is clicked
19:34 - we'll go forever
19:36 - and then if if then
19:39 - if it's Touching The Dashing hair
19:46 - then it will change the lives by minus
19:49 - one
19:50 - basically losing a life
19:53 - and wait 0.5 seconds
20:00 - so we're going to zoom out one and feel
20:01 - free to pause right here
20:06 - and now we'll be going to the text
20:09 - this one's pretty simple when the green
20:11 - flag is clicked
20:14 - it'll go to
20:15 - the middle
20:17 - and it'll hide
20:20 - because you don't lose the game in the
20:21 - beginning and then when I receive
20:24 - game over
20:26 - it will go to the front layer in front
20:29 - of everything
20:31 - show
20:33 - and then
20:35 - stop all
20:37 - now we're done with that we can move on
20:39 - to the backdrop our final one
20:42 - and then when the green flag is clicked
20:43 - oopsies
20:46 - green flag is clicked okay so now I will
20:49 - be uploading a sound so that we can use
20:51 - so I'm going to use this one
20:55 - and we have that and that's basically
20:57 - the side I'll be using for this project
20:59 - you can use whatever from the Sprite
21:01 - library or whatever you want
21:04 - and we can change set volume
21:08 - to 25 percent
21:10 - and go forever
21:14 - and play sound
21:16 - Chinese happy New Year until then
21:19 - so we have that done and finished
21:23 - so now we're gonna drag the money down
21:26 - same with the live so it's not
21:28 - interfering with the rabbit as much
21:31 - so I found a really big bug inside the
21:33 - game and I'm just here to tell you that
21:35 - so when I coated this in the wooden
21:37 - barricade this is incorrect and we might
21:40 - have to trash all of that and instead go
21:43 - to the hair and instead lose change the
21:46 - lives back here so it's actually working
21:49 - because like it wasn't working because
21:51 - when it touched the thing sometimes it
21:54 - lost lives but sometimes it didn't so
21:56 - now it should guarantee a loss of life
21:59 - so I should try it out my lives are
22:02 - losing so that's perfect and dealer so
22:05 - the game should work now so uh
22:08 - let's just test out the whole entire
22:10 - game so we have our money and let's just
22:14 - try to get the money
22:16 - and yeah
22:17 - [Music]
22:19 - because I missed
22:21 - okay
22:25 - and yeah oops oops there we go so yeah
22:31 - this is basically our game that we made
22:33 - today
22:35 - so please like share subscribe and
22:40 - comment in the comment section below
22:42 - um what project you want next and if you
22:45 - do celebrate the Lunar New Year please
22:47 - share with us that is very cool so yeah
22:51 - have a great day
22:53 - see you guys next time
22:55 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

thank you welcome back guys it's kids from the playground here and today we're back for another video on Scratch and today we'll be making a Lunar New Year game project because it is almost a Lunar New Year Lunar New Year is on January 22nd 20 22nd 2023 yep so this is our game for Lunar New Year and there's some music that's a little bit loud so uh we have some music and this Lunar New Year the um it is a rabbit so we use the rabbit for this project and basically there's this wooden barricade that slides up and down in a random position and you have to try to get the red envelopes which would basically have money inside so uh you the purpose of the game is trying to get these without hitting the barricade and losing all of your lives so let's try so you see I got a red envelope over there it makes a little sound it goes somewhere random on this section but it might have been a little bit close oh if I hit the barricade there's a stunned rabbit and I lost a life but I have one money right now so I can do that again and get another one and then now the envelopes at a different place and your objective is try to get a high score for this project and if you lose all your lives on the barricade the game ends and it says game over so that is our game that we have today so we started our new game and now we're gonna load all our Sprites so Sprite um scratch has a um Sprite called the hair which is a rabbit that we're basically using here's rabbit same thing so we have our hair over here and uh you might have noticed from our demo that we had two hairs because it it uh so it's in like an infinite Loop there's a another hair that's right behind that goes in front so to do that we will have to do uh select that group and Ctrl C Ctrl V and put it somewhere in the neighborhood behind the hair so now we have that finished so that's just the representation here it and now we get another hair and we can just rename this hair to The Dashing here because this hair will be dashing it's the Clone basically and it's the one that tries to get the envelopes and so we have to get some Stars so just to make the stunned version of the rabbit so we're gonna do that group Ctrl C go to the dash in here Ctrl V Ctrl V Ctrl V and get three of them but we don't have to shrink it because it is quite large so we're gonna put it like that like that like that so yeah we got our three stars for our stunned rabbit and we still have these two costumes which are basically running hairs so and we have our Dash in here now we are going to add our red Red Envelope there's no Red Envelope um Sprite on scratch sadly so you have to uh get our own from online we you can get it from online or just come to my project Gumball zero nine eight now just come to my profile it's Gumball 098 and I will have a project up there uh that is this game and you can get this Red Envelope just export it or you can go online find your own or use carrots if you do not want to use red envelopes and we have our barricade which basically blocks it and we drew this by ourselves and our game over text so that's our that is all of our Sprites and this project so let's start out and get the backdrop so now we're going to drag in our backdrop for this project so it's just a hay field and we have our very custom made backdrop so we're gonna make a quick representation on how to make this backdrop so you click choose a backdrop and um we chose the hay field and this looks very different from the other one but this is what we did so first we converted the bitmap and then we took a large portion of that place Ctrl C Ctrl V and move it a little bit more up so then we make sure the hair is not floating in the sky so we just do this repeat and as needed until you basically cover the whole entire place with hay so that's a lot of hay so you have all your hay over here and this is basically our backdrop and you might have noticed on our other hey field that we have we have also added uh flowers and and we also have a grasshoppers which are available in the Sprite library and our flowers are just pretty easy to draw or you can just uh we have some projects that you can find with flowers in them and before you duplicate any grasshoppers or any of that you have to get to your backdrop and from bitmap you convert back to vector and then you can use this and then get um any Sprite you want so let's just get a grasshopper and we can just go to the costumes and duplicate it to our backdrop you can use any costume you want and basically just add it to your backdrop shrink it a little bit group it and yeah basically add some decoration to your project and we're now going to delete our backdrop and our grasshopper right there so I have a whole entire thing set up so now we're gonna get onto the wooden barricade and teach you how to draw it so this part you can draw this pretty simply just by creating uh so let's just make a new costume so Ctrl V so that's just a rectangle if you ungroup that I'm going to put that apart it's just a uh a reshaped rectangle and the top is I swear so let's just those are the colors and uh we have a little rectangle over here and then just reshape it a little bit and you have basically um a cylinder more like maybe and for the little cone you have up there you have to get these colors or you can use other colors if you want make a square no outline then you could click the reshape Tool uh click one on the corners delete move that one to the top and then you have basically your little cone over here which you can add to your cylinder so now we have that uh you group it and then you can control C control V and copy paste as needed or you can just come to my Sprite or increase some size and you can come to my project Gumball zero nine eight and just duplicate my wooden barricade I will have shared up in for you and we have also have some extra logs so that's just uh um oopsies so that's just a rectangle like that so we're just going to ungroup that for you just a rectangle it's kind of reshaped and a circle and and a lighter Circle so that's basically our wooden log for group it and then we can just that's our basically our added decoration for the barricade just make that go to the back and you basically have already built your barricade so just add another log if you want and yeah pretty cool barricade yep so yep so this is how you draw your barricade and pretty simple and we're going to delete that we're just gonna use our old one okay so we might move this one to the back because it just looks better with contrast with others so now we will be starting our code and we're going to the hair first so when the green flag is clicked we do everything for the hair first set rotation style left right just in case it doesn't flip in all that crazy stuff that might happen and then switch costume to Hair A which is the standing here which looks like that because we already added another rabbit to there and then we're gonna go to a certain position so let's just go to here and go forever we're gonna go to X negative 176 so that's where we are and Y Mouse y so that's just basically so it's just gonna go up and down with your mouse and if then so we need if then right real quick if then Mouse down so if you click then switch costume to hair B which is this one please put that back here and broadcast Dash forward Dash or now we have that we wait 0.2 seconds and switch costume back to Hair A act like nothing happened and there's a new hair for us to use and then we have another green flag so when the green flag is clicked so we will create two new variables first money so that's just collecting your money uh so we're gonna set money to zero because you don't start off any money and then lives and then set lives to three you can add more or less if you want to make it more challenging or easier and then we will go to control get a forever Loop and then if then you need to ore so if then lives are equal to zero lives are equal to zero like or lives are less than zero then it will broadcast game over basically you lost all your lives and you need to restart so we are done with the hair so now we're going to move on to the dashing here so when the green flag is clicked zoom in a little bit it's gonna hide because we just want the regular hair to show in the beginning not The Dashing one and then when I receive Dash forward which is the broadcast that we received from the hair to move and then we'll create clone of myself and then when I start as a clone we'll set rotation Style where is it that left right and then go to hair so it'll just go to the hair when it starts out and then it will show and then it'll start sound Gallop so we might have to get that from the Sprite like yep perfect cover gallop oh yeah and um we thought it was a little long so we increased the Gallup speed and made it faster it's because it's just better It just fits in more with the project so we're gonna actually start sound gallop and we're going to have a repeat until I'll explain this in a minute repeat until you need to or repeat until touching Red Envelope or envelope whatever we call it touching Red Envelope so basically the rabbit will disappear when it touches the Red Envelope or need a greater sign where's the greater sign yeah there we go so or the X position is greater than 225. basically if it reaches this end it will disappear basically the X position of 225 back here and we cannot use and then it'll move 15 Steps we cannot use touching Edge because you can drive your rabbet all the way up to the edge and we do not want it to disappear and stuff so and then you need a if then if then touching wooden barricade please wooden barricade it will stop other scripts in the Sprite so stop other strips in the Sprite and it will switch costume to Hair A which is the stunned one so basically if you hit the wooden barricade it'll be a stunned rabbit and weight 0.2 seconds 0.2 seconds and delete this quote and then delete this one so now we have another thing to use so I'm going to zoom out real quick see if you can copy down this code feel free to pause and then we're gonna put a when I start as a clone it'll go to the front layer I'm gonna have to move that soon go to the front layer and then switch costume to hair B this one so it's basically running and then we have to repeat until move a little bit over here repeat until you know or again so we're going to repeat until and use this over here and put that in here oops put that in here and then we're gonna go switch costume to hair B and wait 0.1 seconds and then switch costume to here C so it's basically Galloping back and forth between these two and you might ask why don't I just put that 0.1 seconds over here why don't I just put that over here so wait to do block the the other scripts in the Sprite because of the small weight so that is not going to be good so you have to make it a different separate place and now we have that done with we are done with the hair so I'm gonna try to group up these code if you can see it so feel free to pause right here oh not here here so yeah basically all the code for the dashing here so now we're moving on to the red envelope envelope so when the green flag is clicked we will go to go to this position you can do whatever position starts out with it'll go forever show go to and you need this one go to x210 which is over here so that's the 210x and then y so it was just pick random from negative 135y all the way down here but positive 135y all the way up there so it has a lot of um differences in where the envelope is going to be and then we're going to put wait until touching dashing here touching Dash and hair so just wait until it gets touched and then it will change the money money if I pick random one to ten cool and now we're gonna play a quick sound a coin sound pretty sure you can find this in the Sprite Library just right there and you should sell a quick little coin sound so we will use play sound coin until done and then hide then wait 0.2 seconds so yep feel free to pause right here and we'll be moving on to the wooden barricade and so when the green flag is clicked oopsies I don't know why I always zooms out like that and grief like is clicked I'll go to whatever position you wanted to start out at probably gonna make a start out over here because that looks like a little too far and then let's actually make yeah I think that's good maybe up here it doesn't really matter but let's just put it over here and then go forever it'll Glide use this one Glide 0.5 seconds to okay so I'm gonna make it Glide 0.5 seconds to x 100 make this one 102 so it's matching and why pick random negative 180 all the way to the bottom all the way to positive 180 all the way to the top and we're gonna wait wait pick random 0.5 to 1 second before it starts moving again and then after that we will have when the green flag is clicked we'll go forever and then if if then if it's Touching The Dashing hair then it will change the lives by minus one basically losing a life and wait 0.5 seconds so we're going to zoom out one and feel free to pause right here and now we'll be going to the text this one's pretty simple when the green flag is clicked it'll go to the middle and it'll hide because you don't lose the game in the beginning and then when I receive game over it will go to the front layer in front of everything show and then stop all now we're done with that we can move on to the backdrop our final one and then when the green flag is clicked oopsies green flag is clicked okay so now I will be uploading a sound so that we can use so I'm going to use this one and we have that and that's basically the side I'll be using for this project you can use whatever from the Sprite library or whatever you want and we can change set volume to 25 percent and go forever and play sound Chinese happy New Year until then so we have that done and finished so now we're gonna drag the money down same with the live so it's not interfering with the rabbit as much so I found a really big bug inside the game and I'm just here to tell you that so when I coated this in the wooden barricade this is incorrect and we might have to trash all of that and instead go to the hair and instead lose change the lives back here so it's actually working because like it wasn't working because when it touched the thing sometimes it lost lives but sometimes it didn't so now it should guarantee a loss of life so I should try it out my lives are losing so that's perfect and dealer so the game should work now so uh let's just test out the whole entire game so we have our money and let's just try to get the money and yeah because I missed okay and yeah oops oops there we go so yeah this is basically our game that we made today so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below um what project you want next and if you do celebrate the Lunar New Year please share with us that is very cool so yeah have a great day see you guys next time
