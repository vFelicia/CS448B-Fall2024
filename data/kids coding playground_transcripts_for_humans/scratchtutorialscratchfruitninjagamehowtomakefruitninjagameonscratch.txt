00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids coding
00:08 - playground here today we'll be making a
00:10 - fruit ninja game in scratch so
00:12 - um fruit ninja is probably one of the
00:14 - oldest mobile games there is on the app
00:16 - store um i still remember playing this
00:18 - game as a child so we have recreated it
00:21 - in scratch for you guys to play
00:23 - um
00:25 - so basically it's pretty much like the
00:26 - original one
00:28 - um
00:29 - there's the begin button so you can
00:30 - slice as you can see you slice the begin
00:32 - button you go into the game so you slice
00:35 - the fruits
00:37 - and when you hit a bomb then you lose
00:39 - and
00:40 - um
00:41 - also
00:43 - if you uh let the fruits go then you'll
00:46 - lose lives as you can see you're gonna
00:48 - lose lives and when you lose all three
00:50 - of your lives you will also
00:52 - lose so
00:53 - there's two ways to lose hitting a bomb
00:56 - and also letting three fruits fall
00:59 - so yeah that's pretty much the game we
01:01 - have
01:02 - and then so now let's go start a new
01:04 - project
01:06 - okay so in our new project we're
01:07 - deleting our scratch cat obviously
01:09 - and i have some sprites so we have the
01:11 - lives so these are the x's and we have
01:13 - the fruits
01:16 - and then we have the costumes for the
01:17 - backdrop
01:19 - so we have the
01:21 - this
01:22 - backdrop like the loading the main menu
01:25 - and we have the game screen which is
01:26 - like the cutting board
01:30 - and we just got these images from online
01:32 - on google you can just download your own
01:34 - on google or you can just export it
01:36 - straight from my project i have it
01:37 - shared
01:38 - or you can uh use our google drive
01:41 - but if you don't know how to use your
01:43 - google drive just go to our project
01:45 - and one last reminder for google drive
01:47 - uh don't use your school account and
01:49 - you'll never need to request access for
01:51 - a google drive you'll always be able to
01:53 - use it for sprites okay
01:56 - and then
01:57 - that's it for the sprites
02:00 - and
02:01 - let's go start in the backdrop so in the
02:02 - backdrop we have a few lines of code so
02:04 - let's go to the code so one green flag
02:06 - clicked we are going to
02:08 - once again so we're going to make a new
02:10 - variable we're going to name it score so
02:12 - we'll need to score also um i don't know
02:15 - why the pen is already here
02:17 - um but to get the pen extension you have
02:20 - to click that button down there and
02:22 - click the pen
02:23 - um
02:25 - because i started the game with that so
02:26 - that's why the pen is there
02:28 - um so just remember to click the
02:30 - extensions to get the pen
02:32 - okay and so we're gonna set the score
02:35 - to zero in the beginning and then we're
02:37 - gonna switch the backdrop
02:39 - to the start screen which is our first
02:41 - one this one so we're gonna name it
02:43 - start screen
02:44 - and then we're gonna
02:46 - broadcast the message and we're gonna
02:48 - name it start screen so this is the
02:50 - beginning
02:51 - starting of the game
02:53 - and then uh we're going to go to our
02:56 - so now we are going to get our begin
02:57 - button so we're going to just get the
02:59 - button one
03:00 - use this
03:02 - and then send the costume we're going to
03:03 - use
03:04 - this text i guess whatever and then
03:06 - we're going to write begin
03:08 - so then you can just use the select tool
03:11 - put it right here shrink it a little bit
03:13 - maybe that's the perfect size
03:15 - and then we just copy paste it
03:17 - up there and then
03:18 - we can just
03:20 - oops
03:21 - we can just take this and then we can
03:23 - just use the rotate you hold down the
03:25 - shift so you can get a perfect rotation
03:27 - and put it like that
03:31 - so that you've got yourself a basic
03:32 - begin button
03:34 - and we're going to group it so then
03:36 - it'll all be together the center
03:39 - okay
03:40 - so we have our begin button let's go
03:42 - code in it so inside the code it's just
03:44 - gonna be pretty simple
03:47 - so when green if i click we're going to
03:48 - go to this x and y position i'm going to
03:50 - pick 0
03:51 - uh negative 120 that's what i had before
03:54 - and then we're going to
03:56 - go to the events when i receive start
03:57 - screen
03:58 - we're going to click the show so in the
04:00 - beginning it's going to show up and then
04:02 - forever
04:04 - it's going to go turn 2 degrees
04:06 - so we're going to make it just basically
04:08 - keep on turning
04:10 - in the beginning so we're going to turn
04:11 - 2 degrees and then if
04:14 - and then uh we're going to get a new
04:17 - sprite so basically
04:18 - um we want it so if you cut like slices
04:22 - it will begin the game so we're going to
04:24 - get a we're just going to like draw a
04:26 - box this is just so we can select the
04:28 - tool use the select tool to select the
04:29 - color
04:30 - so this will be the like the trail of
04:32 - the slice
04:33 - so i guess we can get like some light
04:34 - blue color doesn't really matter or
04:37 - maybe like that
04:39 - like that color that color looks fine
04:42 - um and then we're going to just no
04:44 - outline just draw
04:47 - a regular square hold down shift if you
04:49 - would like
04:51 - center it
04:53 - and there you go you've got the square
04:55 - so we're just going to rename this to
04:57 - the slice
04:58 - and so next we're going to go back to
05:00 - the button and then inside the button
05:02 - we're going to let's hide this right now
05:04 - i actually know we have to show it to
05:05 - select it so um we're going to
05:09 - if touching so we're just gonna use this
05:11 - thing
05:12 - get the color so if it's touching that
05:14 - color then we're going to hide the
05:15 - button because
05:17 - you're basically slicing it and then
05:19 - we're gonna broadcast a message called
05:20 - start game which starts the game so
05:22 - we're going to make a new variable
05:24 - and name it start game
05:27 - start the game
05:28 - and then we're going to stop the script
05:30 - once um you've entered the game so stop
05:32 - the script
05:34 - okay so now we have the begin button
05:37 - let's
05:38 - hide this
05:41 - and obviously we have to
05:44 - click this a green flag and then
05:47 - and right now it will not work obviously
05:49 - because we have to
05:51 - make the trail for the mouse as you can
05:53 - see there is no trail
05:55 - so we have to make the trail so
05:57 - inside the slice let's hop into the
06:00 - slice
06:01 - sprites
06:02 - and then we're going to start coding in
06:03 - here so
06:05 - we're going to have to make two lists
06:07 - just for the sprites one for the slice x
06:09 - and one for the slice y so slice x for
06:12 - the sprite only
06:14 - and slice y
06:16 - for the sprite only as well so basically
06:18 - this will keep track of where the x and
06:20 - y position of the mouse is so it can
06:22 - create a trail
06:23 - so we have the two lists let's get a one
06:25 - green flag clicked so
06:27 - when preflight clicks we are going to
06:28 - delete all of both
06:31 - delete both all of both slice x and
06:34 - slice y
06:35 - and then forever
06:37 - we're going to get a forever loop
06:39 - so if we're going to get an if so if
06:41 - mouse down
06:44 - if you're clicking down mouse down then
06:45 - we're going to add
06:46 - um
06:48 - we're going to add a mouse x
06:51 - to the list
06:53 - so it's going to add mouse x to the
06:55 - slice x list
06:57 - and then we're going to add another one
06:59 - add instead of slice x we're doing slice
07:01 - y
07:03 - so we're going to instead when this is
07:06 - that then we're going to get a mouse y
07:08 - so add mouse y to the list so now
07:11 - when you like mouse down it will add
07:13 - something to the list as you can see it
07:15 - will add as much to the list
07:18 - so yeah
07:19 - basically when you're slicing it will
07:20 - keep track of where
07:23 - your mouse is so it will create another
07:24 - trail
07:26 - okay and then if we're getting another
07:28 - if
07:30 - if
07:31 - um length of slice x is greater than
07:33 - four or not mouse down so we're going to
07:36 - get this or and then so if it's greater
07:38 - than four so we're only going to limit
07:40 - to so it's only going to be
07:42 - four x and y values at a time so we're
07:46 - going to use the
07:48 - greater than
07:49 - so if the length
07:52 - of the
07:54 - length of
07:56 - slice x is greater than four
07:59 - uh
08:00 - or not mouse down
08:03 - then we're gonna delete so basically if
08:04 - you're not mouse down it will also
08:06 - delete so
08:08 - mouse down then we're also going to
08:10 - delete one of both so
08:13 - delete
08:15 - one of slice x and one of slice y
08:17 - so we don't need to make another whole
08:19 - script for this for slice y because
08:21 - we're already doing this
08:22 - so we just delete one from both
08:24 - so as you can see it's empty you click
08:27 - it'll only limit you to four
08:30 - but
08:30 - as you can see when you click randomly
08:32 - the x and y values change
08:34 - and if you let go it will delete so
08:36 - that's what we want we only wanted to
08:38 - limit to four
08:40 - and then
08:41 - we're going to get another one green
08:42 - flag clicked and then we're going to get
08:44 - a hide
08:46 - so
08:46 - when it's in the beginning we're going
08:48 - to hide and then inside the pen
08:50 - remember at the extension we're going to
08:52 - erase all in the beginning and then
08:54 - we're gonna set the pen color
08:56 - to the slice so we're gonna show the
08:58 - slice
08:59 - and select the color
09:01 - and then we're going to set the pen size
09:03 - to six so the slice will be
09:06 - six thickness and i'm gonna make a new
09:10 - my block so we're gonna make it my block
09:12 - we're gonna name it draw slice
09:16 - okay and click okay
09:18 - draw slice
09:19 - and then basically we're to define it so
09:22 - basically it's going to basically like
09:23 - when you like drag it will draw the
09:25 - slice
09:26 - so we're going to just erase all in the
09:28 - beginning
09:30 - if
09:32 - so if
09:33 - the length of slice x is greater than
09:35 - zero so that means there are something
09:37 - inside the list of slice x
09:40 - so we're gonna get a greater than zero
09:42 - if the length of slice x
09:47 - and the slice x is greater than zero
09:50 - then we're going to pen up
09:53 - and then we're going to set the x and y
09:55 - values
09:56 - to the slice x and slice y the item one
09:59 - the first item so wherever they first
10:01 - start dragging it's going to set it to
10:04 - the x and y value so we're going to go
10:06 - to
10:08 - so we're going to go to
10:10 - um
10:12 - item
10:14 - we're going to get the item
10:16 - item 1 of slice x and we're gonna get
10:18 - item one of slice y
10:20 - so we're gonna use the first two and
10:21 - then we're gonna pen down so we're gonna
10:23 - start drawing after that
10:26 - and then we're gonna set the index to
10:27 - two so we're gonna make a new variable
10:29 - we're gonna name it index
10:30 - so basically the index is it'll keep on
10:33 - going up the list
10:34 - through the list um
10:36 - and it'll keep on
10:38 - adding the x and y values so
10:40 - basically f this is index one so we're
10:43 - going to set the index to two because
10:44 - this is the first one
10:46 - setting next to two
10:48 - and then we're going to repeat until the
10:50 - index is greater than slice x
10:54 - and repeat until the index is greater
10:56 - than slice x
10:59 - index is greater than slice x
11:03 - bigger than
11:05 - where it's not
11:09 - length of slice x sorry um
11:10 - that took a while
11:12 - all right so index has to be greater
11:14 - than length of slicex and then we're
11:15 - going to go to
11:19 - we're going to go to the item
11:21 - index of slice x and we're going to go
11:23 - to the item index of slice y so we're
11:26 - going to go to wherever the index is
11:29 - during in the slice x so
11:31 - basically it's going to repeat until the
11:33 - index goes over four and then because we
11:36 - limit it to four
11:38 - so we're gonna go to the item
11:42 - of slice x and item of slice y and reset
11:45 - the index
11:48 - like that
11:50 - and then we're going to change the index
11:51 - by one so you will go through the list
11:54 - change index by one and then we're going
11:56 - to pin up
11:58 - i feel like we're going to pen up uh
11:59 - stop drawing
12:01 - i'm going to pin up and then right here
12:03 - we have to obviously
12:05 - um oops we have to
12:07 - like call this function
12:09 - for it to do something so we're going to
12:10 - use forever
12:13 - control slice
12:15 - all right so now we can play
12:17 - as you can see
12:18 - the y and x values have been changing
12:20 - and now you have like a trail
12:22 - so you can see and when you slice it
12:25 - the begin button hides see that
12:28 - and now you have a simple trail
12:31 - okay so we have our slice
12:36 - let's move on
12:37 - to our fruits
12:38 - so basically in our fruits in the
12:40 - costumes what we did
12:42 - was we
12:43 - got the fruits from the sprite library
12:45 - the bomb bushes from online just
12:46 - downloaded random bomb from online
12:48 - doesn't really matter so all these
12:49 - fruits are from the sprite library and
12:52 - this has to be in order so as you can
12:53 - see one two three four five and then we
12:55 - go back to the apple so you see that
12:58 - go back to the apple banana orange
13:00 - watermelon it has to be in the same
13:01 - order and i'll explain why after okay so
13:04 - just put them in order and basically for
13:06 - the apple what we do is we convert to
13:08 - bitmap and we use this tool
13:11 - like drag so okay let me just like
13:14 - duplicate this to show you so what we do
13:16 - convert to bitmap use this tool
13:19 - and we do that
13:21 - and then we just remove it and maybe
13:23 - like rotate it a little bit and boom now
13:25 - you've got yourself a sliced apple so i
13:27 - think you guys get the idea so basically
13:28 - that's what you do for each one of them
13:31 - um until you get to the last one don't
13:33 - worry about the bomb
13:35 - but just do all of that
13:37 - um
13:38 - it has to be in order just remember that
13:40 - okay
13:40 - and then so basically in the fruits
13:42 - we're going to
13:43 - start with the one group like clicks
13:46 - and green black we're going to hide
13:48 - and
13:49 - we're going to want to receive start
13:51 - game so when you like slice the begin
13:53 - button
13:54 - then you're going to get a forever loop
13:58 - forever
13:59 - wait one second and then we're going to
14:00 - set the number of roots quick random one
14:03 - to four so the maximum amount of fruits
14:05 - you can have
14:06 - on the board is four four or less so
14:09 - we're gonna get a new variable
14:11 - let's make a new variable
14:13 - um and we'll just name it number of
14:15 - fruits
14:18 - and it's for all sprites let's find
14:23 - number of fruits
14:25 - and num number fruit we're going to do
14:27 - pick random one to four
14:31 - and a four
14:32 - and then we're going to repeat the
14:34 - number of times the number of fruits so
14:36 - we're going to repeat
14:38 - the number of fruits
14:40 - and then we're going to set the x
14:43 - position to negative 200 to 200 so we're
14:46 - going to set it to pick a random
14:47 - somewhere on
14:49 - here from like here to here
14:51 - so we're going to
14:52 - set
14:53 - uh
14:54 - the x
14:58 - to pick random negative 200 to 200
15:05 - and then we're going to
15:07 - set the y to negative 170 so it starts
15:09 - down here so the fruits will start all
15:11 - the way in the bottom
15:14 - and then it will try to like it will
15:16 - come up and then stop at one point and
15:18 - go back down like an upside down
15:19 - parabola so it will go like boom and
15:21 - then it'll go back down so
15:23 - it'll be like that and we're gonna make
15:25 - it some new variables we're gonna name
15:27 - them
15:28 - x velocity so
15:30 - you need to make this with the sprite
15:31 - only so
15:33 - for the sprite line
15:35 - make another one y velocity y
15:38 - velocity for the sprite only as well
15:41 - so we're going to set the x velocity so
15:44 - basically
15:45 - we're going to set
15:47 - x velocity
15:50 - all right so we're going to get a
15:52 - negative one multiplied
15:54 - so the negative one is to make it so
15:57 - let's say the fruits on this side it
15:58 - comes up it's going to end up on the
16:00 - other side to make like a little arch
16:02 - parabola so that's what we want we want
16:05 - it to be like that
16:06 - so we're just going to put the negative
16:08 - 1 in there and then we're going to
16:09 - multiply it so we're going to addition
16:11 - sign
16:12 - multiply addition and then we're getting
16:14 - the x position divided by 50. so what
16:16 - this does is give it a little more
16:17 - variability so let's say you get
16:20 - uh
16:21 - so we could just set so 200 divided by 5
16:24 - is 4 50 is 4 sorry so we could set this
16:27 - to negative 4 to 4 but we want to make
16:29 - it vary a little bit more so we're going
16:31 - to do the exposition divide by 5.
16:34 - so
16:36 - x position divide by five so we could
16:38 - have some decimals like
16:39 - maybe like a
16:41 - 3.563 or whatever it could be something
16:43 - like that
16:44 - so we just want to make it vary a little
16:46 - bit so
16:47 - it'll be a little bit more randomized
16:48 - you know
16:49 - it'll make the your overall game look
16:51 - better so we're going to do the x
16:52 - position divide by
16:55 - this position divide by 50
16:58 - and we're going to add it to pick random
17:00 - negative two to two so we're going to
17:02 - add another negative 2
17:04 - to 2 piconet
17:08 - even give it more variable like vary so
17:11 - vary even more
17:12 - um
17:14 - and then next we're going to put this
17:17 - all into here
17:19 - so we get this one big chunk of code and
17:21 - then we're going to get this set the y
17:23 - velocity
17:26 - and then we're going to set it to pick
17:27 - random 22 to 25
17:30 - grand 22 to 25
17:34 - and then we're gonna make another
17:36 - variable we're gonna name it rotation
17:38 - speed so this is how the
17:40 - fruits are gonna rotate and it has to be
17:42 - for the sprite only as well
17:44 - so we're gonna make the fruits rotate as
17:46 - they come up so
17:47 - so we're gonna
17:48 - set rotation speed
17:52 - rotation speed and then we're going to
17:55 - pick random negative
17:58 - three uh to three
18:01 - so it's gonna
18:02 - rotate speed negative three to three
18:04 - we'll have to plug in somewhere later
18:07 - and then we're gonna set the uh random
18:10 - fruit uh we're gonna make another
18:12 - variable just name it random fruits
18:14 - number
18:20 - random fruit number
18:21 - um
18:22 - random fruit number uh will be for this
18:26 - for all sprites actually so
18:28 - you can just keep it for all sprites
18:31 - and then
18:32 - with the random fruit number we're going
18:34 - to set random fruit number
18:39 - and then we're going to make it pick
18:40 - random one to five
18:44 - and then we're gonna switch the costume
18:46 - to random fruit number so basically
18:47 - it'll just switch from one to five so
18:50 - it'll be random fruits every time so
18:53 - we're gonna switch the costume
18:55 - switch costume
18:56 - random fruit number
19:00 - and then we're going to create a clone
19:01 - of myself
19:04 - there we go
19:07 - and next we're going to when to start as
19:09 - a clone
19:10 - so we're going to set our size to 100
19:12 - because we have a bomb so basically if
19:14 - you cut a bomb will like make the bomb
19:16 - big to make it look explode in your face
19:18 - so that's why we're going to make it set
19:19 - to 100 in the beginning
19:21 - so and then we're going to make it show
19:22 - after that and then repeat until
19:28 - repeat until
19:29 - uh y position is less than negative 170.
19:32 - so you have to repeat until the fruit
19:33 - goes under here
19:35 - so repeat until
19:37 - it's less than
19:39 - so y position
19:43 - is less than negative 170
19:47 - and we're going to change the y velocity
19:49 - by negative one
19:51 - so it will go down
19:53 - our velocity by negative one
19:56 - and then after that we're going to
19:57 - change the y by y velocity and we're
19:59 - also going to change the x by x velocity
20:03 - change x
20:04 - so the change in x and change in y will
20:06 - be based on the y and x velocity so
20:09 - we're going to get the y velocity and
20:11 - the x velocity right there so now we
20:13 - have both of them and we're going to use
20:15 - the rotation speed now so we're going to
20:16 - make them turn
20:18 - the rotation speed
20:21 - rotation speed
20:23 - and then next we're going to make it so
20:25 - if it's touching the color of the slice
20:29 - so we're going to get if then statement
20:30 - so if
20:33 - if it's touching the color
20:37 - we're going to show this again once
20:39 - again we're going to show it
20:40 - and we're going to select the blue color
20:43 - so if it's touching that's then we're
20:45 - going to get an if
20:46 - else
20:48 - if
20:52 - if a
20:54 - constant number is equal to 5 which is
20:56 - the bomb
20:57 - so if the costume number
21:00 - is equal to the five which is the bomb
21:03 - then we're going to start sound we're
21:06 - gonna make us let's see alien creek yeah
21:08 - we have to start this sound just sounds
21:09 - like this
21:11 - so we're gonna put that in and then
21:13 - we're gonna repeat 10 times so that's
21:14 - where we make it change size and make it
21:16 - like explode in your face
21:18 - repeat 10 times and change the size
21:23 - by
21:24 - 30 so it'll sum
21:27 - sum up to 300 in size so we get that and
21:30 - then we're going to broadcast a message
21:32 - and we're going to name it end game so
21:34 - basically if you cut a bomb then you
21:36 - lose
21:38 - end game
21:40 - and then next if the cost number is less
21:43 - than five
21:44 - meaning you did not slice a bomb
21:47 - so we're gonna get else
21:50 - if
21:51 - inside the l so if
21:54 - positive number is less than five
21:58 - costume number less than five
22:01 - then we are going to start some pop
22:05 - with the pop sound
22:06 - i think everyone has the pops on yeah
22:08 - there it is pop
22:10 - we're gonna use the pop sound and then
22:11 - we're gonna change the score by one
22:14 - change score by one and we're going to
22:17 - switch the costume so yeah this is what
22:19 - why we need it in order so let's say
22:22 - the random fruit is banana so
22:24 - basically we're going to make it so we
22:26 - switch the costume to the costume number
22:28 - plus five so let's say the costume
22:30 - number is two we're gonna plus five one
22:32 - two three four five so we're gonna end
22:33 - up in bananas with the cut so it works
22:36 - for any of them let's say you pick
22:37 - watermelon one two three four five
22:40 - you also end up there so this is why you
22:42 - need an order
22:43 - so we're going to switch the costume
22:47 - switch costume to costume number plus
22:50 - five it'll make it much easier that's
22:52 - why
22:53 - so you make sure to do that
22:55 - that's fine
22:58 - and next
22:59 - we're going to get an if then statement
23:01 - so if the costume number
23:03 - under everything so if
23:05 - cost new number is less than five we can
23:08 - just copy that
23:09 - then we're going to
23:11 - broadcast missed fruit
23:19 - new message i'm gonna name it missed
23:21 - fruit
23:24 - and we're going to delete this clone at
23:26 - the end
23:27 - so basically
23:29 - cost a number less than five
23:32 - any of these
23:33 - and it's not cut
23:34 - at all then we're gonna broadcast missed
23:36 - fruit
23:37 - so i'm gonna zoom out and show you guys
23:39 - the whole code
23:41 - make sure you have all of this
23:46 - pause if you'd like to see all the code
23:48 - okay so we have all the fruits code now
23:52 - let's go on to our lives
23:54 - so our lives basically it's like fruit
23:55 - ninja you know how they have the x's so
23:58 - we have like three blue ones
24:00 - and then when you one fruit falls to the
24:02 - bottom we're gonna make one red
24:04 - two falls to the bottom we get two red
24:06 - and then if all of them fall then all of
24:08 - them some bread
24:10 - so we're going to wanna when i receive
24:14 - start game
24:16 - so let me you start game we're going to
24:18 - switch the costume
24:19 - to three lives which is the first one
24:22 - and we're going to show so in the
24:23 - beginning you'll have all your lives and
24:26 - in the beginning we're going to hide
24:29 - and when i receive start get start
24:31 - screen sorry uh start screen we are also
24:34 - going to hide so start screen
24:38 - we also want to hide it so
24:39 - there we have it
24:41 - and then when i receive mist fruit so if
24:43 - you miss a fruit
24:46 - then we will next costume so it will go
24:49 - to the next costume meaning that you
24:51 - lost life
24:52 - and if
24:54 - the costume number is equal to four
24:57 - meaning that you have no lives left then
24:59 - we're gonna end the game so
25:01 - if costume number is equal to four
25:05 - get the costume number
25:07 - equal to four then we're gonna broadcast
25:09 - endgame
25:12 - all right
25:13 - and then finally we have the white fade
25:16 - background so let's say you lose it'll
25:18 - just fade into white
25:20 - so
25:21 - first let's hide all of these variables
25:24 - and just hide everything for now except
25:26 - for the score and
25:29 - let me hide the
25:31 - list as well
25:33 - we can keep the score okay
25:36 - and you'll hide that
25:38 - okay now we have one more
25:40 - basically it's just a white square we're
25:42 - gonna make it real quick
25:43 - so basically when you lose it'll just
25:45 - show up make the game look much better
25:48 - so we're just gonna draw a white
25:50 - rectangle i guess
25:53 - that just
25:55 - like that white rectangle
25:56 - so when i receive
26:00 - when i receive start screen we're going
26:02 - to hide
26:03 - in the beginning
26:06 - and when i receive end game so when you
26:08 - lose
26:09 - at any point we're going to make it go
26:10 - to the origin which is zero zero
26:14 - and we're going to set the ghost effect
26:16 - to 100
26:17 - and
26:19 - accept the ghost effect
26:24 - my brightness goes to 100
26:28 - so ghost effect to 100 and we're going
26:30 - to make it go to the front layer
26:33 - and show so then we're going to show it
26:35 - and then we'll repeat 10 times and then
26:37 - we're gonna decrease the ghost effect
26:38 - until it becomes zero
26:40 - and then you can see it so
26:42 - we're gonna
26:43 - do that and then we're gonna change the
26:45 - ghost effect
26:47 - by negative ten
26:48 - ten times
26:50 - and then we're gonna wait one second
26:55 - and we're gonna start do start screen
26:57 - again so once you die it'll bring you
26:59 - back to the
27:01 - main screen
27:02 - okay
27:03 - okay so i forgot to add one last bit of
27:06 - code here so inside the fruit
27:08 - you have to want to receive end game
27:11 - we're going to stop other scripts in the
27:12 - sprite
27:16 - stop other scripts in the sprite
27:19 - and we're going to delete this clone
27:21 - this part is
27:23 - what when we uh it's basically when you
27:25 - switch when you get to the begin when
27:27 - you slice the begin button it'll switch
27:28 - to another screen the game screen which
27:30 - is this one
27:32 - uh so it's just a cutting board and the
27:33 - other one's like the loading screen i
27:35 - guess like the main menu so we're gonna
27:37 - add that real quick so let's go in here
27:39 - and then
27:40 - right here when we start game when i
27:43 - receive start games when the game is
27:44 - starting
27:45 - then we're going to switch the costume
27:48 - to the game screen
27:50 - so we're going to save the project and
27:52 - we'll go full screen
27:54 - so as you can see start on the fruit
27:56 - ninja main menu
27:59 - so slice the begin button as you can see
28:01 - the fruits pop up
28:03 - and if you have more if you lose all
28:05 - your lives and the game ends
28:08 - i'm also going to slice a bomb
28:11 - that happens then you also lose
28:15 - also we want to change something up here
28:17 - because as you can see when you um like
28:20 - when you lose
28:21 - just the fruits um it doesn't go back to
28:24 - the main menu it just stays on the game
28:26 - screen
28:27 - so what you can do is just switch to
28:29 - take this out and when you broadcast it
28:31 - you'll just do that so if you want to do
28:33 - that that's fine if you want to do
28:35 - either one and right here we're gonna
28:37 - have to do search into the start screen
28:40 - and we have to receive start screen as
28:43 - well
28:44 - and then basically and then we just
28:46 - duplicate this again
28:47 - we also have to keep the old script so
28:49 - we get to start game
28:50 - and the game screen so we also have to
28:52 - keep that
28:53 - so
28:55 - basically this is just so if you want to
28:57 - keep making go back to the main menu
28:58 - after you lose
29:00 - you can it's fine as either way it's
29:02 - still fine
29:04 - so as you can see when you lose you go
29:06 - to the main menu with the fruit ninja
29:08 - and all that
29:10 - so we're missing one last thing which is
29:12 - the high score so we can add high score
29:14 - into this game um it's fairly simple so
29:17 - we're going to make a new variable and
29:19 - we're just going to make it for all
29:20 - sprites cloud variable and we're going
29:22 - to name it my score
29:24 - high score
29:26 - and then with the high score we're going
29:27 - to get an if then statement
29:30 - under here
29:31 - we're going to get if
29:33 - high score is less than
29:37 - uh score so if the high score is less
29:39 - than the score
29:40 - or the score is greater than the high
29:41 - score then we're going to set the high
29:43 - score to the score
29:46 - so we're going to do the high score look
29:47 - right here
29:48 - okay
29:49 - save and let's go
29:55 - so i just say the bomb let's just try
29:58 - again i just want to get some score
30:00 - as you can see
30:05 - when you lose it'll set this your
30:07 - highest score to the
30:09 - uh high score as you can see yeah okay
30:11 - so that's pretty much it thank you guys
30:13 - for watching don't forget to like share
30:15 - and subscribe and ring the notification
30:18 - bell and i'll see you guys in the next
30:19 - video

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here today we'll be making a fruit ninja game in scratch so um fruit ninja is probably one of the oldest mobile games there is on the app store um i still remember playing this game as a child so we have recreated it in scratch for you guys to play um so basically it's pretty much like the original one um there's the begin button so you can slice as you can see you slice the begin button you go into the game so you slice the fruits and when you hit a bomb then you lose and um also if you uh let the fruits go then you'll lose lives as you can see you're gonna lose lives and when you lose all three of your lives you will also lose so there's two ways to lose hitting a bomb and also letting three fruits fall so yeah that's pretty much the game we have and then so now let's go start a new project okay so in our new project we're deleting our scratch cat obviously and i have some sprites so we have the lives so these are the x's and we have the fruits and then we have the costumes for the backdrop so we have the this backdrop like the loading the main menu and we have the game screen which is like the cutting board and we just got these images from online on google you can just download your own on google or you can just export it straight from my project i have it shared or you can uh use our google drive but if you don't know how to use your google drive just go to our project and one last reminder for google drive uh don't use your school account and you'll never need to request access for a google drive you'll always be able to use it for sprites okay and then that's it for the sprites and let's go start in the backdrop so in the backdrop we have a few lines of code so let's go to the code so one green flag clicked we are going to once again so we're going to make a new variable we're going to name it score so we'll need to score also um i don't know why the pen is already here um but to get the pen extension you have to click that button down there and click the pen um because i started the game with that so that's why the pen is there um so just remember to click the extensions to get the pen okay and so we're gonna set the score to zero in the beginning and then we're gonna switch the backdrop to the start screen which is our first one this one so we're gonna name it start screen and then we're gonna broadcast the message and we're gonna name it start screen so this is the beginning starting of the game and then uh we're going to go to our so now we are going to get our begin button so we're going to just get the button one use this and then send the costume we're going to use this text i guess whatever and then we're going to write begin so then you can just use the select tool put it right here shrink it a little bit maybe that's the perfect size and then we just copy paste it up there and then we can just oops we can just take this and then we can just use the rotate you hold down the shift so you can get a perfect rotation and put it like that so that you've got yourself a basic begin button and we're going to group it so then it'll all be together the center okay so we have our begin button let's go code in it so inside the code it's just gonna be pretty simple so when green if i click we're going to go to this x and y position i'm going to pick 0 uh negative 120 that's what i had before and then we're going to go to the events when i receive start screen we're going to click the show so in the beginning it's going to show up and then forever it's going to go turn 2 degrees so we're going to make it just basically keep on turning in the beginning so we're going to turn 2 degrees and then if and then uh we're going to get a new sprite so basically um we want it so if you cut like slices it will begin the game so we're going to get a we're just going to like draw a box this is just so we can select the tool use the select tool to select the color so this will be the like the trail of the slice so i guess we can get like some light blue color doesn't really matter or maybe like that like that color that color looks fine um and then we're going to just no outline just draw a regular square hold down shift if you would like center it and there you go you've got the square so we're just going to rename this to the slice and so next we're going to go back to the button and then inside the button we're going to let's hide this right now i actually know we have to show it to select it so um we're going to if touching so we're just gonna use this thing get the color so if it's touching that color then we're going to hide the button because you're basically slicing it and then we're gonna broadcast a message called start game which starts the game so we're going to make a new variable and name it start game start the game and then we're going to stop the script once um you've entered the game so stop the script okay so now we have the begin button let's hide this and obviously we have to click this a green flag and then and right now it will not work obviously because we have to make the trail for the mouse as you can see there is no trail so we have to make the trail so inside the slice let's hop into the slice sprites and then we're going to start coding in here so we're going to have to make two lists just for the sprites one for the slice x and one for the slice y so slice x for the sprite only and slice y for the sprite only as well so basically this will keep track of where the x and y position of the mouse is so it can create a trail so we have the two lists let's get a one green flag clicked so when preflight clicks we are going to delete all of both delete both all of both slice x and slice y and then forever we're going to get a forever loop so if we're going to get an if so if mouse down if you're clicking down mouse down then we're going to add um we're going to add a mouse x to the list so it's going to add mouse x to the slice x list and then we're going to add another one add instead of slice x we're doing slice y so we're going to instead when this is that then we're going to get a mouse y so add mouse y to the list so now when you like mouse down it will add something to the list as you can see it will add as much to the list so yeah basically when you're slicing it will keep track of where your mouse is so it will create another trail okay and then if we're getting another if if um length of slice x is greater than four or not mouse down so we're going to get this or and then so if it's greater than four so we're only going to limit to so it's only going to be four x and y values at a time so we're going to use the greater than so if the length of the length of slice x is greater than four uh or not mouse down then we're gonna delete so basically if you're not mouse down it will also delete so mouse down then we're also going to delete one of both so delete one of slice x and one of slice y so we don't need to make another whole script for this for slice y because we're already doing this so we just delete one from both so as you can see it's empty you click it'll only limit you to four but as you can see when you click randomly the x and y values change and if you let go it will delete so that's what we want we only wanted to limit to four and then we're going to get another one green flag clicked and then we're going to get a hide so when it's in the beginning we're going to hide and then inside the pen remember at the extension we're going to erase all in the beginning and then we're gonna set the pen color to the slice so we're gonna show the slice and select the color and then we're going to set the pen size to six so the slice will be six thickness and i'm gonna make a new my block so we're gonna make it my block we're gonna name it draw slice okay and click okay draw slice and then basically we're to define it so basically it's going to basically like when you like drag it will draw the slice so we're going to just erase all in the beginning if so if the length of slice x is greater than zero so that means there are something inside the list of slice x so we're gonna get a greater than zero if the length of slice x and the slice x is greater than zero then we're going to pen up and then we're going to set the x and y values to the slice x and slice y the item one the first item so wherever they first start dragging it's going to set it to the x and y value so we're going to go to so we're going to go to um item we're going to get the item item 1 of slice x and we're gonna get item one of slice y so we're gonna use the first two and then we're gonna pen down so we're gonna start drawing after that and then we're gonna set the index to two so we're gonna make a new variable we're gonna name it index so basically the index is it'll keep on going up the list through the list um and it'll keep on adding the x and y values so basically f this is index one so we're going to set the index to two because this is the first one setting next to two and then we're going to repeat until the index is greater than slice x and repeat until the index is greater than slice x index is greater than slice x bigger than where it's not length of slice x sorry um that took a while all right so index has to be greater than length of slicex and then we're going to go to we're going to go to the item index of slice x and we're going to go to the item index of slice y so we're going to go to wherever the index is during in the slice x so basically it's going to repeat until the index goes over four and then because we limit it to four so we're gonna go to the item of slice x and item of slice y and reset the index like that and then we're going to change the index by one so you will go through the list change index by one and then we're going to pin up i feel like we're going to pen up uh stop drawing i'm going to pin up and then right here we have to obviously um oops we have to like call this function for it to do something so we're going to use forever control slice all right so now we can play as you can see the y and x values have been changing and now you have like a trail so you can see and when you slice it the begin button hides see that and now you have a simple trail okay so we have our slice let's move on to our fruits so basically in our fruits in the costumes what we did was we got the fruits from the sprite library the bomb bushes from online just downloaded random bomb from online doesn't really matter so all these fruits are from the sprite library and this has to be in order so as you can see one two three four five and then we go back to the apple so you see that go back to the apple banana orange watermelon it has to be in the same order and i'll explain why after okay so just put them in order and basically for the apple what we do is we convert to bitmap and we use this tool like drag so okay let me just like duplicate this to show you so what we do convert to bitmap use this tool and we do that and then we just remove it and maybe like rotate it a little bit and boom now you've got yourself a sliced apple so i think you guys get the idea so basically that's what you do for each one of them um until you get to the last one don't worry about the bomb but just do all of that um it has to be in order just remember that okay and then so basically in the fruits we're going to start with the one group like clicks and green black we're going to hide and we're going to want to receive start game so when you like slice the begin button then you're going to get a forever loop forever wait one second and then we're going to set the number of roots quick random one to four so the maximum amount of fruits you can have on the board is four four or less so we're gonna get a new variable let's make a new variable um and we'll just name it number of fruits and it's for all sprites let's find number of fruits and num number fruit we're going to do pick random one to four and a four and then we're going to repeat the number of times the number of fruits so we're going to repeat the number of fruits and then we're going to set the x position to negative 200 to 200 so we're going to set it to pick a random somewhere on here from like here to here so we're going to set uh the x to pick random negative 200 to 200 and then we're going to set the y to negative 170 so it starts down here so the fruits will start all the way in the bottom and then it will try to like it will come up and then stop at one point and go back down like an upside down parabola so it will go like boom and then it'll go back down so it'll be like that and we're gonna make it some new variables we're gonna name them x velocity so you need to make this with the sprite only so for the sprite line make another one y velocity y velocity for the sprite only as well so we're going to set the x velocity so basically we're going to set x velocity all right so we're going to get a negative one multiplied so the negative one is to make it so let's say the fruits on this side it comes up it's going to end up on the other side to make like a little arch parabola so that's what we want we want it to be like that so we're just going to put the negative 1 in there and then we're going to multiply it so we're going to addition sign multiply addition and then we're getting the x position divided by 50. so what this does is give it a little more variability so let's say you get uh so we could just set so 200 divided by 5 is 4 50 is 4 sorry so we could set this to negative 4 to 4 but we want to make it vary a little bit more so we're going to do the exposition divide by 5. so x position divide by five so we could have some decimals like maybe like a 3.563 or whatever it could be something like that so we just want to make it vary a little bit so it'll be a little bit more randomized you know it'll make the your overall game look better so we're going to do the x position divide by this position divide by 50 and we're going to add it to pick random negative two to two so we're going to add another negative 2 to 2 piconet even give it more variable like vary so vary even more um and then next we're going to put this all into here so we get this one big chunk of code and then we're going to get this set the y velocity and then we're going to set it to pick random 22 to 25 grand 22 to 25 and then we're gonna make another variable we're gonna name it rotation speed so this is how the fruits are gonna rotate and it has to be for the sprite only as well so we're gonna make the fruits rotate as they come up so so we're gonna set rotation speed rotation speed and then we're going to pick random negative three uh to three so it's gonna rotate speed negative three to three we'll have to plug in somewhere later and then we're gonna set the uh random fruit uh we're gonna make another variable just name it random fruits number random fruit number um random fruit number uh will be for this for all sprites actually so you can just keep it for all sprites and then with the random fruit number we're going to set random fruit number and then we're going to make it pick random one to five and then we're gonna switch the costume to random fruit number so basically it'll just switch from one to five so it'll be random fruits every time so we're gonna switch the costume switch costume random fruit number and then we're going to create a clone of myself there we go and next we're going to when to start as a clone so we're going to set our size to 100 because we have a bomb so basically if you cut a bomb will like make the bomb big to make it look explode in your face so that's why we're going to make it set to 100 in the beginning so and then we're going to make it show after that and then repeat until repeat until uh y position is less than negative 170. so you have to repeat until the fruit goes under here so repeat until it's less than so y position is less than negative 170 and we're going to change the y velocity by negative one so it will go down our velocity by negative one and then after that we're going to change the y by y velocity and we're also going to change the x by x velocity change x so the change in x and change in y will be based on the y and x velocity so we're going to get the y velocity and the x velocity right there so now we have both of them and we're going to use the rotation speed now so we're going to make them turn the rotation speed rotation speed and then next we're going to make it so if it's touching the color of the slice so we're going to get if then statement so if if it's touching the color we're going to show this again once again we're going to show it and we're going to select the blue color so if it's touching that's then we're going to get an if else if if a constant number is equal to 5 which is the bomb so if the costume number is equal to the five which is the bomb then we're going to start sound we're gonna make us let's see alien creek yeah we have to start this sound just sounds like this so we're gonna put that in and then we're gonna repeat 10 times so that's where we make it change size and make it like explode in your face repeat 10 times and change the size by 30 so it'll sum sum up to 300 in size so we get that and then we're going to broadcast a message and we're going to name it end game so basically if you cut a bomb then you lose end game and then next if the cost number is less than five meaning you did not slice a bomb so we're gonna get else if inside the l so if positive number is less than five costume number less than five then we are going to start some pop with the pop sound i think everyone has the pops on yeah there it is pop we're gonna use the pop sound and then we're gonna change the score by one change score by one and we're going to switch the costume so yeah this is what why we need it in order so let's say the random fruit is banana so basically we're going to make it so we switch the costume to the costume number plus five so let's say the costume number is two we're gonna plus five one two three four five so we're gonna end up in bananas with the cut so it works for any of them let's say you pick watermelon one two three four five you also end up there so this is why you need an order so we're going to switch the costume switch costume to costume number plus five it'll make it much easier that's why so you make sure to do that that's fine and next we're going to get an if then statement so if the costume number under everything so if cost new number is less than five we can just copy that then we're going to broadcast missed fruit new message i'm gonna name it missed fruit and we're going to delete this clone at the end so basically cost a number less than five any of these and it's not cut at all then we're gonna broadcast missed fruit so i'm gonna zoom out and show you guys the whole code make sure you have all of this pause if you'd like to see all the code okay so we have all the fruits code now let's go on to our lives so our lives basically it's like fruit ninja you know how they have the x's so we have like three blue ones and then when you one fruit falls to the bottom we're gonna make one red two falls to the bottom we get two red and then if all of them fall then all of them some bread so we're going to wanna when i receive start game so let me you start game we're going to switch the costume to three lives which is the first one and we're going to show so in the beginning you'll have all your lives and in the beginning we're going to hide and when i receive start get start screen sorry uh start screen we are also going to hide so start screen we also want to hide it so there we have it and then when i receive mist fruit so if you miss a fruit then we will next costume so it will go to the next costume meaning that you lost life and if the costume number is equal to four meaning that you have no lives left then we're gonna end the game so if costume number is equal to four get the costume number equal to four then we're gonna broadcast endgame all right and then finally we have the white fade background so let's say you lose it'll just fade into white so first let's hide all of these variables and just hide everything for now except for the score and let me hide the list as well we can keep the score okay and you'll hide that okay now we have one more basically it's just a white square we're gonna make it real quick so basically when you lose it'll just show up make the game look much better so we're just gonna draw a white rectangle i guess that just like that white rectangle so when i receive when i receive start screen we're going to hide in the beginning and when i receive end game so when you lose at any point we're going to make it go to the origin which is zero zero and we're going to set the ghost effect to 100 and accept the ghost effect my brightness goes to 100 so ghost effect to 100 and we're going to make it go to the front layer and show so then we're going to show it and then we'll repeat 10 times and then we're gonna decrease the ghost effect until it becomes zero and then you can see it so we're gonna do that and then we're gonna change the ghost effect by negative ten ten times and then we're gonna wait one second and we're gonna start do start screen again so once you die it'll bring you back to the main screen okay okay so i forgot to add one last bit of code here so inside the fruit you have to want to receive end game we're going to stop other scripts in the sprite stop other scripts in the sprite and we're going to delete this clone this part is what when we uh it's basically when you switch when you get to the begin when you slice the begin button it'll switch to another screen the game screen which is this one uh so it's just a cutting board and the other one's like the loading screen i guess like the main menu so we're gonna add that real quick so let's go in here and then right here when we start game when i receive start games when the game is starting then we're going to switch the costume to the game screen so we're going to save the project and we'll go full screen so as you can see start on the fruit ninja main menu so slice the begin button as you can see the fruits pop up and if you have more if you lose all your lives and the game ends i'm also going to slice a bomb that happens then you also lose also we want to change something up here because as you can see when you um like when you lose just the fruits um it doesn't go back to the main menu it just stays on the game screen so what you can do is just switch to take this out and when you broadcast it you'll just do that so if you want to do that that's fine if you want to do either one and right here we're gonna have to do search into the start screen and we have to receive start screen as well and then basically and then we just duplicate this again we also have to keep the old script so we get to start game and the game screen so we also have to keep that so basically this is just so if you want to keep making go back to the main menu after you lose you can it's fine as either way it's still fine so as you can see when you lose you go to the main menu with the fruit ninja and all that so we're missing one last thing which is the high score so we can add high score into this game um it's fairly simple so we're going to make a new variable and we're just going to make it for all sprites cloud variable and we're going to name it my score high score and then with the high score we're going to get an if then statement under here we're going to get if high score is less than uh score so if the high score is less than the score or the score is greater than the high score then we're going to set the high score to the score so we're going to do the high score look right here okay save and let's go so i just say the bomb let's just try again i just want to get some score as you can see when you lose it'll set this your highest score to the uh high score as you can see yeah okay so that's pretty much it thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe and ring the notification bell and i'll see you guys in the next video
