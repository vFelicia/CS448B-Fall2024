00:08 - hello guys welcome back to kids calling
00:10 - playground
00:11 - so i haven't done a video uh lately so
00:13 - uh thought of doing one i think a lot of
00:15 - kids is asking how do you convert the uh
00:18 - scratch three project into an apk file
00:21 - so that you could install in the mobile
00:23 - device like a phone or something so i'll
00:25 - show you how to do that so today i'm
00:27 - gonna try to uh show you that i'll do
00:29 - that so i'm going to use
00:30 - my kids up project this uh scrolling
00:32 - platformer
00:33 - so what you have to do is first you save
00:35 - it to your computer
00:37 - so when you download this it will save
00:38 - this to your computer
00:40 - so once you save this to your computer
00:41 - you'll find where the file is at
00:43 - let's say in the download folder or
00:45 - whatever right
00:47 - okay so i found my file and move it over
00:50 - here so let's just call it like uh case
00:52 - code playground
00:53 - this is my file so i put the sp3 file
00:56 - here which is the scratch file that i
00:58 - just downloaded okay
01:00 - so once you downloaded uh the file
01:04 - uh so what you have to do you have to go
01:05 - to uh oracle find the oracle so just
01:08 - type like
01:09 - search for jdk
01:13 - download 1.8 so something like this so
01:16 - you say like
01:17 - java jdk 1.8 okay
01:21 - so you go to like oracle site just like
01:23 - this one just what i had over here so
01:25 - basically you click on this
01:26 - you come to this page here so in this
01:29 - page
01:29 - uh what you have to do is you're gonna
01:31 - have to scroll down okay scroll down
01:33 - here
01:34 - you see uh it's only uh looking for jdk
01:36 - one eight so
01:37 - jdk one is an older version of java
01:40 - right now it's like 15
01:42 - so but uh i think the uh the uh that
01:45 - converter needs jdk 1a so that's why we
01:47 - use gdk1a
01:48 - so you can click on this link then
01:50 - download if you have window and if you
01:52 - have mac you have to download the mac
01:54 - one okay
01:55 - so you might need your parents to help
01:56 - you with this you need to have a google
01:58 - uh
01:59 - uh not google you have an oracle account
02:01 - so you have to create oracle account
02:02 - download this file and then when you
02:04 - have after you have downloaded this exe
02:06 - file
02:07 - what you do is just double click the exe
02:09 - file and it will install so since i
02:11 - already have java
02:12 - so i don't have to do this part so i'll
02:14 - show you how it looks like
02:16 - so i have a different version of java
02:18 - here i have 15 and
02:20 - one eight as well so it depends on where
02:22 - you want to
02:23 - save it i mean i save it into c coding c
02:26 - java but you can have it in your program
02:28 - file or something so this is how the
02:30 - after you install it should be somewhere
02:32 - in your in your project okay so
02:34 - something like this so as you can see if
02:37 - you click inside here it will show
02:38 - like something like this so what we're
02:41 - going to do is we are going to create
02:43 - java home to this location okay
02:46 - okay next uh you have to go to like pc
02:50 - uh right click on your pc property
02:53 - okay and then here you have to click on
02:55 - this advanced system
02:56 - setting uh event system setting here to
02:59 - go to your environment variable uh make
03:01 - sure
03:01 - that you have set up your java home
03:04 - where it is okay
03:05 - so uh something like this java home and
03:07 - then you have to have a path
03:08 - a path so when you edit it you see like
03:12 - java home
03:13 - the home location
03:16 - and then you have to have a path so the
03:18 - path is like
03:19 - uh java home bin whatever right the bin
03:22 - is
03:23 - added to the path so once you have all
03:24 - that uh
03:26 - what you can do is uh to test it what if
03:29 - it's working or not so you can say
03:31 - cmd open this
03:36 - okay in this thing you just type java
03:40 - version so you can see that you have the
03:43 - 1.8 version here installed so that's
03:45 - mean you're good
03:46 - okay
03:50 - okay so now that you have your java
03:52 - everything set up
03:53 - you have to go to this something called
03:55 - uh html
03:56 - uh lilifier so i'll give you the link
03:59 - below
04:00 - it's like shippedtest.github.io.htmlfire
04:04 - so here what you can do is this uh you
04:06 - can select
04:08 - you can even go to the scratch project
04:09 - and all that but you can just
04:11 - say choose and then you go to your apk
04:16 - and then i think i have it here right so
04:19 - just select this
04:21 - so once you select the file you see that
04:24 - jungle whatever
04:25 - scrolling platformer right so here you
04:27 - can put the name

04:43 - fill it up so
04:44 - once i got this one uh these like
04:46 - different options here compatible modes
04:48 - like
04:48 - uh two version two of scratch version
04:51 - three
04:52 - that's the turbo mode uh if you don't
04:54 - know how to do that don't don't check
04:55 - all this thing
04:57 - leave it like this uh it's fine you know
04:59 - full screen button
05:00 - if you want show the stop and stop
05:03 - button i didn't check it so we don't
05:05 - need it actually
05:05 - so we're going to convert this into a
05:07 - actual um
05:09 - apk file so leave kind of leave
05:11 - everything default and these are the uh
05:13 - the variable button if you want to
05:14 - change the color and all that
05:16 - so kind of leave things default should
05:19 - be okay
05:19 - and what you do is just click on this so
05:24 - what it does is downloaded a
05:25 - file like this okay so find this file it
05:28 - should be somewhere in your download
05:30 - folder
05:30 - okay okay so you find your file it
05:34 - should be in your download folder or
05:35 - something like that
05:36 - copy that over and drop it into your
05:38 - folder here
05:42 - okay so you see this file here so what
05:45 - you do is right click
05:46 - you have to actually rename the file so
05:49 - rename it
05:50 - to index.html
05:54 - okay so and then you can delete this
05:56 - file here actually delete this now
05:59 - delete and then to test it out you can
06:00 - double click on it so it should work
06:02 - so double click on this it should load
06:05 - so
06:05 - this is just like the game that you're
06:07 - playing right so you can select this and
06:09 - run
06:10 - send same thing right with the
06:13 - with the mouse or whatever i mean it
06:16 - jumps okay
06:17 - all right so this is look like this okay
06:19 - let's uh
06:20 - stop this for now so we'll close this so
06:22 - this looks
06:23 - fine uh we have the so basically we
06:26 - converted the
06:27 - scratch project to html5 then
06:30 - what you need to do you have to download
06:32 - a new software
06:33 - something called a website to apk
06:37 - so you can find that i'll leave a link
06:39 - description
06:40 - uh to do that okay okay so you have to
06:43 - go to this website uh website to apk
06:46 - android
06:47 - api builder and then just download the
06:49 - free version okay
06:50 - so after you download the free version
06:52 - install it i
06:54 - should be okay it doesn't have any virus
06:55 - or anything i checked it
06:57 - so once you download and install it
06:58 - you'll have something like this so you
07:00 - have something like this website to apk
07:02 - builder
07:03 - so what you have to do is i already made
07:05 - one earlier just to test it out
07:07 - so you can call it uh jungle
07:11 - platformer okay
07:15 - okay so you need to scroll down here and
07:17 - select the location where you want
07:18 - to go so you can say change and here
07:22 - uh just go to your apk go to the
07:26 - jungle platform okay so in jungle
07:29 - platformer i think i showed you earlier
07:31 - in jungle platform make sure you have
07:32 - something called index.html only one
07:34 - file in here
07:36 - okay and then you can change it wherever
07:38 - you want to go your output so this is my
07:40 - output so we'll create the uh
07:42 - file here okay so here and here i put it
07:45 - create
07:46 - output so somehow it will create a file
07:47 - here that's built
07:49 - after that you can leave these things
07:50 - kind of the same
07:52 - and then you can change the icon so the
07:55 - icon you need to have a
07:58 - a png file okay okay so i
08:01 - i i have to convert the svg file to png
08:04 - you see there's a backdrop i just
08:06 - i just extracted this one so i want this
08:08 - screen
08:09 - uh this is my thumbnail right so i'm
08:11 - going to put that as the uh
08:13 - application so what you have to do is
08:15 - you extract it it'll give you a file
08:17 - like this
08:18 - you have to go into um another website
08:22 - to convert this okay so you search up
08:26 - convert
08:27 - uh svg to png and select this one the
08:30 - cloud convert okay just go here
08:33 - then here you select the file that you
08:35 - want um
08:37 - that svg file right we have the svg file
08:41 - i think download okay select this
08:45 - so this is your svg file you want to
08:47 - convert to png just click convert
08:51 - oh exceed okay
08:55 - okay because it's free i guess they say
08:58 - you can only do
08:59 - daily limit is 10 but i only did one
09:02 - time but i don't know why
09:04 - that's kind of crazy okay so that did
09:07 - not allow us to convert let's just use
09:09 - another one
09:10 - we can just use this one i think it
09:12 - doesn't matter
09:13 - upload a file so let's just pick this
09:16 - again
09:18 - okay and then we're gonna convert to png
09:22 - download so
09:25 - okay we download the png file just uh
09:29 - you make sure that you you know where
09:30 - your png file is you can
09:32 - create you can put it in there so let's
09:34 - go back to this tool
09:37 - okay and here we'll change the icon
09:41 - so go back to the way you downloaded
09:48 - okay
09:50 - here uh just select this png file
09:53 - right so you have the icon here okay
09:56 - so now you have the icon ready you have
09:58 - this ready
09:59 - so make sure this one uh it goes to that
10:02 - folder right
10:03 - and then you can say landscape okay so
10:05 - here are the couple of
10:06 - options that usually uh default so i
10:08 - already unchecked so uncheck the
10:10 - zoom if you don't want to zoom like two
10:12 - finger zoom and then text selection you
10:14 - can uncheck that one
10:16 - and then uh here uh there's something
10:18 - called um
10:19 - show toolbar yeah uncheck that so that
10:22 - will help
10:23 - okay that's pretty much it if you want
10:24 - to take down this one confirmation you
10:26 - can
10:27 - but it doesn't really matter so let's
10:29 - see if it all works
10:30 - hopefully it works so let's click on
10:32 - generate
10:34 - so it will take some time to generate so
10:36 - let it finish
10:41 - so it'll take some time so once it's
10:43 - finished it will create the uh the file
10:45 - over there
10:46 - and then what you can do is upload that
10:48 - file to your google drive and then from
10:50 - your google drive you can
10:51 - just download to your phone okay and
10:54 - then you can install a new phone so say
10:55 - finish
10:56 - say finish so now you look into this
11:00 - folder you have something called jungle
11:02 - platformer right
11:03 - as well so you can upload to your google
11:05 - drive
11:08 - okay so you go to your google drive and
