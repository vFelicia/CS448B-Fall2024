00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - welcome back guys it's kids code and
00:08 - click right here and today we're back
00:10 - for another video well this is actually
00:12 - part two of the video of tower Smasher
00:15 - so I'm just gonna go rename the title
00:18 - first if you haven't watched part one
00:25 - please watch that right now and in part
00:27 - one we did all this code so this calls
00:31 - this and this cause this and this makes
00:34 - all the clones so so I'm going to move
00:38 - on to the ball we haven't even worked on
00:42 - the bull yet we have to make a new block
00:45 - move ball to stop and another block move
01:05 - so move ball to start is to move the
01:08 - ball over here and move balls to
01:10 - actually move it so let's do a go to
01:22 - let's you go to met to go to around here
01:26 - I think this would work maybe a little
01:29 - bit lower a little bit higher this is
01:33 - much higher I'm just gonna go delete
01:38 - this I think this is close enough maybe
01:42 - a little bit over here actually maybe ok
01:45 - so we have this you can set the ball to
01:50 - 50% so it's not that big it's not that
01:52 - cheap you know won't like it everything
01:55 - at once well if you want to be cheap you
01:58 - can do it but and we also have to set a
02:01 - speed horizontal speed to zero and we
02:05 - can duplicate that oopsies and choose
02:11 - just a V speed vertical speed and then
02:14 - we can also broadcast new message get
02:21 - ready so when I define move ball or
02:29 - change the X you also need changed x and
02:33 - y change X by each speed because it's
02:41 - horizontal speed and change Y by V speed
02:45 - that's vertical speed I'll change the
02:50 - the speed to give me a multiply sign to
03:00 - 0.99 H speed so I'll also set H speed
03:13 - I'm sorry that's actually right here on
03:16 - B speed XP
03:20 - so I'm on the sternest at each speed
03:23 - give this back it's a check at H speed
03:27 - speed speed right there and then a V
03:30 - speed is on top we can put that on top
03:33 - if you want to be speed is negative zero
03:37 - point if then touching the color see if
03:51 - that's not to be the red color just take
03:56 - the brown color this is a simple just a
03:58 - little bit different
03:59 - I'll set the V speed to multiply sine
04:12 - negative 0.8 these be so this H speed
04:28 - and V speed so I did something wrong
04:33 - right here
04:34 - it's actually back it's just actually
04:38 - set it just means actually changed that
04:44 - if you change V speed and this one's
04:47 - actually set a new speed let's just take
04:49 - this house when we could save it set B
04:56 - speed
05:04 - it's actually net negative zero point to
05:07 - what I did earlier so this is supposed
05:12 - to make like when you watch it's gonna
05:13 - be really quick and then it's gonna fall
05:15 - down gradually and get slower so it's
05:19 - supposed to be each speed okay let's
05:24 - move on so we're still working on the
05:27 - ball we can minimize one do not minimize
05:30 - make it smaller so why not when the
05:34 - green flag is clicked just set this
05:37 - score to zero
05:37 - it's simple enough they'll set lunches
05:42 - to 20 so you only get 20 lunches before
05:46 - you lose 20 lunches it'll move balls
05:51 - start like it runs this code and then
05:58 - when I receive complete game they'll say
06:04 - you have to take this one not say for
06:06 - two seconds because it might be a really
06:08 - big number so it'll say you showing
06:11 - because you'll join the two together you
06:13 - score comfort space you score a you
06:19 - score the amount that you scored so you
06:21 - gotta put a score so this will make it
06:26 - so it won't go away like if you put two
06:28 - two seconds that means they'll go away
06:31 - in two seconds so it's move on to if you
06:34 - lose so when the green flag is clicked
06:41 - well go forever then if then loop the
06:48 - launch is equals you'll need greater
06:51 - than or less than because it takes like
06:52 - a time for it to launch again so zero
06:56 - lunches it'll stop all you need forever
07:00 - remember that so it'll keep on going
07:05 - rows in the beginning you'll just stop
07:07 - not really stop but oh just do it once
07:10 - so then we also have to work on the
07:13 - arrow
07:14 - so you can see all this code if if you
07:18 - miss some code you can be sure to pause
07:20 - the video and let's work on the arrow
07:24 - it's the arrow when the green flag is
07:28 - clicked either the pen it's inside this
07:31 - a block thing that you can pick I
07:33 - already have pen already set up and then
07:37 - I'll set the pen color to any color you
07:40 - want I'm gonna use yellow and then
07:44 - you'll set pen size to 15 that's pretty
07:51 - thick and they'll show go forever
08:00 - well risk if we erase everything and
08:07 - it'll go to X this thing so you have to
08:12 - use the backdrop up stage actually two
08:15 - of them and then you always have to
08:18 - change the back first so you can put
08:21 - ball
08:21 - don't go exposition of the ball and all
08:24 - you also need this ball but you need the
08:28 - Y position is this in the Y section oh
08:32 - good and that's pointer will point
08:41 - towards ball what is that point words
08:47 - bowl
08:50 - it'll turn the 480 degrees and then when
08:57 - this sprite is clicked it will broadcast
09:02 - fire you broadcast message though show
09:10 - up hide pen up and then when I receive
09:18 - get ready
09:24 - show and pen down so let's try it up
09:34 - do you see look there's like a little
09:36 - thing doesn't want yet not don't the
09:39 - code yet but we can move on to it's
09:42 - another for the ball bull has another
09:44 - chunk of code so when I receive fire
09:49 - because that's what got them the arrow
09:52 - or reset the timer but so reset timer
10:01 - you have change launches by minus
10:06 - negative also set I'll tell you what the
10:14 - reset timer is for later but now let's
10:17 - focus on this set h gap - you need to -
10:25 - actually but actually one for the other
10:27 - one so that one - it's - Mouse X Y also
10:34 - here Mouse Y for the next one now so X
10:37 - and no x position
10:42 - - x position and I can just duplicate
10:45 - this I guess yes that could work
10:48 - V gap instead and then noce y instead
10:53 - oh yeah I need this and then go to this
10:59 - and take Y position instead of
11:04 - exposition the gap is to define the
11:09 - where the your mouse is in the ball is
11:12 - so also let's just keep on moving on a
11:16 - set H speed to divide each gap is to
11:30 - figure how much each gap
11:34 - and three so if you just duplicate this
11:38 - it's really easy but instead changes to
11:42 - these speed I change this to VCAT by 30
11:52 - so this is 4 but like a decent paste but
11:57 - if you want to make this like 20 and
11:59 - this 20 that means this will go like 20
12:03 - I'll go quicker and if you make it like
12:06 - a larger number I'll ghost
12:07 - um I'll go slower so let's keep on
12:11 - continuing repeat until you need a
12:20 - greater then go sign you up or put this
12:27 - inside 5 seconds and put timer so the
12:35 - timers for it'll go until 5 seconds so
12:37 - keep on moving until 5 seconds or it's
12:40 - touching the edge you'll automatically
12:42 - go it's touching to the edge you'll
12:45 - automatically go oh move the ball so the
12:49 - timer is 4 so we have to put the move
12:54 - ball to start afterwards so if it's if
12:57 - the timer is greater than 5 don't go
12:59 - back to the start it or if it's touching
13:01 - the edge you'll go back to the stock oh
13:03 - so just keep on moving just first remove
13:07 - all the variables Bam Bam Bam Bam
13:11 - except to score you can keep that one
13:13 - you see her scored we can move it more
13:15 - off so as you can see the timer actually
13:19 - works like 1 2 3 4 5 or might count
13:23 - longer and they'll go back there or if
13:25 - it's touching the edge it'll go and you
13:30 - can also hit these things you always
13:32 - also get you score I I've wasted 2
13:35 - lunches earlier so I can also show you
13:39 - what happens when you lose
13:44 - so we can set these lunches to to save
13:47 - up to so that's gonna be one and last
13:55 - lunch it runs out so you ran a high ran
13:58 - our lunches let's change back to 20 so
14:02 - this is the end of our project so I'm
14:08 - gonna demo it one more time before I go
14:14 - let me add the music first and go at the
14:17 - music forever well that's really big so
14:24 - I already have a sound you can take any
14:26 - sound from the sound library I'm gonna
14:28 - upload a sound this song you can totally
14:34 - play this and I'm gonna go take us down
14:39 - place out and glitching or ride until
14:41 - done that's the song I've been using so
14:45 - anyways I'm gonna go try to gather stick
14:49 - you like doing it into I like getting in
14:51 - school you can skip this part let's just
14:57 - I'm just gonna play
15:05 - five seconds so please like share and
15:50 - subscribe to our Channel and please call
15:53 - us in the comment section below to see
15:55 - what videos will come next and be sure
15:58 - to smash that like please show to your

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's kids code and click right here and today we're back for another video well this is actually part two of the video of tower Smasher so I'm just gonna go rename the title first if you haven't watched part one please watch that right now and in part one we did all this code so this calls this and this cause this and this makes all the clones so so I'm going to move on to the ball we haven't even worked on the bull yet we have to make a new block move ball to stop and another block move so move ball to start is to move the ball over here and move balls to actually move it so let's do a go to let's you go to met to go to around here I think this would work maybe a little bit lower a little bit higher this is much higher I'm just gonna go delete this I think this is close enough maybe a little bit over here actually maybe ok so we have this you can set the ball to 50% so it's not that big it's not that cheap you know won't like it everything at once well if you want to be cheap you can do it but and we also have to set a speed horizontal speed to zero and we can duplicate that oopsies and choose just a V speed vertical speed and then we can also broadcast new message get ready so when I define move ball or change the X you also need changed x and y change X by each speed because it's horizontal speed and change Y by V speed that's vertical speed I'll change the the speed to give me a multiply sign to 0.99 H speed so I'll also set H speed I'm sorry that's actually right here on B speed XP so I'm on the sternest at each speed give this back it's a check at H speed speed speed right there and then a V speed is on top we can put that on top if you want to be speed is negative zero point if then touching the color see if that's not to be the red color just take the brown color this is a simple just a little bit different I'll set the V speed to multiply sine negative 0.8 these be so this H speed and V speed so I did something wrong right here it's actually back it's just actually set it just means actually changed that if you change V speed and this one's actually set a new speed let's just take this house when we could save it set B speed it's actually net negative zero point to what I did earlier so this is supposed to make like when you watch it's gonna be really quick and then it's gonna fall down gradually and get slower so it's supposed to be each speed okay let's move on so we're still working on the ball we can minimize one do not minimize make it smaller so why not when the green flag is clicked just set this score to zero it's simple enough they'll set lunches to 20 so you only get 20 lunches before you lose 20 lunches it'll move balls start like it runs this code and then when I receive complete game they'll say you have to take this one not say for two seconds because it might be a really big number so it'll say you showing because you'll join the two together you score comfort space you score a you score the amount that you scored so you gotta put a score so this will make it so it won't go away like if you put two two seconds that means they'll go away in two seconds so it's move on to if you lose so when the green flag is clicked well go forever then if then loop the launch is equals you'll need greater than or less than because it takes like a time for it to launch again so zero lunches it'll stop all you need forever remember that so it'll keep on going rows in the beginning you'll just stop not really stop but oh just do it once so then we also have to work on the arrow so you can see all this code if if you miss some code you can be sure to pause the video and let's work on the arrow it's the arrow when the green flag is clicked either the pen it's inside this a block thing that you can pick I already have pen already set up and then I'll set the pen color to any color you want I'm gonna use yellow and then you'll set pen size to 15 that's pretty thick and they'll show go

ball don't go exposition of the ball and all you also need this ball but you need the Y position is this in the Y section oh good and that's pointer will point towards ball what is that point words bowl it'll turn the 480 degrees and then when this sprite is clicked it will broadcast fire you broadcast message though show up hide pen up and then when I receive get ready show and pen down so let's try it up do you see look there's like a little thing doesn't want yet not don't the code yet but we can move on to it's another for the ball bull has another chunk of code so when I receive fire because that's what got them the arrow or reset the timer but so reset timer you have change launches by minus negative also set I'll tell you what the reset timer is for later but now let's focus on this set h gap you need to actually but actually one for the other one so that one it's Mouse X Y also here Mouse Y for the next one now so X and no x position x position and I can just

it like a larger number I'll ghost um I'll go slower so let's keep on continuing repeat until you need a greater then go sign you up or put this inside 5 seconds and put timer so the timers for it'll go until 5 seconds so keep on moving until 5 seconds or it's touching the edge you'll automatically go it's touching to the edge you'll automatically go oh move the ball so the timer is 4 so we have to put the move ball to start afterwards so if it's if the timer is greater than 5 don't go back to the start it or if it's touching the edge you'll go back to the stock oh so just keep on moving just first remove all the variables Bam Bam Bam Bam except to score you can keep that one you see her scored we can move it more off so as you can see the timer actually works like 1 2 3 4 5 or might count
