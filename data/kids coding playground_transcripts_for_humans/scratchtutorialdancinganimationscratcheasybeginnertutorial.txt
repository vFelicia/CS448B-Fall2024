00:10 - another video and today we're doing
00:12 - something different it's a dancing
00:14 - animation this is a dancing animation of
00:16 - ballerinas and bets dancing animation
00:20 - today tutorial we will be learning these
00:22 - concepts in scratch clothing loops and
00:24 - color effect so I'm going to show your
00:33 - demo let's open the screen these you can
00:37 - bats or dancing in the ballerinas are
00:40 - also in they're all different color its
00:44 - refuse close to this yes as you can see
00:48 - there's also music playing in the
00:49 - background so we can create a new
00:52 - project looking it look first things
00:56 - first let's name it dance so we can
01:02 - delete this the regular cat sprites we
01:05 - can get the ballerina sprite and also
01:09 - the that's bright okay so you can change
01:15 - the backdrop to anything you want I'm
01:18 - gonna stick with the blue sky cuz
01:19 - there's bats in the background so move
01:24 - them right here so let's work on the
01:28 - backdrop first so you can use any song
01:31 - you want you can you collect them
01:34 - through the sounds thing so it's really
01:39 - simple you see it forever
01:41 - you can pick two the sound you want so
01:44 - you can go I mean you can search them up
01:46 - or you can click loops or this long song
01:49 - um so next I'll take X so let's work on
01:59 - the ballerina
02:01 - so the ballerina bat have fairly the
02:05 - same code but the bachelors on top of
02:07 - the ballerina so you gotta change it to
02:09 - go to so you just move it evenly
02:12 - there so you got to put a hide so in the
02:20 - beginning
02:21 - don't hide and then oh go to here we can
02:27 - drag it more in yes put this back in you
02:32 - can do so
02:34 - I mean also we have to put the repeat 6
02:39 - times because you can make 6 clones or 5
02:42 - clones or whatever you want but I'm
02:43 - gonna stick with the six clothes so you
02:46 - can create the clone of myself move 75
02:51 - steps so the 75 steps is for the valeriy
03:00 - not to move and create a clone and move
03:03 - and create a clone and move and create
03:04 - clothes so you can also change the
03:06 - colour effect if you want that's
03:07 - optional and when I start us a clone it
03:13 - will show each clone will show go
03:17 - forever
03:19 - wait 0.5 seconds 0.5 0.5 same as 0.5 and
03:25 - then I'll go the neck costume so keep on
03:28 - dancing so the bat is the same code but
03:33 - you're gonna move on top
03:34 - I'm gonna go adjust the bat down a
03:37 - little bit because I think it's a little
03:39 - bit too high so we can move the
03:41 - ballerina code but remember they change
03:43 - the the go to so just take out this go
03:50 - to go to move in and take this code so
03:58 - so I'm just gonna try out the game so
04:02 - let's make it fullscreen as you can see
04:04 - I made duplicates
04:08 - that's and then ballerinas too and
04:10 - they're all different color well that
04:13 - only changes the color of its nose so
04:15 - yeah that's it for today please like
04:18 - share and subscribe before you go and
04:20 - please bring the notification spell in
04:22 - common to see what you want later for us
04:25 - to code next thank you
