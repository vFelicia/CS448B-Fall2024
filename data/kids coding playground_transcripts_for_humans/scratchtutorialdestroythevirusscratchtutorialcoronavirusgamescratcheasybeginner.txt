00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys this kids coding
00:08 - playground here
00:09 - and today we're back for another video
00:11 - called destroy the virus today we'll be
00:13 - working on a coronavirus themed game
00:15 - the cat is supposed to fly around the
00:16 - city destroying the viruses don't forget
00:19 - don't forget to wear your mask
00:25 - to show the virus we will be learning
00:27 - these following concepts in scratch
00:28 - variables loops touching sprite
00:31 - color effect and clone
00:39 - okay so we'll go demo the game
00:43 - as you can see i'm the um cat wearing
00:46 - the mask
00:47 - and then wherever i click it flies and
00:49 - it punches wherever it's like
00:51 - and i get to collect the coronavirus or
00:54 - the viruses
00:55 - and kill them and kill them so right now
00:58 - it's score
00:59 - five i might change that
01:04 - you can make it like 30.
01:13 - so you make it any any anything you want
01:17 - but
01:18 - let's go
01:20 - [Music]
01:23 - you go fly around catching the viruses
01:25 - protecting the city
01:26 - it says you win okay let's get started
01:33 - okay so this is a new project you can
01:35 - delete the original sprite
01:37 - i already have things in my backpack for
01:40 - me
01:40 - so i can drag in the cat you don't the
01:43 - mask is optional i mean like you don't
01:44 - really have to draw it but
01:48 - i'll show you how to draw it so let's go
01:51 - to the costumes
01:52 - so as you can see i drew a mask right
01:55 - here
01:58 - wrong button and go paint
02:06 - so we can take the circle change the
02:09 - color
02:09 - and the outline it can be any color
02:26 - it can be any color but
02:36 - so got the circle
02:39 - the outside is blue the inside is white
02:42 - so you can draw it like
02:43 - that and then you can also use the
02:44 - reshape tool to reshape it
02:47 - make a little shorter
02:53 - and also make some lines like in the
02:55 - middle
02:59 - you can change the thickness i'ma draw a
03:04 - line across
03:05 - you can also use the reshape tool for
03:07 - lines too
03:10 - so i can reshape that
03:19 - so let's hear some lines
03:30 - okay so i can uh
03:34 - reshape like all of this all the lines
03:36 - can be reshaped
03:38 - i mean this a demonstration isn't as
03:42 - good as the
03:43 - original mask but
03:48 - you can take it
03:55 - as you can see that's another mask i
03:57 - just drew it
04:08 - you like adjust it and bring like the
04:10 - lines so it looks more like a mask
04:15 - so so something like this so
04:18 - let's just go delete the sprite now
04:21 - let's go working
04:22 - let's go work on the code so let's just
04:27 - and you can also you also have to copy
04:29 - it onto them
04:30 - you have to group it by using the
04:32 - pointer tool
04:33 - called or you can use the group button
04:37 - and then you can do ctrl c for that mask
04:42 - ctrl c then ctrl v
04:46 - and you can paste the mask and you can
04:47 - like adjust it there's
04:49 - adjust button so there you go
04:53 - it can rotate yeah you can adjust it
04:56 - size
04:57 - so there you go a mask
05:00 - all right let's just start the code so
05:04 - first we have to make a variable called
05:08 - score
05:10 - and we also have to make the cat
05:13 - we also need um i also have a u-wind
05:17 - thing already made
05:20 - and i can also make a virus so i'm going
05:22 - to teach you how to make a virus
05:24 - you can use a puffer fish it looks
05:26 - similar to a virus
05:27 - i was using and then you can go to the
05:30 - costumes
05:32 - so you can delete all these other ones
05:36 - and then this one we can use this tool
05:40 - delete this who's wrong
05:43 - wrong one it's that one the face and
05:46 - then we can also delete the fins
05:48 - to make it look more like a virus
05:51 - as you can see you can also rename it
05:54 - the virus
05:56 - and the name if you want
05:59 - and um you can start coding
06:02 - so the cat flying when a green flag is
06:06 - clicked
06:10 - the green flag is clicked
06:15 - i'll go forever it'll go wherever you
06:18 - click
06:18 - so it's if then mouse down
06:27 - it'll switch costume to cat
06:32 - flying a wait 0.1 seconds
06:36 - it's actually it's an else statement i
06:38 - just noticed
06:40 - take this out so that we can reuse this
06:42 - one
06:43 - if then else statement the mouse down
06:47 - cat flying a and you see in the costumes
06:52 - a b a b and then
06:55 - wait 0.1 seconds so it goes there in 0.1
06:59 - seconds
07:00 - and and else it'll switch the costume to
07:04 - cat blind p
07:11 - so we can also work on the cat so when
07:14 - the green flag is clicked
07:19 - it can go to anywhere but i'm gonna make
07:21 - it yeah let's make it
07:22 - let's move a little bit to the
07:26 - here um so around here you can move it
07:30 - around
07:31 - and then point in direction 90 because
07:32 - it has to punch
07:34 - punch it and then switch switch costume
07:38 - to cat
07:44 - cat flying b um
07:48 - the set rotation style to left right so
07:50 - it won't rotate
07:52 - or also start flipping over and stuff
07:56 - forever
07:58 - if then the mouse is down
08:04 - that means it'll point towards mouse
08:06 - pointer so i'll point wherever
08:08 - you go
08:13 - it'll glide to it
08:24 - oh to mouse x mouse y because that's
08:26 - where you want your
08:28 - mouse
08:34 - so virus we're going to work on the
08:35 - virus code so
08:40 - let's go test it out it's flying as you
08:43 - can see
08:43 - it's flying to wherever you click so
08:47 - it's also let's work on the virus
08:55 - so when green flag clicked it'll clear
08:58 - all the graphic effects because as you
09:00 - can see
09:01 - um when i demoed the game it was
09:03 - different colors
09:04 - so in the beginning you got to clear all
09:05 - the graphic effects
09:08 - it'll set the score to zero
09:13 - set size to 50 you can use any size you
09:16 - want you can make it big or small
09:18 - this is medium sized
09:22 - repeat until repeat
09:26 - five actually repeat five times we'll
09:28 - spawn five viruses
09:33 - create clone with myself then hide
09:38 - so also i'm going to work on more on the
09:40 - virus so
09:42 - when i start as a clone it'll
09:45 - change color effect by 25
09:49 - but that's not it also has to buy pick
09:52 - random
09:54 - one to 300 so it'll be different colors
09:56 - each virus is a different color
09:59 - i'll go to a random position
10:03 - a show
10:07 - forever
10:12 - if then statement is touching the cat
10:15 - which
10:16 - catches the virus
10:20 - that means i'll hide
10:24 - and it'll change score
10:30 - change score by one
10:34 - um you also have to make a broadcast
10:38 - message
10:42 - kill kill
10:46 - right
10:49 - wait one second
10:56 - it'll go to a random position
10:59 - no show again
11:04 - cat and and the virus so we'll be
11:07 - working on these two so first
11:14 - so he's we're still working on the virus
11:17 - so when i receive
11:18 - kill when i receive kill virus
11:24 - it will if then statement
11:29 - if then
11:32 - let's put it right there
11:39 - or so it's like if it's more than or
11:43 - less than
11:44 - so you need this and this
11:48 - so if the score
11:52 - is greater than zero
11:57 - thirty thirty i meant thirty um
12:00 - or it equals thirty so that's when you
12:02 - win
12:03 - so when the score is greater than thirty
12:06 - or equals thirty
12:08 - and broadcast you win
12:17 - you win and then when i receive
12:20 - you win stop other scripts in this
12:23 - sprite
12:28 - also the cat also has us this one
12:32 - as well and we're also going to work on
12:34 - the you win sprite so
12:36 - it's really simple when i receive
12:42 - when green flag is clicked it will hide
12:47 - and then when i receive you win
12:52 - it'll go to the middle so let's go to x0
12:56 - 0 show
13:02 - then eventually eventually stopping
13:08 - and then so we can change a background
13:13 - to um a city
13:16 - with waters that's what i was using um
13:20 - and we can also make the
13:23 - music it's really zoomed in
13:28 - the music is really simple just forever
13:30 - loop you just get a sound
13:32 - i think i used um dance funky
13:36 - yeah i used funky so
13:40 - let's go to the sound section
13:45 - so i'm gonna go demo the game
13:49 - as you can see wherever you click is
13:51 - where the map of
13:52 - a cat goes and you can see he's punching
13:54 - the virus
13:56 - and then let's see if i can
14:00 - you can see they're all different colors
14:01 - [Music]
14:08 - so it says you win
14:11 - before i go please like share and
14:14 - subscribe and comment in the comment
14:15 - section
14:16 - below to see what projects you want
14:19 - featured
14:19 - or um what projects you want us to make
14:23 - so anyway thank you all bye
14:30 - [Music]
14:36 - you

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys this kids coding playground here and today we're back for another video called destroy the virus today we'll be working on a coronavirus themed game the cat is supposed to fly around the city destroying the viruses don't forget don't forget to wear your mask to show the virus we will be learning these following concepts in scratch variables loops touching sprite color effect and clone okay so we'll go demo the game as you can see i'm the um cat wearing the mask and then wherever i click it flies and it punches wherever it's like and i get to collect the coronavirus or the viruses and kill them and kill them so right now it's score five i might change that you can make it like 30. so you make it any any anything you want but let's go you go fly around catching the viruses protecting the city it says you win okay let's get started okay so this is a new project you can delete the original sprite i already have things in my backpack for me so i can drag in the cat you don't the mask is optional i mean like you don't really have to draw it but i'll show you how to draw it so let's go to the costumes so as you can see i drew a mask right here wrong button and go paint so we can take the circle change the color and the outline it can be any color it can be any color but so got the circle the outside is blue the inside is white so you can draw it like that and then you can also use the reshape tool to reshape it make a little shorter and also make some lines like in the middle you can change the thickness i'ma draw a line across you can also use the reshape tool for lines too so i can reshape that so let's hear some lines okay so i can uh reshape like all of this all the lines can be reshaped i mean this a demonstration isn't as good as the original mask but you can take it as you can see that's another mask i just drew it you like adjust it and bring like the lines so it looks more like a mask so so something like this so let's just go delete the sprite now let's go working let's go work on the code so let's just and you can also you also have to copy it onto them you have to group it by using the pointer tool called or you can use the group button and then you can do ctrl c for that mask ctrl c then ctrl v and you can paste the mask and you can like adjust it there's adjust button so there you go it can rotate yeah you can adjust it size so there you go a mask all right let's just start the code so first we have to make a variable called score and we also have to make the cat we also need um i also have a uwind thing already made and i can also make a virus so i'm going to teach you how to make a virus you can use a puffer fish it looks similar to a virus i was using and then you can go to the costumes so you can delete all these other ones and then this one we can use this tool delete this who's wrong wrong one it's that one the face and then we can also delete the fins to make it look more like a virus as you can see you can also rename it the virus and the name if you want and um you can start coding so the cat flying when a green flag is clicked the green flag is clicked i'll go forever it'll go wherever you click so it's if then mouse down it'll switch costume to cat flying a wait 0.1 seconds it's actually it's an else statement i just noticed take this out so that we can reuse this one if then else statement the mouse down cat flying a and you see in the costumes a b a b and then wait 0.1 seconds so it goes there in 0.1 seconds and and else it'll switch the costume to cat blind p so we can also work on the cat so when the green flag is clicked it can go to anywhere but i'm gonna make it yeah let's make it let's move a little bit to the here um so around here you can move it around and then point in direction 90 because it has to punch punch it and then switch switch costume to cat cat flying b um the set rotation style to left right so it won't rotate or also start flipping over and stuff forever if then the mouse is down that means it'll point towards mouse pointer so i'll point wherever you go it'll glide to it oh to mouse x mouse y because that's where you want your mouse so virus we're going to work on the virus code so let's go test it out it's flying as you can see it's flying to wherever you click so it's also let's work on the virus so when green flag clicked it'll clear all the graphic effects because as you can see um when i demoed the game it was different colors so in the beginning you got to clear all the graphic effects it'll set the score to zero set size to 50 you can use any size you want you can make it big or small this is medium sized repeat until repeat five actually repeat five times we'll spawn five viruses create clone with myself then hide so also i'm going to work on more on the virus so when i start as a clone it'll change color effect by 25 but that's not it also has to buy pick random one to 300 so it'll be different colors each virus is a different color i'll go to a random position a show forever if then statement is touching the cat which catches the virus that means i'll hide and it'll change score change score by one um you also have to make a broadcast message kill kill right wait one second it'll go to a random position no show again cat and and the virus so we'll be working on these two so first so he's we're still working on the virus so when i receive kill when i receive kill virus it will if then statement if then let's put it right there or so it's like if it's more than or less than so you need this and this so if the score is greater than zero thirty thirty i meant thirty um or it equals thirty so that's when you win so when the score is greater than thirty or equals thirty and broadcast you win you win and then when i receive you win stop other scripts in this sprite also the cat also has us this one as well and we're also going to work on the you win sprite so it's really simple when i receive when green flag is clicked it will hide and then when i receive you win it'll go to the middle so let's go to x0 0 show then eventually eventually stopping and then so we can change a background to um a city with waters that's what i was using um and we can also make the music it's really zoomed in the music is really simple just forever loop you just get a sound i think i used um dance funky yeah i used funky so let's go to the sound section so i'm gonna go demo the game as you can see wherever you click is where the map of a cat goes and you can see he's punching the virus and then let's see if i can you can see they're all different colors so it says you win before i go please like share and subscribe and comment in the comment section below to see what projects you want featured or um what projects you want us to make so anyway thank you all bye you
