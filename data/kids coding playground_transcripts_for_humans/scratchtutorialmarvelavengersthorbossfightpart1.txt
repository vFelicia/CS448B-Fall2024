00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids coding
00:10 - playground here
00:11 - and today we're back for another video
00:13 - of well i mean like scratch because it's
00:15 - going to play grounds
00:16 - and anyway so we're going to start now
00:20 - many kids have requested for the marvel
00:23 - game
00:24 - so um we decided to make it today so
00:28 - uh yeah so you want to see my game
00:31 - well i mean it's called thor boss fight
00:33 - and i'm clicking
00:35 - look as you can see uh thor loses health
00:38 - he's 120 hp
00:40 - and whenever the bugs hit him he loses 5
00:42 - hp and then to get rid of the bugs
00:44 - you gotta go like that and then the
00:46 - lightning comes out and kills all the
00:47 - bombs really cool in my opinion
00:49 - and then you just have to use them to
00:51 - kill the things and then
00:52 - if the dragon walks to your stone i know
00:54 - he's really slow
00:56 - that means you lose or if the bugs kill
00:57 - you and died as well so
00:59 - i mean like um the dragon uh
01:03 - is immune to lightning because he's a
01:04 - dragon and the ways to
01:07 - attack the dragon is use the
01:10 - slam with the hammer which or the throw
01:13 - with the hammer which i'm going to show
01:14 - you right now
01:15 - the throw hammer you can spam not really
01:17 - spam but like go
01:19 - it's more higher dps than the hammer
01:22 - the number one so but i honestly like
01:26 - this one better just because
01:28 - you know then yeah the dragon is mean to
01:31 - lightning so
01:34 - yeah so so if he gets the rocks and he
01:39 - so or yeah i've told you that
01:43 - so i'm about to die here that's because
01:45 - i was not trying in the beginning trying
01:47 - to show you guys
01:48 - how to die and stuff
01:54 - oh it says oh i died so look so thor's
01:57 - like
01:58 - i don't know i don't know like he's died
02:00 - like something hit him or something
02:01 - so it says you lose but i'm gonna speed
02:03 - up the process a little bit and see
02:05 - if you win so as you can see i'm
02:08 - in the middle of this right now i'm
02:10 - online it's hard getting the recording
02:12 - back up with them
02:14 - kill some dps bro and then light him
02:18 - up kill the peons the
02:25 - [Music]
02:33 - you win so the dragon can also get your
02:36 - stone and you lose so
02:38 - yeah you gotta i'm gonna show you that
02:42 - so i'm gonna upload my images now
02:45 - because
02:46 - i got a bunch of images two reasons why
02:48 - i did this because the dragon had too
02:49 - much files inside and also because you
02:52 - you're tired of me saying this eight
02:53 - letter word backpack so
02:55 - yeah so it's not backpack this time so
02:59 - i'm gonna upload all of these
03:04 - so
03:10 - so up to up to here and shift
03:14 - and then down to here so lip i got them
03:17 - all so it might take a while honestly
03:19 - and it might get a little bit laggy for
03:21 - your computer
03:23 - oh look there's a dragon the dragon has
03:25 - a really big file and so this is thor
03:27 - okay so we got him all in the lightning
03:29 - oh nice laggy
03:32 - um yeah so okay so
03:35 - um if you're if you don't if you can't
03:38 - get these things in our google drive
03:39 - you're basically doing it wrong uh so
03:44 - um so um
03:47 - you guys if it doesn't work for you guys
03:49 - you can just go to my shared project
03:50 - right click export this magical button
03:53 - so
03:54 - and there's two lightnings i'll tell you
03:55 - why in
03:57 - just a second so first i'm gonna do some
04:00 - stuff with the leaves
04:02 - i'm just gonna make the oh wow it's
04:04 - really laggy it's still saving my
04:06 - project
04:08 - and the thing isn't even showing up so
04:11 - i'm gonna make the elven stone next cup
04:13 - okay so now i'm going to upload the
04:15 - sprite the rock sprite
04:17 - r-o-c-k-s because i messed it up it was
04:21 - supposed to be on the costume so
04:23 - yeah i'm going to get the costume
04:24 - convert to vector
04:27 - ctrl c ctrl v
04:30 - and look it's bigger than that but i can
04:32 - delete the sprite
04:33 - but i'm just going to make this smaller
04:36 - the elven stone the elven symbol
04:39 - the elven symbol on the stone
04:43 - so that's great and it's fine
04:47 - and okay so now we can delete the leaves
04:49 - we don't need this
04:50 - and okay so we're gonna start out with
04:52 - the thor
04:53 - we have many costumes for it so we're
04:55 - gonna oh yeah we're gonna do the
04:56 - lightning first because
04:58 - we're gonna show you how to do the
04:58 - lighting so this is the big lightning i
05:01 - already have so this is how you do it
05:02 - for all the costumes so there's
05:05 - so many costumes for this uh so you just
05:09 - have to do
05:10 - control a so i was scrolling while doing
05:14 - control a
05:15 - so it just zoomed everything in so yeah
05:17 - um
05:19 - so this i'm going to do control a and
05:21 - ctrl a
05:22 - so gather all of it zoom out
05:29 - and make it larger
05:33 - so there we go it's larger we just
05:36 - center it
05:40 - so we have to do this for everything so
05:43 - all of these we have to do
05:47 - all of it
05:53 - so you get the point you just have to
05:54 - keep on doing this and
05:56 - uh do it for all this costumes
06:00 - so uh i'm gonna do one more for good
06:02 - measure
06:03 - ctrl a you get the point
06:08 - but just make it really big and
06:11 - make it go to the middle so it'll cover
06:14 - the whole screen so
06:15 - we already have it for the other one we
06:17 - already have lightning so we can delete
06:18 - lightning too
06:23 - yeah so we already have it enlarged in
06:25 - this one
06:26 - so i'm going to delete the lightning too
06:29 - and then
06:30 - i actually downloaded this from this
06:32 - lightning thunderbolt
06:34 - gif it's this one so that this is the
06:37 - where i
06:38 - downloaded this uh thing so just cost
06:40 - save images
06:42 - and just put it in
06:45 - so yeah um
06:48 - we're gonna get started on the thor we
06:50 - really have to get started in the code
06:51 - it's already been seven minutes and 27
06:53 - seconds so let's do this
06:55 - so when the green flag is clicked
06:59 - it'll go to the position i have it in
07:03 - around the edge you just drag it around
07:06 - and figure out yourself
07:07 - so it'll set hp
07:10 - to any hp you want so first i'm going to
07:14 - make the variable
07:15 - hp
07:19 - to 125 so
07:22 - uh i'm gonna the size has to be 75
07:26 - so if you make it 100 you could make it
07:28 - 100 but it's way too big in my opinion
07:30 - so
07:31 - make it 75.
07:34 - and switch costume to thor 0
07:38 - 0 and forever
07:43 - if if the if the
07:47 - key one is compressed
07:53 - key one is pressed then i'll broadcast a
07:56 - message called
07:57 - attack so broadcasting white so yeah
08:00 - broadcast message attack
08:05 - you just have to duplicate this make
08:07 - number two
08:10 - and instead of attack make a new message
08:13 - of
08:14 - throw hammer
08:18 - because thor throws his hammer too if oh
08:21 - if you want to
08:22 - yeah yeah you just yeah if you want to
08:24 - do that you can
08:25 - do it yeah so instead
08:28 - do for three on this one because it's
08:30 - lightning
08:31 - so let's switch this to lightning attack
08:40 - and then when i receive attack
08:46 - it will switch costume to thor zero zero
08:51 - this is this costume right here and
08:54 - repeat 12 times because on the attack
08:58 - costume we have 12 costumes
09:00 - so i think it's starting from 4-1
09:04 - starting from 4-0 one two three four
09:08 - five yeah you get the point uh we made
09:10 - multiple costumes so it looks more
09:12 - smoother
09:13 - because look look this is basically the
09:16 - same thing right this is literally the
09:18 - same thing
09:18 - but if you actually do it like make
09:21 - multiple of these
09:22 - and what looks more smoother and it's a
09:24 - better animation in my opinion so
09:26 - and so we have that repeat 12
09:31 - i'll move 10 steps
09:37 - next costume
09:42 - uh weight 0.005
09:46 - so that's the thousandths place
09:50 - 0.005 um
09:53 - broadcast attack dragon
09:57 - so yeah you have to hit the dragon with
10:00 - the hammer
10:01 - so attack dragon
10:06 - so and also we have to do switch
10:08 - crossing back to the regular four
10:11 - four zero zero so we have him right here
10:15 - let's bring this a little bit more down
10:17 - uh and
10:18 - glide 0.1 seconds
10:23 - back to this position
10:29 - and after that we have to work on the
10:31 - lightning attack and throw hammer
10:33 - so i'm going to show you how this looks
10:34 - like so
10:36 - um yeah if you add extra costumes like
10:39 - if you add like
10:40 - more costumes than us you you have to
10:43 - make instead of repeat 12 you might have
10:45 - to use
10:45 - more so let's do this see look
10:51 - yeah um so
10:55 - now we're going to work on the lightning
10:58 - attack
11:00 - so when i receive
11:04 - lightning attack then it will switch
11:07 - costumes
11:08 - i i think i should do throw hammer first
11:11 - but that's fine i'm going to throw
11:13 - hammer
11:13 - actually because it's more i mean like
11:16 - this is number two and this is number
11:17 - one so why not just do throw hammer
11:19 - and then switch costume to 406
11:22 - which is
11:25 - which is costing 14 for this one so he's
11:28 - about to throw the hammer he got his
11:29 - hand ready and stuff
11:31 - so door six
11:35 - oh six and repeat eight times
11:44 - and next costume so you always want to
11:47 - make it
11:48 - i mean not like next costume but like
11:50 - weight zero point zero zero five
11:52 - so no pre eight costumes from starting
11:56 - from
11:56 - four six so zero point
12:00 - zero zero five thousandths place
12:02 - remember
12:03 - south thousands
12:06 - now so uh switch costumes are back to
12:09 - the war zero
12:10 - zero so down here
12:15 - and now we're gonna show you this so one
12:19 - look two two two throwing nothing but
12:23 - air right
12:24 - now because we don't have the hammer
12:26 - coated so
12:28 - we're gonna go the hammer now cause
12:30 - speaking of hammer
12:31 - hammer hammer so
12:34 - when i was when when the green flag is
12:36 - quite
12:37 - hide
12:42 - in a little bit we still have some at
12:44 - bugs too i mean some
12:45 - sprites add like the bug so yeah we're
12:48 - going to get to that after when we're
12:49 - done
12:50 - coding some before so throw hammer
12:54 - the only big part of the code is
12:55 - probably the bug other than that
12:58 - this is the thor is actually not that
13:00 - bad
13:01 - so go to thor show
13:06 - repeat until touching dragon walking
13:12 - uh touching dragon walking or edge so
13:17 - you know or touching
13:23 - dragon walking which is the dragon
13:26 - or um
13:30 - the edge it might not be able to touch
13:33 - the edge but it's
13:34 - extra just in case if someone just tries
13:37 - to glitch out the game and mess
13:38 - everything up
13:39 - yeah no touch they'll touch the edge or
13:41 - the
13:42 - dragon watching walking so yeah so move
13:45 - ten steps
13:46 - you just have to keep on moving and
13:50 - hide so yeah really simple code for the
13:53 - hammer
13:54 - so i'm going to show you guys right now
13:58 - so you guys can copy that down
14:01 - two look hits the dragon bam we haven't
14:03 - coded much
14:04 - yet so let's keep on coding so
14:07 - let's go back to the four because we're
14:10 - gonna work on the thor
14:12 - the lightning attack so when i receive
14:17 - lightning attack which is also lightning
14:19 - so
14:20 - same thing but whatever uh switch
14:22 - costume that thor 15 which is
14:26 - uh this one
14:30 - so he's like raising up his hammer like
14:32 - rar or something like a viking
14:34 - i don't know so switch costume to thor
14:37 - 15 which will make him raising up his
14:41 - hand so we're going to show you that
14:44 - real quick but
14:45 - after we're done coding this of course
14:46 - repeat eight costumes
14:51 - next costume
14:55 - wait 0.05 seconds and then switch
14:59 - costume back to thor zero zero so
15:01 - yeah basically the same thing for all of
15:04 - them just a little bit different
15:06 - so we're gonna show you that three yard
15:12 - so yeah so nice uh now we're gonna work
15:15 - on
15:16 - the lightning because we are doing the
15:19 - lightning next because we just coded the
15:21 - lightning
15:22 - attack so
15:26 - actually i forgot to add the broadcast
15:29 - lightning on this thing
15:31 - so this is just a broadcast lightning
15:33 - and weight which i did not add quite
15:36 - yet i mean yeah we'll add it so like
15:38 - right now
15:39 - so uh lightning so
15:43 - lightning
15:47 - nice so next we're gonna work on the
15:50 - lightning of course because we just
15:52 - did that so you can see the whole entire
15:55 - jiff
15:56 - it's like bam bam bam lightning coming
15:58 - down from the sky
16:00 - because thor's a lightning dude
16:04 - if you if you didn't know you probably
16:06 - already know that because you
16:08 - knew that because it's avengers everyone
16:10 - knows about avengers
16:11 - so and then when i receive lightning
16:18 - it will switch costume to lightning
16:22 - no not 36 but one
16:25 - which is lightning and those show
16:30 - and go to front layer
16:34 - repeat 36 times because there's 36
16:38 - costumes
16:39 - of next costume so because it's really
16:43 - quick
16:44 - we want it to be really quick or else
16:45 - the bugs will kill you before the
16:46 - thing's even done
16:48 - so and then hide
16:53 - and broadcast kill bugs
16:58 - which we will get to that we just have
17:00 - to upload the bugs
17:02 - uh
17:05 - from the sprite library so yeah another
17:08 - one
17:10 - where we're gonna work on next the thor
17:14 - if we have anything else to do yes we do
17:17 - so
17:19 - we might i'm gonna do this real quick so
17:22 - when the green flag is clicked
17:24 - it'll go forever
17:25 - [Music]
17:27 - if then the it
17:31 - i mean like if the hp
17:34 - is you know what i mean if the hp
17:37 - is like less than zero then
17:41 - it will um
17:45 - or equal to zero it will die so
17:48 - hp
17:51 - hp hp
17:55 - and then broadcast you lose so
17:58 - yeah broadcast you lose we also have
18:02 - some other things to code
18:03 - and you lose so
18:07 - and then when i receive you lose
18:14 - then it will switch costumes of thor 12
18:18 - which is him going yar
18:21 - whatever that thing is like bending
18:26 - backwards
18:28 - is this costume
18:31 - this one your yard
18:35 - so yeah nice we are actually not done
18:39 - with the thor
18:40 - quite yet we still have one more thing
18:42 - but we will not do that quite yet
18:43 - because we
18:44 - have to do the dragon
18:48 - so the dragon should be
18:51 - great so yeah um
18:54 - we're gonna work on the dragon then
18:56 - we're gonna work on the
18:58 - a bug so i'm gonna move that right there
19:02 - i'm actually we're gonna do the rocks
19:04 - rocks are like the easiest thing you've
19:05 - ever seen in your life
19:07 - so it's when the green flag is clicked
19:10 - i'll go to i have a precise chord in it
19:13 - but i
19:14 - i don't want it to be that hard i
19:16 - probably like i'll say here
19:18 - or here here uh okay whatever that
19:22 - position is 96.
19:24 - negative 96 and negative 58 then go to
19:26 - back layer
19:27 - really easy simple
19:32 - so yeah uh
19:35 - you probably can already see that but
19:37 - you know it was easy to even do so
19:40 - yeah now we're going to work on dragon
19:42 - walking i'm so
19:43 - zoomed in now uh dragon walking
19:47 - we did the lightning pretty sure we did
19:49 - lightning we did the lightning
19:51 - and we have the dragon walking so
19:54 - when the when the green flag
19:57 - wow
20:00 - always too small when i want it big so
20:04 - when the green flag is clicked
20:08 - i'll go to i'm gonna make it
20:12 - a precise coordinate because i want it
20:13 - not to be that cheap okay
20:15 - so that's already negative 38 but i just
20:18 - already
20:20 - and then i gotta make a variable dragon
20:23 - hp
20:23 - because dragons have hp too you know
20:27 - well if they're actually real i don't
20:28 - know if dragons are real
20:30 - um it'll go forever
20:35 - five thousand you can make it like ten
20:37 - thousand
20:38 - twenty thousand if you really wanna
20:40 - challenge so
20:41 - that'd be nice if someone actually made
20:43 - like
20:44 - ten thousand or something that'd be a
20:46 - really great challenge i'll play
20:48 - that so when the green flag is clicked
20:51 - it'll go forever wait five
20:54 - seconds so this is where
20:57 - you make the dragon move and then it'll
21:00 - move five
21:01 - negative five steps because he's the
21:02 - wrong way right now so
21:04 - yeah so so yeah he's going backward
21:08 - so it's like this he's every five
21:10 - seconds he moves a little bit he just
21:12 - moves
21:12 - some steps so as you can see look looks
21:16 - like he's smoothing
21:18 - he's not moving quite yet but he's going
21:20 - to move in a few seconds
21:24 - he's moving see look he just moved so
21:27 - nice
21:27 - and then you can use three
21:31 - no there's not any bugs yet so yeah
21:34 - so we basically got the whole game coded
21:37 - not the whole game but like part of the
21:38 - game
21:39 - it's already looking pretty great in my
21:41 - opinion it's been 22 minutes actually so
21:44 - there might be a part two for this
21:48 - so bear with me if this is becomes a 40
21:51 - minute video just bear with me
21:53 - uh winter i just donated the trees in
21:57 - the background
21:58 - we don't need those uh bye-bye and
22:01 - um yeah we can finish this bear with me
22:04 - if it's a 40 minute video watch it
22:06 - tomorrow if you want to let you
22:08 - watch videos for 40 minutes so yeah um
22:11 - we're going to work on the ladybug
22:13 - because no we haven't finished the
22:15 - dragon yet i just noticed that
22:16 - uh so when i receive
22:23 - attack dragon will change dragon hp
22:27 - by -100 so that's like the
22:32 - axe attack like where he runs up and
22:34 - goes
22:36 - the hammer so
22:39 - yeah and then when the green flag is
22:41 - clicked
22:43 - you'll go forever
22:46 - it will if then there's if then
22:50 - if then or dragon hp is less
22:54 - then okay i'll explain it later so if
22:57 - the dragon hp
22:59 - is less than zero
23:02 - or equal to zero then
23:05 - it will broadcast you win so we're gonna
23:09 - drag the dragon hp instead of
23:11 - hp for the thor cause thor is different
23:13 - from the dragon
23:15 - uh now broadcast you win
23:21 - you win because you killed the dragon
23:27 - and you need to if then if then touching
23:30 - the hammer
23:32 - which is the hammer sprite because when
23:34 - you throw the
23:35 - hammer hits him if then touching
23:38 - hammer then change dragon hp by
23:42 - 50. the reason why i made by the dragon
23:44 - the hammer weaker than the
23:46 - other one is because -50
23:50 - is because uh i mean like the
23:55 - dr the hammer has a longer like a more
23:58 - faster
24:01 - swing i don't know like more spamble
24:04 - than the other one so
24:05 - if then touching rocks
24:09 - then you lose choose
24:12 - so yeah broadcast you
24:15 - lose because you lost and then
24:19 - um now we're gonna work on the bug
24:23 - yeah we can also upload the sun real
24:25 - quick um just extra decor
24:27 - you know who doesn't want some extra
24:30 - decoration
24:34 - so yeah i'm going to move the dragon hp
24:37 - on this side because dragon hp
24:38 - is on that side and then i'm going to
24:41 - make it like around
24:42 - here that should be green enough extra
24:44 - decor
24:45 - never hurt so yeah um
24:48 - we're gonna work on the ladybug next and
24:51 - then we're gonna work on the you and you
24:53 - lose spray
24:54 - so ladybug has a hunk of code
24:57 - so right now i'm out of time so
25:01 - yeah we got a lot done today um so i
25:04 - will
25:04 - be doing this in part two the bugs and
25:08 - everything else so see you guys next

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here and today we're back for another video of well i mean like scratch because it's going to play grounds and anyway so we're going to start now many kids have requested for the marvel game so um we decided to make it today so uh yeah so you want to see my game well i mean it's called thor boss fight and i'm clicking look as you can see uh thor loses health he's 120 hp and whenever the bugs hit him he loses 5 hp and then to get rid of the bugs you gotta go like that and then the lightning comes out and kills all the bombs really cool in my opinion and then you just have to use them to kill the things and then if the dragon walks to your stone i know he's really slow that means you lose or if the bugs kill you and died as well so i mean like um the dragon uh is immune to lightning because he's a dragon and the ways to attack the dragon is use the slam with the hammer which or the throw with the hammer which i'm going to show you right now the throw hammer you can spam not really spam but like go it's more higher dps than the hammer the number one so but i honestly like this one better just because you know then yeah the dragon is mean to lightning so yeah so so if he gets the rocks and he so or yeah i've told you that so i'm about to die here that's because i was not trying in the beginning trying to show you guys how to die and stuff oh it says oh i died so look so thor's like i don't know i don't know like he's died like something hit him or something so it says you lose but i'm gonna speed up the process a little bit and see if you win so as you can see i'm in the middle of this right now i'm online it's hard getting the recording back up with them kill some dps bro and then light him up kill the peons the you win so the dragon can also get your stone and you lose so yeah you gotta i'm gonna show you that so i'm gonna upload my images now because i got a bunch of images two reasons why i did this because the dragon had too much files inside and also because you you're tired of me saying this eight letter word backpack so yeah so it's not backpack this time so i'm gonna upload all of these so so up to up to here and shift and then down to here so lip i got them all so it might take a while honestly and it might get a little bit laggy for your computer oh look there's a dragon the dragon has a really big file and so this is thor okay so we got him all in the lightning oh nice laggy um yeah so okay so um if you're if you don't if you can't get these things in our google drive you're basically doing it wrong uh so um so um you guys if it doesn't work for you guys you can just go to my shared project right click export this magical button so and there's two lightnings i'll tell you why in just a second so first i'm gonna do some stuff with the leaves i'm just gonna make the oh wow it's really laggy it's still saving my project and the thing isn't even showing up so i'm gonna make the elven stone next cup okay so now i'm going to upload the sprite the rock sprite rocks because i messed it up it was supposed to be on the costume so yeah i'm going to get the costume convert to vector ctrl c ctrl v and look it's bigger than that but i can delete the sprite but i'm just going to make this smaller the elven stone the elven symbol the elven symbol on the stone so that's great and it's fine and okay so now we can delete the leaves we don't need this and okay so we're gonna start out with the thor we have many costumes for it so we're gonna oh yeah we're gonna do the lightning first because we're gonna show you how to do the lighting so this is the big lightning i already have so this is how you do it for all the costumes so there's so many costumes for this uh so you just have to do control a so i was scrolling while doing control a so it just zoomed everything in so yeah um so this i'm going to do control a and ctrl a so gather all of it zoom out and make it larger so there we go it's larger we just center it so we have to do this for everything so all of these we have to do all of it so you get the point you just have to keep on doing this and uh do it for all this costumes so uh i'm gonna do one more for good measure ctrl a you get the point but just make it really big and make it go to the middle so it'll cover the whole screen so we already have it for the other one we already have lightning so we can delete lightning too yeah so we already have it enlarged in this one so i'm going to delete the lightning too and then i actually downloaded this from this lightning thunderbolt gif it's this one so that this is the where i downloaded this uh thing so just cost save images and just put it in so yeah um we're gonna get started on the thor we really have to get started in the code it's already been seven minutes and 27 seconds so let's do this so when the green flag is clicked it'll go to the position i have it in around the edge you just drag it around and figure out yourself so it'll set hp to any hp you want so first i'm going to make the variable hp to 125 so uh i'm gonna the size has to be 75 so if you make it 100 you could make it 100 but it's way too big in my opinion so make it 75. and switch costume to thor 0 0 and forever if if the if the key one is compressed key one is pressed then i'll broadcast a message called attack so broadcasting white so yeah broadcast message attack you just have to duplicate this make number two and instead of attack make a new message of throw hammer because thor throws his hammer too if oh if you want to yeah yeah you just yeah if you want to do that you can do it yeah so instead do for three on this one because it's lightning so let's switch this to lightning attack and then when i receive attack it will switch costume to thor zero zero this is this costume right here and repeat 12 times because on the attack costume we have 12 costumes so i think it's starting from 41 starting from 40 one two three four five yeah you get the point uh we made multiple costumes so it looks more smoother because look look this is basically the same thing right this is literally the same thing but if you actually do it like make multiple of these and what looks more smoother and it's a better animation in my opinion so and so we have that repeat 12 i'll move 10 steps next costume uh weight 0.005 so that's the thousandths place 0.005 um broadcast attack dragon so yeah you have to hit the dragon with the hammer so attack dragon so and also we have to do switch crossing back to the regular four four zero zero so we have him right here let's bring this a little bit more down uh and glide 0.1 seconds back to this position and after that we have to work on the lightning attack and throw hammer so i'm going to show you how this looks like so um yeah if you add extra costumes like if you add like more costumes than us you you have to make instead of repeat 12 you might have to use more so let's do this see look yeah um so now we're going to work on the lightning attack so when i receive lightning attack then it will switch costumes i i think i should do throw hammer first but that's fine i'm going to throw hammer actually because it's more i mean like this is number two and this is number one so why not just do throw hammer and then switch costume to 406 which is which is costing 14 for this one so he's about to throw the hammer he got his hand ready and stuff so door six oh six and repeat eight times and next costume so you always want to make it i mean not like next costume but like weight zero point zero zero five so no pre eight costumes from starting from four six so zero point zero zero five thousandths place remember south thousands now so uh switch costumes are back to the war zero zero so down here and now we're gonna show you this so one look two two two throwing nothing but air right now because we don't have the hammer coated so we're gonna go the hammer now cause speaking of hammer hammer hammer so when i was when when the green flag is quite hide in a little bit we still have some at bugs too i mean some sprites add like the bug so yeah we're going to get to that after when we're done coding some before so throw hammer the only big part of the code is probably the bug other than that this is the thor is actually not that bad so go to thor show repeat until touching dragon walking uh touching dragon walking or edge so you know or touching dragon walking which is the dragon or um the edge it might not be able to touch the edge but it's extra just in case if someone just tries to glitch out the game and mess everything up yeah no touch they'll touch the edge or the dragon watching walking so yeah so move ten steps you just have to keep on moving and hide so yeah really simple code for the hammer so i'm going to show you guys right now so you guys can copy that down two look hits the dragon bam we haven't coded much yet so let's keep on coding so let's go back to the four because we're gonna work on the thor the lightning attack so when i receive lightning attack which is also lightning so same thing but whatever uh switch costume that thor 15 which is uh this one so he's like raising up his hammer like rar or something like a viking i don't know so switch costume to thor 15 which will make him raising up his hand so we're going to show you that real quick but after we're done coding this of course repeat eight costumes next costume wait 0.05 seconds and then switch costume back to thor zero zero so yeah basically the same thing for all of them just a little bit different so we're gonna show you that three yard so yeah so nice uh now we're gonna work on the lightning because we are doing the lightning next because we just coded the lightning attack so actually i forgot to add the broadcast lightning on this thing so this is just a broadcast lightning and weight which i did not add quite yet i mean yeah we'll add it so like right now so uh lightning so lightning nice so next we're gonna work on the lightning of course because we just did that so you can see the whole entire jiff it's like bam bam bam lightning coming down from the sky because thor's a lightning dude if you if you didn't know you probably already know that because you knew that because it's avengers everyone knows about avengers so and then when i receive lightning it will switch costume to lightning no not 36 but one which is lightning and those show and go to front layer repeat 36 times because there's 36 costumes of next costume so because it's really quick we want it to be really quick or else the bugs will kill you before the thing's even done so and then hide and broadcast kill bugs which we will get to that we just have to upload the bugs uh from the sprite library so yeah another one where we're gonna work on next the thor if we have anything else to do yes we do so we might i'm gonna do this real quick so when the green flag is clicked it'll go forever if then the it i mean like if the hp is you know what i mean if the hp is like less than zero then it will um or equal to zero it will die so hp hp hp and then broadcast you lose so yeah broadcast you lose we also have some other things to code and you lose so and then when i receive you lose then it will switch costumes of thor 12 which is him going yar whatever that thing is like bending backwards is this costume this one your yard so yeah nice we are actually not done with the thor quite yet we still have one more thing but we will not do that quite yet because we have to do the dragon so the dragon should be great so yeah um we're gonna work on the dragon then we're gonna work on the a bug so i'm gonna move that right there i'm actually we're gonna do the rocks rocks are like the easiest thing you've ever seen in your life so it's when the green flag is clicked i'll go to i have a precise chord in it but i i don't want it to be that hard i probably like i'll say here or here here uh okay whatever that position is 96. negative 96 and negative 58 then go to back layer really easy simple so yeah uh you probably can already see that but you know it was easy to even do so yeah now we're going to work on dragon walking i'm so zoomed in now uh dragon walking we did the lightning pretty sure we did lightning we did the lightning and we have the dragon walking so when the when the green flag wow always too small when i want it big so when the green flag is clicked i'll go to i'm gonna make it a precise coordinate because i want it not to be that cheap okay so that's already negative 38 but i just already and then i gotta make a variable dragon hp because dragons have hp too you know well if they're actually real i don't know if dragons are real um it'll go forever five thousand you can make it like ten thousand twenty thousand if you really wanna challenge so that'd be nice if someone actually made like ten thousand or something that'd be a really great challenge i'll play that so when the green flag is clicked it'll go forever wait five seconds so this is where you make the dragon move and then it'll move five negative five steps because he's the wrong way right now so yeah so so yeah he's going backward so it's like this he's every five seconds he moves a little bit he just moves some steps so as you can see look looks like he's smoothing he's not moving quite yet but he's going to move in a few seconds he's moving see look he just moved so nice and then you can use three no there's not any bugs yet so yeah so we basically got the whole game coded not the whole game but like part of the game it's already looking pretty great in my opinion it's been 22 minutes actually so there might be a part two for this so bear with me if this is becomes a 40 minute video just bear with me uh winter i just donated the trees in the background we don't need those uh byebye and um yeah we can finish this bear with me if it's a 40 minute video watch it tomorrow if you want to let you watch videos for 40 minutes so yeah um we're going to work on the ladybug because no we haven't finished the dragon yet i just noticed that uh so when i receive attack dragon will change dragon hp by 100 so that's like the axe attack like where he runs up and goes the hammer so yeah and then when the green flag is clicked you'll go forever it will if then there's if then if then or dragon hp is less then okay i'll explain it later so if the dragon hp is less than zero or equal to zero then it will broadcast you win so we're gonna drag the dragon hp instead of hp for the thor cause thor is different from the dragon uh now broadcast you win you win because you killed the dragon and you need to if then if then touching the hammer which is the hammer sprite because when you throw the hammer hits him if then touching hammer then change dragon hp by 50. the reason why i made by the dragon the hammer weaker than the other one is because 50 is because uh i mean like the dr the hammer has a longer like a more faster swing i don't know like more spamble than the other one so if then touching rocks then you lose choose so yeah broadcast you lose because you lost and then um now we're gonna work on the bug yeah we can also upload the sun real quick um just extra decor you know who doesn't want some extra decoration so yeah i'm going to move the dragon hp on this side because dragon hp is on that side and then i'm going to make it like around here that should be green enough extra decor never hurt so yeah um we're gonna work on the ladybug next and then we're gonna work on the you and you lose spray so ladybug has a hunk of code so right now i'm out of time so yeah we got a lot done today um so i will be doing this in part two the bugs and everything else so see you guys next time oh yeah i forgot one thing i have to show you and also before you go please like share subscribe and comment i don't know comment anything like avenger common avenger so great see it's working look we got everything worked out but we don't have the bugs yet so but it's still i mean like it's still a game i mean like you can still kill the thing you know but you can still hit him afterwards so this is basically the game right now so i'm gonna lightning and show you the lightning so yeah um it's pretty nice in my opinion so anyways see you guys next time you
