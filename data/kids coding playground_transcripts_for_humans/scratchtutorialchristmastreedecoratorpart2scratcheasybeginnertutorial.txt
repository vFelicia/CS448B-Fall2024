00:00 - [Music]
00:08 - hey guys it's kids from playground here
00:10 - welcome and we're in the second part
00:14 - of um the christmas decorator
00:17 - so if you don't have any of this code
00:21 - you can totally copy it out right now um
00:24 - feel free to pause the video so we have
00:26 - this
00:28 - we have this we have
00:32 - this we have all of this
00:38 - so if you don't have any of this i'm
00:39 - gonna go here
00:42 - so you can guys can copy this down feel
00:44 - free to pause
00:45 - so these are these three parts you can
00:48 - copy off of these three parts right now
00:51 - feel free to pause the video if if you
00:53 - don't have time
00:55 - to um copy off that quickly and candy
00:57 - cane
00:59 - it should be really simple
01:03 - just like that same with the stocking
01:07 - we're still in the um backdrop we didn't
01:10 - do yet so let's work on
01:12 - the music cuz i like music
01:16 - so uh let's get on
01:19 - the music so
01:23 - so when the green flag is clicked for
01:25 - music
01:27 - so we gotta add the extension so there's
01:29 - music pen video sensing blah blah blah
01:31 - text the speech maki makey
01:33 - i've used most of all of these so
01:37 - um uh the music should be really simple
01:40 - it's not it takes a lot of time to do it
01:43 - but
01:44 - it will it's pretty simple and it's easy
01:46 - to code
01:49 - do it in the backdrop because it can
01:51 - play sounds so um go forever
01:55 - play note
01:59 - play note 64. so when you click on this
02:05 - so when you click on this it will find a
02:08 - whole entire piano keyboard
02:10 - and um let's see so if i have a whole
02:14 - entire piano
02:15 - so i i know how to play piano because i
02:17 - do play piano so this is the c
02:19 - this is d this is e this is f this is g
02:22 - this is
02:22 - um a this is b and this is c again so
02:26 - um so we're not going to use
02:29 - i think we're not going to use a c or
02:31 - any of this stuff so we're going to use
02:33 - 64 which is
02:34 - e so e and then we could just duplicate
02:38 - this
02:39 - because it's our jingle bell so we can
02:41 - duplicate this again
02:44 - what it keeps on playing so i think it's
02:48 - so it's here for
02:52 - uh seven times and the third one you
02:55 - gotta make it
02:56 - point seven five a little bit longer
02:59 - like that
03:01 - if you ever heard jingle bells it's like
03:04 - the third beat it has that
03:05 - so let's duplicate
03:08 - so you can already hear the uh um thing
03:12 - this is 0.7 as well so let's
03:15 - hear this
03:19 - so let's see it
03:23 - [Music]
03:27 - so we need another of these 0.25
03:30 - oh yeah 0.25 soon
03:32 - [Music]
03:36 - so it's a 0.25 another 0.25
03:42 - and uh 0.75
03:47 - a 0.25 a 0.25 and another 0.75
03:51 - so we need six of those and another of
03:58 - those
04:01 - put this right on the bottom and we have
04:04 - to play a different note so let's go
04:06 - let's see
04:10 - so to play
04:15 - 67 which is
04:18 - it's uh g so 67 then back to
04:23 - and then 60 we do you see i actually
04:26 - think we do yeah and then the 62
04:31 - i think 62 is
04:37 - is d so uh for 0.25 beats
04:42 - and then play note 64
04:49 - 64 for zero
04:52 - for one b just one b and
04:56 - let's do this so we're gonna play note
05:02 - 65
05:04 - for 0.25 beats
05:11 - and duplicate this again because we're
05:13 - playing this again
05:15 - and then we're going to add this on and
05:18 - then play note
05:19 - 65 4.5 which is larger than
05:24 - 0.25 which is 0.50 which is 0.50
05:28 - so 0.5 and then we have
05:32 - 65 again
05:35 - right over here so i think we should
05:38 - hear it first because
05:40 - yeah this is good
05:45 - yeah okay and then um
05:48 - duplicate this is 64.
05:51 - 4.25 um
05:54 - six four and then another one another
05:57 - six four
06:01 - so a six five another six five two more
06:04 - six
06:05 - fours another six four
06:13 - and so i'm missing two six four so let's
06:16 - put this on
06:18 - uh and then we need a six
06:21 - two which is possibly d
06:26 - and another six two
06:29 - four point five instead of uh uh uh 0.25
06:35 - and then
06:38 - let's do 64 again
06:41 - or 0.25 beats
06:46 - and then we play 62
06:50 - for 0.75
06:55 - uh and play 67
07:02 - [Music]
07:03 - 67 40.5 piece
07:09 - so we did not finish the whole entire
07:11 - jingle bells because it's
07:13 - just like a part of it is just
07:16 - so much so you guys can um
07:19 - definitely watch a tutorial how to play
07:21 - on a piano
07:22 - and then um and then do it on your own
07:26 - and finish the jingle bells if you want
07:28 - and then we're gonna work on the snow
07:32 - so i'm gonna show you how it works so
07:34 - right now we have the santa the jingle
07:36 - bells are playing
07:37 - stocking candy cane
07:40 - gift box gift tree
07:43 - [Music]
07:49 - so we put on the forever so make it go
07:52 - on forever
07:53 - so let's work on the snow now
07:57 - so this has a lot
08:00 - of code so
08:04 - let's start on
08:07 - our variables so we're going to make a
08:08 - variable called
08:11 - wind so
08:14 - when the green flag is clicked it'll go
08:17 - forever
08:19 - let's zoom in a little bit and it'll set
08:24 - wind
08:27 - to pick random
08:33 - one negative one to one
08:40 - so make like the wind go like the snow
08:43 - go around here so
08:46 - let's see so when the when when the
08:49 - green flag is clicked
08:51 - we'll set ghost effect
08:59 - to a hundred
09:03 - and it'll go to the position i already
09:06 - have it
09:07 - and the y240
09:11 - change this and
09:14 - forever
09:17 - it'll create a clone of myself
09:21 - and i'll wait a pic random of seconds so
09:24 - it'll wait
09:27 - pick random one
09:30 - two zero zero
09:33 - point zero zero five to
09:38 - zero point zero and it still will start
09:41 - falling
09:42 - so when i start as a clone
09:47 - go set size
09:53 - to pick random
10:00 - 60 to 90 so it'll be
10:03 - 60 to 100 you can do that if you want so
10:05 - some snow will be bigger some snow will
10:07 - be smaller
10:08 - and it'll go to
10:14 - oh go to pick random
10:19 - let's just duplicate this pick random uh
10:23 - negative 240 to
10:26 - 240 and the y is 220.
10:32 - it's gonna be all around here because
10:33 - this is x and this is y so it'll be all
10:36 - around here
10:38 - i'll repeat four times
10:43 - no change ghost effect by net minus 20
10:46 - so
10:50 - yeah change ghost effect
10:55 - by minus 20 negative 20.
11:00 - so this will make it more dimmer which
11:02 - is um
11:04 - yeah which is good so i'll repeat
11:07 - two times
11:11 - you know change y by negative five
11:17 - so fall down
11:20 - and then we'll change x by wind
11:24 - so go around in a round and round
11:29 - yeah so so i got below to the right
11:32 - so that's basically what the wind is and
11:34 - a little bit to the left so
11:35 - and i'll repeat until
11:39 - so there's a lot of hunka code here
11:42 - so i'll repeat until
11:51 - so actually this is not needed what i
11:54 - just coded is not needed this part so we
11:57 - can just move into here and then
11:59 - delete the repeat two times and put this
12:02 - back
12:02 - up so um you know or
12:07 - and uh another or and
12:11 - another or and an
12:14 - another or
12:18 - and another or which is the fourth form
12:20 - so
12:21 - four wars five things so if it's
12:24 - touching the gift box
12:32 - or it's touching so i'm just gonna
12:34 - duplicate this
12:35 - we're touching the
12:40 - the tree which is the christmas tree
12:43 - i don't know if it's touching the same
12:44 - time then the santa
12:49 - and or the
12:53 - candy cane or the
12:57 - sock which is the stocking
13:01 - or the oopsies
13:04 - you need this ore to be inside or this
13:08 - sock
13:11 - or the edge
13:16 - um you'll disappear so let's do this do
13:19 - it where is it
13:20 - where's edge right there so
13:23 - a bunch of words so
13:27 - and let's work on some other things so
13:29 - let's repeat until
13:31 - re i mean repeat 10 times in an if then
13:35 - statement
13:38 - if then it's not
13:43 - touching color
13:46 - white
13:51 - where's this white
13:55 - uh then it will change
13:59 - y by minus negative two minus two
14:03 - change y
14:08 - and then you'll change x
14:13 - by a divide
14:17 - by the wind
14:22 - divided by 2.5
14:28 - you know else else go to the ghost
14:30 - effect
14:33 - and we'll change the ghost effect
14:38 - let's change ghost effect by
14:41 - 10 outside of here
14:51 - so i'm in the delete the clone right
14:53 - afterwards so
14:54 - delete outside so let's
14:58 - try sorry about this guys but
15:01 - we do actually need to repeat two times
15:05 - um i thought we that was not needed but
15:07 - it actually is
15:09 - so um so we have to do the touching edge
15:11 - so because
15:12 - um if it doesn't that means it uh
15:16 - it will get on the it will touch the
15:19 - edge which is on the top so
15:21 - it will disappear in the top so you need
15:22 - to repeat two times change
15:24 - y by minus five and i just duplicate it
15:27 - now
15:30 - let's try it see look it's working yay
15:33 - so so um
15:37 - look it's it's not it's not touching
15:40 - the um the when it touches the candy
15:43 - cane
15:44 - it goes away yeah but we didn't do the
15:47 - tree
15:47 - because the tree um but when it's
15:50 - touching the present box
15:51 - the gift box or the
15:53 - [Music]
16:00 - anyways um i think that might be it for
16:05 - this video
16:06 - um please like share subscribe
16:09 - and yeah um let's rename this before we
16:13 - go
16:14 - uh christmas tree decorator
16:28 - so
16:31 - so let's type that so let's do this so
16:35 - anyways see you guys for this uh video
16:39 - merry christmas and see you guys next
16:42 - [Music]
16:48 - time
16:51 - [Music]
16:52 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys it's kids from playground here welcome and we're in the second part of um the christmas decorator so if you don't have any of this code you can totally copy it out right now um feel free to pause the video so we have this we have this we have this we have all of this so if you don't have any of this i'm gonna go here so you can guys can copy this down feel free to pause so these are these three parts you can copy off of these three parts right now feel free to pause the video if if you don't have time to um copy off that quickly and candy cane it should be really simple just like that same with the stocking we're still in the um backdrop we didn't do yet so let's work on the music cuz i like music so uh let's get on the music so so when the green flag is clicked for music so we gotta add the extension so there's music pen video sensing blah blah blah text the speech maki makey i've used most of all of these so um uh the music should be really simple it's not it takes a lot of time to do it but it will it's pretty simple and it's easy to code do it in the backdrop because it can play sounds so um go forever play note play note 64. so when you click on this so when you click on this it will find a whole entire piano keyboard and um let's see so if i have a whole entire piano so i i know how to play piano because i do play piano so this is the c this is d this is e this is f this is g this is um a this is b and this is c again so um so we're not going to use i think we're not going to use a c or any of this stuff so we're going to use 64 which is e so e and then we could just duplicate this because it's our jingle bell so we can duplicate this again what it keeps on playing so i think it's so it's here for uh seven times and the third one you gotta make it point seven five a little bit longer like that if you ever heard jingle bells it's like the third beat it has that so let's duplicate so you can already hear the uh um thing this is 0.7 as well so let's hear this so let's see it so we need another of these 0.25 oh yeah 0.25 soon so it's a 0.25 another 0.25 and uh 0.75 a 0.25 a 0.25 and another 0.75 so we need six of those and another of those put this right on the bottom and we have to play a different note so let's go let's see so to play 67 which is it's uh g so 67 then back to and then 60 we do you see i actually think we do yeah and then the 62 i think 62 is is d so uh for 0.25 beats and then play note 64 64 for zero for one b just one b and let's do this so we're gonna play note 65 for 0.25 beats and duplicate this again because we're playing this again and then we're going to add this on and then play note 65 4.5 which is larger than 0.25 which is 0.50 which is 0.50 so 0.5 and then we have 65 again right over here so i think we should hear it first because yeah this is good yeah okay and then um duplicate this is 64. 4.25 um six four and then another one another six four so a six five another six five two more six fours another six four and so i'm missing two six four so let's put this on uh and then we need a six two which is possibly d and another six two four point five instead of uh uh uh 0.25 and then let's do 64 again or 0.25 beats and then we play 62 for 0.75 uh and play 67 67 40.5 piece so we did not finish the whole entire jingle bells because it's just like a part of it is just so much so you guys can um definitely watch a tutorial how to play on a piano and then um and then do it on your own and finish the jingle bells if you want and then we're gonna work on the snow so i'm gonna show you how it works so right now we have the santa the jingle bells are playing stocking candy cane gift box gift tree so we put on the forever so make it go on forever so let's work on the snow now so this has a lot of code so let's start on our variables so we're going to make a variable called wind so when the green flag is clicked it'll go forever let's zoom in a little bit and it'll set wind to pick random one negative one to one so make like the wind go like the snow go around here so let's see so when the when when the green flag is clicked we'll set ghost effect to a hundred and it'll go to the position i already have it and the y240 change this and forever it'll create a clone of myself and i'll wait a pic random of seconds so it'll wait pick random one two zero zero point zero zero five to zero point zero and it still will start falling so when i start as a clone go set size to pick random 60 to 90 so it'll be 60 to 100 you can do that if you want so some snow will be bigger some snow will be smaller and it'll go to oh go to pick random let's just duplicate this pick random uh negative 240 to 240 and the y is 220. it's gonna be all around here because this is x and this is y so it'll be all around here i'll repeat four times no change ghost effect by net minus 20 so yeah change ghost effect by minus 20 negative 20. so this will make it more dimmer which is um yeah which is good so i'll repeat two times you know change y by negative five so fall down and then we'll change x by wind so go around in a round and round yeah so so i got below to the right so that's basically what the wind is and a little bit to the left so and i'll repeat until so there's a lot of hunka code here so i'll repeat until so actually this is not needed what i just coded is not needed this part so we can just move into here and then delete the repeat two times and put this back up so um you know or and uh another or and another or and an another or and another or which is the fourth form so four wars five things so if it's touching the gift box or it's touching so i'm just gonna duplicate this we're touching the the tree which is the christmas tree i don't know if it's touching the same time then the santa and or the candy cane or the sock which is the stocking or the oopsies you need this ore to be inside or this sock or the edge um you'll disappear so let's do this do it where is it where's edge right there so a bunch of words so and let's work on some other things so let's repeat until re i mean repeat 10 times in an if then statement if then it's not touching color white where's this white uh then it will change y by minus negative two minus two change y and then you'll change x by a divide by the wind divided by 2.5 you know else else go to the ghost effect and we'll change the ghost effect let's change ghost effect by 10 outside of here so i'm in the delete the clone right afterwards so delete outside so let's try sorry about this guys but we do actually need to repeat two times um i thought we that was not needed but it actually is so um so we have to do the touching edge so because um if it doesn't that means it uh it will get on the it will touch the edge which is on the top so it will disappear in the top so you need to repeat two times change y by minus five and i just duplicate it now let's try it see look it's working yay so so um look it's it's not it's not touching the um the when it touches the candy cane it goes away yeah but we didn't do the tree because the tree um but when it's touching the present box the gift box or the anyways um i think that might be it for this video um please like share subscribe and yeah um let's rename this before we go uh christmas tree decorator so so let's type that so let's do this so anyways see you guys for this uh video merry christmas and see you guys next time you
