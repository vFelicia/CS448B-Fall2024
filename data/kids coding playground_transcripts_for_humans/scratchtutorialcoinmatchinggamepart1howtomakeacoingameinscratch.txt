00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:09 - kids coding playground
00:10 - today we'll be working on a coin
00:12 - matching game so the objective of the
00:14 - game
00:14 - is to match the amount of coins it takes
00:17 - to match the target number so 85
00:19 - right here you're supposed to like
00:21 - select the amount of each coin
00:23 - you use to match the target number if
00:26 - um you have to do it in the least amount
00:28 - of steps but if
00:30 - if you do it in the in the least amount
00:32 - of steps
00:33 - then you get um a point but if you don't
00:36 - then it'll say sorry
00:37 - um that's correct but that is not the
00:39 - least amount of steps
00:41 - and right here it says match the value
00:43 - below with the least amount of coins so
00:45 - you have to use the least amount of
00:46 - coins
00:48 - so in this tutorial i'll be learning
00:51 - these font concepts variables
00:53 - broadcasting messages
00:54 - the custom block operators and pick
00:57 - random
00:58 - so before we begin our tutorial um
01:01 - 86 of you guys are not subscribed
01:05 - and only 12 percent of you guys are
01:06 - subscribed so please subscribe to make
01:08 - these numbers higher
01:10 - because only 12 percent of you guys are
01:12 - subscribed and 86
01:14 - or not so without further ado let's
01:17 - get on to the video so i'm going to demo
01:19 - the game
01:21 - so let's try that so in the beginning
01:25 - i'll just say the instructions click the
01:28 - space bar to begin
01:30 - and then um 17 right here
01:33 - so you use one ten cent one five cent
01:36 - and two
01:36 - one cents so when you check it you'll
01:38 - say that is correct
01:40 - let's say you don't do it in the least
01:42 - amount of steps and you click the new to
01:44 - get a new number
01:46 - okay so new 72 let's say don't do it in
01:50 - the least amount of steps let's do
01:52 - this
01:54 - [Music]
01:57 - see this that is correct but that is not
01:59 - the least amount of coins
02:00 - so that is not the least amount of coins
02:03 - so that means you have to do this
02:07 - three of these and two of these
02:09 - [Music]
02:10 - oh sorry sorry um two of these and then
02:14 - you have to use
02:14 - um two of these and the two of these
02:18 - so let's say you get it correct so let's
02:22 - get a new number
02:22 - 29 let's say you just do this if you say
02:25 - that isn't correct
02:26 - try again so yeah that's pretty much the
02:28 - game
02:29 - and you have to match the target number
02:31 - so yeah
02:33 - let's start a new project
02:36 - all right so i started a new project so
02:38 - first let's rename our new project
02:40 - to coin matching
02:45 - coin matching game so i'm gonna delete
02:48 - the scratch cat because i don't need it
02:50 - and i'm gonna drag in some other stuff
02:51 - so let's go to the backdrop
02:53 - okay so now let's go to our backdrop um
02:57 - right here so i'm gonna go to my
02:58 - backpack i will not be needing this but
03:01 - first we'll get the
03:02 - instructions page let me delete this one
03:05 - and then we'll be needing this backdrop
03:08 - this is like the um
03:09 - match the value this backdrop with all
03:12 - the scents
03:12 - and stuff like that so that's the
03:15 - backdrop i'll be having
03:17 - and then for the sprites i'm going to
03:19 - upload
03:20 - the check sprite the new sprite
03:24 - um these sprites i will need to upload
03:28 - multiple of these
03:32 - but i'll rename them so it'll be easier
03:35 - for
03:35 - for you guys to uh read it so i need
03:38 - four
03:39 - uh four sets of them so down since this
03:42 - is a one cent
03:43 - i'm gonna like um put this
03:46 - as down i'm gonna name this down one and
03:49 - up one and then this can be named down
03:53 - five because it's five cents and then we
03:55 - have up
03:56 - five and then we have down
04:00 - 10 up 10
04:05 - and down 25
04:09 - up 25.
04:13 - so as you can see all of them are
04:15 - stacked on top of each other
04:16 - so what i'm going to do here is going to
04:18 - hide all of these
04:20 - um except for one set of them so then i
04:23 - can um
04:24 - put them where i want it to be just hide
04:26 - all of this
04:27 - so i have 25 one so i'm gonna put that
04:29 - right here
04:31 - down here let's put it
04:35 - also like right here
04:38 - like that move this in a little bit more
04:42 - like that okay so i'm gonna high i'm
04:45 - gonna
04:45 - show this one and show this one so the
04:48 - ten cent ones
04:49 - you know like right here
04:53 - and then put this one about like right
04:55 - here
04:57 - like that okay and then we're gonna show
04:59 - the five
05:01 - and the other five
05:04 - right here and right here
05:09 - and then finally the one cent ones
05:14 - put that right here and put the other
05:17 - one right here
05:18 - all right so now we have all of the
05:21 - arrows um it might not be very good
05:25 - so yeah now we have all the arrows
05:30 - um okay so i
05:33 - um put these two together so
05:36 - now you know that this is one cent five
05:38 - cent tencent and 25 cents
05:40 - group them together so we will be
05:42 - putting these in our google drive so you
05:44 - can download them
05:45 - from the google drive and so this is how
05:48 - i drew the backdrop by the way so
05:50 - i just drew a circle and one cent but if
05:53 - you want to put the actual send sign
05:55 - you have to do this so on windows it's
05:57 - like
05:58 - alt 0 1 6 2 and you get a sent sign
06:02 - so if you're in windows just do alt 0162
06:05 - you get the send sign
06:07 - but if you're not on windows you can
06:09 - just write send
06:10 - something like that and then i just
06:12 - wrote match the value below with the
06:14 - least amount of coins so i'll put the
06:15 - variable
06:16 - the target number right here and then
06:18 - i'll put the amount of one cents amount
06:20 - of five cents an amount of 10 cents and
06:21 - the amount of 25 cents
06:23 - used in these boxes and these are just
06:26 - like blue
06:27 - rectangles i just drew so
06:30 - and then this i just drew a green
06:31 - backdrop wrote the instructions
06:34 - and press the spacebar to begin so
06:37 - that's what i did
06:39 - all right and let me delete this
06:43 - because i'm not going to be using that
06:45 - okay
06:46 - oops
06:52 - okay so now let's continue um i also got
06:55 - a retro robot from the scratch library
06:57 - you can just get it from here
06:59 - retro robot this thing
07:02 - and i just changed the costume this one
07:06 - and i just made it like 50 size because
07:10 - it's too big actually no it's maybe 75
07:14 - okay so now it's a little bit better so
07:16 - i'm going to make it turn to the left
07:19 - do that select the don't rotate and then
07:22 - negative 90.
07:23 - so now it's going to rotate to the left
07:27 - all right now let's work on the backdrop
07:30 - code so the backdrop code i just
07:31 - made a music so let's get a one green
07:34 - flag clicked
07:36 - set the volume to 50 so it isn't too
07:39 - loud
07:40 - uh let 15 zoom in a little bit
07:44 - okay so i get it forever loop and i just
07:46 - pick the xylophone music
07:48 - um you guys pick any sound you want i
07:51 - just got one from the sprite library i
07:52 - mean sound library
07:54 - um cylo
07:58 - xylo one i took this one this one
08:02 - go to sounds and get a play sound until
08:06 - done
08:06 - and put in the focal loop okay so now
08:09 - we're gonna go to the retro robot
08:14 - okay for the retro robot i'm gonna start
08:17 - with the um
08:18 - making a bunch of variables so we're
08:20 - gonna make
08:22 - um selected one
08:28 - one selected one so there's like the
08:30 - amount of
08:31 - selected for the one cent variable one
08:33 - cent um
08:35 - and then we're gonna make selected five
08:42 - five and then i made selected
08:46 - all the way up to 25 so select
08:49 - selected ten i'm not going to put a
08:52 - space and then
08:55 - selected 25.
08:59 - select the 25 and hide these variables
09:03 - for now we'll show them later and then
09:05 - we also made a um
09:08 - a bunch more so this is calculated we'll
09:11 - need these in the future
09:13 - to find the fastest way to um
09:17 - uh do this fastest way to get the
09:20 - coins and we need calculated
09:24 - five calculated five
09:28 - and then we're going to do calculated 10
09:33 - all the way up to 25. and then
09:36 - calculated 25
09:41 - and then we're also going to make
09:42 - another variable called target so that's
09:43 - the target number you want to
09:45 - get and then we'll make one more called
09:47 - remainder
09:49 - that's to find the remainder target
09:52 - and remainder
10:00 - remainder so those are all my variables
10:02 - pretty sure
10:03 - okay let's work on the
10:07 - retro robot first so let's get our one
10:08 - green flag clicked
10:10 - let's zoom in a little bit let's go hide
10:13 - i'm gonna hide him in the beginning
10:17 - and then because you know why because we
10:19 - have this backdrop
10:20 - and i don't want to show right there so
10:23 - we want to hide
10:24 - the robot in the beginning so hide
10:28 - and then we want to hide the variable
10:30 - selected
10:31 - one so these are the amount of select
10:35 - um the amount each one is selected so
10:37 - i'm going to hide
10:38 - all of them hide selected 5
10:41 - high selected 10 and 25.
10:46 - 10 and 25. so i'm also going to hide the
10:50 - variable target we'll need that later
10:53 - target uh right here so next we're going
10:56 - to get one green flag clicked again
11:00 - and we're gonna switch the backdrop to
11:02 - backdrop one
11:04 - oops backdrop to backdrop one which is
11:06 - uh i mean two
11:08 - i'm pretty sure backdrop two is my um
11:11 - this one
11:13 - i'm gonna name it to backdrop one and
11:15 - this one to backdrop two so i won't get
11:17 - that confused
11:18 - so backdrop one is my um
11:21 - uh the instructions page so i'm gonna go
11:23 - to batch one
11:25 - and then i'm gonna go to control wait
11:27 - until
11:29 - key space is being pressed so i'm gonna
11:31 - wait until the spacebar is being pressed
11:33 - and then when the spacebar is pressed
11:35 - then we're gonna switch backdrop to
11:36 - backdrop two
11:38 - which is the other backdrop and then
11:41 - we're going to go to events
11:42 - when backdrop switches to backdrop 2
11:45 - then we want to show the robot
11:49 - show the robot and um
11:52 - let's show all of these variables right
11:54 - here
11:56 - show calcul uh selected oh yeah these
11:58 - should be
11:59 - uh selected not calculated sorry about
12:01 - that
12:02 - selected five selected 10 and selected
12:06 - 25 not calculated
12:07 - you should be all selected so we're
12:09 - gonna show the selected variables right
12:11 - here
12:12 - so show selected one selected five
12:16 - and selected ten and twenty five ten
12:20 - and twenty five all right so now we have
12:23 - all of the variables set
12:25 - let's go on to the um new let's go to
12:28 - the newsprint
12:29 - and before i uh continue into the new
12:31 - sprite i want to show you
12:33 - how to position all of them so i'm going
12:35 - to show all of the selected variables
12:38 - and the target so what you want to do is
12:40 - double click and it'll become
12:42 - like this and you just put it right here
12:44 - so that's not going to be a target one
12:46 - selected one i'm just gonna put it right
12:48 - here
12:50 - right here so double click so then it'll
12:52 - become smaller
12:53 - and if you double click again it'll
12:55 - become a slider like this
12:56 - but we will not need that so we're just
12:58 - going to use this one
13:04 - put that in here and this one
13:07 - so that's how it would look if you're
13:09 - wondering how
13:11 - and now let's get on to the new sprite
13:13 - so
13:15 - in the new we're going to get a one flag
13:17 - clicked we want to hide it
13:18 - in the beginning hide
13:22 - we want to hide it and then when the
13:25 - backdrop switches the backdrop too
13:26 - which is the um other one
13:30 - the the spectrum then we want to show
13:34 - and then when green flag is being
13:36 - clicked we're gonna get
13:37 - set the target to pick random one to one
13:40 - hundred
13:41 - so the target number will be a random
13:43 - number from one to one hundred
13:45 - so we're gonna make it one two one
13:48 - hundred
13:50 - and we're gonna set the selected to one
13:52 - zero
13:53 - sorry set selected to zero
13:56 - we're gonna set all the selected to zero
13:59 - sorry
14:00 - so then um in the beginning no coins
14:03 - should be selected
14:04 - select five should be zero and then
14:08 - selected
14:08 - 10 and 25 should also be zero
14:12 - okay and then when this sprite is being
14:15 - clicked the new button is being clicked
14:18 - when sprite is clicked
14:21 - and we want to set the selected all of
14:23 - them to zero
14:25 - because you're making a new a new number
14:29 - and then we're gonna also set the target
14:32 - i'm gonna duplicate this and put that
14:35 - down here
14:36 - so what the new thing is when you click
14:39 - it i'll give you a new number
14:40 - so when the spread is clicked it'll set
14:42 - everything back to zero and set the
14:44 - target to pick random 100
14:46 - so that's from the new sprite and
14:48 - finally let's do the check spray
14:51 - so for the check sprite we're gonna get
14:54 - uh
14:54 - when fly clicked we want to hide
14:59 - hide and after hiding when the backdrop
15:02 - switches the backdrop to
15:05 - which is the coin backdrop this one
15:08 - then we want to show
15:12 - then when this sprite is clicked
15:15 - then we want to broadcast the message
15:17 - called check answer which we'll reuse
15:19 - later
15:21 - check check answer
15:26 - all right i think we're gonna stop here
15:28 - so that's
15:29 - what we did today the check new and the
15:32 - setup
15:33 - so um we'll continue on the next part
15:36 - uh tomorrow so don't forget to like
15:40 - share and subscribe and ring the
15:42 - notification bell
15:43 - see you guys in the next video
15:54 - [Music]
15:54 - you

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today we'll be working on a coin matching game so the objective of the game is to match the amount of coins it takes to match the target number so 85 right here you're supposed to like select the amount of each coin you use to match the target number if um you have to do it in the least amount of steps but if if you do it in the in the least amount of steps then you get um a point but if you don't then it'll say sorry um that's correct but that is not the least amount of steps and right here it says match the value below with the least amount of coins so you have to use the least amount of coins so in this tutorial i'll be learning these font concepts variables broadcasting messages the custom block operators and pick random so before we begin our tutorial um 86 of you guys are not subscribed and only 12 percent of you guys are subscribed so please subscribe to make these numbers higher because only 12 percent of you guys are subscribed and 86 or not so without further ado let's get on to the video so i'm going to demo the game so let's try that so in the beginning i'll just say the instructions click the space bar to begin and then um 17 right here so you use one ten cent one five cent and two one cents so when you check it you'll say that is correct let's say you don't do it in the least amount of steps and you click the new to get a new number okay so new 72 let's say don't do it in the least amount of steps let's do this see this that is correct but that is not the least amount of coins so that is not the least amount of coins so that means you have to do this three of these and two of these oh sorry sorry um two of these and then you have to use um two of these and the two of these so let's say you get it correct so let's get a new number 29 let's say you just do this if you say that isn't correct try again so yeah that's pretty much the game and you have to match the target number so yeah let's start a new project all right so i started a new project so first let's rename our new project to coin matching coin matching game so i'm gonna delete the scratch cat because i don't need it and i'm gonna drag in some other stuff so let's go to the backdrop okay so now let's go to our backdrop um right here so i'm gonna go to my backpack i will not be needing this but first we'll get the instructions page let me delete this one and then we'll be needing this backdrop this is like the um match the value this backdrop with all the scents and stuff like that so that's the backdrop i'll be having and then for the sprites i'm going to upload the check sprite the new sprite um these sprites i will need to upload multiple of these but i'll rename them so it'll be easier for for you guys to uh read it so i need four uh four sets of them so down since this is a one cent i'm gonna like um put this as down i'm gonna name this down one and up one and then this can be named down five because it's five cents and then we have up five and then we have down 10 up 10 and down 25 up 25. so as you can see all of them are stacked on top of each other so what i'm going to do here is going to hide all of these um except for one set of them so then i can um put them where i want it to be just hide all of this so i have 25 one so i'm gonna put that right here down here let's put it also like right here like that move this in a little bit more like that okay so i'm gonna high i'm gonna show this one and show this one so the ten cent ones you know like right here and then put this one about like right here like that okay and then we're gonna show the five and the other five right here and right here and then finally the one cent ones put that right here and put the other one right here all right so now we have all of the arrows um it might not be very good so yeah now we have all the arrows um okay so i um put these two together so now you know that this is one cent five cent tencent and 25 cents group them together so we will be putting these in our google drive so you can download them from the google drive and so this is how i drew the backdrop by the way so i just drew a circle and one cent but if you want to put the actual send sign you have to do this so on windows it's like alt 0 1 6 2 and you get a sent sign so if you're in windows just do alt 0162 you get the send sign but if you're not on windows you can just write send something like that and then i just wrote match the value below with the least amount of coins so i'll put the variable the target number right here and then i'll put the amount of one cents amount of five cents an amount of 10 cents and the amount of 25 cents used in these boxes and these are just like blue rectangles i just drew so and then this i just drew a green backdrop wrote the instructions and press the spacebar to begin so that's what i did all right and let me delete this because i'm not going to be using that okay oops okay so now let's continue um i also got a retro robot from the scratch library you can just get it from here retro robot this thing and i just changed the costume this one and i just made it like 50 size because it's too big actually no it's maybe 75 okay so now it's a little bit better so i'm going to make it turn to the left do that select the don't rotate and then negative 90. so now it's going to rotate to the left all right now let's work on the backdrop code so the backdrop code i just made a music so let's get a one green flag clicked set the volume to 50 so it isn't too loud uh let 15 zoom in a little bit okay so i get it forever loop and i just pick the xylophone music um you guys pick any sound you want i just got one from the sprite library i mean sound library um cylo xylo one i took this one this one go to sounds and get a play sound until done and put in the focal loop okay so now we're gonna go to the retro robot okay for the retro robot i'm gonna start with the um making a bunch of variables so we're gonna make um selected one one selected one so there's like the amount of selected for the one cent variable one cent um and then we're gonna make selected five five and then i made selected all the way up to 25 so select selected ten i'm not going to put a space and then selected 25. select the 25 and hide these variables for now we'll show them later and then we also made a um a bunch more so this is calculated we'll need these in the future to find the fastest way to um uh do this fastest way to get the coins and we need calculated five calculated five and then we're going to do calculated 10 all the way up to 25. and then calculated 25 and then we're also going to make another variable called target so that's the target number you want to get and then we'll make one more called remainder that's to find the remainder target and remainder remainder so those are all my variables pretty sure okay let's work on the retro robot first so let's get our one green flag clicked let's zoom in a little bit let's go hide i'm gonna hide him in the beginning and then because you know why because we have this backdrop and i don't want to show right there so we want to hide the robot in the beginning so hide and then we want to hide the variable selected one so these are the amount of select um the amount each one is selected so i'm going to hide all of them hide selected 5 high selected 10 and 25. 10 and 25. so i'm also going to hide the variable target we'll need that later target uh right here so next we're going to get one green flag clicked again and we're gonna switch the backdrop to backdrop one oops backdrop to backdrop one which is uh i mean two i'm pretty sure backdrop two is my um this one i'm gonna name it to backdrop one and this one to backdrop two so i won't get that confused so backdrop one is my um uh the instructions page so i'm gonna go to batch one and then i'm gonna go to control wait until key space is being pressed so i'm gonna wait until the spacebar is being pressed and then when the spacebar is pressed then we're gonna switch backdrop to backdrop two which is the other backdrop and then we're going to go to events when backdrop switches to backdrop 2 then we want to show the robot show the robot and um let's show all of these variables right here show calcul uh selected oh yeah these should be uh selected not calculated sorry about that selected five selected 10 and selected 25 not calculated you should be all selected so we're gonna show the selected variables right here so show selected one selected five and selected ten and twenty five ten and twenty five all right so now we have all of the variables set let's go on to the um new let's go to the newsprint and before i uh continue into the new sprite i want to show you how to position all of them so i'm going to show all of the selected variables and the target so what you want to do is double click and it'll become like this and you just put it right here so that's not going to be a target one selected one i'm just gonna put it right here right here so double click so then it'll become smaller and if you double click again it'll become a slider like this but we will not need that so we're just going to use this one put that in here and this one so that's how it would look if you're wondering how and now let's get on to the new sprite so in the new we're going to get a one flag clicked we want to hide it in the beginning hide we want to hide it and then when the backdrop switches the backdrop too which is the um other one the the spectrum then we want to show and then when green flag is being clicked we're gonna get set the target to pick random one to one hundred so the target number will be a random number from one to one hundred so we're gonna make it one two one hundred and we're gonna set the selected to one zero sorry set selected to zero we're gonna set all the selected to zero sorry so then um in the beginning no coins should be selected select five should be zero and then selected 10 and 25 should also be zero okay and then when this sprite is being clicked the new button is being clicked when sprite is clicked and we want to set the selected all of them to zero because you're making a new a new number and then we're gonna also set the target i'm gonna duplicate this and put that down here so what the new thing is when you click it i'll give you a new number so when the spread is clicked it'll set everything back to zero and set the target to pick random 100 so that's from the new sprite and finally let's do the check spray so for the check sprite we're gonna get uh when fly clicked we want to hide hide and after hiding when the backdrop switches the backdrop to which is the coin backdrop this one then we want to show then when this sprite is clicked then we want to broadcast the message called check answer which we'll reuse later check check answer all right i think
