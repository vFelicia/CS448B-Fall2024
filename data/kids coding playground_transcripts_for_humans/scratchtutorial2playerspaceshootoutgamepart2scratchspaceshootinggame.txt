00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to kids cutting
00:09 - playground
00:09 - today we'll be making the second part
00:11 - for the space shootout game
00:13 - so i will be um i will be sharing this
00:18 - project so if you have any confusion on
00:20 - it
00:21 - you can just check it out on my scratch
00:23 - account
00:25 - so i'm just gonna review the code so
00:27 - this is the movement code
00:29 - and setting stuff in the beginning for
00:31 - the player one
00:33 - this is for player two
00:36 - the movement for player two and
00:39 - laser one over here
00:46 - so this is the code for the player one
00:48 - laser
00:49 - and this is the code for the laser laser
00:52 - for the second one
00:54 - laser one and laser two are pretty much
00:56 - the same thing except for some
00:57 - different sensing you just have to
01:00 - switch it
01:01 - switch it around and one more thing we
01:05 - have to add
01:06 - so this is if this is for if the player
01:08 - will die
01:09 - so if the shield will need this later
01:13 - so if uh the shield is less than or
01:17 - equal to zero
01:23 - the player one shield this is for player
01:25 - one so if the player one shield is less
01:27 - than or equal to zero
01:30 - then we can broadcast a new message
01:32 - we'll need this message later
01:34 - called hide player one shield
01:43 - hide player one shield will need the
01:45 - same code for player two
01:47 - if
01:51 - if the uh player two shield
01:55 - is less than or equal to zero
02:02 - player two shield is less than or equal
02:04 - to zero then we'll broadcast another
02:06 - message
02:10 - we'll call it hide player 2 shield
02:14 - so let's go here hide
02:18 - hide player to
02:21 - shield hide player two shield
02:27 - we'll need those broadcasts later so
02:29 - let's work on the shields right now so
02:30 - this is the outside shield the player
02:32 - one shield one
02:34 - so when flag clicked i want to show it
02:38 - and get a forever loop forever
02:42 - i want this to go to the player player
02:44 - one this is for the
02:46 - player one shield and i i made this
02:49 - uh outside shield turn five degrees
02:52 - at five degrees to the right
02:56 - and if it's touching if
02:59 - touching the player two shield one
03:03 - touching player two shield one so if
03:05 - it's touching this outer shield
03:07 - player two shield one so this is to
03:10 - prevent them from going
03:11 - near each other because i found it a bug
03:13 - where if you
03:14 - uh you um if there's no bounce if they
03:17 - don't go bouncy
03:18 - if they touch each other and they don't
03:20 - bounce apart then
03:21 - one player can get on top of the other
03:23 - and kill them immediately
03:25 - so we need to broadcast a new message
03:28 - called bounce
03:29 - we'll need that later
03:33 - bounce and right here from the
03:37 - player one we broadcasted hide player
03:39 - one shield
03:40 - so when i received that we want to hide
03:45 - and then for the player 2 shield it's
03:47 - pretty much the same thing
03:49 - except we do not need that last bit of
03:51 - script
03:52 - of the bouncing part we do not need this
03:57 - this part right here this part we do not
03:59 - need
04:00 - and instead of five degrees instead of
04:03 - turning right five degrees we can turn
04:05 - left i made it turn seven degrees to the
04:08 - left
04:08 - you guys can make it however slow or
04:10 - fast you want
04:12 - the faster it is the harder it is to get
04:14 - it through both the shields
04:18 - so i did um turn left one of them and
04:21 - for the right i did turn right on them
04:24 - so um we can so now you have to turn
04:27 - right
04:28 - and turn left so it's opposite
04:31 - and for player one when it receives
04:34 - bounce
04:37 - then we can like change the x by
04:39 - negative thirty so
04:41 - they cannot come together
04:45 - [Applause]
04:46 - okay and then for player 2
04:50 - it's um we also have to do the same
04:53 - thing
04:54 - for the bounce just drag and drop it
04:56 - into player two
04:58 - and instead of negative 30 we're going
05:00 - to do 30 since
05:01 - it's already pointing to the left so
05:03 - making it go even more to the left
05:05 - wouldn't make sense
05:06 - so we have to make it 30 since it's
05:08 - already pointing to this way
05:11 - and then finally for the um
05:15 - and then for the text we have text
05:19 - this for winning and losing so
05:22 - from the uh players we broadcast i mean
05:24 - the lasers we broadcasted a message
05:27 - called player two and player one dead
05:29 - right here
05:30 - so i already have the costumes so
05:33 - player one wins and player two wins i
05:36 - made one in red and one in blue
05:38 - because this one's blue and this one's
05:39 - red
05:41 - so i'm just gonna add the code so
05:44 - when i res when i receive player two
05:49 - player one dead
05:52 - when i receive player one dead switch
05:54 - costume
05:55 - to costume one which is the first
05:58 - costume
05:59 - which is player one um i'm sorry sorry
06:03 - um
06:03 - switch to the costume two because when
06:07 - the player one is dead we want to switch
06:08 - to the second one
06:09 - noting that the second second player has
06:12 - one
06:13 - and then we want to show and stop all
06:19 - and then we need to duplicate this
06:22 - instead of player one dead we'll use
06:25 - player two dead
06:27 - player two dead instead we'll switch
06:29 - costume costume one since the player two
06:31 - is dead that means the
06:32 - player one is winning and then we want
06:35 - to show stop ball
06:36 - and then when flat clicked we want to go
06:39 - to zero zero which is
06:40 - the center go to the front layer
06:47 - and hide in the beginning
06:51 - okay so
06:54 - next finally we have to do the ladybug
06:57 - alien code
07:02 - okay so first for the ladybug alien with
07:05 - whatever you want to call it we have to
07:06 - create a custom block
07:08 - called create alien
07:14 - create alien click ok
07:17 - and then for this one every uh every
07:20 - time
07:20 - you'll clone two of them so repeat two
07:22 - times create a clone of myself
07:26 - and then for uh get a one fly clicked
07:30 - when flag is clicked we want to set this
07:32 - variable we made in the beginning
07:34 - set the alien set for player 1 that
07:36 - variable to 0
07:39 - in the beginning and then i want to set
07:40 - the size to 50 percent
07:42 - the alien should be 50 so it's not too
07:45 - big
07:46 - and then i'm going to wait one second
07:50 - and then and then it'll start creating
07:52 - aliens after one second
07:54 - so you call this block this code right
07:57 - here create alien
07:59 - and then in the scrolling platformer i
08:02 - also
08:02 - did this so we want to set the x to
08:05 - negative 99999
08:06 - so then the actual alien not the clone
08:09 - will get off the screen
08:10 - sometimes the hide does not work and i'm
08:13 - just going to put the hide here just in
08:14 - case
08:15 - so after that we want to get when i
08:18 - start as a clone
08:20 - when i start as a clone let's make it
08:24 - soon
08:24 - a little bit when i started to clone i
08:26 - want to go to
08:29 - pick random
08:32 - i want to make it pick random negative
08:35 - 200 and
08:36 - oh no you don't need this one negative
08:39 - 200
08:40 - to 200. so the aliens will spawn
08:43 - from this x position so like this one
08:46 - somewhere in between
08:48 - and then for the y i made it 150 so
08:50 - it'll be like
08:51 - spawn like above here
08:54 - and i want to show after that
08:58 - show and then after that
09:02 - um we we need to make a variable called
09:04 - flying to spaceship name
09:06 - in the beginning i told you there's one
09:08 - in the first video i told you guys
09:10 - there's one
09:11 - variable for this spread only so
09:14 - since i already i got this from a
09:16 - backpack that's why it already has it
09:18 - but this is for this sprite only make
09:20 - this variable called flying to spaceship
09:22 - name
09:23 - and it should be only for this sprite
09:27 - so remember that and then we want to set
09:29 - the flying to spaceship name
09:31 - to blank in the beginning to nothing
09:34 - and then if get an if else statement
09:39 - if that uh alien set her player
09:43 - player one is equal to zero
09:49 - alien set for player one
09:53 - then we can set the flying to spaceship
09:55 - name to player one
10:00 - player one
10:04 - player one and set the alien
10:08 - set for player one to one
10:11 - else we will do set flying to spaceship
10:14 - name to player two
10:18 - so this is just to pick random which
10:21 - spaceship the alien will go for
10:24 - and you have to spell it exactly how
10:26 - it's like
10:27 - or it'll get messed up and then we need
10:30 - to get
10:31 - a point towards point towards
10:36 - the flying to spaceship name so it can
10:39 - be either
10:40 - the player one or the player two and
10:43 - then we wanna get a repeat until
10:47 - repeat until the um is touching
10:50 - the flying to spaceship name
10:53 - whichever one player one or player two
10:57 - and then we move three steps
11:01 - move three steps if touching edge
11:05 - if it's touching the edge
11:10 - touching edge then we'll move it back
11:14 - to pick random
11:17 - pick random uh go to pick random
11:21 - negative 200
11:22 - to 200 so if it's touching the edge
11:24 - we'll make it go back somewhere up here
11:29 - and the y is 150
11:32 - and duplicate this
11:36 - so
11:40 - oh my god oops duplicate
11:45 - at this right here get an ore
11:50 - if it's touching the laser one or
11:53 - laser two
11:57 - laser one or laser two so if it's
12:00 - touching either one of those we want it
12:02 - to disappear
12:04 - um so we'll make no not disappear but
12:05 - make it just respawn somewhere up here
12:08 - to make it look like the laser will kill
12:10 - it or something
12:11 - and then next we want to get if touching
12:14 - if if
12:19 - it's touching we need three oars
12:29 - actually we only need two i think so
12:32 - and then we'll need it to do um if
12:35 - touching player one
12:38 - player one or player one
12:42 - uh shield shield one player one shield
12:45 - one
12:46 - or the player one shield two
12:49 - then we wanna broadcast player1.hit and
12:53 - wait
12:56 - player1.hit and wait and then we want to
12:58 - make it
12:59 - go back to this random position
13:04 - and then we want to just duplicate this
13:06 - whole chunk of code
13:07 - put it under here instead of player one
13:09 - we'll do player two
13:10 - instead of player one shield one do
13:12 - player two shield one
13:14 - and instead of player one shield two
13:16 - we'll do player shield two
13:17 - uh player two he'll to and then we'll
13:20 - broadcast
13:22 - player 2 got hit and then we'll make it
13:25 - go back to random position
13:28 - okay so now we are done we can save our
13:31 - project
13:31 - and i will show you guys and i also
13:35 - forgot to do one last thing
13:36 - add the code for these so i'm just going
13:39 - to drag and drop
13:41 - it for the red red shields
13:48 - forgot about that drag
13:51 - right here so for here instead of we'll
13:54 - do hide player two shield
13:58 - instead this one's hide player one
14:00 - shield this is hide player two shield
14:02 - and instead of go to player one we wanna
14:04 - make it go to player two
14:06 - and if touching player one shield one
14:09 - instead
14:11 - and then right here
14:16 - hide player two shield go to player two
14:21 - and turn instead of turn five degrees we
14:24 - make it
14:25 - turn we do not need this piece of code
14:27 - as well
14:28 - make it turn to the left seven degrees
14:33 - there you go so now let's play it
14:38 - so as you can see oh yeah let me show
14:40 - the variables
14:41 - of the shield so that you can see the
14:44 - health go down
14:46 - so i'm just going to move this on this
14:48 - side
14:49 - move this on this side i'm going to
14:50 - double click on it so then
14:52 - i'll be like that so
14:55 - my dad will be playing here so it's wasd
14:58 - and spacebar
14:59 - and then i'll do i'll be playing as
15:01 - player two
15:08 - so as you can see you can't go together
15:10 - and actually shot
15:12 - he actually my dad actually shot me
15:13 - through here
15:15 - so yeah that's pretty much the game
15:18 - and i also forgot one last thing to add
15:22 - the music so i actually download a
15:26 - non-copyright music from the youtube uh
15:29 - audio list
15:33 - so i need to get the sound
15:36 - it's just i'm just gonna upload it you
15:38 - guys can do get whatever you want
15:42 - i just got a short song i guess
15:45 - i'm just gonna do that
15:49 - and the song is kind of soft so i'm
15:51 - gonna turn up the volume
15:53 - a little bit
15:56 - so okay um and also
16:00 - i'm gonna make the hp for this a little
16:02 - bit lower maybe
16:03 - like 500 just so i can show you
16:06 - how the shield disappears at the end
16:09 - when you lose all your health
16:14 - and then so i'm just gonna destroy one
16:17 - shield
16:18 - [Music]
16:20 - oops i actually shot through it okay
16:23 - [Music]
16:28 - i might as well also change the bullet
16:30 - damage
16:31 - so then i can have like
16:34 - maybe 50 negative 50. let's see
16:38 - [Music]
16:42 - so as you can see i just destroyed the
16:44 - enemy shield
16:46 - as you can see boom it's already gone
16:51 - so i'm gonna show you guys one more time
16:54 - oh i actually went through
16:56 - [Music]
16:58 - see now the shield is gone and you can
16:59 - just one shot them
17:02 - so that is the game the two-player
17:07 - a two-player space shootout game
17:10 - and um don't forget to like share
17:13 - and subscribe and ring the notification
17:16 - bell to see all the latest updates
17:18 - on this channel and thank you guys for
17:19 - watching see you guys in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys to kids cutting playground today we'll be making the second part for the space shootout game so i will be um i will be sharing this project so if you have any confusion on it you can just check it out on my scratch account so i'm just gonna review the code so this is the movement code and setting stuff in the beginning for the player one this is for player two the movement for player two and laser one over here so this is the code for the player one laser and this is the code for the laser laser for the second one laser one and laser two are pretty much the same thing except for some different sensing you just have to switch it switch it around and one more thing we have to add so this is if this is for if the player will die so if the shield will need this later so if uh the shield is less than or equal to zero the player one shield this is for player one so if the player one shield is less than or equal to zero then we can broadcast a new message we'll need this message later called hide player one shield hide player one shield will need the same code for player two if if the uh player two shield is less than or equal to zero player two shield is less than or equal to zero then we'll broadcast another message we'll call it hide player 2 shield so let's go here hide hide player to shield hide player two shield we'll need those broadcasts later so let's work on the shields right now so this is the outside shield the player one shield one so when flag clicked i want to show it and get a forever loop forever i want this to go to the player player one this is for the player one shield and i i made this uh outside shield turn five degrees at five degrees to the right and if it's touching if touching the player two shield one touching player two shield one so if it's touching this outer shield player two shield one so this is to prevent them from going near each other because i found it a bug where if you uh you um if there's no bounce if they don't go bouncy if they touch each other and they don't bounce apart then one player can get on top of the other and kill them immediately so we need to broadcast a new message called bounce we'll need that later bounce and right here from the player one we broadcasted hide player one shield so when i received that we want to hide and then for the player 2 shield it's pretty much the same thing except we do not need that last bit of script of the bouncing part we do not need this this part right here this part we do not need and instead of five degrees instead of turning right five degrees we can turn left i made it turn seven degrees to the left you guys can make it however slow or fast you want the faster it is the harder it is to get it through both the shields so i did um turn left one of them and for the right i did turn right on them so um we can so now you have to turn right and turn left so it's opposite and for player one when it receives bounce then we can like change the x by negative thirty so they cannot come together okay and then for player 2 it's um we also have to do the same thing for the bounce just drag and drop it into player two and instead of negative 30 we're going to do 30 since it's already pointing to the left so making it go even more to the left wouldn't make sense so we have to make it 30 since it's already pointing to this way and then finally for the um and then for the text we have text this for winning and losing so from the uh players we broadcast i mean the lasers we broadcasted a message called player two and player one dead right here so i already have the costumes so player one wins and player two wins i made one in red and one in blue because this one's blue and this one's red so i'm just gonna add the code so when i res when i receive player two player one dead when i receive player one dead switch costume to costume one which is the first costume which is player one um i'm sorry sorry um switch to the costume two because when the player one is dead we want to switch to the second one noting that the second second player has one and then we want to show and stop all and then we need to duplicate this instead of player one dead we'll use player two dead player two dead instead we'll switch costume costume one since the player two is dead that means the player one is winning and then we want to show stop ball and then when flat clicked we want to go to zero zero which is the center go to the front layer and hide in the beginning okay so next finally we have to do the ladybug alien code okay so first for the ladybug alien with whatever you want to call it we have to create a custom block called create alien create alien click ok and then for this one every uh every time you'll clone two of them so repeat two times create a clone of myself and then for uh get a one fly clicked when flag is clicked we want to set this variable we made in the beginning set the alien set for player 1 that variable to 0 in the beginning and then i want to set the size to 50 percent the alien should be 50 so it's not too big and then i'm going to wait one second and then and then it'll start creating aliens after one second so you call this block this code right here create alien and then in the scrolling platformer i also did this so we want to set the x to negative 99999 so then the actual alien not the clone will get off the screen sometimes the hide does not work and i'm just going to put the hide here just in case so after that we want to get when i start as a clone when i start as a clone let's make it soon a little bit when i started to clone i want to go to pick random i want to make it pick random negative 200 and oh no you don't need this one negative 200 to 200. so the aliens will spawn from this x position so like this one somewhere in between and then for the y i made it 150 so it'll be like spawn like above here and i want to show after that show and then after that um we we need to make a variable called flying to spaceship name in the beginning i told you there's one in the first video i told you guys there's one variable for this spread only so since i already i got this from a backpack that's why it already has it but this is for this sprite only make this variable called flying to spaceship name and it should be only for this sprite so remember that and then we want to set the flying to spaceship name to blank in the beginning to nothing and then if get an if else statement if that uh alien set her player player one is equal to zero alien set for player one then we can set the flying to spaceship name to player one player one player one and set the alien set for player one to one else we will do set flying to spaceship name to player two so this is just to pick random which spaceship the alien will go for and you have to spell it exactly how it's like or it'll get messed up and then we need to get a point towards point towards the flying to spaceship name so it can be either the player one or the player two and then we wanna get a repeat until repeat until the um is touching the flying to spaceship name whichever one player one or player two and then we move three steps move three steps if touching edge if it's touching the edge touching edge then we'll move it back to pick random pick random uh go to pick random negative 200 to 200 so if it's touching the edge we'll make it go back somewhere up here and the y is 150 and duplicate this so oh my god oops duplicate at this right here get an ore if it's touching the laser one or laser two laser one or laser two so if it's touching either one of those we want it to disappear um so we'll make no not disappear but make it just respawn somewhere up here to make it look like the laser will kill it or something and then next we want to get if touching if if it's touching we need three oars actually we only need two i think so and then we'll need it to do um if touching player one player one or player one uh shield shield one player one shield one or the player one shield two then we wanna broadcast player1.hit and wait player1.hit and wait and then we want to make it go back to this random position and then we want to just duplicate this whole chunk of code put it under here instead of player one we'll do player two instead of player one shield one do player two shield one and instead of player one shield two we'll do player shield two uh player two he'll to and then we'll broadcast player 2 got hit and then we'll make it go back to random position okay so now we are done we can save our project and i will show you guys and i also forgot to do one last thing add the code for these so i'm just going to drag and drop it for the red red shields forgot about that drag right here so for here instead of we'll do hide player two shield instead this one's hide player one shield this is hide player two shield and instead of go to player one we wanna make it go to player two and if touching player one shield one instead and then right here hide player two shield go to player two and turn instead of turn five degrees we make it turn we do not need this piece of code as well make it turn to the left seven degrees there you go so now let's play it so as you can see oh yeah let me show the variables of the shield so that you can see

little bit lower maybe like 500 just so i can show you how the shield disappears at the end when you lose all your health and then so i'm just gonna destroy one shield oops i actually shot through it
