00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - welcome back guys it's kitchen
00:08 - playground here and today we're back
00:09 - with a video on Scratch and today we'll
00:11 - be making the farm Clicker
00:13 - now we announced last week we already
00:16 - had made a demo video for that and it's
00:19 - a pretty complicated game so I'll be
00:21 - walking you through the whole entire
00:23 - game starting with the no code game so
00:28 - um first of all you can just get remix
00:30 - this to make it yourself I will have
00:32 - probably this shared it's the farm
00:34 - clicker no code
00:37 - um after this video I'll share this and
00:39 - it's the no code thing so you can remix
00:41 - it for for yourself and then you can
00:43 - just get everything here because the
00:47 - Sprites are pretty hard to draw some of
00:49 - them and some of them you have to get
00:50 - online and all that stuff so you I'm
00:54 - gonna share this after the product uh
00:56 - for this video and you guys can go remix
00:58 - that or you can just draw your own or
01:02 - download it from my projects and so
01:10 - let's start with the money which is
01:13 - basically the numbers you might have
01:15 - seen in the demo before that are um up
01:18 - next to the world record you may have
01:21 - noticed there's no mega units either so
01:23 - no mega units in this tutorial so we're
01:26 - gonna start the money so I'll show you
01:29 - how to draw the money like the costumes
01:31 - for these things so you have to right
01:33 - click or not right click so we're just
01:35 - gonna pay a new one over here so first
01:37 - we're gonna get our text so we have our
01:40 - text right here I put out a handwriting
01:42 - because that's what we use for all of
01:43 - them we're gonna change it to Black
01:45 - because that's what our default color as
01:47 - the back you see that little Shadow
01:48 - we'll be using that peace
01:51 - and then uh on this I'll just write
01:54 - let's put a demonstration of let's put
01:56 - four so we have four here we click out
01:59 - and then we
02:01 - click over here and then now we can
02:03 - access the outline so we will have to
02:06 - make this black and we'll change this to
02:08 - six
02:09 - so it's really dark you see
02:12 - um
02:12 - it's really like condensed so that means
02:16 - we'll get another one and we'll change
02:18 - this to white instead
02:21 - and then put a four
02:24 - and it fits inside there like that and
02:27 - that's how we just made the Sprites with
02:29 - the little Shadow behind it
02:31 - so that's basically how we did that so
02:33 - now
02:35 - when coding you must name the costumes
02:37 - so this is number one is going to be one
02:40 - same with two three four five six seven
02:42 - eight nine but zero has to be the last
02:45 - one and has to be ten for this money uh
02:49 - thing to work
02:51 - so zero has to be ten
02:55 - and now let's move on to the code so
02:57 - when the green flag is clicked let's put
02:59 - that over here uh we're gonna hide
03:04 - and we're gonna set money so new
03:06 - variable
03:07 - we'll be using this variable
03:10 - so set money
03:12 - to zero and then broadcast a new message
03:15 - called
03:18 - dart game
03:23 - and we're gonna put this part so when I
03:26 - receive
03:28 - start game
03:29 - we're gonna go to a certain position so
03:33 - for this position we have it over here
03:35 - and it's over here around this place so
03:37 - just find a position around here and
03:39 - then we're going to get a new variable
03:42 - called number
03:43 - and this is for this Sprite only this is
03:46 - very important do not skip this step so
03:49 - we're going to get that over here
03:51 - and then
03:53 - so in our original game I think the x is
03:55 - actually 190 so I'm going to change that
03:57 - you can use our exact coordinates if you
03:59 - want and then instead we're going to set
04:01 - number to zero and we're going to get
04:04 - another variable money number
04:09 - clone
04:11 - and then this is for all Sprites and
04:12 - then we'll click OK for that and then
04:14 - set
04:15 - money number clone
04:18 - this is zero as well
04:19 - and then we're going to go to control
04:21 - place a forever Loop right here and then
04:24 - wait wait right here
04:26 - wait and then you have a less than sign
04:30 - right over here and then money number
04:33 - clone is less than
04:36 - length this one right here
04:39 - length of
04:42 - money so that's what we have over here
04:45 - feel free feel free to pause we have
04:47 - this part and this part
04:50 - so now we're going to continue and then
04:53 - wait I mean change number by one
04:58 - and it will also change money number
05:02 - clone by one
05:04 - and it'll also create a clone of myself
05:07 - and
05:10 - change
05:11 - X by
05:13 - negative 20.
05:16 - so this is basically keeping track of
05:19 - what numbers there are and all that
05:22 - stuff and this is keeping track of the
05:24 - Clones of the numbers
05:25 - and
05:27 - um this is basically changing X by
05:29 - negative 20 so this would just move by
05:31 - each number and now we're going to move
05:33 - on to this part over here so when I
05:37 - start as a clone
05:40 - here we're gonna show
05:44 - uh forever
05:48 - um if then else
05:51 - if then else
05:53 - um
05:53 - you need a greater sign if then else if
05:57 - the number is greater than the length
06:02 - of money
06:05 - then it'll hide
06:10 - else it will show
06:14 - and this is very important do not skip
06:17 - this step
06:18 - it'll have to so we're actually going to
06:21 - get a switch costume
06:23 - to and put it over here
06:26 - and now we're actually going to put all
06:28 - the operators together so we're going to
06:30 - start with this one so let's get a minus
06:32 - from over here number
06:35 - minus number minus one
06:39 - and then we're gonna get
06:42 - another minus keep this one blank
06:45 - and then we're gonna get length
06:48 - of
06:49 - money so we're gonna get over here
06:52 - length of money and we're also gonna get
06:55 - oopsies
06:57 - this one oh yeah so we're gonna put
06:59 - right here
07:01 - lots of money minus number minus one so
07:05 - that's how we're gonna put this together
07:06 - but we're not done so we have to get
07:08 - this one and get letter
07:11 - and then we're gonna put all of this
07:13 - oopsies all of this into here
07:16 - and then after that and then we're going
07:18 - to take money and put it in here so it's
07:21 - pretty complicated and throw them all in
07:23 - here so it's pretty complicated but
07:28 - just put the operators together
07:30 - so this block of code just shows if the
07:32 - costume matches the number over here so
07:36 - that's just basically what this code
07:38 - means it's really important do not skip
07:39 - this
07:41 - so I'm going to show you uh it says zero
07:43 - over here because I have no money right
07:45 - now but I can let's just go set money to
07:49 - 1000
07:52 - we're gonna get one thousand so that's
07:54 - basically how we do it
07:59 - so now uh let's just go on to the glow
08:02 - this is pretty simple
08:03 - just the glow around for visual quality
08:10 - I'm actually going to show you the
08:11 - costume first so let's see this we're
08:13 - just going to duplicate just to see this
08:15 - better so let's paint
08:18 - I believe this one
08:20 - goes down here and then it's the
08:23 - opposite for the top so we're gonna
08:26 - actually swap these and it's gonna be
08:28 - like that for what we use for the glow
08:32 - around the chicken
08:34 - and basically it's the same for the
08:37 - other ones too
08:39 - so the gloat is optional it's just for
08:41 - some extra visual quality but you don't
08:44 - have to add if you don't want to you can
08:46 - just take it from my project Gumball 098
08:48 - that's my username so after that we're
08:50 - going to go over here and then go to x00
08:52 - Middle origin and then go to
08:56 - back layer
08:59 - and then it'll show
09:02 - it'll also go forever
09:06 - and it will turn right one degree so
09:09 - that just makes it move a little bit if
09:11 - you've seen our demo please watch our
09:13 - demo and you see it just circles around
09:16 - and that's basically the glow optional
09:18 - but it's better if you do
09:23 - so now we're going to move on to the
09:25 - chick
09:26 - so the green flag when the green flag is
09:28 - clicked oh yeah the costumes first of
09:30 - all so I just took the chick from
09:32 - scratch they have one over here and they
09:34 - have three skins but I deleted two of
09:36 - them and I just duplicated this one and
09:39 - I colored this one differently made it a
09:42 - lighter more mango yellow
09:44 - instead of the darker yellow over here
09:46 - so it can show a difference when you
09:48 - click it so it just makes it
09:52 - so you know that you clicked on the
09:53 - chicken
09:54 - so we're gonna go when the green fog is
09:56 - clicked it'll go to the middle as well
09:58 - as point in Direction 90. and it'll also
10:03 - switch to
10:06 - costume chick a
10:08 - and we have to make a new variable
10:10 - called CPS and that's basically how much
10:13 - you get money per click so we're gonna
10:16 - get that over here and then set CPS to
10:19 - one so let's just
10:21 - and get one for clicking on the chick
10:24 - and then now we're gonna go forever
10:27 - and then we're gonna have a little
10:29 - variable over here called turn
10:33 - and we're going to change turn by four
10:39 - and
10:40 - this is and we're going to use this over
10:43 - here so right like this
10:47 - and we're gonna get one of the more less
10:50 - used blocks you're gonna get this ABS
10:52 - one
10:53 - and then put it right here change it to
10:56 - the cosine
10:57 - of and then you have to take a division
11:00 - one
11:01 - cosine of turn
11:04 - divided by two that's basically what
11:07 - makes it turn like that and like that
11:08 - and like that like that it's really
11:10 - steady so use this code right here
11:12 - and then when this Sprite is clicked
11:16 - uh
11:18 - when the spread is clicked it will
11:20 - change
11:24 - money
11:26 - by
11:28 - CPS
11:29 - so because you can have the tools and
11:32 - I'll just see how much CPS you have or
11:34 - whatever and the switch costume
11:38 - to the chick A2 yep that's correct L
11:41 - weight 0.05 seconds
11:47 - 3.05 seconds and it'll switch costume
11:51 - to check a
11:52 - and then when this Sprite is clicked
11:56 - I when the Sprite is clicked it will
11:58 - start sound Sharp
12:02 - and it'll create clone
12:05 - of
12:07 - chick Club so that's basically
12:11 - the little background to the chick so
12:15 - and now we have the chick so you see
12:18 - it's tilting tilting same with the glow
12:20 - effect and then if I click on it I get
12:21 - uh uh the money and you can also hear
12:26 - the sound
12:30 - and now we're actually going to move on
12:32 - to Chick clone
12:34 - so this one is visual quality visual
12:37 - effects if you click on it there's gonna
12:39 - be a little chicken that falls down it's
12:42 - like a random color so that's just some
12:44 - visual quality for you
12:45 - and then so when I start as a clone
12:50 - yo
12:52 - go to
12:55 - the chicken
12:57 - and you'll switch costume
13:01 - to pick random one to three
13:05 - so this chicken actually
13:09 - this chicken actually is from the
13:12 - scratch library and it has the three
13:16 - costumes
13:18 - and it'll pick random from these three
13:20 - costumes and it'll go to the back layer
13:25 - and then also set size to 30 percent
13:28 - so it's just a little visual quality
13:31 - falling down
13:32 - and then it'll show
13:34 - and it'll set
13:37 - X
13:39 - to
13:40 - pick random
13:42 - negative 50.
13:46 - 250
13:48 - and it will repeat
13:52 - until touching Edge
13:59 - and now it will change why
14:03 - by negative 10 until it falls to the
14:06 - ground and then turn
14:09 - like that to the right side
14:12 - pick random
14:15 - negative 10 to 10 degrees
14:19 - and now after that it will delete this
14:20 - one
14:23 - and we need this short little block
14:25 - right here when the creative flag is
14:27 - clicked
14:27 - it will hide
14:30 - and forever
14:32 - it will change color effect by 25 so
14:36 - that's just a little visual quality
14:39 - now we're gonna have this so whenever I
14:42 - click on this you see the little chicken
14:43 - falling down
14:45 - so and we're also going to hide the
14:47 - barrels real quick so the ones that we
14:49 - really don't need to be shown
14:51 - and we also have to go to
14:54 - the money and hide this one too
15:01 - so yeah now we're gonna move on to the
15:04 - heads so our first basic card in the
15:08 - game
15:09 - so hands right here when the green flag
15:11 - is clicked
15:14 - it'll go to
15:17 - okay so I'm going to show you how to
15:18 - basically make this basic hen costume so
15:21 - we're just going to get a button real
15:23 - simple get this little button right here
15:25 - and no wait wrong one I'm gonna go to
15:28 - this button go to the costumes delete
15:31 - this one and we're actually gonna get a
15:34 - costume so I use hen because it's a farm
15:36 - clicker so we're actually going to go to
15:39 - the hens
15:42 - HHH so we get this one right I think I
15:46 - use 10B if I'm not mistaken so I use
15:48 - this one you know my shrink this a bit
15:51 - group this all together
15:53 - delete then oh I didn't control C
15:58 - so I restored the costume and I control
16:01 - C
16:02 - the
16:03 - go over here and then Ctrl V now we have
16:06 - our head
16:07 - it's grouped together we're actually
16:08 - going to delete this one right here
16:11 - and then now we have this one
16:13 - we're gonna shrink it so it's like you
16:15 - can put it inside the button so put it
16:17 - like a general size and then I just use
16:19 - the text
16:21 - I'm not sure if I use handwriting I
16:22 - think I just used stand serif but that's
16:24 - fine and I just wrote 50 to indicate the
16:27 - cost of the head
16:29 - so now we have that
16:33 - now we're going to code the hen
16:35 - so when the green flag gets clicked
16:37 - it'll go to this position I just got
16:40 - some position to the right and then it
16:43 - will set hens owned so we're going to
16:45 - make a new variable
16:47 - Penzone
16:49 - and they'll get set hands own to zero
16:53 - and we're actually going to right click
16:54 - on this most people did not know that's
16:56 - a thing we're actually going to drag
16:58 - this over here so it can indicate how
17:02 - much hands you own so it won't be just
17:05 - one bunch of clumpy variables together
17:06 - so just right click to get this part so
17:10 - right click
17:12 - so and then right click to get this
17:14 - thing
17:15 - and not right click double click
17:18 - and then set hens own to zero and then
17:21 - when this Sprite
17:24 - when the Sprite clicked
17:26 - you if then else statement
17:31 - and you need another if then else
17:32 - statement but inside the if then
17:34 - statement like that
17:35 - and it will be like this so you need to
17:39 - or
17:41 - if then the player has money
17:44 - equals 50 because that's the cost of the
17:46 - hen
17:47 - or money is greater than 50.
17:52 - we're actually going to
17:55 - put in here so if then
17:58 - we need a less than
18:00 - so if then the hens owned
18:04 - is less than 150 because the max cap for
18:07 - hens is 150 so if then it's less than
18:09 - 150 it'll start sound glug so that's
18:12 - just the basic sound you can find that a
18:14 - Sprite Library
18:16 - right there put it like that and then
18:18 - change money by minus 50.
18:22 - change money by -50 so deduct your money
18:26 - when you buy a head and then after that
18:28 - it will change your hands own by one so
18:31 - you have another hen to
18:34 - the
18:35 - stack
18:37 - and then after that
18:39 - you'll have to broadcast
18:41 - bot hen
18:46 - right there
18:48 - else
18:50 - broadcast
18:51 - over here maximum
18:55 - units
18:58 - reached
19:00 - and we'll actually capture that with
19:02 - this one
19:04 - and after that a broadcast maximum units
19:06 - reached else
19:09 - broadcast
19:11 - you don't have enough money to buy this
19:12 - so if you don't have enough you know if
19:14 - you don't have fifty dollars then it'll
19:17 - be you don't have enough
19:20 - to buy this
19:24 - and now we have that
19:26 - when I receive bot hen
19:28 - for forever it will change money
19:33 - so it would change money depending on
19:35 - how much hens you have so change money
19:37 - by the number of hens you owned and
19:41 - it'll wait two seconds
19:46 - so now we have that code finished for
19:50 - the hands
19:54 - and now we're actually going to code
19:57 - this one though you don't have enough
20:00 - money to buy this right so actually
20:02 - there's two costumes here we have that
20:05 - you don't have enough money to buy this
20:06 - item and the maximum units reached so
20:09 - we're actually going to go over here and
20:12 - then when the green flag is clicked
20:15 - we're actually gonna go to the front
20:18 - layer
20:19 - let's see the project real quick go to
20:21 - the front layer
20:22 - and hide
20:26 - and then when I receive
20:29 - you don't have enough money to buy this
20:32 - it will switch costume to costume one
20:39 - and then also go to the front layer
20:41 - and show
20:44 - also start sound collect
20:46 - so we just have like some sound to
20:48 - indicate that you don't have enough
20:49 - money to buy this and then it'll wait
20:52 - one second
20:54 - and hide
20:56 - as you know the First costume is that
20:58 - you don't have enough money to buy this
20:59 - one and then we'll duplicate that
21:02 - actually and then instead change this to
21:04 - maximum units breached which is to
21:07 - costume two because that's the maximum
21:08 - unit reached one and then it's the same
21:12 - so we have that all set so I'm going to
21:15 - show you real quick
21:17 - um I'm gonna give myself fifty dollars
21:19 - real quick so we can I can show you so
21:22 - change
21:24 - [Music]
21:27 - 90. that's not right change money by 50
21:30 - you can buy a hen and you see it's
21:33 - producing money for me and I have one
21:35 - hand this goes up and
21:38 - actually and if I don't have enough
21:40 - money I'll say you do not have enough
21:41 - money to buy this item so cool
21:44 - we have that all set up please like
21:47 - share and subscribe and comment in the
21:49 - comment section below what else games
21:50 - you'd like to see on our YouTube channel
21:53 - this is one of our subscriber ideas that
21:55 - we have taken and made it into our
21:57 - project so if you'd like to see any of
21:59 - your projects please comment it and the
22:03 - part will be coming out tomorrow so see
22:04 - you guys in the next part
22:06 - [Music]
22:15 - thank you

welcome back guys it's kitchen playground here and today we're back with a video on Scratch and today we'll be making the farm Clicker now we announced last week we already had made a demo video for that and it's a pretty complicated game so I'll be walking you through the whole entire game starting with the no code game so um first of all you can just get remix this to make it yourself I will have probably this shared it's the farm clicker no code um after this video I'll share this and it's the no code thing so you can remix it for for yourself and then you can just get everything here because the Sprites are pretty hard to draw some of them and some of them you have to get online and all that stuff so you I'm gonna share this after the product uh for this video and you guys can go remix that or you can just draw your own or download it from my projects and so let's start with the money which is basically the numbers you might have seen in the demo before that are um up next to the world record you may have noticed there's no mega units either so no mega units in this tutorial so we're gonna start the money so I'll show you how to draw the money like the costumes for these things so you have to right click or not right click so we're just gonna pay a new one over here so first we're gonna get our text so we have our text right here I put out a handwriting because that's what we use for all of them we're gonna change it to Black because that's what our default color as the back you see that little Shadow we'll be using that peace and then uh on this I'll just write let's put a demonstration of let's put four so we have four here we click out and then we click over here and then now we can access the outline so we will have to make this black and we'll change this to six so it's really dark you see um it's really like condensed so that means we'll get another one and we'll change this to white instead and then put a four and it fits inside there like that and that's how we just made the Sprites with the little Shadow behind it so that's basically how we did that so now when coding you must name the costumes so this is number one is going to be one same with two three four five six seven eight nine but zero has to be the last one and has to be ten for this money uh thing to work so zero has to be ten and now let's move on to the code so when the green flag is clicked let's put that over here uh we're gonna hide and we're gonna set money so new variable we'll be using this variable so set money to zero and then broadcast a new message called dart game and we're gonna put this part so when I receive start game we're gonna go to a certain position so for this position we have it over here and it's over here around this place so just find a position around here and then we're going to get a new variable called number and this is for this Sprite only this is very important do not skip this step so we're going to get that over here and then so in our original game I think the x is actually 190 so I'm going to change that you can use our exact coordinates if you want and then instead we're going to set number to zero and we're going to get another variable money number clone and then this is for all Sprites and then we'll click OK for that and then set money number clone this is zero as well and then we're going to go to control place a forever Loop right here and then wait wait right here wait and then you have a less than sign right over here and then money number clone is less than length this one right here length of money so that's what we have over here feel free feel free to pause we have this part and this part so now we're going to continue and then wait I mean change number by one and it will also change money number clone by one and it'll also create a clone of myself and change X by negative 20. so this is basically keeping track of what numbers there are and all that stuff and this is keeping track of the Clones of the numbers and um this is basically changing X by negative 20 so this would just move by each number and now we're going to move on to this part over here so when I start as a clone here we're gonna show uh forever um if then else if then else um you need a greater sign if then else if the number is greater than the length of money then it'll hide else it will show and this is very important do not skip this step it'll have to so we're actually going to get a switch costume to and put it over here and now we're actually going to put all the operators together so we're going to start with this one so let's get a minus from over here number minus number minus one and then we're gonna get another minus keep this one blank and then we're gonna get length of money so we're gonna get over here length of money and we're also gonna get oopsies this one oh yeah so we're gonna put right here lots of money minus number minus one so that's how we're gonna put this together but we're not done so we have to get this one and get letter and then we're gonna put all of this oopsies all of this into here and then after that and then we're going to take money and put it in here so it's pretty complicated and throw them all in here so it's pretty complicated but just put the operators together so this block of code just shows if the costume matches the number over here so that's just basically what this code means it's really important do not skip this so I'm going to show you uh it says zero over here because I have no money right now but I can let's just go set money to 1000 we're gonna get one thousand so that's basically how we do it so now uh let's just go on to the glow this is pretty simple just the glow around for visual quality I'm actually going to show you the costume first so let's see this we're just going to duplicate just to see this better so let's paint I believe this one goes down here and then it's the opposite for the top so we're gonna actually swap these and it's gonna be like that for what we use for the glow around the chicken and basically it's the same for the other ones too so the gloat is optional it's just for some extra visual quality but you don't have to add if you don't want to you can just take it from my project Gumball 098 that's my username so after that we're going to go over here and then go to x00 Middle origin and then go to back layer and then it'll show it'll also go forever and it will turn right one degree so that just makes it move a little bit if you've seen our demo please watch our demo and you see it just circles around and that's basically the glow optional but it's better if you do so now we're going to move on to the chick so the green flag when the green flag is clicked oh yeah the costumes first of all so I just took the chick from scratch they have one over here and they have three skins but I deleted two of them and I just duplicated this one and I colored this one differently made it a lighter more mango yellow instead of the darker yellow over here so it can show a difference when you click it so it just makes it so you know that you clicked on the chicken so we're gonna go when the green fog is clicked it'll go to the middle as well as point in Direction 90. and it'll also switch to costume chick a and we have to make a new variable called CPS and that's basically how much you get money per click so we're gonna get that over here and then set CPS to one so let's just and get one for clicking on the chick and then now we're gonna go forever and then we're gonna have a little variable over here called turn and we're going to change turn by four and this is and we're going to use this over here so right like this and we're gonna get one of the more less used blocks you're gonna get this ABS one and then put it right here change it to the cosine of and then you have to take a division one cosine of turn divided by two that's basically what makes it turn like that and like that and like that like that it's really steady so use this code right here and then when this Sprite is clicked uh when the spread is clicked it will change money by CPS so because you can have the tools and I'll just see how much CPS you have or whatever and the switch costume to the chick A2 yep that's correct L weight 0.05 seconds 3.05 seconds and it'll switch costume to check a and then when this Sprite is clicked I when the Sprite is clicked it will start sound Sharp and it'll create clone of chick Club so that's basically the little background to the chick so and now we have the chick so you see it's tilting tilting same with the glow effect and then if I click on it I get uh uh the money and you can also hear the sound and now we're actually going to move on to Chick clone so this one is visual quality visual effects if you click on it there's gonna be a little chicken that falls down it's like a random color so that's just some visual quality for you and then so when I start as a clone yo go to the chicken and you'll switch costume to pick random one to three so this chicken actually this chicken actually is from the scratch library and it has the three costumes and it'll pick random from these three costumes and it'll go to the back layer and then also set size to 30 percent so it's just a little visual quality falling down and then it'll show and it'll set X to pick random negative 50. 250 and it will repeat until touching Edge and now it will change why by negative 10 until it falls to the ground and then turn like that to the right side pick random negative 10 to 10 degrees and now after that it will delete this one and we need this short little block right here when the creative flag is clicked it will hide and forever it will change color effect by 25 so that's just a little visual quality now we're gonna have this so whenever I click on this you see the little chicken falling down so and we're also going to hide the barrels real quick so the ones that we really don't need to be shown and we also have to go to the money and hide this one too so yeah now we're gonna move on to the heads so our first basic card in the game so hands right here when the green flag is clicked it'll go to okay so I'm going to show you how to basically make this basic hen costume so we're just going to get a button real simple get this little button right here and no wait wrong one I'm gonna go to this button go to the costumes delete this one and we're actually gonna get a costume so I use hen because it's a farm clicker so we're actually going to go to the hens HHH so we get this one right I think I use 10B if I'm not mistaken so I use this one you know my shrink this a bit group this all together delete then oh I didn't control C so I restored the costume and I control C the go over here and then Ctrl V now we have our head it's grouped together we're actually going to delete this one right here and then now we have this one we're gonna shrink it so it's like you can put it inside the button so put it like a general size and then I just use the text I'm not sure if I use handwriting I think I just used stand serif but that's fine and I just wrote 50 to indicate the cost of the head so now we have that now we're going to code the hen so when the green flag gets clicked it'll go to this position I just got some position to the right and then it will set hens owned so we're going to make a new variable Penzone and they'll get set hands own to zero and we're actually going to right click on this most people did not know that's a thing we're actually going to drag this over here so it can indicate how much hands you own so it won't be just one bunch of clumpy variables together so just right click to get this part so right click so and then right click to get this thing and not right click double click and then set hens own to zero and then when this Sprite when the Sprite clicked you if then else statement and you need another if then else statement but inside the if then statement like that and it will be like this so you need to or if then the player has money equals 50 because that's the cost of the hen or money is greater than 50. we're actually going to put in here so if then we need a less than so if then the hens owned is less than 150 because the max cap for hens is 150 so if then it's less than 150 it'll start sound glug so that's just the basic sound you can find that a Sprite Library right there put it like that and then change money by minus 50. change money by 50 so deduct your money when you buy a head and then after that it will change your hands own by one so you have another hen to the stack and then after that you'll have to broadcast bot hen right there else broadcast over here maximum units reached and we'll actually capture that with this one and after that a broadcast maximum units reached else broadcast you don't have enough money to buy this so if you don't have enough you know if you don't have fifty dollars then it'll be you don't have enough to buy this and now we have that when I receive bot hen for forever it will change money so it would change money depending on how much hens you have so change money by the number of hens you owned and it'll wait two seconds so now we have that code finished for the hands and now we're actually going to code this one though you don't have enough money to buy this right so actually there's two costumes here we have that you don't have enough money to buy this item and the maximum units reached so we're actually going to go over here and then when the green flag is clicked we're actually gonna go to the front layer let's see the project real quick go to the front layer and hide and then when I receive you don't have enough money to buy this it will switch costume to costume one and then also go to the front layer and show also start sound collect so we just have like some sound to indicate that you don't have enough money to buy this and then it'll wait one second and hide as you know the First costume is that you don't have enough money to buy this one and then we'll duplicate that actually and then instead change this to maximum units breached which is to costume two because that's the maximum unit reached one and then it's the same so we have that all set so I'm going to show you real quick um I'm gonna give myself fifty dollars real quick so we can I can show you so change 90. that's not right change money by 50 you can buy a hen and you see it's producing money for me and I have one hand this goes up and actually and if I don't have enough money I'll say you do not have enough money to buy this item so cool we have that all set up please like share and subscribe and comment in the comment section below what else games you'd like to see on our YouTube channel this is one of our subscriber ideas that we have taken and made it into our project so if you'd like to see any of your projects please comment it and the part will be coming out tomorrow so see you guys in the next part thank you
