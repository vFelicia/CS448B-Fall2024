00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys it's kids coding
00:08 - playground here
00:09 - today we will be working on a new year's
00:12 - game um
00:13 - and before i would like to continue on
00:14 - to the video um
00:16 - this person internet 44 gave us the
00:18 - inspiration to make
00:20 - this new year's firework animation thing
00:23 - so big thanks to this person who made
00:25 - this game um project
00:27 - so yeah so before we start i'm just
00:29 - going to demo the game once
00:32 - so just like some fireworks and then it
00:35 - says happy
00:36 - new year's 2021 and it glides in
00:39 - and then there's some music in the
00:40 - background
00:41 - [Music]
00:43 - so yeah that's basically the project
00:45 - we'll be doing today
00:46 - so without further ado let's start a new
00:49 - project so
00:52 - let's go new project so we have a new
00:54 - project let's
00:56 - work on uh so we're we're not going to
00:58 - need scratch yet we can just
00:59 - take him out um we
01:03 - you just need some blank costumes we're
01:05 - going to be using pen in this project
01:07 - to draw the fireworks so before we
01:11 - get into the coding we're gonna have to
01:12 - rename our project obviously so we're
01:14 - gonna name it like
01:16 - new year 2021
01:20 - so new year 2021 and then we're gonna
01:23 - just duplicate this
01:24 - actually we can duplicate it at the end
01:26 - so that we have all the code
01:28 - um so the first sprite we're gonna we
01:31 - already have pen so if you guys don't
01:32 - know how to get the pen extension
01:34 - click on here and then click this so you
01:36 - can get the pen
01:37 - okay so next you want to get the one
01:40 - green flag clicked
01:43 - and then we want to erase alt in the
01:45 - beginning so you want to erase
01:47 - everything
01:48 - zoom in a little then set the pen color
01:52 - to whatever color you want to start
01:54 - with i'm just going to set it to like a
01:55 - blue color
01:58 - it's you can set it to whatever you want
02:00 - basically
02:02 - and then we're going to go we're going
02:03 - to wait 0.3 seconds before actually
02:05 - starting the game
02:06 - so after that we're gonna set the pen
02:08 - size to five
02:10 - set pen size to not change set pin size
02:14 - to five
02:15 - so that's how thick we're gonna draw the
02:17 - line as
02:18 - and then we're gonna get a forever loop
02:19 - so it's gonna forever
02:22 - forever um we're gonna change the pen
02:25 - color
02:26 - by pick random what color so we're just
02:28 - changing the pen color
02:30 - uh by pick random so we're gonna get
02:32 - this change pen color
02:33 - by pick random pick random
02:37 - 10 to 15.
02:40 - okay so after that we want to pen up
02:44 - the pin out and we're going to go to
02:49 - we're going to go to like somewhere down
02:51 - here so we're going to go to
02:54 - i'm going to go to pick random negative
02:57 - 240 to 240
02:59 - and then for the y we're just going to
03:01 - go to negative 200 so
03:04 - like this so it'll spawn somewhere from
03:06 - here to here and then
03:07 - y will be negative 200. so all the
03:10 - fireworks will be somewhere down here
03:12 - and then we're gonna point direction of
03:14 - negative five to five
03:16 - so point in direction point in direction
03:21 - right here sorry and then we're gonna
03:23 - get a net pick random from negative five
03:26 - five so this
03:30 - okay and after that we're going to get
03:32 - the pen down so then we'll actually
03:33 - start drawing
03:35 - pen down and then we're going to make
03:37 - some variables now so we're going to
03:39 - make
03:39 - a variable so we can just delete this
03:41 - one so
03:43 - we're going to make a variable called
03:44 - speed and then
03:46 - all the variables with a lowercase will
03:48 - be for the sprite only so speed will be
03:51 - for the sprite only
03:53 - the speed so we're going to set the
03:56 - speed to 20
03:57 - so the speed is going to be how fast
04:00 - it's moving so we're going to set it to
04:01 - 20
04:02 - um and then we're going to repeat this
04:03 - amount of speed so they'll repeat 20
04:05 - times basically
04:07 - repeat speed and then we're going to put
04:10 - move speed so we're just going to move
04:15 - 20 steps that's what it's basically
04:17 - saying and then we're going to change
04:18 - the speed
04:19 - by negative one so
04:22 - minus one and then we're gonna make
04:26 - two new variables so we're going to make
04:28 - a variable so this is going to be for
04:30 - for all sprites so we're going to name
04:31 - it number
04:33 - of clones so all the
04:36 - variables with upper case a number of
04:38 - clones one all the
04:40 - variables starting with the upper case
04:41 - letter is going to be
04:43 - for all sprites so we're going to be uh
04:46 - doing number of clones one
04:48 - and ready to explode and this is for all
04:51 - sprites again
04:55 - one so ready to explode one
04:58 - and number of clones one so we have the
05:01 - two variables so right now we're going
05:02 - to set those two variables to zero
05:06 - oops put that under here set
05:09 - number ready explode and number of
05:11 - clones one
05:12 - down here and then right here we're
05:15 - going to do
05:16 - how much you want to do how many um
05:19 - fireworks you want the thing to split
05:21 - into so when you hit it
05:22 - you can pick whatever amount you want to
05:24 - split so i did 10.
05:27 - you guys can do any amount you would
05:28 - like so
05:30 - i made it split into 10 and then we're
05:32 - gonna put number of clones one
05:34 - into this so repeat until 10 is less
05:37 - than the number of clones one
05:38 - and we're going to create a clone of
05:40 - myself
05:42 - and then after that we're going to make
05:44 - a new variable
05:45 - so this is for this sprite only
05:49 - so we're going to make it the first
05:51 - letter
05:52 - lowercase explode speed
05:56 - so that's how fast we're gonna have to
05:58 - explode so we're gonna set it to 20
06:00 - again so set explode speed to 20.
06:06 - set ready to explode to one
06:09 - so we kind of simplified this game a
06:11 - little bit more i rather than the
06:13 - original one the original one was a bit
06:15 - more complex
06:16 - um so this is a little bit more simpler
06:19 - than the original
06:21 - um and then repeat 10 times we're gonna
06:23 - change the explosion speed by negative
06:25 - one
06:26 - explode speed by negative one okay so
06:29 - now we have the first script done
06:31 - now we're gonna get something called um
06:33 - when i start as a clone so we're going
06:34 - to go ctrl
06:36 - when i start as a clone let's drag here
06:39 - so when i start as a clone we're going
06:40 - to set the pen brightness to 50
06:42 - so it looks cooler when you do that so
06:45 - i'll just make the
06:47 - fireworks look way better and we're
06:50 - gonna do
06:51 - change number of clones by one
06:54 - number of phones by one so keep on going
06:57 - up
06:58 - every time this script runs
07:01 - and then we're gonna wait until the
07:02 - ready explode is equal to one
07:04 - as right here we set the ready to
07:07 - explode as one
07:08 - once is greater than ten
07:12 - so we're going to get a wait until
07:16 - wait until we're going to get an equal
07:19 - equal to one so we're going to get it
07:23 - ready to explode
07:25 - ready to explode one into the first slot
07:28 - and then we're going to do a point in
07:29 - direction of
07:30 - either negative 8 180 to 180 so we're
07:32 - just going to pick a random
07:35 - so we're going to pick random negative
07:38 - 180
07:40 - to 180 then we're going to repeat 10
07:44 - times
07:46 - and then we're going to move the
07:48 - explosion speed step so right here
07:50 - we defined it as 20 so basically moving
07:53 - 20 steps
07:54 - move explode speed
07:59 - uh steps and then we're gonna change the
08:02 - brightness by negative one
08:04 - also another thing to add right here so
08:06 - down here remember we used to find the
08:08 - exploding speed to negative one so it
08:11 - will get slower as it goes
08:12 - progresses to go out so that's why we
08:14 - added this
08:16 - and then right here we're gonna add in
08:18 - another part so we're gonna change the
08:20 - pen
08:20 - brightness brightness
08:24 - by negative one oh yeah and this should
08:27 - be brightness not color
08:28 - so set this to brightness as well
08:32 - and then we're gonna use delete this
08:34 - clone i'm gonna use the delete this
08:36 - clone so it'll delete it
08:37 - once the script is finished okay and now
08:40 - we're just going to
08:41 - duplicate all these duplicate this two
08:44 - other times
08:45 - because we want to make three fireworks
08:47 - you guys can do what however much you
08:49 - want
08:49 - so we're gonna have to change these
08:51 - variable names so for the
08:53 - for the spike sprite only the uh
08:56 - lowercase letters uh lowercase words
08:59 - variables
09:00 - we don't have to change but for these we
09:01 - have to change so we're gonna
09:03 - make a new variable oops click the wrong
09:06 - one
09:07 - make a new variable so we're going to do
09:08 - number of clones to
09:12 - two for all sprites
09:16 - and the rest gonna do ready to explode
09:20 - ready to explode and then
09:23 - two for all sprites as well so
09:27 - we're going to switch out all these
09:29 - variables for number of clones too
09:31 - and ready to explode to so we need a
09:33 - different variable for each one and then
09:35 - for here
09:36 - we're gonna do ready to explode two and
09:38 - also for the explode speed we do not
09:40 - need to do another one because it's for
09:41 - the sprite only and then we'll go right
09:44 - here we're gonna do
09:45 - number of clones too and right here you
09:48 - can just right click
09:49 - and ready to explode too okay so i think
09:53 - that's it
09:53 - let's move on to the third one we're
09:55 - going to make another another set of
09:57 - variables
09:58 - we're going to do number of clones
10:01 - three and for all sprites as well and
10:04 - ready to explode
10:07 - ready to explode three
10:12 - so we have the variables now we're going
10:13 - to change them
10:15 - it's right here ready uh the number of
10:17 - clones three switch system
10:19 - ready to explode three right here we're
10:21 - gonna do
10:22 - number of clones three i don't think i
10:24 - change it here
10:26 - i'm gonna check yeah i did not so be
10:28 - sure to
10:29 - switch your variables so number of
10:30 - clones two you have to change all of
10:32 - them
10:33 - and they're ready to explode three and
10:36 - up here we have
10:37 - two more i think number of clones
10:40 - three and ready to explode set that to
10:42 - three
10:47 - okay so i think that should be it we're
10:49 - gonna add a black background
10:51 - and the 2021 message okay so
10:54 - right now as you can see um when we play
10:57 - the project
10:58 - it explodes but the trail marks do not
11:02 - disappear
11:03 - so if you wanted to make it disappear
11:04 - that's why we're going to make the black
11:06 - background sprite to stamp so we're
11:09 - going to
11:10 - paint a new sprite so what we just want
11:13 - to do is just draw
11:14 - a black box i'm just going to call this
11:16 - black background
11:20 - black background and we're just going to
11:22 - get the square tool
11:24 - and make just something
11:27 - about the size bigger than the screen
11:31 - okay so we're also gonna have to put
11:32 - this in the background so we're just
11:34 - gonna drag that to the center real quick
11:37 - um make it bigger
11:41 - um so we're gonna make it go to zero
11:43 - zero so we're going to do ctrl c
11:46 - go to the background and ctrl v so the
11:47 - background also has the black color as
11:49 - well
11:50 - so for the background we're just gonna
11:53 - get a one green flag clicked
11:55 - set ghost effect to 80 so then it will
11:57 - just have a little faint color
12:00 - so we're going to get set ghost effects
12:05 - goes to 80 and then right here forever
12:09 - loop make it go to the center which is
12:11 - zero zero
12:13 - so go to zero zero and then we're gonna
12:16 - stamp so then
12:17 - the streak marks will disappear
12:21 - all right okay now we're finished with
12:24 - the black
12:24 - black background as you can see the
12:26 - fireworks can explode
12:28 - and it looks pretty cool so now we're
12:29 - going to work on the message
12:32 - so now let's paint a new backdrop i mean
12:35 - not a new sprite
12:36 - also before we get into this right we
12:38 - want to change the different colors
12:40 - so as you can see when you play all of
12:42 - them have the about the same color
12:44 - so we want to change that by changing
12:46 - the starting color
12:47 - like make this one green and make this
12:49 - one
12:50 - red maybe look right or something like
12:52 - that
12:53 - so when you play now you can see they
12:55 - are different colors
12:58 - and one last thing we can also change
13:00 - the speed we can change
13:01 - the height of each one so the first one
13:03 - i'm gonna make it 20
13:05 - second one i can make it like 22
13:09 - and the third one i can make it a little
13:11 - lower and make it 18.
13:12 - so now you can see the height difference
13:14 - of the different fireworks
13:16 - as you can see it's like a little height
13:18 - difference yeah so it's pretty cool
13:22 - and now we can work on the sprite since
13:24 - we have all that finished
13:26 - we're just going to get the text i'm
13:28 - going to use the handwriting
13:29 - font i'm going to make it a red color
13:31 - because i tried it with white if you're
13:32 - gonna make it a white color and you make
13:34 - it change color effect
13:35 - the color is really faint so you want to
13:37 - use like something bright color
13:39 - red so we're gonna write like um
13:42 - happy new year's happy new year
13:47 - uh 20 20 i guess put a couple spaces
13:51 - 20 21 sorry not 20 20 20 21
13:55 - okay like that and then we're gonna make
13:56 - it a little bit bigger
14:00 - so now we have that okay and we can
14:05 - work on the code so we're going to
14:06 - rename the sprite let's make it let's
14:08 - name it 2021 or something like that
14:10 - let's go to the code and then for the
14:12 - code we're just going to get our one
14:13 - green flag clicked
14:17 - and green flag clicked hide
14:21 - go to
14:25 - 300 y 0 so we want it to make it glided
14:30 - and then we're just going to make a
14:31 - little wait time right here
14:33 - like maybe three seconds and then we're
14:35 - gonna get a show
14:39 - and we're gonna make it glide three
14:42 - seconds
14:44 - three seconds to the center so zero zero
14:48 - and then we're going to get another one
14:49 - green plot clicked when green fly
14:50 - clicked
14:51 - forever change
14:54 - color effect by five and we need to add
14:57 - the music now so after this we're going
14:59 - to add the music
15:01 - uh what is it color oh yeah five
15:04 - and in the background we can just add
15:05 - the music go to sounds would
15:07 - import a sound so we just got with our
15:09 - youtube
15:10 - library this thing
15:16 - okay so we're just going to get one
15:18 - green flag clicked
15:20 - forever we're going to play the sound
15:24 - until done okay
15:27 - i'm going to turn the volume down a
15:29 - little bit so then you can hear me
15:30 - talking it
15:31 - a bit louder okay so now let's play it
15:35 - save um taking a while save
15:42 - it's because of the music that's why
15:44 - taking a while to save
15:46 - okay so now finally saved let's wait
15:50 - as you can see fireworks happy new year
15:54 - 2021 and wish you guys
15:57 - have a happy new year thank you guys for
15:59 - watching feel free to like
16:01 - share and subscribe and i'll see you
16:04 - guys in the next video
16:06 - bye
16:10 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here today we will be working on a new year's game um and before i would like to continue on to the video um this person internet 44 gave us the inspiration to make this new year's firework animation thing so big thanks to this person who made this game um project so yeah so before we start i'm just going to demo the game once so just like some fireworks and then it says happy new year's 2021 and it glides in and then there's some music in the background so yeah that's basically the project we'll be doing today so without further ado let's start a new project so let's go new project so we have a new project let's work on uh so we're we're not going to need scratch yet we can just take him out um we you just need some blank costumes we're going to be using pen in this project to draw the fireworks so before we get into the coding we're gonna have to rename our project obviously so we're gonna name it like new year 2021 so new year 2021 and then we're gonna just duplicate this actually we can duplicate it at the end so that we have all the code um so the first sprite we're gonna we already have pen so if you guys don't know how to get the pen extension click on here and then click this so you can get the pen okay so next you want to get the one green flag clicked and then we want to erase alt in the beginning so you want to erase everything zoom in a little then set the pen color to whatever color you want to start with i'm just going to set it to like a blue color it's you can set it to whatever you want basically and then we're going to go we're going to wait 0.3 seconds before actually starting the game so after that we're gonna set the pen size to five set pen size to not change set pin size to five so that's how thick we're gonna draw the line as and then we're gonna get a forever loop so it's gonna forever forever um we're gonna change the pen color by pick random what color so we're just changing the pen color uh by pick random so we're gonna get this change pen color by pick random pick random 10 to 15. okay so after that we want to pen up the pin out and we're going to go to we're going to go to like somewhere down here so we're going to go to i'm going to go to pick random negative 240 to 240 and then for the y we're just going to go to negative 200 so like this so it'll spawn somewhere from here to here and then y will be negative 200. so all the fireworks will be somewhere down here and then we're gonna point direction of negative five to five so point in direction point in direction right here sorry and then we're gonna get a net pick random from negative five five so this okay and after that we're going to get the pen down so then we'll actually start drawing pen down and then we're going to make some variables now so we're going to make a variable so we can just delete this one so we're going to make a variable called speed and then all the variables with a lowercase will be for the sprite only so speed will be for the sprite only the speed so we're going to set the speed to 20 so the speed is going to be how fast it's moving so we're going to set it to 20 um and then we're going to repeat this amount of speed so they'll repeat 20 times basically repeat speed and then we're going to put move speed so we're just going to move 20 steps that's what it's basically saying and then we're going to change the speed by negative one so minus one and then we're gonna make two new variables so we're going to make a variable so this is going to be for for all sprites so we're going to name it number of clones so all the variables with upper case a number of clones one all the variables starting with the upper case letter is going to be for all sprites so we're going to be uh doing number of clones one and ready to explode and this is for all sprites again one so ready to explode one and number of clones one so we have the two variables so right now we're going to set those two variables to zero oops put that under here set number ready explode and number of clones one down here and then right here we're going to do how much you want to do how many um fireworks you want the thing to split into so when you hit it you can pick whatever amount you want to split so i did 10. you guys can do any amount you would like so i made it split into 10 and then we're gonna put number of clones one into this so repeat until 10 is less than the number of clones one and we're going to create a clone of myself and then after that we're going to make a new variable so this is for this sprite only so we're going to make it the first letter lowercase explode speed so that's how fast we're gonna have to explode so we're gonna set it to 20 again so set explode speed to 20. set ready to explode to one so we kind of simplified this game a little bit more i rather than the original one the original one was a bit more complex um so this is a little bit more simpler than the original um and then repeat 10 times we're gonna change the explosion speed by negative one explode speed by negative one okay so now we have the first script done now we're gonna get something called um when i start as a clone so we're going to go ctrl when i start as a clone let's drag here so when i start as a clone we're going to set the pen brightness to 50 so it looks cooler when you do that so i'll just make the fireworks look way better and we're gonna do change number of clones by one number of phones by one so keep on going up every time this script runs and then we're gonna wait until the ready explode is equal to one as right here we set the ready to explode as one once is greater than ten so we're going to get a wait until wait until we're going to get an equal equal to one so we're going to get it ready to explode ready to explode one into the first slot and then we're going to do a point in direction of either negative 8 180 to 180 so we're just going to pick a random so we're going to pick random negative 180 to 180 then we're going to repeat 10 times and then we're going to move the explosion speed step so right here we defined it as 20 so basically moving 20 steps move explode speed uh steps and then we're gonna change the brightness by negative one also another thing to add right here so down here remember we used to find the exploding speed to negative one so it will get slower as it goes progresses to go out so that's why we added this and then right here we're gonna add in another part so we're gonna change the pen brightness brightness by negative one oh yeah and this should be brightness not color so set this to brightness as well and then we're gonna use delete this clone i'm gonna use the delete this clone so it'll delete it once the script is finished okay and now we're just going to duplicate all these duplicate this two other times because we want to make three fireworks you guys can do what however much you want so we're gonna have to change these variable names so for the for the spike sprite only the uh lowercase letters uh lowercase words variables we don't have to change but for these we have to change so we're gonna make a new variable oops click the wrong one make a new variable so we're going to do number of clones to two for all sprites and the rest gonna do ready to explode ready to explode and then two for all sprites as well so we're going to switch out all these variables for number of clones too and ready to explode to so we need a different variable for each one and then for here we're gonna do ready to explode two and also for the explode speed we do not need to do another one because it's for the sprite only and then we'll go right here we're gonna do number of clones too and right here you can just right click and ready to explode too okay so i think that's it let's move on to the third one we're going to make another another set of variables we're going to do number of clones three and for all sprites as well and ready to explode ready to explode three so we have the variables now we're going to change them it's right here ready uh the number of clones three switch system ready to explode three right here we're gonna do number of clones three i don't think i change it here i'm gonna check yeah i did not so be sure to switch your variables so number of clones two you have to change all of them and they're ready to explode three and up here we have two more i think number of clones three and ready to explode set that to three okay so i think that should be it we're gonna add a black background and the 2021 message okay so right now as you can see um when we play the project it explodes but the trail marks do not disappear so if you wanted to make it disappear that's why we're going to make the black background sprite to stamp so we're going to paint a new sprite so what we just want to do is just draw a black box i'm just going to call this black background black background and we're just going to get the square tool and make just something about the size bigger than the screen okay so we're also gonna have to put this in the background so we're just gonna drag that to the center real quick um make it bigger um so we're gonna make it go to zero zero so we're going to do ctrl c go to the background and ctrl v so the background also has the black color as well so for the background we're just gonna get a one green flag clicked set ghost effect to 80 so then it will just have a little faint color so we're going to get set ghost effects goes to 80 and then right here forever loop make it go to the center which is zero zero so go to zero zero and then we're gonna stamp so then the streak marks will disappear all right okay now we're finished with the black black background as you can see the fireworks can explode and it looks pretty cool so now we're going to work on the message so now let's paint a new backdrop i mean not a new sprite also before we get into this right we want to change the different colors so as you can see when you play all of them have the about the same color so we want to change that by changing the starting color like make this one green and make this one red maybe look right or something like that so when you play now you can see they are different colors and one last thing we can also change the speed we can change the height of each one so the first one i'm gonna make it 20 second one i can make it like 22 and the third one i can make it a little lower and make it 18. so now you can see the height difference of the different fireworks as you can see it's like a little height difference yeah so it's pretty cool and now we can work on the sprite since we have all that finished we're just going to get the text i'm going to use the handwriting font i'm going to make it a red color because i tried it with white if you're gonna make it a white color and you make it change color effect the color is really faint so you want to use like something bright color red so we're gonna write like um happy new year's happy new year uh 20 20 i guess put a couple spaces 20 21 sorry not 20 20 20 21 okay like that and then we're gonna make it a little bit bigger so now we have that okay and we can work on the code so we're going to rename the sprite let's make it let's name it 2021 or something like that let's go to the code and then for the code we're just going to get our one green flag clicked and green flag clicked hide go to 300 y 0 so we want it to make it glided and then we're just going to make a little wait time right here like maybe three seconds and then we're gonna get a show and we're gonna make it glide three seconds three seconds to the center so zero zero and then we're going to get another one green plot clicked when green fly clicked forever change color effect by five and we need to add the music now so after this we're going to add the music uh what is it color oh yeah five and in the background we can just add the music go to sounds would import a sound so we just got with our youtube library this thing okay so we're just going to get one green flag clicked forever we're going to play the sound until done okay i'm going to turn the volume down a little bit so then you can hear me talking it a bit louder okay so now let's play it save um taking a while save it's because of the music that's why taking a while to save okay so now finally saved let's wait as you can see fireworks happy new year 2021 and wish you guys have a happy new year thank you guys for watching feel free to like share and subscribe and i'll see you guys in the next video bye
