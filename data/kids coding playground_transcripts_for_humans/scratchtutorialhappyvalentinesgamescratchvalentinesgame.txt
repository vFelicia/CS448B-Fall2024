00:00 - [Music]
00:08 - welcome back
00:09 - guys it's kidscodingplayground here and
00:12 - today we're back for another video
00:14 - and if you didn't know tomorrow is
00:16 - valentine's day
00:19 - we are working on valentine's game so
00:21 - let's full screen this
00:23 - and i'm gonna download it so play some
00:25 - music i i put on soft
00:28 - so um
00:32 - use the arrow keys to move it left or
00:34 - right
00:35 - you cannot move it up or down
00:37 - [Music]
00:39 - and then you click on the bow so it
00:42 - changes costumes
00:43 - click on like any part of the phone that
00:45 - shoots the arrow
00:49 - and it shows the numbers of course that
00:50 - are left
00:54 - and it shows the amount of arrows so i
00:57 - used three arrows
00:58 - [Music]
01:00 - four arrows five
01:03 - and then this is happy valentine's day
01:07 - so anyways
01:11 - let's start so i already made my new
01:14 - project i'm gonna rename
01:15 - the title to happy
01:19 - things called valentine's day
01:23 - happy valentine's game so let's set that
01:28 - valentine's
01:31 - game
01:34 - so we have to
01:37 - do some stuff so first i'm going to show
01:40 - you how to draw a bow and arrow so
01:42 - you can skip forward if you do not want
01:43 - to learn because i have
01:45 - them in the google uh google uh drive
01:49 - so so if you don't know how to
01:52 - log into google drive you can watch our
01:54 - video links in description
01:56 - so so if you know how to uh do it um
02:00 - cool do not use your school account if
02:02 - you if you have a school account so
02:04 - i'm gonna drag the bow
02:08 - arrow and the happy valentine's day
02:13 - so i'm gonna
02:18 - so there's three main costumes in the
02:20 - bow
02:21 - so we're going to draw the bow right now
02:23 - so i'm going to teach you how to draw it
02:25 - so skip forward if you do not want to
02:26 - draw
02:27 - know how to draw the bottle because we
02:28 - do have in the google drive or if you
02:30 - want to download one from online so
02:33 - so let's just draw it
02:38 - i'm going to paint a new sprite and then
02:39 - you can choose your color
02:41 - i'm not going to judge you if you make
02:42 - your bow green
02:44 - but you can make it any color you want
02:47 - it doesn't matter
02:48 - so we decided to use brown because
02:50 - that's the most
02:51 - main thing for bows so all bows are made
02:54 - of wood so that's why it's brown
02:56 - so yeah so you draw you start out with a
03:00 - rectangle
03:02 - and five outline
03:05 - and the inside is some brownish color or
03:07 - you can make a purple if you want to or
03:09 - blue
03:10 - and then you just raise up the middle
03:11 - with reshape tool and then you raise it
03:13 - up
03:14 - even more with the bottom to make
03:17 - like the bow
03:20 - the bow uh wood piece like a boomerang
03:24 - and i'm gonna make that larger
03:30 - and fit that so let's also do that for
03:32 - the other side
03:36 - and then we also need to make a string
03:38 - because bows always have
03:40 - strings it's called the bow string so i
03:43 - think that's what it's called i'm not
03:44 - sure
03:45 - so use shift key and then to make a
03:47 - perfect
03:48 - uh line all the way to the other side so
03:51 - that's a bow string
03:52 - but i but i kind of mispositioned the
03:55 - line
03:56 - so i drew the line right there so
04:00 - yeah this is going to be the first
04:01 - costume where there's
04:03 - the little bow the wood piece and the
04:06 - bow string
04:07 - and with the arrow so we're going to
04:09 - draw the arrow next
04:12 - let's make that a little bit larger so
04:14 - touch the string because that's just a
04:16 - flying string
04:20 - so we need to make the arrow but first
04:25 - we have to duplicate it
04:26 - so i'm gonna move that line a little bit
04:28 - it's a little bit dispositioned
04:30 - so i'm gonna duplicate these costumes
04:32 - two more times so i have three costumes
04:33 - in the end because
04:34 - two plus one is three so if you didn't
04:36 - know that's two plus one is three
04:38 - and um now we have three costumes
04:42 - so let's work on the first costume still
04:46 - shift key make the line and then
04:49 - make the arrow so
04:53 - um you need a square and this is a good
04:56 - trick
04:57 - click the delete button with the reshape
04:58 - tool and click delete
05:00 - and backup states not delete wait it is
05:02 - delete nevermind
05:04 - um and
05:08 - it turns into a triangle because a half
05:09 - of a square is a triangle
05:12 - uh so i'm going to move that a little
05:14 - bit
05:19 - so right there right on that thing
05:22 - oh yeah and we have to do the like
05:26 - i don't know what type of detail that is
05:28 - but we have to make the
05:30 - uh uh never mind we have to make the
05:33 - feathers
05:34 - um some arrows have feathers some do not
05:38 - and it's normally
05:41 - for native uh i like native people
05:43 - always have the red feathers i don't
05:45 - know why
05:45 - and they always dip their arrows in
05:47 - poison but this is
05:48 - red air red feathers don't ask why
05:52 - sometimes it's white feathers sometimes
05:53 - it's yellow feathers it doesn't matter
05:55 - what color you make it
05:58 - so i'm gonna move those things it looks
06:00 - a little bit horrible but you know
06:06 - yeah um i'm gonna put that on the bow
06:11 - group it all and then drag it on the
06:14 - ball
06:17 - let's drag down
06:25 - let's move it a little bit there we got
06:27 - a arrow on a bow
06:29 - so let's work on the second costume
06:34 - which also has the errors let's copy
06:35 - paste that
06:37 - ctrl v ctrl c ctrl v so that we got that
06:40 - on the middle and then we gotta pull out
06:42 - the whole string with the bow string
06:44 - without with the reshape tool so you
06:47 - move that up
06:51 - and then you have to move that
06:55 - yeah and there you got it and then the
06:57 - last costume you keep it as it is
06:59 - so it's when you find the bow
07:02 - so yeah next we have to rotate yeah
07:05 - that's
07:06 - that's all we have to do right rotate
07:09 - the bow so
07:12 - group
07:15 - a little arrow little two arrows move it
07:18 - with the shift key and make it
07:20 - directly rotated
07:23 - it's the point to the right side for it
07:25 - to point up so
07:27 - that's how it is and make the bow string
07:30 - right on the cross in the middle
07:32 - do that for the same for these
07:38 - group la la la put it over there
07:41 - and then same thing
07:45 - group
07:49 - move it down
07:52 - there we go above
07:56 - well we're gonna use the original one
07:58 - because i honestly think that looks
07:59 - better
08:00 - so um yeah
08:03 - i don't think we need these small bows
08:04 - these are kind of small so
08:06 - anyways let's just delete these and
08:08 - there we go
08:09 - regular ball we already have links in
08:11 - the description google drive
08:13 - or we can get one from online like what
08:14 - i said earlier so
08:16 - we also have to upload the heart oh yeah
08:19 - and you also have to make the arrows
08:20 - right just copy paste that
08:21 - and we have to just copy paste this
08:25 - arrow ctrl c
08:27 - ctrl v then go arrow
08:36 - you go center it on the center of the
08:38 - arrow in between the feathers
08:40 - and the tip so delete that
08:45 - and we have to add the heart for what
08:47 - you have to shoot
08:49 - so let's shoot the heart
08:54 - all right so
08:59 - we have to make the backdrop so it's
09:01 - called hearts
09:06 - hearts asia itchy
09:10 - i don't know why it's called hearts even
09:11 - though it's one heart it's just one
09:13 - heart it's not even
09:14 - multiple hearts so anyways just like
09:16 - this backdrop
09:17 - and we have to get coding so first let's
09:20 - work on the
09:21 - bowen arrow
09:26 - so so the green slag is clicked
09:34 - it will point in direction zero
09:39 - facing up
09:45 - and go to x zero
09:49 - net y negative 160 so i already have
09:51 - that that position because i drag it for
09:53 - my backpack
09:54 - set size is 75 it's already 75 but let's
09:57 - just put it in
10:03 - so um i'm gonna make this around 25
10:06 - 20 minutes or 25 minutes so stay tuned
10:11 - so anyways forever
10:23 - touching the mouse pointer
10:28 - oh if then else i meant
10:32 - if then else touching
10:36 - the mouse pointer then it will switch
10:38 - costume to costume
10:40 - 2
10:45 - yeah so it'll be like like
10:50 - i don't know that's a bad explanation
10:53 - like like a pullback of the bowstring so
10:56 - uh yeah um the switch costing costume
11:00 - two
11:00 - uh so you need to if and then
11:04 - if then the mouse is down then i'll fly
11:06 - to the arrow because yeah your
11:07 - mouse has to be on the thing you click
11:10 - on it and then it'll fire the thing so
11:14 - mouse pointer
11:18 - mouse down if the mouse down then switch
11:20 - costume the
11:21 - costume three
11:27 - broadcast fire arrow so we'll get back
11:30 - to that later i think
11:31 - we'll get to that in a minute
11:40 - arrow um and wait one second
11:46 - and then elf switch costume to costume
11:54 - one
11:57 - uh and we're gonna add the
12:02 - right arrow and left arrow rotate so
12:05 - if the
12:09 - well um this this block whatever it's
12:11 - called when the
12:12 - right arrow is clicked it repress
12:16 - just duplicate this right now make the
12:18 - left arrow
12:22 - then move uh turn one degrees to the
12:25 - right
12:26 - this is turn one degrees to the left
12:29 - very little but when you hold down the
12:31 - key
12:31 - it moves like this
12:35 - so let's see
12:38 - you see like it's moving
12:45 - so this is not working yet because i
12:47 - haven't coded the arrow
12:48 - and yeah so let's do that
12:52 - so uh as you can see it was a little bit
12:55 - jumpy here
12:56 - like if you're not on the right thing
12:59 - you'll just
13:00 - jump everywhere like it's like a frog or
13:02 - something but it's not it's a bow
13:04 - and uh so we have to add some code
13:07 - well this was already planned out so
13:10 - yeah
13:11 - uh so i have to make a variable distance
13:14 - to mouse
13:25 - this is a mouse
13:28 - and then i have to set
13:32 - distance to mouse
13:36 - uh set
13:40 - distance i think i already made that
13:43 - did i make that variable yet i don't
13:45 - think i made that variable yet
13:49 - i took the arrow from the project so
13:51 - it's my backpack so
13:53 - it still has this error used variable
13:55 - let's smack that out of here so
13:57 - send distance to mouse to distance to
13:59 - mouse
14:00 - distance to mouse pointer to be precise
14:05 - distance to mouse pointer so there we go
14:08 - and then uh we have to do uh or
14:16 - so we're working on this script okay um
14:18 - let's move this up
14:19 - let's move this away and then we or
14:24 - um if touching
14:28 - mouse pointer or
14:32 - distance to mouse is less than 85
14:36 - so it won't move a lot and it won't
14:40 - bounce up and down and down
14:42 - and up so if 85 is larger than distance
14:45 - to mouse
14:47 - yeah or it's touching that mouse pointer
14:49 - so
14:50 - let's drag this in
14:55 - uh less than so let's put that in
14:58 - and let's try it it's like it isn't
15:02 - wobbling all over the place anymore see
15:06 - working correctly good so now we're
15:09 - gonna work on the one and only
15:12 - other strip the code for the arrow um
15:16 - so this does not actually have a lot of
15:17 - code so this is actually a pretty easy
15:20 - project to make
15:23 - so you need clones but first i'm going
15:25 - to start with
15:26 - this and i'm going to make the variable
15:28 - arrow used so this is like a
15:33 - there we go
15:36 - so when the green flag is clicked set
15:38 - arrow used to zero because you didn't
15:40 - use any arrows in the beginning
15:42 - and then set size to 75
15:49 - and um hide
15:55 - uh i'm gonna
15:59 - i'm gonna do this next so when i start
16:02 - as a clone
16:07 - control yes
16:12 - let's hide this real quick so when i
16:14 - start as a clone
16:17 - it will so first i'm gonna do this uh
16:22 - when i receive fire
16:23 - arrow i'll change
16:27 - i never use my one because i always have
16:29 - that i'll create clone
16:30 - of myself so and then when i start as a
16:34 - clone
16:35 - it'll go to the bow and arrow
16:41 - so we have it right here bow and arrow
16:43 - and then point in direction direction of
16:46 - bow and arrow so
16:47 - point in direction
16:50 - direction of bow and arrow
16:58 - direction you gotta change this one
16:59 - first remember this is like the tricky
17:02 - thing
17:02 - the direction of bow and arrow move 50
17:05 - steps
17:08 - so we have it right here so move up
17:13 - here i'll keep on moving it'll um
17:16 - show
17:22 - and then repeat until touching edge so
17:24 - it won't stop until it touches the edge
17:26 - so let's have that repeat until
17:29 - touching edge
17:34 - move 10 steps and delete this clone and
17:38 - then so let's go back to control
17:40 - delete so let's test it out
17:45 - look it's firing the arrow great so now
17:48 - we're gonna work on the
17:49 - happy va uh let's actually work on the
17:51 - heart first so um
17:54 - heart so this has some code but not that
17:57 - much so
17:58 - part
18:03 - when the green flag is clicked oh my god
18:05 - that's really small
18:08 - it will set size to 30 percent
18:16 - oh wow it's really big right now i think
18:18 - 30 is good enough
18:20 - yeah no no too small maybe like 50.
18:23 - let's try 50
18:25 - because i was using a different heart in
18:26 - the demo so
18:29 - 50 is fine so it'll hide
18:35 - you know set number of hearts to 20.
18:42 - yeah we have to make a new variable of
18:43 - course
18:45 - so this is the countdown of how much
18:47 - hearts you didn't shoot yet so
18:50 - uh set um number of hearts to
18:54 - 20. only 20 hearts
18:57 - you know repeat number of hearts and
18:59 - we'll keep on repeating
19:01 - and making hearts
19:05 - until they get 20. so uh repeat
19:08 - where's that right here so repeat number
19:12 - of hots
19:15 - and create clone of myself
19:22 - and when the green flag is clicked
19:27 - it will go forever
19:32 - and then if then touching
19:35 - no if then the number of hearts equals
19:37 - zero so that means there's no more
19:39 - hearts
19:40 - left on the board then it'll show the
19:43 - valentine's thing but we'll have to
19:44 - broadcast a message of course
19:47 - yeah of course we have to broadcast a
19:48 - message so
19:50 - broadcast happy valentine's day
19:55 - happy choose valentine's happy
19:56 - valentine's
19:58 - happy valentine's
20:02 - and then we have to work on this last
20:04 - script
20:05 - so when i start as a clone
20:10 - then it'll go to x x position just a
20:14 - position
20:15 - i'll go to x pick random
20:18 - negative 200
20:21 - to positive 200
20:28 - and why pick random 25 to 145 so both
20:31 - positive so 25
20:36 - and then 145 so it will be up
20:39 - around here so and the x will be around
20:43 - here and that y will be up here so
20:45 - that's why if we had similar thing to do
20:48 - in the pokemon game
20:50 - so um i use a different part i use
20:52 - scratch's heart
20:53 - there's two types of hearts and i
20:55 - decided to use them both but it looks
20:56 - like the hard one
20:57 - the the purple one is bigger than the
21:01 - red one
21:05 - but also varying size so go to
21:08 - um and then we'll make it next costume
21:11 - because
21:12 - i just want to make it more fun and
21:16 - i'll show and i just want to make it
21:17 - like different variations of colors
21:20 - just to make it more fun and i'll wait
21:23 - until touching the arrow and then i'll
21:26 - hide
21:27 - i'm not not hi make the sound
21:30 - so it's touching air
21:35 - touching arrow
21:40 - then it will start sound
21:45 - yeah it's already there all the sprites
21:47 - have this
21:48 - i think the scratch count has meow not
21:50 - sure
21:51 - so it'll change number of hearts by
21:54 - minus one
21:57 - so change number of hearts by
22:02 - -1 and then delete this clump
22:10 - now we're going to work on the happy
22:11 - valentine's day sprite
22:13 - and we're gonna demo it in the end so
22:15 - when the green flag just clicked
22:20 - oh yeah we also have to make the music
22:23 - uh i'll make it
22:24 - hide and then when i receive
22:30 - happy valentine's you know show
22:33 - we have to add the music real quick uh
22:36 - the backdrop
22:37 - has it so when the green flag is clicked
22:41 - you know how i love making this update
22:43 - yes
22:44 - uh i'll play it sets volume to 15.
22:48 - it's cool how you can make scratch the
22:49 - different volumes
22:51 - so i can make it like quieter already
22:55 - so set volume to 15
22:58 - play sound dance energetic so dancing
23:05 - yeah this one so and i'll go forever
23:12 - dance energetic until done
23:15 - so let's do this um
23:19 - screen let's do it
23:23 - so all of them are purple
23:26 - that was an absolute fail
23:29 - this is what happens when you get ideas
23:31 - from someone
23:33 - so yeah we're gonna um
23:36 - make the heart uh do color effect
23:39 - instead of just changing to the next
23:42 - costume because it'll always be the next
23:44 - costume
23:45 - well you can do this if it's if you want
23:46 - to it's optional i like all my hearts
23:49 - red but that's fine
23:50 - i mean um there's heart red so
23:54 - we have to make the color effect
23:59 - by 25
24:02 - and click on it
24:05 - this does not work just just just don't
24:08 - do the color effect
24:11 - party hearts
24:16 - got to work okay so pick random one
24:19 - two three bajillion three hundred
24:23 - so all different colors really fun cool

welcome back guys it's kidscodingplayground here and today we're back for another video and if you didn't know tomorrow is valentine's day we are working on valentine's game so let's full screen this and i'm gonna download it so play some music i i put on soft so um use the arrow keys to move it left or right you cannot move it up or down and then you click on the bow so it changes costumes click on like any part of the phone that shoots the arrow and it shows the numbers of course that are left and it shows the amount of arrows so i used three arrows four arrows five and then this is happy valentine's day so anyways let's start so i already made my new project i'm gonna rename the title to happy things called valentine's day happy valentine's game so let's set that valentine's game so we have to do some stuff so first i'm going to show you how to draw a bow and arrow so you can skip forward if you do not want to learn because i have them in the google uh google uh drive so so if you don't know how to log into google drive you can watch our video links in description so so if you know how to uh do it um cool do not use your school account if you if you have a school account so i'm gonna drag the bow arrow and the happy valentine's day so i'm gonna so there's three main costumes in the bow so we're going to draw the bow right now so i'm going to teach you how to draw it so skip forward if you do not want to draw know how to draw the bottle because we do have in the google drive or if you want to download one from online so so let's just draw it i'm going to paint a new sprite and then you can choose your color i'm not going to judge you if you make your bow green but you can make it any color you want it doesn't matter so we decided to use brown because that's the most main thing for bows so all bows are made of wood so that's why it's brown so yeah so you draw you start out with a rectangle and five outline and the inside is some brownish color or you can make a purple if you want to or blue and then you just raise up the middle with reshape tool and then you raise it up even more with the bottom to make like the bow the bow uh wood piece like a boomerang and i'm gonna make that larger and fit that so let's also do that for the other side and then we also need to make a string because bows always have strings it's called the bow string so i think that's what it's called i'm not sure so use shift key and then to make a perfect uh line all the way to the other side so that's a bow string but i but i kind of mispositioned the line so i drew the line right there so yeah this is going to be the first costume where there's the little bow the wood piece and the bow string and with the arrow so we're going to draw the arrow next let's make that a little bit larger so touch the string because that's just a flying string so we need to make the arrow but first we have to duplicate it so i'm gonna move that line a little bit it's a little bit dispositioned so i'm gonna duplicate these costumes two more times so i have three costumes in the end because two plus one is three so if you didn't know that's two plus one is three and um now we have three costumes so let's work on the first costume still shift key make the line and then make the arrow so um you need a square and this is a good trick click the delete button with the reshape tool and click delete and backup states not delete wait it is delete nevermind um and it turns into a triangle because a half of a square is a triangle uh so i'm going to move that a little bit so right there right on that thing oh yeah and we have to do the like i don't know what type of detail that is but we have to make the uh uh never mind we have to make the feathers um some arrows have feathers some do not and it's normally for native uh i like native people always have the red feathers i don't know why and they always dip their arrows in poison but this is red air red feathers don't ask why sometimes it's white feathers sometimes it's yellow feathers it doesn't matter what color you make it so i'm gonna move those things it looks a little bit horrible but you know yeah um i'm gonna put that on the bow group it all and then drag it on the ball let's drag down let's move it a little bit there we got a arrow on a bow so let's work on the second costume which also has the errors let's copy paste that ctrl v ctrl c ctrl v so that we got that on the middle and then we gotta pull out the whole string with the bow string without with the reshape tool so you move that up and then you have to move that yeah and there you got it and then the last costume you keep it as it is so it's when you find the bow so yeah next we have to rotate yeah that's that's all we have to do right rotate the bow so group a little arrow little two arrows move it with the shift key and make it directly rotated it's the point to the right side for it to point up so that's how it is and make the bow string right on the cross in the middle do that for the same for these group la la la put it over there and then same thing group move it down there we go above well we're gonna use the original one because i honestly think that looks better so um yeah i don't think we need these small bows these are kind of small so anyways let's just delete these and there we go regular ball we already have links in the description google drive or we can get one from online like what i said earlier so we also have to upload the heart oh yeah and you also have to make the arrows right just copy paste that and we have to just copy paste this arrow ctrl c ctrl v then go arrow you go center it on the center of the arrow in between the feathers and the tip so delete that and we have to add the heart for what you have to shoot so let's shoot the heart all right so we have to make the backdrop so it's called hearts hearts asia itchy i don't know why it's called hearts even though it's one heart it's just one heart it's not even multiple hearts so anyways just like this backdrop and we have to get coding so first let's work on the bowen arrow so so the green slag is clicked it will point in direction zero facing up and go to x zero net y negative 160 so i already have that that position because i drag it for my backpack set size is 75 it's already 75 but let's just put it in so um i'm gonna make this around 25 20 minutes or 25 minutes so stay tuned so anyways forever touching the mouse pointer oh if then else i meant if then else touching the mouse pointer then it will switch costume to costume 2 yeah so it'll be like like i don't know that's a bad explanation like like a pullback of the bowstring so uh yeah um the switch costing costume two uh so you need to if and then if then the mouse is down then i'll fly to the arrow because yeah your mouse has to be on the thing you click on it and then it'll fire the thing so mouse pointer mouse down if the mouse down then switch costume the costume three broadcast fire arrow so we'll get back to that later i think we'll get to that in a minute arrow um and wait one second and then elf switch costume to costume one uh and we're gonna add the right arrow and left arrow rotate so if the well um this this block whatever it's called when the right arrow is clicked it repress just duplicate this right now make the left arrow then move uh turn one degrees to the right this is turn one degrees to the left very little but when you hold down the key it moves like this so let's see you see like it's moving so this is not working yet because i haven't coded the arrow and yeah so let's do that so uh as you can see it was a little bit jumpy here like if you're not on the right thing you'll just jump everywhere like it's like a frog or something but it's not it's a bow and uh so we have to add some code well this was already planned out so yeah uh so i have to make a variable distance to mouse this is a mouse and then i have to set distance to mouse uh set distance i think i already made that did i make that variable yet i don't think i made that variable yet i took the arrow from the project so it's my backpack so it still has this error used variable let's smack that out of here so send distance to mouse to distance to mouse distance to mouse pointer to be precise distance to mouse pointer so there we go and then uh we have to do uh or so we're working on this script okay um let's move this up let's move this away and then we or um if touching mouse pointer or distance to mouse is less than 85 so it won't move a lot and it won't bounce up and down and down and up so if 85 is larger than distance to mouse yeah or it's touching that mouse pointer so let's drag this in uh less than so let's put that in and let's try it it's like it isn't wobbling all over the place anymore see working correctly good so now we're gonna work on the one and only other strip the code for the arrow um so this does not actually have a lot of code so this is actually a pretty easy project to make so you need clones but first i'm going to start with this and i'm going to make the variable arrow used so this is like a there we go so when the green flag is clicked set arrow used to zero because you didn't use any arrows in the beginning and then set size to 75 and um hide uh i'm gonna i'm gonna do this next so when i start as a clone control yes let's hide this real quick so when i start as a clone it will so first i'm gonna do this uh when i receive fire arrow i'll change i never use my one because i always have that i'll create clone of myself so and then when i start as a clone it'll go to the bow and arrow so we have it right here bow and arrow and then point in direction direction of bow and arrow so point in direction direction of bow and arrow direction you gotta change this one first remember this is like the tricky thing the direction of bow and arrow move 50 steps so we have it right here so move up here i'll keep on moving it'll um show and then repeat until touching edge so it won't stop until it touches the edge so let's have that repeat until touching edge move 10 steps and delete this clone and then so let's go back to control delete so let's test it out look it's firing the arrow great so now we're gonna work on the happy va uh let's actually work on the heart first so um heart so this has some code but not that much so part when the green flag is clicked oh my god that's really small it will set size to 30 percent oh wow it's really big right now i think 30 is good enough yeah no no too small maybe like 50. let's try 50 because i was using a different heart in the demo so 50 is fine so it'll hide you know set number of hearts to 20. yeah we have to make a new variable of course so this is the countdown of how much hearts you didn't shoot yet so uh set um number of hearts to 20. only 20 hearts you know repeat number of hearts and we'll keep on repeating and making hearts until they get 20. so uh repeat where's that right here so repeat number of hots and create clone of myself and when the green flag is clicked it will go forever and then if then touching no if then the number of hearts equals zero so that means there's no more hearts left on the board then it'll show the valentine's thing but we'll have to broadcast a message of course yeah of course we have to broadcast a message so broadcast happy valentine's day happy choose valentine's happy valentine's happy valentine's and then we have to work on this last script so when i start as a clone then it'll go to x x position just a position i'll go to x pick random negative 200 to positive 200 and why pick random 25 to 145 so both positive so 25 and then 145 so it will be up around here so and the x will be around here and that y will be up here so that's why if we had similar thing to do in the pokemon game so um i use a different part i use scratch's heart there's two types of hearts and i decided to use them both but it looks like the hard one the the purple one is bigger than the red one but also varying size so go to um and then we'll make it next costume because i just want to make it more fun and i'll show and i just want to make it like different variations of colors just to make it more fun and i'll wait until touching the arrow and then i'll hide i'm not not hi make the sound so it's touching air touching arrow then it will start sound yeah it's already there all the sprites have this i think the scratch count has meow not sure so it'll change number of hearts by minus one so change number of hearts by 1 and then delete this clump now we're going to work on the happy valentine's day sprite and we're gonna demo it in the end so when the green flag just clicked oh yeah we also have to make the music uh i'll make it hide and then when i receive happy valentine's you know show we have to add the music real quick uh the backdrop has it so when the green flag is clicked you know how i love making this update yes uh i'll play it sets volume to 15. it's cool how you can make scratch the different volumes so i can make it like quieter already so set volume to 15 play sound dance energetic so dancing yeah this one so and i'll go forever dance energetic until done so let's do this um screen let's do it so all of them are purple that was an absolute fail this is what happens when you get ideas from someone so yeah we're gonna um make the heart uh do color effect instead of just changing to the next costume because it'll always be the next costume well you can do this if it's if you want to it's optional i like all my hearts red but that's fine i mean um there's heart red so we have to make the color effect by 25 and click on it this does not work just just just don't do the color effect party hearts got to work okay so pick random one two three bajillion three hundred so all different colors really fun cool party hearts see click on it i think i'll get all of those oh yeah this is happy valentine's day so we're done with this um so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below if you celebrate
