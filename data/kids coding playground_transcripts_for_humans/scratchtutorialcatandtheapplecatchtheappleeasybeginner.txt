00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - welcome back guys and it's kids code and
00:08 - click run again and today we will be
00:10 - working on another project called cat in
00:13 - the Apple today we will be working on
00:18 - this game basically the cat jumps up and
00:21 - Trust and get the Apple before it
00:22 - disappears cat and that we will be
00:28 - learning these following concepts in
00:30 - scratch I didn't show or ever loop one
00:33 - key pressed touch touching sprite drawn
00:36 - chess and broadcasting messages so this
00:42 - is the demo of the game and we will be
00:46 - playing this game we use arrow keys to
00:49 - move the apples come up at a different
00:53 - time you press the spacebar to jump but
00:56 - it's not that smooth there's a forest
01:01 - it's like maybe trying to get the apples
01:04 - [Music]
01:07 - music
01:08 - so anyways before I start please like
01:13 - share subscribe and comment in the
01:18 - comment section below so this game isn't
01:23 - that smooth because it's for beginners
01:25 - and I'm going to be working on another
01:28 - game later that's similar to this so
01:31 - first things first let's rename the
01:33 - project to cat and so then we have to
01:41 - make a variable called sport because
01:44 - that's how you keep track of the score
01:48 - and then so we gotta get a backdrop so
01:52 - you didn't take any backdrop you won it
01:54 - can be like a pool or anything but we're
01:57 - gonna make a cat in an apple so it's
01:58 - gonna be at the forest so the backdrop
02:02 - has a little bit code when the green
02:06 - flag is clicked the green flag is
02:10 - clicked
02:11 - look find the sound you can use any
02:14 - sound you want but I'm gonna use you can
02:17 - go to loops if you want to do it but you
02:19 - can also search it oh I'm going to use
02:20 - dance magic I'm gonna use this dance
02:26 - mashup then I'm gonna go and you always
02:30 - need a forever loop and then you put
02:33 - dance until dawn that's the backdrop
02:38 - code so now we'll be working on the cat
02:42 - so we can rename this to the cat um you
02:46 - can take this I think so we always have
02:50 - to start out with it flag clicked flag
03:01 - clicked go to if you make him go to
03:03 - anywhere let's say make him go right
03:06 - here a little bit up probably around
03:11 - here um it'll go to the front layer
03:16 - let's make it go to the front layer so
03:18 - then it's in front of all the trees so
03:21 - where's that good a friend later right
03:26 - there and then you always have to set
03:29 - the score 2-0 in the beginning next we
03:36 - have to make the right arrow and left
03:38 - arrow so when the right arrow is pressed
03:45 - it will point in Direction 90 so it will
03:49 - be facing this way but first we have to
03:51 - put this thing so when it's pointing to
03:54 - the other side for the left arrow it
03:55 - won't flip over so let's make it point
03:58 - in Direction 90 move 10 steps to the
04:06 - right next costume cuz ask to change its
04:09 - costume and if find edge you'll bounce
04:13 - so you cannot get off the board so the
04:18 - right hand and left arrow are pretty
04:20 - simple you just have to duplicate it by
04:22 - right-clicking
04:23 - and you but you gets a left arrow and
04:26 - your point in direction negative night
04:29 - since we did the rotation cell left
04:32 - right this thing that means it won't
04:35 - flip over so and then you also need to
04:37 - change this so you actually don't have
04:42 - to move negative ten steps because it's
04:46 - pointing direction negative ninety so
04:49 - then it'll be pointing the other way
04:51 - left the left side will be pointing on
04:54 - the left side and then so then you don't
04:56 - have to move negative ten steps so when
05:03 - so this is the demo let's see as you can
05:06 - see it moves so it also plays the music
05:11 - so when the space key is pressed repeat
05:14 - 15 times so change the light by ten so
05:19 - keep it'll go up Oh change the Y by ten
05:23 - you keep on going up next cos do and
05:29 - then you can just duplicate that and
05:32 - then you have to make this negative 10
05:38 - so it comes back down let's see so you
05:45 - can see it moves up and down when you
05:47 - click the space so next we're going to
05:50 - work on we're gonna get three threes
05:52 - first so you can use any for you one but
05:56 - let's use this tree let's move it right
05:59 - here top this tree move it right here
06:11 - you can also duplicate if you want
06:14 - oopsies put it right here so that is
06:20 - just for decoration so those are the
06:26 - treats they don't have any code so yeah
06:29 - you're gonna get the apples right this
06:32 - sprite so the Apple when when the green
06:38 - flag is clicked you can make the Apple a
06:43 - little bit smaller I think it's a little
06:45 - bit too big to make it 75 I'll go to
06:49 - let's make it go to right here
06:53 - then it'll hide in the beginning you
06:59 - know forever
07:02 - it'll wait pick random so you got so
07:07 - we'd use pick random one two three
07:10 - seconds so I'll pick a random time to
07:13 - show and then you need to show and then
07:19 - you gotta wait three seconds and then it
07:25 - will hide so it'll come out and then
07:28 - from one to three seconds it'll wait
07:30 - three seconds it'll hide again if you
07:33 - have three seconds to cache the Apple
07:35 - and then so we're working on the cat
07:40 - again we're not done with this code yet
07:42 - so when flag clicked go go forever let's
07:48 - zoom in we'll go forever
07:53 - I'll go forever and then you can put it
08:00 - let's put it if then statement so if
08:04 - it's touching if the cat is touching any
08:08 - Apple you need the or operator to make
08:12 - three you gotta put the orange like this
08:14 - or and then you get three so you gotta
08:16 - put touching so first we got to
08:19 - duplicate these apples duplicate
08:23 - duplicate and then let's go back to the
08:29 - cat
08:29 - it's then touching touching any Apple
08:34 - touching Apple one Apple Apple 2 or
08:50 - Apple 3 then it will broadcast a new
08:55 - message we gotta make a message called
08:57 - got Apple got happen and then you have
09:08 - to do when I receive got Apple then you
09:11 - know change the score by one because the
09:14 - score has to go up so we're still
09:23 - working on the Apple code when I receive
09:25 - got Apple bill hide so we gotta use this
09:30 - for all the apples so let's drag this
09:34 - into this one this one and this one so
09:41 - before we're done we also have to change
09:45 - to the go-to so it's just Apple three
09:49 - words out right here so let's make it go
09:51 - to right here so we can go to go to
10:00 - right here
10:01 - use a go to right here and then Apple to
10:05 - the same you can make it go to the right
10:08 - computer and we can also change the
10:16 - color so Apple it's optional but um
10:19 - let's just do it
10:21 - we can make this a Golden Apple
10:26 - we just want a Golden Apple and we can
10:29 - make this one a green apple
10:37 - yeah that's fine so we're done for today
10:41 - and thank you for watching and I'm gonna
10:44 - demo the game before we're going as you
10:47 - can see that adversity pop-up that waits
10:50 - one two three seconds and then I can get
10:52 - the score the music is working
10:55 - [Music]
11:02 - thank you for watching everybody and
11:05 - have a good day
11:07 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys and it's kids code and click run again and today we will be working on another project called cat in the Apple today we will be working on this game basically the cat jumps up and Trust and get the Apple before it disappears cat and that we will be learning these following concepts in scratch I didn't show or ever loop one key pressed touch touching sprite drawn chess and broadcasting messages so this is the demo of the game and we will be playing this game we use arrow keys to move the apples come up at a different time you press the spacebar to jump but it's not that smooth there's a forest it's like maybe trying to get the apples music so anyways before I start please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below so this game isn't that smooth because it's for beginners and I'm going to be working on another game later that's similar to this so first things first let's rename the project to cat and so then we have to make a variable called sport because that's how you keep track of the score and then so we gotta get a backdrop so you didn't take any backdrop you won it can be like a pool or anything but we're gonna make a cat in an apple so it's gonna be at the forest so the backdrop has a little bit code when the green flag is clicked the green flag is clicked look find the sound you can use any sound you want but I'm gonna use you can go to loops if you want to do it but you can also search it oh I'm going to use dance magic I'm gonna use this dance mashup then I'm gonna go and you always need a forever loop and then you put dance until dawn that's the backdrop code so now we'll be working on the cat so we can rename this to the cat um you can take this I think so we always have to start out with it flag clicked flag clicked go to if you make him go to anywhere let's say make him go right here a little bit up probably around here um it'll go to the front layer let's make it go to the front layer so then it's in front of all the trees so where's that good a friend later right there and then you always have to set the score 20 in the beginning next we have to make the right arrow and left arrow so when the right arrow is pressed it will point in Direction 90 so it will be facing this way but first we have to put this thing so when it's pointing to the other side for the left arrow it won't flip over so let's make it point in Direction 90 move 10 steps to the right next costume cuz ask to change its costume and if find edge you'll bounce so you cannot get off the board so the right hand and left arrow are pretty simple you just have to duplicate it by rightclicking and you but you gets a left arrow and your point in direction negative night since we did the rotation cell left right this thing that means it won't flip over so and then you also need to change this so you actually don't have to move negative ten steps because it's pointing direction negative ninety so then it'll be pointing the other way left the left side will be pointing on the left side and then so then you don't have to move negative ten steps so when so this is the demo let's see as you can see it moves so it also plays the music so when the space key is pressed repeat 15 times so change the light by ten so keep it'll go up Oh change the Y by ten you keep on going up next cos do and then you can just duplicate that and then you have to make this negative 10 so it comes back down let's see so you can see it moves up and down when you click the space so next we're going to work on we're gonna get three threes first so you can use any for you one but let's use this tree let's move it right here top this tree move it right here you can also duplicate if you want oopsies put it right here so that is just for decoration so those are the treats they don't have any code so yeah you're gonna get the apples right this sprite so the Apple when when the green flag is clicked you can make the Apple a little bit smaller I think it's a little bit too big to make it 75 I'll go to let's make it go to right here then it'll hide in the beginning you know forever it'll wait pick random so you got so we'd use pick random one two three seconds so I'll pick a random time to show and then you need to show and then you gotta wait three seconds and then it will hide so it'll come out and then from one to three seconds it'll wait three seconds it'll hide again if you have three seconds to cache the Apple and then so we're working on the cat again we're not done with this code yet so when flag clicked go go forever let's zoom in we'll go forever I'll go forever and then you can put it let's put it if then statement so if it's touching if the cat is touching any Apple you need the or operator to make three you gotta put the orange like this or and then you get three so you gotta put touching so first we got to duplicate these apples duplicate duplicate and then let's go back to the cat it's then touching touching any Apple touching Apple one Apple Apple 2 or Apple 3 then it will broadcast a new message we gotta make a message called got Apple got happen and then you have to do when I receive got Apple then you know change the score by one because the score has to go up so we're still working on the Apple code when I receive got Apple bill hide so we gotta use this for all the apples so let's drag this into this one this one and this one so before we're done we also have to change to the goto so it's just Apple three words out right here so let's make it go to right here so we can go to go to right here use a go to right here and then Apple to the same you can make it go to the right computer and we can also change the color so Apple it's optional but um let's just do it we can make this a Golden Apple we just want a Golden Apple and we can make this one a green apple yeah that's fine so we're done for today and thank you for watching and I'm gonna demo the game before we're going as you can see that adversity popup that waits one two three seconds and then I can get the score the music is working thank you for watching everybody and have a good day
