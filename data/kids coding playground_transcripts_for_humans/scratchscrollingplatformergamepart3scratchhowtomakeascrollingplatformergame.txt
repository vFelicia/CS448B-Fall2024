00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:09 - kids coding playground
00:10 - today we're doing the third part for
00:12 - this uh scrolling platformer
00:14 - so i'll just go through what we'll be
00:17 - doing today
00:18 - so today we'll be just doing the jumping
00:21 - moving around now the um platform
00:24 - actually stops you
00:25 - and we will be doing the x scrolling
00:28 - and however there are a couple bugs when
00:30 - you go to the bottom you're not dead
00:32 - we will do that in future videos and you
00:35 - can
00:35 - glitch to the top like that even though
00:38 - you're not jumping
00:39 - so we will do that later
00:43 - so now let's go to our previous project
00:47 - so let's go to our project
00:50 - go to my stuff
00:56 - so i will scroll through the code just
00:59 - to
01:00 - let you guys look at
01:03 - it if you missed anything so
01:08 - just get anything you missed
01:12 - scroll a little slow okay
01:16 - so now let's go to the platforms
01:20 - that's all the code for the platforms
01:21 - pretty simple
01:24 - not too much so now we will be adding
01:27 - the scrolling
01:28 - so let's go to your play game
01:31 - when i receive play game script okay so
01:34 - you want to get the set
01:36 - scroll x to the x position
01:41 - set scroll x to x position
01:46 - so now you have scrolling x scrolling
01:50 - so now we have x scrolling that's cool
01:54 - now we have the scrolling physics down
01:56 - let's go
01:57 - on to the um player so
02:00 - for the player um i believe we have to
02:04 - make a
02:05 - new block let's make a new block
02:08 - so we already have the change player x
02:10 - by now we're going to make the change
02:12 - player y by
02:14 - change player y by
02:18 - change player y by add one input and put
02:21 - s y
02:22 - in there like that press ok
02:27 - so we're going to define this block real
02:28 - quick
02:30 - so we will change the y
02:34 - to whatever parameter is in here so just
02:37 - drag that into here
02:39 - and then we want to call the position
02:42 - so that's just to const position is just
02:45 - to constantly
02:46 - shift it to the scroll so it'll scroll
02:49 - with it
02:51 - go to the position of the scrolling
02:54 - so after that you want to get a repeat
02:56 - until
02:59 - repeat until not touching platforms
03:04 - so repeat until not touching platforms
03:10 - platforms and you want to change the y
03:14 - by one so this is just to make it go
03:16 - back up a little bit
03:18 - so it won't fall through the platform
03:21 - just trying to make it even out on the
03:25 - platform so you want to change the y by
03:28 - one
03:29 - recall the position so it'll keep on
03:32 - positioning it
03:33 - and you want to go to the tick script
03:36 - and you want to change the y
03:38 - player y by negative 8.
03:42 - so now i will show you guys as you can
03:44 - see it doesn't look good it's
03:46 - just falling through the like a little
03:48 - bit
03:49 - and it's keep on bouncing up and down up
03:51 - and down
03:52 - and when you move it's moving very slow
03:56 - and we don't want that
03:57 - so what you want to do is go to the tick
04:00 - click right click click edit and run
04:03 - screen without refresh
04:06 - so now it will not fall through
04:09 - because it's running the screen without
04:10 - refreshing it so you cannot see the
04:12 - movement because it's super fast
04:15 - so now you have the scrolling and now it
04:17 - doesn't keep up bouncing up and down
04:19 - on the platform so let's go
04:23 - to the player y position
04:27 - so in the tick custom block uh we change
04:30 - the instead of this we can change the
04:34 - player
04:34 - s so we can change the s y the speed y
04:37 - by negative two
04:42 - and we can change the player y by the s
04:45 - y
04:46 - speed y so that if you to or
04:49 - to fall to the ground from a higher
04:51 - ground you'll fall faster
04:53 - so like in real life you would fall
04:54 - faster if you fell from a building
04:56 - rather than a house
04:59 - so it's basically saying that if you
05:02 - fall from a higher
05:03 - place like up here then you would
05:06 - go fall faster
05:10 - then we need to change the player y to
05:13 - the sy
05:14 - and then we would need to set the sy
05:16 - back to zero
05:17 - up here in the y position
05:21 - if not if the sprite will not fall
05:24 - through the platform
05:25 - to make the sprite not fall through the
05:26 - platform we want to put the set
05:29 - s y back to zero right here
05:34 - all right so now let's go on to the
05:36 - player position
05:38 - so and right before i continue i would
05:41 - like to show you if you take out the
05:42 - zero what would happen
05:45 - it will fall through as you can see when
05:47 - you move
05:48 - you'll fall through but if you reset the
05:51 - speed y back to zero
05:54 - everything is perfectly fine
05:57 - all right now we have all that down
06:00 - let's go to the
06:02 - uh tick custom block let's get
06:05 - and let's move all this
06:08 - down wait so
06:12 - let's put this under here oops so let's
06:15 - put this up here get an
06:16 - if then statement if
06:20 - the key up arrow i'm just going to
06:22 - duplicate this
06:24 - if the key up arrow up
06:28 - or the w key is pressed so we can also
06:30 - do wsd
06:32 - then we will set the sy the speed y
06:36 - to 16 that's the normal default
06:40 - 16 and then you can just pop that right
06:44 - under here
06:45 - so use this at this code to allow the
06:47 - player to
06:48 - jump set the jump height to 16 pixels
06:52 - but if the player holds up it will keep
06:54 - on jumping you can like double jump and
06:56 - triple jump
06:57 - because this negative two is not enough
07:00 - to override the 16. so i'll demonstrate
07:04 - one time
07:04 - so as you can see you can like jump like
07:06 - flappy bird
07:08 - like when you hold it you just get stuck
07:09 - on top and fall back down it's like this
07:11 - is good for like flappy bird games or
07:13 - something
07:14 - but not for a platform game scrolling
07:16 - platform game like we're doing
07:18 - so we do not want that so we will fix
07:20 - that
07:23 - so let's go back to the player y
07:24 - position this define
07:26 - change player y by block so we're gonna
07:29 - get
07:30 - a we're gonna set the in-air
07:33 - variable we have so the in-air variable
07:37 - it's for the sprite only remember all
07:40 - the lower case
07:41 - ones not in all caps are for the player
07:44 - only so remember to set it for the only
07:46 - for the player so you want to set the in
07:48 - air back to zero
07:49 - and up here you want to change the in
07:52 - air by one
07:55 - so what the in air oops so
07:58 - the in air the longer the player is in
08:01 - the air like when it's jumping
08:03 - um the bigger the value of the in air
08:05 - gets and
08:06 - when it's touching the platforms it'll
08:08 - reset the in air back to zero because
08:10 - it's not true the player is not in the
08:12 - air
08:13 - so next we want to add an if-then
08:16 - statement
08:17 - to the tick go here and an if-then
08:20 - statement wraps around the
08:21 - set s-y to 16
08:24 - so now it will not be able to jump like
08:26 - flappy bird
08:29 - so now just add this
08:32 - if in air
08:35 - is less than four
08:38 - then we can set the sy to 16. so add the
08:41 - statement so if the player is in the air
08:43 - for a bit it will allow the player to
08:45 - jump but if a player is coming down a
08:47 - slope or leaving
08:48 - the platform they are allowed to jump
08:52 - so add that if then statement wrapped
08:57 - around the
08:57 - sy so yeah
09:01 - so now let's play it so that's
09:05 - all the code as you can see now you can
09:07 - jump perfectly fine
09:08 - you cannot jump like flappy bird anymore
09:10 - you can jump normally
09:12 - however there are a couple bugs as you
09:14 - can see i'm not jumping you'll teleport
09:15 - to the top we can fix that in the next
09:17 - video
09:18 - and let me add something in the
09:20 - platforms the costumes
09:23 - so if you i were to draw like a line
09:26 - so like a green color
09:29 - okay so i'm gonna get the oops it's
09:32 - supposed to be
09:33 - like this i'll just draw the line
09:36 - just like get a green color okay maybe
09:40 - five thickness uh actually let's
09:43 - increase it to ten
09:45 - okay so i will zoom out a little bit
09:48 - let's draw
09:49 - oops
09:51 - [Music]
09:53 - let's make green color okay so i will
09:56 - draw like a line
09:57 - from this side let's hold down shift
10:02 - i've done shift i'll just draw it like
10:04 - about this long
10:07 - and i'll show you what happens when i do
10:10 - that
10:12 - so when i play it the player can
10:15 - automatically teleport
10:16 - up like that and go up there we will fix
10:20 - that bug in the next video
10:22 - but when you on top it will stop the
10:24 - player
10:25 - but when it's on the bottom and jumps up
10:27 - it will go through
10:29 - so we will fix that in the next video i
10:32 - will
10:33 - delete this real quick we're not gonna
10:36 - end the video quite yet we can teach you
10:38 - guys how to draw the background
10:41 - so i'm gonna i think i have to import it
10:44 - or i think i already have it oh i
10:46 - i don't have it yet let me just uh oh
10:49 - yeah i have a backpack
10:50 - so i'm gonna drag this one so this one
10:53 - these two we got from online let me just
10:55 - delete this one uh this one we just
10:58 - made ourselves we drew this one so we're
11:00 - going to teach you guys how to draw your
11:01 - backdrop
11:02 - so let's open a new
11:06 - uh backdrop so first i'm going to
11:09 - explain
11:09 - what everything in here is so for the
11:12 - back
11:13 - for the blue sky we made it two
11:16 - different colors so it can like fade out
11:18 - on the bottom
11:18 - so it'll look better and then for the
11:21 - trees
11:22 - we just did uh lines with the thickness
11:24 - of 80
11:27 - it's just like make the trees some of
11:29 - them are 70 when you go up it will get
11:31 - thinner
11:32 - 50 60 and same with the other tree
11:35 - these we put vines on the side that are
11:38 - 20 thickness
11:39 - and then we have a tree branch that's
11:41 - just 60 thickness with the
11:43 - line and then we have a sun that's just
11:45 - a normal plain circle
11:47 - with a yellow color with no outline
11:50 - and then here we just drew some of these
11:53 - uh
11:54 - blocks with the um a square tool
12:00 - like right there so i will show you guys
12:03 - how to draw it
12:04 - so i'm gonna go back drop so first
12:07 - we can get the back the color so we just
12:10 - set it
12:11 - like that just draw a square no outline
12:14 - we do not want any outline
12:17 - so we just drew it like that center your
12:22 - backdrop
12:24 - next we want to draw this and one thing
12:27 - before we do the sun we have to do the
12:28 - double fill
12:29 - like we said like the fade so we're
12:31 - going to make this a light
12:33 - blue color the second one a light blue
12:36 - color
12:39 - like that and then we're just gonna fill
12:42 - the backdrop with that so there's a
12:45 - little fade on the bottom
12:46 - the top is darker and the bottom is
12:48 - lighter
12:50 - so now let's draw the trees
12:53 - so we just got like a um
12:56 - we just got like a thickness of let's we
12:59 - just got the trees as a thickness of 60.
13:02 - we can draw the ground actually it's
13:04 - just a gray color with no outline
13:07 - i'm just gonna go here draw like a gray
13:08 - block
13:11 - just so just like so let's draw some
13:14 - blocks like that
13:17 - just you can randomize them
13:22 - and we have another block on top and
13:25 - then
13:25 - we just got a 60 thickness tree branch
13:29 - and a tree trunk just draw it like that
13:33 - hold down shift so you get a straight
13:34 - line
13:38 - don't forget to hold down shift and then
13:41 - we can hide that with another
13:42 - grey block which make it go to the front
13:46 - make the other gray block go to the
13:47 - front and then we can draw some lines
13:51 - for the tree like thickness of 80.
13:54 - so we're going to get the line hold down
13:57 - shift so you get a straight line
14:02 - for both trees
14:07 - and then you can just stretch it out a
14:08 - little like we're doing
14:14 - and then we can make it like 70
14:16 - thickness now
14:19 - and then hold down shift to get a
14:22 - straight line
14:26 - and then maybe we can do it to 60 this
14:28 - time
14:35 - like that oops sorry about that
14:40 - maybe we can like center that a little
14:44 - do it for the other one and finally we
14:46 - can do a thickness of 50
14:50 - and we'll just finish off the top layer
14:54 - like that hold down shift
14:58 - and finally we can draw like some vines
15:03 - with a thickness of 20.
15:06 - you this is optional if you want it just
15:08 - hold down shift so you get a straight
15:10 - line
15:12 - draw like one longer one shorter
15:16 - just like jazz up your little game
15:20 - backgrounds are very important in games
15:23 - same with music
15:25 - and then we'll add the sun for the final
15:27 - thing
15:28 - for the yellow color we'll just draw a
15:30 - circle
15:32 - with no outline hold down shift so you
15:35 - get a perfect circle
15:37 - since the sun is in front of everything
15:39 - we'll make it go to the back layer
15:41 - but make the blue go to the back
15:44 - the very back layer so select the
15:48 - we'll select the blue background
15:52 - select the tree we'll just group up the
15:53 - tree first
15:56 - let's group up the tree
16:03 - let's make it to go to the forward front
16:06 - layer
16:07 - and there you go so that's how you draw
16:10 - it
16:12 - so we're just going to delete it now so
16:15 - just
16:15 - we just demonstrated how to draw it
16:19 - so that concludes today's tutorial so
16:22 - we're just gonna do a recap
16:23 - we just drew the backdrop now we can
16:25 - jump around
16:26 - there's scrolling physics um
16:30 - there's still some bugs however we will
16:32 - fix that in the next video
16:34 - so thank you guys for watching please
16:35 - like share and subscribe to our channel
16:38 - for the latest uploads on our channel
16:40 - and i'll see you guys
16:41 - in part four for the platformer see ya
16:46 - [Music]
16:48 - guys
16:53 - [Music]
16:55 - you

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today we're doing the third part for this uh scrolling platformer so i'll just go through what we'll be doing today so today we'll be just doing the jumping moving around now the um platform actually stops you and we will be doing the x scrolling and however there are a couple bugs when you go to the bottom you're not dead we will do that in future videos and you can glitch to the top like that even though you're not jumping so we will do that later so now let's go to our previous project so let's go to our project go to my stuff so i will scroll through the code just to let you guys look at it if you missed anything so just get anything you missed scroll a little slow okay so now let's go to the platforms that's all the code for the platforms pretty simple not too much so now we will be adding the scrolling so let's go to your play game when i receive play game script okay so you want to get the set scroll x to the x position set scroll x to x position so now you have scrolling x scrolling so now we have x scrolling that's cool now we have the scrolling physics down let's go on to the um player so for the player um i believe we have to make a new block let's make a new block so we already have the change player x by now we're going to make the change player y by change player y by change player y by add one input and put s y in there like that press ok so we're going to define this block real quick so we will change the y to whatever parameter is in here so just drag that into here and then we want to call the position so that's just to const position is just to constantly shift it to the scroll so it'll scroll with it go to the position of the scrolling so after that you want to get a repeat until repeat until not touching platforms so repeat until not touching platforms platforms and you want to change the y by one so this is just to make it go back up a little bit so it won't fall through the platform just trying to make it even out on the platform so you want to change the y by one recall the position so it'll keep on positioning it and you want to go to the tick script and you want to change the y player y by negative 8. so now i will show you guys as you can see it doesn't look good it's just falling through the like a little bit and it's keep on bouncing up and down up and down and when you move it's moving very slow and we don't want that so what you want to do is go to the tick click right click click edit and run screen without refresh so now it will not fall through because it's running the screen without refreshing it so you cannot see the movement because it's super fast so now you have the scrolling and now it doesn't keep up bouncing up and down on the platform so let's go to the player y position so in the tick custom block uh we change the instead of this we can change the player s so we can change the s y the speed y by negative two and we can change the player y by the s y speed y so that if you to or to fall to the ground from a higher ground you'll fall faster so like in real life you would fall faster if you fell from a building rather than a house so it's basically saying that if you fall from a higher place like up here then you would go fall faster then we need to change the player y to the sy and then we would need to set the sy back to zero up here in the y position if not if the sprite will not fall through the platform to make the sprite not fall through the platform we want to put the set s y back to zero right here all right so now let's go on to the player position so and right before i continue i would like to show you if you take out the zero what would happen it will fall through as you can see when you move you'll fall through but if you reset the speed y back to zero everything is perfectly fine all right now we have all that down let's go to the uh tick custom block let's get and let's move all this down wait so let's put this under here oops so let's put this up here get an if then statement if the key up arrow i'm just going to duplicate this if the key up arrow up or the w key is pressed so we can also do wsd then we will set the sy the speed y to 16 that's the normal default 16 and then you can just pop that right under here so use this at this code to allow the player to jump set the jump height to 16 pixels but if the player holds up it will keep on jumping you can like double jump and triple jump because this negative two is not enough to override the 16. so i'll demonstrate one time so as you can see you can like jump like flappy bird like when you hold it you just get stuck on top and fall back down it's like this is good for like flappy bird games or something but not for a platform game scrolling platform game like we're doing so we do not want that so we will fix that so let's go back to the player y position this define change player y by block so we're gonna get a we're gonna set the inair variable we have so the inair variable it's for the sprite only remember all the lower case ones not in all caps are for the player only so remember to set it for the only for the player so you want to set the in air back to zero and up here you want to change the in air by one so what the in air oops so the in air the longer the player is in the air like when it's jumping um the bigger the value of the in air gets and when it's touching the platforms it'll reset the in air back to zero because it's not true the player is not in the air so next we want to add an ifthen statement to the tick go here and an ifthen statement wraps around the set sy to 16 so now it will not be able to jump like flappy bird so now just add this if in air is less than four then we can set the sy to 16. so add the statement so if the player is in the air for a bit it will allow the player to jump but if a player is coming down a slope or leaving the platform they are allowed to jump so add that if then statement wrapped around the sy so yeah so now let's play it so that's all the code as you can see now you can jump perfectly fine you cannot jump like flappy bird anymore you can jump normally however there are a couple bugs as you can see i'm not jumping you'll teleport to the top we can fix that in the next video and let me add something in the platforms the costumes so if you i were to draw like a line so like a green color okay so i'm gonna get the oops it's supposed to be like this i'll just draw the line just like get a green color okay maybe five thickness uh actually let's increase it to ten okay so i will zoom out a little bit let's draw oops let's make green color okay so i will draw like a line from this side let's hold down shift i've done shift i'll just draw it like about this long and i'll show you what happens when i do that so when i play it the player can automatically teleport up like that and go up there we will fix that bug in the next video but when you on top it will stop the player but when it's on the bottom and jumps up it will go through so we will fix that in the next video i will delete this real quick we're not gonna end the video quite yet we can teach you guys how to draw the background so i'm gonna i think i have to import it or i think i already have it oh i i don't have it yet let me just uh oh yeah i have a backpack so i'm gonna drag this one so this one these two we got from online let me just delete this one uh this one we just made ourselves we drew this one so we're going to teach you guys how to draw your backdrop so let's open a new uh backdrop so first i'm going to explain what everything in here is so for the back for the blue sky we made it two different colors so it can like fade out on the bottom so it'll look better and then for the trees we just did uh lines with the thickness of 80 it's just like make the trees some of them are 70 when you go up it will get thinner 50 60 and same with the other tree these we put vines on the side that are 20 thickness and then we have a tree branch that's just 60 thickness with the line and then we have a sun that's just a normal plain circle with a yellow color with no outline and then here we just drew some of these uh blocks with the um a square tool like right there so i will show you guys how to draw it so i'm gonna go back drop so first we can get the back the color so we just set it like that just draw a square no outline we do not want any outline so we just drew it like that center your backdrop next we want to draw this and one thing before we do the sun we have to do the double fill like we said like the fade so we're going to make this a light blue color the second one a light blue color like that and then we're just gonna fill the backdrop with that so there's a little fade on the bottom the top is darker and the bottom is lighter so now let's draw the trees so we just got like a um we just got like a thickness of let's we just got the trees as a thickness of 60. we can draw the ground actually it's just a gray color with no outline i'm just gonna go here draw like a gray block just so just like so let's draw some blocks like that just you can randomize them and we have another block on top and then we just got a 60 thickness tree branch and a tree trunk just draw it like that hold down shift so you get a straight line don't forget to hold down shift and then we can hide that with another grey block which make it go to the front make the other gray block go to the front and then we can draw some lines for the tree like thickness of 80. so we're going to get the line hold down shift so you get a straight line for both trees and then you can just stretch it out a little like we're doing and then we can make it like 70 thickness now and then hold down shift to get a straight line and then maybe we can do it to 60 this time like that oops sorry about that maybe we can like center that a little do it for the other one and finally we can do a thickness of 50 and we'll just finish off the top layer like that hold down shift and finally we can draw like some vines with a thickness of 20. you this is optional if you want it just hold down shift so you get a straight line draw like one longer one shorter just like jazz up your little game backgrounds are very important in games same with music and then we'll add the sun for the final thing for the yellow color we'll just draw a circle with no outline hold down shift so you get a perfect circle since the sun is in front of everything we'll make it go to the back layer but make the blue go to the back the very back layer so select the we'll select the blue background select the tree we'll just group up the tree first let's group up the tree let's make it to go to the forward front layer and there you go so that's how you draw it so we're just going to delete it now so just we just demonstrated how to draw it so that concludes today's tutorial so we're just gonna do a recap we just drew the backdrop now we can jump around there's scrolling physics um there's still some bugs however we will fix that in the next video so thank you guys for watching please like share and subscribe to our channel for the latest uploads on our channel and i'll see you guys in part four for the platformer see ya guys you
