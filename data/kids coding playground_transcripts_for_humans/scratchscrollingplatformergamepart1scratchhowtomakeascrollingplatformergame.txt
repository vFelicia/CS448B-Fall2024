00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:09 - kids coding playground
00:10 - so today we'll be doing a scrolling
00:12 - platformer after a while of hard work we
00:15 - finally
00:15 - pulled off the scrolling platformer
00:18 - ready for you guys
00:19 - to learn we got some of these ideas from
00:22 - griff patch you guys probably know him
00:23 - from scratch he made some very
00:25 - famous games and he's also a scratch
00:28 - youtuber
00:29 - please subscribe to his channel if you
00:31 - haven't already in the link in the
00:32 - description
00:34 - and today we'll be learning these
00:36 - following concepts we'll be learning
00:38 - custom blocks
00:39 - the scrolling physics for the scrolling
00:42 - platformer
00:43 - clones friction like when you move
00:46 - forward it'll have like
00:47 - friction on the player and collision
00:49 - with platforms and traps
00:51 - some of these we will not be doing today
00:54 - because
00:55 - we today will just be setting up
00:57 - variables and
00:58 - sprites next we would like to give some
01:02 - shout outs to some people
01:04 - so sergey hakkoben uh
01:07 - gave us some sprites from this
01:10 - uh this uh website right here
01:13 - we used the sprites to for this project
01:18 - we used the game maker studio 2 to uh
01:22 - cut out the sprites and we used some of
01:25 - the sprites for our
01:26 - platformer right here and then 11 plus
01:29 - preparations
01:30 - suggested us to do a scrolling
01:32 - platformer so here we are making the
01:34 - scrolling platformer
01:36 - so now i will demo the game for you guys
01:41 - so we have some music so there's y
01:44 - scrolling and x scrolling
01:46 - you collect the fruits
01:49 - [Music]
01:52 - you avoid all the spikes and if you hit
01:54 - the spikes
01:55 - it'll blink and you go back to the
01:57 - beginning and all those fruits are there
01:59 - again
02:00 - and in order to go to the next level you
02:03 - must use
02:04 - you must collect all the fruits
02:07 - and once you hit the portal you go
02:09 - inside the portal
02:11 - and there's a timer right here and you
02:13 - can just
02:14 - wall jump you can also walk up you can
02:17 - you can walk up
02:27 - this tells you what level you're on
02:36 - i'll try to complete this as fast as i
02:38 - can so i can show you
02:40 - what happens
02:44 - this part's the hardest part
02:49 - so when you win it'll stop the timer
02:52 - and it'll say you win i'll still let you
02:54 - walk around
02:56 - give you like some freedom to walk
02:58 - around but
03:00 - that's it we have that's all we have
03:03 - so now let's start a new project we will
03:06 - start
03:06 - on the game
03:10 - we only have three levels for our game
03:12 - but that's not all you guys can make
03:14 - your own levels
03:15 - after learning how to make it from us we
03:18 - only did three levels
03:19 - because uh we don't want to make the
03:21 - videos way too long
03:24 - so next let's get on to the code
03:28 - so first we have to make some variables
03:31 - you can delete the my variable before i
03:34 - can continue
03:35 - i would like to tell you guys to like
03:37 - share and subscribe
03:39 - and now let's make some variables
03:42 - so in grif patch's video he capitalized
03:45 - all the
03:46 - work all the variables that um were
03:49 - global
03:50 - not like just for the sprite only so for
03:53 - all sprites
03:54 - he would like capitalize the name of the
03:56 - variable
03:57 - so i'm gonna do that to cause less
03:59 - confusion
04:01 - so we're going to make some variables
04:03 - we'll need collected
04:05 - so put this in all caps
04:08 - collected for all sprites
04:12 - this is like the amount of collected um
04:15 - collectibles or the fruits
04:17 - then when you collected max
04:20 - so this is just to say the maximum
04:23 - amount of
04:25 - fruits you can collect now let's get
04:27 - another one called exit
04:30 - and remember all the variables that are
04:32 - capital are
04:33 - for all sprites now we can make
04:37 - another one called in-air
04:40 - this is for this sprite only so we we
04:43 - can just delete this
04:44 - sprite and we will draw our sprite
04:48 - so we have we have the sprite in our
04:51 - backpack already
04:54 - but we will show you guys how to draw it
04:57 - so we're going to code here
04:58 - create a new costume and we'll draw it
05:01 - for you guys
05:03 - so first we need to get the uh so you
05:07 - see there's
05:08 - a two rectangles and four
05:11 - circles so that's how we draw like the
05:13 - curved edges
05:16 - there's a circle so let's draw the
05:20 - squares so you want to draw them not too
05:22 - fat you need them kind of thin
05:24 - squares and next you want to get
05:29 - no outline and you can just copy paste
05:33 - the square rectangle you did from before
05:35 - and hold down shift
05:37 - and rotate and center
05:40 - your sprite center both of the
05:44 - rectangles and next you want to get the
05:46 - circle tool hold down shift
05:49 - and you want to scale the circle
05:51 - perfectly
05:53 - like that it's not completely perfect
05:56 - you can select it move it back a little
06:01 - or use the arrow key it's not perfect
06:04 - enough
06:06 - a little bit more to the
06:09 - i think that should be a little bit more
06:11 - to the right uh
06:12 - that's perfect that looks pretty rounded
06:15 - out so you can just copy paste it
06:18 - and try to proportion it
06:22 - correctly for all the other sides as
06:23 - well i'll move it to the left a little
06:25 - bit
06:26 - as you can see that looks pretty much
06:28 - all round
06:30 - and you can just hold down shift to
06:33 - select both of the circles
06:35 - and you can move it down
06:38 - i'll use the arrow keys and boom you got
06:40 - your
06:42 - it's a little bit off but i can move it
06:45 - up a little
06:50 - yeah so that's pretty much a rounded
06:51 - square that looks pretty nice
06:53 - actually so now we can draw in the eyes
06:56 - so we use a line with a thickness of 25
07:00 - so we have a a black line with a
07:03 - thickness of 25
07:05 - and we just hold down the shift key so
07:07 - then we get a straight line
07:10 - and then we draw another line i think i
07:13 - kind of messed up right there
07:20 - let's try that let's try 15.
07:26 - let's rescale to 20 because i actually
07:29 - kind of messed up there
07:30 - our square is a little smaller compared
07:32 - to the other square we have
07:34 - so i'm trying to rescale it like as you
07:37 - can see it's a little smaller
07:39 - so i'm doing 20 size now
07:44 - you gotta move it a little bit
07:47 - so yeah and then you draw two white
07:49 - circles for the pupils
07:52 - let's get circle tool get the white
07:56 - just saturation zero and brightness to
07:58 - 100
08:00 - hold oh yeah and we forgot to fill it we
08:02 - were supposed to fill it
08:08 - and now
08:11 - let's try again delete i'll delete the
08:13 - circle
08:16 - okay just draw hold down shift
08:20 - and draw a small circle no outline sorry
08:22 - about that
08:25 - so we just draw a kind of small circle
08:28 - delete that circle again
08:30 - just draw a small circle hold down shift
08:33 - so we get a perfect circle
08:35 - we can copy paste that
08:39 - and there you go you got your square
08:42 - so try to draw it like that
08:45 - you guys can pause the video to copy it
08:47 - down if you want i'm going to delete
08:49 - this one now
08:51 - because we don't need it anymore so
08:54 - let's go continue on making our
08:56 - variables
08:58 - so we already have some variables from
09:00 - the last
09:01 - thing i had these variables because i
09:03 - dragged it from my backpack
09:05 - so i already have some pre loaded
09:07 - variables so that's kind of nice so
09:09 - i'll give you some time to copy that
09:11 - down so you guys can um
09:14 - just copy these down we'll need these
09:16 - later but we won't need them now
09:19 - and remember all this lowercase ones are
09:22 - for this sprite only
09:23 - so you have to set all the lowercase
09:25 - ones for this sprite only and
09:27 - the uppercase all capped ones are for uh
09:30 - all sprites global so next we will make
09:34 - some more variables
09:35 - so let's make the level
09:40 - level level variable for all sprites
09:42 - because
09:43 - it's all uppercase mouse
09:46 - so the mouse variable is to tell where
09:49 - the
09:50 - um mouse is so when you press
09:53 - so uh grip patch did a video on this on
09:56 - a scrolling platformer when you press
09:58 - m it will find the x and y position of
10:00 - your mouse
10:01 - so this is good for putting where you
10:04 - want your collectibles
10:05 - and where you want your um platforms to
10:08 - be
10:11 - so next we want to make another variable
10:13 - called player dying
10:15 - this is for all sprites and player dying
10:19 - we'll need that later when we have traps
10:21 - and spikes
10:22 - we won't need that now let's make
10:24 - another variable called scroll
10:26 - x scroll x
10:30 - so this is the scrolling for the x
10:32 - position
10:34 - and this will need scroll y of course so
10:37 - this is a
10:38 - y scrolling position and then we'll need
10:42 - one more variable called timer this is
10:45 - just the time how long you can speed run
10:48 - or play the level
10:50 - so timer so those are all the variables
10:53 - we will need and we will also
10:58 - need a blank sprite so in group patches
11:01 - one in this tutorial
11:02 - he taught that um making a blank sprite
11:06 - will actually help you run the game
11:09 - faster
11:10 - because it actually takes time for
11:12 - scratch to draw yellow border around the
11:15 - code when you play the game so this will
11:18 - actually make the game a little more
11:19 - smoother
11:22 - and next we can set up our
11:26 - sprites we need the code for our sprites
11:29 - so
11:30 - let's go to the player we will be
11:33 - um putting in the platforms in the next
11:35 - video
11:36 - right now we're running low on time so
11:38 - let's just
11:39 - get on to the code for the player just
11:42 - like the setting up code
11:43 - so we're going to make a block called
11:45 - game on in the beginning
11:50 - this is just to start the game
11:53 - so game on we want to reset all our
11:55 - variables
11:57 - so we want to set our x to zero
12:00 - set that y to zero
12:04 - y to zero and you wanna set the s y
12:08 - which is the speed y to zero
12:11 - set the in air in air to zero
12:15 - in air is if the character's in the air
12:18 - the player
12:19 - to zero and then we want to duplicate
12:22 - this then we can set the
12:26 - speed x to zero as well
12:30 - and then next we can set the exit to
12:33 - blank
12:35 - so exit is if the player has touched the
12:37 - um
12:40 - uh portal we'll need that later
12:44 - and exits to tell if the player is dead
12:46 - we'll need to set scroll
12:48 - x to zero and same with scroll y
12:53 - and i'm going to move the s x up here so
12:57 - i can
12:57 - put the x s x and x y together
13:01 - so in the beginning we want to set the
13:02 - size to 50
13:04 - so my character is already up 50
13:08 - but if you haven't just set it to 50
13:11 - set the ghost effect to zero because
13:14 - when you touch the portal it kind of
13:17 - ghost effects away so we want to set it
13:19 - back to zero
13:20 - we want to show in the beginning so
13:24 - um at one point when you die it'll start
13:26 - blinking and hide in
13:27 - show we don't want it to like get messed
13:29 - up so we always wanted to show in the
13:31 - beginning
13:33 - you want to get it when fly clicked
13:37 - in the beginning we want to set the
13:38 - levels as one
13:40 - we'll talk about the levels later we
13:43 - will not need that right now
13:44 - just set it to one in the beginning
13:46 - because we always want to start in level
13:47 - one
13:48 - we want to show the variable level
13:50 - because at the end
13:52 - when you win i hid the variable level so
13:55 - in the beginning you always want to show
13:56 - it
13:57 - set the timer to zero in the beginning
14:01 - timer to zero and you want to broadcast
14:06 - and wait a message called green flag
14:10 - or start game start game
14:14 - and then we can broadcast another one
14:16 - called play game
14:22 - play game and then when this sprite
14:25 - receives green flag
14:30 - green flag we want it to play game
14:33 - when it receives a start game sorry then
14:36 - we wanted to hide
14:40 - and go to the front layer
14:44 - i'm actually gonna change this start
14:46 - game to set game because it's kind of
14:48 - confusing
14:49 - so i'm gonna just
14:53 - broadcast a new message called set game
14:58 - because it's a bit too confusing because
15:00 - play game and start game you
15:01 - you can get mixed up
15:04 - so instead of start game we're gonna
15:07 - receive set game
15:09 - so that's it for now for this video
15:12 - thank you guys for watching
15:14 - please don't forget to like share and
15:16 - subscribe and i'll see you guys
15:18 - in part two for the scrolling platformer
15:29 - [Music]
15:32 - you

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground so today we'll be doing a scrolling platformer after a while of hard work we finally pulled off the scrolling platformer ready for you guys to learn we got some of these ideas from griff patch you guys probably know him from scratch he made some very famous games and he's also a scratch youtuber please subscribe to his channel if you haven't already in the link in the description and today we'll be learning these following concepts we'll be learning custom blocks the scrolling physics for the scrolling platformer clones friction like when you move forward it'll have like friction on the player and collision with platforms and traps some of these we will not be doing today because we today will just be setting up variables and sprites next we would like to give some shout outs to some people so sergey hakkoben uh gave us some sprites from this uh this uh website right here we used the sprites to for this project we used the game maker studio 2 to uh cut out the sprites and we used some of the sprites for our platformer right here and then 11 plus preparations suggested us to do a scrolling platformer so here we are making the scrolling platformer so now i will demo the game for you guys so we have some music so there's y scrolling and x scrolling you collect the fruits you avoid all the spikes and if you hit the spikes it'll blink and you go back to the beginning and all those fruits are there again and in order to go to the next level you must use you must collect all the fruits and once you hit the portal you go inside the portal and there's a timer right here and you can just wall jump you can also walk up you can you can walk up this tells you what level you're on i'll try to complete this as fast as i can so i can show you what happens this part's the hardest part so when you win it'll stop the timer and it'll say you win i'll still let you walk around give you like some freedom to walk around but that's it we have that's all we have so now let's start a new project we will start on the game we only have three levels for our game but that's not all you guys can make your own levels after learning how to make it from us we only did three levels because uh we don't want to make the videos way too long so next let's get on to the code so first we have to make some variables you can delete the my variable before i can continue i would like to tell you guys to like share and subscribe and now let's make some variables so in grif patch's video he capitalized all the work all the variables that um were global not like just for the sprite only so for all sprites he would like capitalize the name of the variable so i'm gonna do that to cause less confusion so we're going to make some variables we'll need collected so put this in all caps collected for all sprites this is like the amount of collected um collectibles or the fruits then when you collected max so this is just to say the maximum amount of fruits you can collect now let's get another one called exit and remember all the variables that are capital are for all sprites now we can make another one called inair this is for this sprite only so we we can just delete this sprite and we will draw our sprite so we have we have the sprite in our backpack already but we will show you guys how to draw it so we're going to code here create a new costume and we'll draw it for you guys so first we need to get the uh so you see there's a two rectangles and four circles so that's how we draw like the curved edges there's a circle so let's draw the squares so you want to draw them not too fat you need them kind of thin squares and next you want to get no outline and you can just copy paste the square rectangle you did from before and hold down shift and rotate and center your sprite center both of the rectangles and next you want to get the circle tool hold down shift and you want to scale the circle perfectly like that it's not completely perfect you can select it move it back a little or use the arrow key it's not perfect enough a little bit more to the i think that should be a little bit more to the right uh that's perfect that looks pretty rounded out so you can just copy paste it and try to proportion it correctly for all the other sides as well i'll move it to the left a little bit as you can see that looks pretty much all round and you can just hold down shift to select both of the circles and you can move it down i'll use the arrow keys and boom you got your it's a little bit off but i can move it up a little yeah so that's pretty much a rounded square that looks pretty nice actually so now we can draw in the eyes so we use a line with a thickness of 25 so we have a a black line with a thickness of 25 and we just hold down the shift key so then we get a straight line and then we draw another line i think i kind of messed up right there let's try that let's try 15. let's rescale to 20 because i actually kind of messed up there our square is a little smaller compared to the other square we have so i'm trying to rescale it like as you can see it's a little smaller so i'm doing 20 size now you gotta move it a little bit so yeah and then you draw two white circles for the pupils let's get circle tool get the white just saturation zero and brightness to 100 hold oh yeah and we forgot to fill it we were supposed to fill it and now let's try again delete i'll delete the circle okay just draw hold down shift and draw a small circle no outline sorry about that so we just draw a kind of small circle delete that circle again just draw a small circle hold down shift so we get a perfect circle we can copy paste that and there you go you got your square so try to draw it like that you guys can pause the video to copy it down if you want i'm going to delete this one now because we don't need it anymore so let's go continue on making our variables so we already have some variables from the last thing i had these variables because i dragged it from my backpack so i already have some pre loaded variables so that's kind of nice so i'll give you some time to copy that down so you guys can um just copy these down we'll need these later but we won't need them now and remember all this lowercase ones are for this sprite only so you have to set all the lowercase ones for this sprite only and the uppercase all capped ones are for uh all sprites global so next we will make some more variables so let's make the level level level variable for all sprites because it's all uppercase mouse so the mouse variable is to tell where the um mouse is so when you press so uh grip patch did a video on this on a scrolling platformer when you press m it will find the x and y position of your mouse so this is good for putting where you want your collectibles and where you want your um platforms to be so next we want to make another variable called player dying this is for all sprites and player dying we'll need that later when we have traps and spikes we won't need that now let's make another variable called scroll x scroll x so this is the scrolling for the x position and this will need scroll y of course so this is a y scrolling position and then we'll need one more variable called timer this is just the time how long you can speed run or play the level so timer so those are all the variables we will need and we will also need a blank sprite so in group patches one in this tutorial he taught that um making a blank sprite will actually help you run the game faster because it actually takes time for scratch to draw yellow border around the code when you play the game so this will actually make the game a little more smoother and next we can set up our sprites we need the code for our sprites so let's go to the player we will be um putting in the platforms in the next video right now we're running low on time so let's just get on to the code for the player just like the setting up code so we're going to make a block called game on in the beginning this is just to start the game so game on we want to reset all our variables so we want to set our x to zero set that y to zero y to zero and you wanna set the s y which is the speed y to zero set the in air in air to zero in air is if the character's in the air the player to zero and then we want to duplicate this then we can set the speed x to zero as well and then next we can set the exit to blank so exit is if the player has touched the um uh portal we'll need that later and exits to tell if the player is dead we'll need to set scroll x to zero and same with scroll y and i'm going to move the s x up here so i can put the x s x and x y together so in the beginning we want to set the size to 50 so my character is already up 50 but if you haven't just set it to 50 set the ghost effect to zero because when you touch the portal it kind of ghost effects away so we want to set it back to zero we want to show in the beginning so um at one point when you die it'll start blinking and hide in show we don't want it to like get messed up so we always wanted to show in the beginning you want to get it when fly clicked in the beginning we want to set the levels as one we'll talk about the levels later we will not need that right now just set it to one in the beginning because we always want to start in level one we want to show the variable level because at the end when you win i hid the variable level so in the beginning you always want to show it set the timer to zero in the beginning timer to zero and you want to broadcast and wait a message called green flag or start game start game and then we can broadcast another one called play game play game and then when this sprite receives green flag green flag we want it to play game when it receives a start game sorry then we wanted to hide and go to the front layer i'm actually gonna change this start game to set game because it's kind of confusing so i'm gonna just broadcast a new message called set game because it's a bit too confusing because play game and start game you you can get mixed up so instead of start game we're gonna receive set game so that's it for now for this video thank you guys for watching please don't forget to like share and subscribe and i'll see you guys in part two for the scrolling platformer you
