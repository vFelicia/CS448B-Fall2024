00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to another tutorial
00:09 - on kids coding playground
00:10 - today we'll be doing a math game so the
00:13 - players can choose
00:15 - any operation such as addition
00:17 - multiplication
00:18 - uh division and subtraction or you can
00:20 - pick a random operation so
00:22 - choose a random one for you to play and
00:24 - the player can choose a type of
00:26 - operation
00:26 - and they would like to play and the cat
00:28 - will ask the math problems for each
00:31 - um operation so let's say you click on
00:33 - multiplication the cat will start asking
00:35 - questions for multiplication
00:37 - if you click click on subtraction the
00:40 - cat will start asking questions for
00:42 - subtraction
00:44 - so today we'll be learning these
00:46 - following concepts in scratch
00:48 - variables custom blocks broadcasting
00:50 - messages
00:51 - loops and we'll be using a bunch of
00:53 - operator blocks
00:55 - we can later expand this math game into
00:57 - a math racing game
00:58 - which i did for my tech fair about like
01:01 - two years ago
01:02 - and i got third place on the tech fair
01:04 - so
01:05 - later we can expand to that but first
01:07 - we'll need to work
01:08 - on the regular math racing game math
01:10 - game
01:11 - so i'll demo the game for you guys so
01:14 - um so in the beginning i should say
01:17 - let's play a math game
01:18 - answer the following questions press
01:20 - quit to stop all questions
01:21 - that's just a stop all choose one of the
01:24 - operations or random
01:25 - so let me show you when you click on
01:26 - random it'll pick a random operation for
01:28 - you as you can see
01:30 - so i'm just going to um so when you get
01:32 - a
01:33 - question correct they'll say that is
01:34 - correct and let's say if i get a
01:36 - question wrong on purpose like
01:37 - it'll say wrong number and there's also
01:40 - a different modes today we'll be working
01:43 - on addition and subtraction
01:45 - i think that's all we'll have time for
01:47 - we'll work on multiplication and
01:49 - division
01:50 - in the later videos so let's see
01:52 - addition so 33 plus 20 that's
01:54 - 53
01:56 - [Music]
01:59 - that's 40. so if you get it right you'll
02:01 - get more score as you can see in the top
02:03 - right
02:03 - corner you can get more score so yeah
02:06 - that's pretty much the game
02:09 - so let's start a new project
02:16 - okay so we can keep the cat for now
02:19 - and um if you want to make a backdrop
02:21 - you can um
02:23 - so i just made like a little green
02:25 - backdrop with like no outline
02:29 - um and i just like
02:33 - use the darker green on this side
02:36 - like that and i just drew a square
02:40 - uh you guys can do whatever you guys
02:42 - would like i'm just gonna make a
02:44 - backdrop
02:45 - so this is gonna be my backdrop and
02:47 - we're gonna keep the cat
02:49 - um i can rename the cat actually but in
02:51 - the old one i just still had a sprite
02:53 - one but
02:54 - um and then we'll need to make some
02:56 - buttons i already have them in my
02:58 - backpack
02:59 - today we'll be making the addition and
03:00 - subtraction ones
03:03 - and the quit button uh that's all we'll
03:05 - have time for i think
03:08 - so uh for the
03:11 - so for the addition um all we did is
03:14 - just drew a square
03:16 - a rectangle and then wrote addition and
03:18 - same for subtraction
03:20 - i just drew a rectangle and then wrote
03:23 - um the word subtraction and then for the
03:25 - quick bunch has a circle
03:27 - and that real quit so that's it for the
03:30 - um
03:30 - three buttons and let's go working on
03:34 - the code now
03:35 - so actually first we need to create some
03:37 - variables
03:38 - so we're going to make a variable called
03:40 - answer to problem
03:46 - sir to problem
03:50 - problem so make this answer your problem
03:53 - it's for all sprites
03:55 - and then we'll need to make another
03:56 - variable called guess so this is
03:59 - what the player guesses as the answer
04:03 - and then we have the random number one
04:05 - which is the
04:06 - number picking the random number which
04:09 - is the first number
04:10 - they'll pick and then we also have a
04:12 - second number
04:14 - random number two
04:18 - and then we'll need to create one more
04:20 - called random game
04:22 - and score let me create two more
04:24 - actually so random game
04:26 - so this is for the um so let's say you
04:28 - click the random button
04:30 - it'll pick a random game so this is what
04:31 - it's for and then you have to make score
04:35 - and then we can delete my variable this
04:37 - is not use
04:39 - so this is all we have for now so let's
04:42 - go to the cat
04:43 - get a one fly clicked so when fly
04:45 - clicked
04:46 - um we're gonna hide some variables
04:49 - so um we're gonna hide the variable
04:53 - score in the beginning
04:57 - actually no we don't need this we don't
04:58 - need to hide the variable we can just
05:00 - keep it showing i guess
05:01 - if you want i'm gonna keep the score on
05:03 - the right side
05:05 - so i'm gonna get a one fly clicked and
05:08 - then i'm gonna um
05:09 - show the variable score
05:12 - actually no we don't need to because
05:14 - it's already shown and
05:16 - i'm just gonna make it say let's play a
05:17 - math game
05:24 - math game
05:28 - so let's play a math game i'll say it
05:30 - for like
05:31 - two seconds and then i'll duplicate it
05:34 - we're just
05:34 - gonna tell them the instructions how to
05:36 - play in the beginning and then i'm going
05:38 - to say answer
05:39 - the following questions
05:46 - and then i'm going to do it duplicate
05:48 - two more
05:50 - one is press quit
05:53 - the quit button to stop all question
06:02 - stop all questions so this is just a
06:03 - stop all and then one more
06:06 - we'll do a choose one
06:10 - of the operations or
06:14 - random so these will be the instructions
06:19 - so if you guys want to make it um less
06:21 - less
06:22 - like less sane then you can just put all
06:25 - the instructions in one stay and just
06:26 - make it for a longer
06:28 - time so i just did it like this but you
06:31 - guys can do it any
06:32 - uh differently so i'm gonna make a new
06:36 - variable right now
06:37 - i mean new broadcast i'm gonna name it
06:40 - choose game so this
06:41 - this is just to uh select the game so
06:45 - choosing game so let's go into our
06:48 - addition and subtraction so
06:49 - for addition i'm going to get a when i
06:51 - receive choose game we want to show
06:53 - so it'll um show up in the beginning and
06:56 - in the beginning we want to hide when
06:58 - fly click we want to hide
07:00 - um sorry hide
07:04 - so i'm gonna zoom in a little bit uh
07:07 - when
07:08 - i when this sprite is clicked so i'm
07:11 - gonna do
07:12 - two more broadcasts one is called start
07:14 - game and one is called start edition
07:18 - game and we'll make another one called
07:20 - start edition letting the player know
07:22 - it'll start the edition start
07:27 - edition start edition
07:31 - and then when i receive start gaming we
07:32 - want to hide the button it is no longer
07:35 - needed after the game has started
07:37 - start game we want to hide
07:41 - and then um this part is not necessary
07:45 - but you guys can add it if you would
07:46 - like
07:47 - it's just to make your game look better
07:48 - so when you put your mouse on it it'll
07:50 - get bigger and smaller so
07:51 - just get a forever loop
07:55 - if touching mouse pointer
08:00 - then we can set the size to 85 percent
08:05 - uh else set it to 100.
08:09 - there are many other ways to do it but
08:12 - the other ways are a little bit more
08:13 - difficult so this is just an easier way
08:15 - of doing it
08:17 - um so now let's go back to the cat so
08:20 - for the cat we're gonna have to make
08:22 - some custom blocks
08:24 - so we're gonna get a new custom block
08:27 - let's name it edition
08:31 - edition
08:34 - edition edition i think that's how you
08:38 - spell it but
08:38 - addition so we're going to define the
08:40 - edition block
08:42 - so let's define the addition block right
08:44 - now let's get a forever loop
08:46 - and then in the beginning we want to set
08:48 - the guess to zero
08:51 - so the guess is zero in the beginning so
08:54 - we set it to zero
08:55 - and then we want to set the random
08:57 - number one to pick random one to one
08:59 - hundred
09:00 - so for addition it will pick random one
09:02 - to one hundred so
09:06 - um pick a random one to 100 so the first
09:08 - number we'll pick random one to 100
09:11 - and then we want to set the second
09:12 - number pick random number two to also
09:14 - pick random one to 100
09:17 - and then we're going to use the variable
09:18 - set answer to problem
09:20 - to random number one plus the random
09:22 - number two which is the first number
09:24 - which you pick random it could be like
09:26 - 25 or something
09:27 - and then the second one could be like 10
09:29 - and you add them together so you get an
09:31 - addition
09:32 - operator so you add the random number
09:34 - one which is a random number pick one
09:37 - hundred and random number two which is a
09:39 - pick random one to one hundred
09:41 - so you add them up oops
09:45 - put that back in like random number one
09:48 - plus
09:48 - random number two and then
09:51 - i'm gonna zoom in a little bit more so
09:53 - you guys can see it better and then
09:54 - we're gonna get a repeat
09:56 - until so we're gonna repeat until
10:00 - guess is equal to answer to problem so
10:02 - it will repeat until
10:04 - the answer is right so the guess is what
10:06 - the player inputs
10:08 - and the um answer to problem is the um
10:12 - answer to the problem the random number
10:15 - one
10:16 - plus the random number two and then
10:18 - we're going to ask
10:20 - ask ask
10:23 - join random number one join the ad
10:26 - edition symbol random number two
10:28 - so it will ask what is
10:32 - random number one plus random number two
10:35 - so we're going to join
10:37 - and just pop that in there get in
10:40 - uh another join we need two joints
10:44 - and put it in here so we're gonna get
10:47 - join the random number one
10:51 - addition symbol
10:54 - and then random number two like that
10:58 - so ask that and then and then after that
11:01 - we want to set the guess
11:02 - to the answer which is the answer right
11:05 - here
11:06 - the correct answer and then if the
11:09 - answer is equal to random number one
11:11 - plus random number two
11:13 - so this is just to check if the player
11:15 - has got the right answer
11:17 - so if random number one is equal the
11:20 - answer is equal to random number one
11:22 - plus random number two so look at
11:24 - addition symbol
11:26 - if the answer is equal to random number
11:31 - one plus random number two
11:36 - then we can start actually this should
11:38 - be an if else statement because
11:40 - if they get it wrong then it should say
11:43 - wrong number
11:44 - so let's change it soon if else
11:47 - sorry about that so you put that in here
11:50 - and then when i get something right i'm
11:53 - gonna get a new sound
11:54 - so i got like a guitar strum sound
11:58 - uh guitar strum
12:02 - this one sounds like this uh
12:06 - and then i just put in here play sound
12:08 - guitar strum and then it'll say that is
12:10 - correct
12:14 - that is correct
12:19 - that is correct for two seconds and then
12:21 - we can change the score by one
12:24 - because they got the right answer
12:28 - else if they get it wrong oops let me
12:30 - just duplicate this
12:31 - if they get it wrong then we'll say
12:34 - something else we'll say
12:35 - that is the wrong answer
12:42 - and then instead of playing guitar strum
12:44 - um i got i got like a string pluck
12:46 - sound um from before
12:54 - just like kind of sounds like they got
12:56 - it wrong or something so
12:58 - i'm just gonna go to sounds put that
12:59 - right here and then say that is the
13:01 - wrong answer
13:03 - okay and now we have to call the edition
13:07 - thing so um we broadcasted start edition
13:10 - from here
13:10 - remember right here so we're going to go
13:12 - to cat
13:14 - uh when i receive start edition
13:17 - we want to call this block so edition
13:22 - so now let's try out let's try it out
13:26 - so it's going to say let's play a math
13:28 - game answer the following
13:30 - questions press the quit button to stop
13:32 - all answers choose one of the random
13:35 - operators
13:36 - operators for random so we only have one
13:38 - operation right now so let's click on
13:39 - addition
13:40 - so ask the answer as you can see right
13:42 - here so 54 plus 42
13:45 - is equal to 96 so let's put 96
13:48 - and they'll say that is correct so it is
13:50 - working and the score went
13:52 - up and i forgot in the beginning we have
13:56 - to set the score to zero
13:59 - so it will go back to zero because uh
14:02 - i forgot about that and then 60 plus 35
14:05 - let's see if i get it wrong let's put
14:06 - seven or something
14:08 - uh they'll say that is the wrong answer
14:11 - so it is working right now so 60 plus 35
14:14 - is actually 95 so say that is correct
14:17 - so as you can see it's working now so
14:21 - uh addition is working right now and we
14:24 - can work on the quick button but
14:25 - i don't think we have enough time to
14:27 - work on the subtraction like i said in
14:28 - the beginning
14:30 - um i think we'll work on that in the
14:32 - next video but
14:33 - so when this so for here i'm just going
14:35 - to do it when i when this sprite is
14:37 - clicked
14:39 - stop all because it's the quit button
14:43 - and then when fly clicked we want to
14:44 - hide
14:48 - and finally when i receive
14:52 - a start game we want to show
14:56 - show the quit equipment right there so
14:58 - that is it for this video
15:00 - don't forget to save your project and
15:02 - you can rename it with math game
15:06 - so that's it for this video hope you
15:09 - guys really enjoyed
15:11 - don't forget to like share subscribe and
15:14 - ring the notification bell
15:15 - see you guys in the next video
15:27 - you

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys to another tutorial on kids coding playground today we'll be doing a math game so the players can choose any operation such as addition multiplication uh division and subtraction or you can pick a random operation so choose a random one for you to play and the player can choose a type of operation and they would like to play and the cat will ask the math problems for each um operation so let's say you click on multiplication the cat will start asking questions for multiplication if you click click on subtraction the cat will start asking questions for subtraction so today we'll be learning these following concepts in scratch variables custom blocks broadcasting messages loops and we'll be using a bunch of operator blocks we can later expand this math game into a math racing game which i did for my tech fair about like two years ago and i got third place on the tech fair so later we can expand to that but first we'll need to work on the regular math racing game math game so i'll demo the game for you guys so um so in the beginning i should say let's play a math game answer the following questions press quit to stop all questions that's just a stop all choose one of the operations or random so let me show you when you click on random it'll pick a random operation for you as you can see so i'm just going to um so when you get a question correct they'll say that is correct and let's say if i get a question wrong on purpose like it'll say wrong number and there's also a different modes today we'll be working on addition and subtraction i think that's all we'll have time for we'll work on multiplication and division in the later videos so let's see addition so 33 plus 20 that's 53 that's 40. so if you get it right you'll get more score as you can see in the top right corner you can get more score so yeah that's pretty much the game so let's start a new project okay so we can keep the cat for now and um if you want to make a backdrop you can um so i just made like a little green backdrop with like no outline um and i just like use the darker green on this side like that and i just drew a square uh you guys can do whatever you guys would like i'm just gonna make a backdrop so this is gonna be my backdrop and we're gonna keep the cat um i can rename the cat actually but in the old one i just still had a sprite one but um and then we'll need to make some buttons i already have them in my backpack today we'll be making the addition and subtraction ones and the quit button uh that's all we'll have time for i think so uh for the so for the addition um all we did is just drew a square a rectangle and then wrote addition and same for subtraction i just drew a rectangle and then wrote um the word subtraction and then for the quick bunch has a circle and that real quit so that's it for the um three buttons and let's go working on the code now so actually first we need to create some variables so we're going to make a variable called answer to problem sir to problem problem so make this answer your problem it's for all sprites and then we'll need to make another variable called guess so this is what the player guesses as the answer and then we have the random number one which is the number picking the random number which is the first number they'll pick and then we also have a second number random number two and then we'll need to create one more called random game and score let me create two more actually so random game so this is for the um so let's say you click the random button it'll pick a random game so this is what it's for and then you have to make score and then we can delete my variable this is not use so this is all we have for now so let's go to the cat get a one fly clicked so when fly clicked um we're gonna hide some variables so um we're gonna hide the variable score in the beginning actually no we don't need this we don't need to hide the variable we can just keep it showing i guess if you want i'm gonna keep the score on the right side so i'm gonna get a one fly clicked and then i'm gonna um show the variable score actually no we don't need to because it's already shown and i'm just gonna make it say let's play a math game math game so let's play a math game i'll say it for like two seconds and then i'll duplicate it we're just gonna tell them the instructions how to play in the beginning and then i'm going to say answer the following questions and then i'm going to do it duplicate two more one is press quit the quit button to stop all question stop all questions so this is just a stop all and then one more we'll do a choose one of the operations or random so these will be the instructions so if you guys want to make it um less less like less sane then you can just put all the instructions in one stay and just make it for a longer time so i just did it like this but you guys can do it any uh differently so i'm gonna make a new variable right now i mean new broadcast i'm gonna name it choose game so this this is just to uh select the game so choosing game so let's go into our addition and subtraction so for addition i'm going to get a when i receive choose game we want to show so it'll um show up in the beginning and in the beginning we want to hide when fly click we want to hide um sorry hide so i'm gonna zoom in a little bit uh when i when this sprite is clicked so i'm gonna do two more broadcasts one is called start game and one is called start edition game and we'll make another one called start edition letting the player know it'll start the edition start edition start edition and then when i receive start gaming we want to hide the button it is no longer needed after the game has started start game we want to hide and then um this part is not necessary but you guys can add it if you would like it's just to make your game look better so when you put your mouse on it it'll get bigger and smaller so just get a forever loop if touching mouse pointer then we can set the size to 85 percent uh else set it to 100. there are many other ways to do it but the other ways are a little bit more difficult so this is just an easier way of doing it um so now let's go back to the cat so for the cat we're gonna have to make some custom blocks so we're gonna get a new custom block let's name it edition edition edition edition i think that's how you spell it but addition so we're going to define the edition block so let's define the addition block right now let's get a forever loop and then in the beginning we want to set the guess to zero so the guess is zero in the beginning so we set it to zero and then we want to set the random number one to pick random one to one hundred so for addition it will pick random one to one hundred so um pick a random one to 100 so the first number we'll pick random one to 100 and then we want to set the second number pick random number two to also pick random one to 100 and then we're going to use the variable set answer to problem to random number one plus the random number two which is the first number which you pick random it could be like 25 or something and then the second one could be like 10 and you add them together so you get an addition operator so you add the random number one which is a random number pick one hundred and random number two which is a pick random one to one hundred so you add them up oops put that back in like random number one plus random number two and then i'm gonna zoom in a little bit more so you guys can see it better and then we're gonna get a repeat until so we're gonna repeat until guess is equal to answer to problem so it will repeat until the answer is right so the guess is what the player inputs and the um answer to problem is the um answer to the problem the random number one plus the random number two and then we're going to ask ask ask join random number one join the ad edition symbol random number two so it will ask what is random number one plus random number two so we're going to join and just pop that in there get in uh another join we need two joints and put it in here so we're gonna get join the random number one addition symbol and then random number two like that so ask that and then and then after that we want to set the guess to the answer which is the answer right here the correct answer and then if the answer is equal to random number one plus random number two so this is just to check if the player has got the right answer so if random number one is equal the answer is equal to random number one plus random number two so look at addition symbol if the answer is equal to random number one plus random number two then we can start actually this should be an if else statement because if they get it wrong then it should say wrong number so let's change it soon if else sorry about that so you put that in here and then when i get something right i'm gonna get a new sound so i got like a guitar strum sound uh guitar strum this one sounds like this uh and then i just put in here play sound guitar strum and then it'll say that is correct that is correct that is correct for two seconds and then we can change the score by one because they got the right answer else if they get it wrong oops let me just duplicate this if they get it wrong then we'll say something else we'll say that is the wrong answer and then instead of playing guitar strum um i got i got like a string pluck sound um from before just like kind of sounds like they got it wrong or something so i'm just gonna go to sounds put that right here and then say that is the wrong answer okay and now we have to call the edition thing so um we broadcasted start edition from here remember right here so we're going to go to cat uh when i receive start edition we want to call this block so edition so now let's try out let's try it out so it's going to say let's play a math game answer the following questions press the quit button to stop all answers choose one of the random operators operators for random so we only have one operation right now so let's click on addition so ask the answer as you can see right here so 54 plus 42 is equal to 96 so let's put 96 and they'll say that is correct so it is working and the score went up and i forgot in the beginning we have to set the score to zero so it will go back to zero because uh i forgot about that and then 60 plus 35 let's see if i get it wrong let's put seven or something uh they'll say that is the wrong answer so it is working right now so 60 plus 35 is actually 95 so say that is correct so as you can see it's working now so uh addition is working right now and we can work on the quick button but i don't think we have enough time to work on the subtraction like i said in the beginning um i think we'll work on that in the next video but so when this so for here i'm just going to do it when i when this sprite is clicked stop all because it's the quit button and then when fly clicked we want to hide and finally when i receive a start game we want to show show the quit equipment right there so that is it for this video don't forget to save your project and you can rename it with math game so that's it for this video hope you guys really enjoyed don't forget to like share subscribe and ring the notification bell see you guys in the next
