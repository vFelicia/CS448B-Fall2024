00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:09 - kids coding playground
00:10 - today we'll be doing a pen sailboat
00:13 - we'll be making
00:14 - like a pencil i'll show you guys up
00:16 - close
00:17 - so it will like draw a little sailboat
00:20 - with pen
00:21 - this is a beginner's tutorial on how to
00:23 - use pen
00:26 - so i'll play that one more time i'll
00:28 - show you guys
00:33 - so pretty much a pen sailboat it's
00:35 - pretty cool
00:36 - so let's make a new project
00:42 - first of all we will not need the
00:44 - scratch cap just delete the scratch cat
00:47 - then we want to get the ball ball
00:51 - this one this ball sprite
00:55 - um and then we got one flag clicked
00:59 - go to zero zero the center
01:02 - the origin of the coordinate plane then
01:04 - we can set the size to 20 percent so it
01:07 - isn't too big
01:12 - and oh yeah i forgot renamed your
01:13 - project to pen
01:16 - pen uh i can't spell pen sale
01:20 - boat so pen sailboat just
01:23 - rename your project get a one flat click
01:26 - go to zero zero
01:27 - set the size to 20 and we will need the
01:31 - pen extension so to add the pen
01:33 - extension
01:34 - um just go to your click the
01:37 - extension i already have it right here
01:39 - but all you do is click the extension
01:41 - button and click pen
01:43 - then you have the pen extension right
01:44 - here so in the beginning you want to
01:46 - erase
01:47 - all so it'll erase all the pen uh you
01:50 - guys can set
01:51 - it to any pen color i'm just setting it
01:53 - to green
01:54 - because i like green i'm going to set
01:57 - the color to green
01:58 - you guys can set it to any color you'd
02:00 - like and then
02:01 - i'm going to set the pen size
02:05 - to 20 so it'll be like a little thicker
02:08 - line
02:11 - and then get pen down so pen down is
02:14 - making it
02:14 - draw pen up is the lifting up the pen
02:17 - and erase also erase everything
02:20 - so next you want to like glide to x y
02:23 - positions
02:25 - so we want to draw it in like a sailboat
02:27 - formation so
02:29 - we want to glide 0.5 seconds
02:33 - seconds to about maybe 150 so
02:38 - maybe like 150 you kind of gotta like
02:41 - predict
02:42 - and play with numbers sometimes when
02:44 - you're doing
02:45 - with gliding so we wanted to go to x 150
02:49 - and the y
02:49 - to zero just keep it the same so as you
02:52 - can see when you play
02:54 - um it will just move to the right 150
02:57 - like that
03:00 - and then we can get another glide 0.5
03:04 - seconds
03:07 - and we're just gonna go
03:10 - maybe um
03:13 - 0.5 seconds to x zero
03:17 - so it won't go to any to the right or
03:19 - left and then we want the y
03:21 - to go 150
03:26 - so let's see see that so x is 0
03:29 - y to 150 it will go up
03:32 - as you can see um
03:36 - and next we will be getting a another
03:38 - glide you can just duplicate this
03:40 - actually
03:40 - just put it under here um glide 0.5
03:44 - seconds
03:46 - we can set the um x to negative 150
03:51 - just playing around with numbers here
03:52 - and y to zero
03:54 - so now we'll make like a little triangle
03:57 - that's not complete
04:00 - um so like make a little triangle
04:02 - incomplete triangle
04:04 - but that's okay we will keep on going
04:09 - um but another one under here this time
04:12 - we'll go to
04:13 - x5 and y0
04:17 - oops y0 x5 so
04:20 - move to the right a little bit more so
04:23 - it'll close
04:24 - into the triangle like that see that now
04:27 - the triangle is completely finished
04:29 - so we want to make the x5 so if i were
04:32 - to put this to x0
04:34 - the triangle will not be completely
04:36 - closed up as you can see
04:39 - wait never mind so
04:42 - it actually does close up but
04:45 - i thought that it would not close up but
04:49 - whatever let's continue i'll just keep
04:51 - it at five
04:54 - i think zero would be fine also i
04:57 - thought it didn't close up because
04:58 - before i tried it i put zero zero
05:01 - on it it didn't completely close up so
05:05 - i'll just you guys can keep it at zero
05:07 - or five or whatever
05:09 - but i'm keeping it at 5 so next you want
05:12 - to get
05:12 - another glide you just duplicate this
05:16 - and then we change the x to
05:20 - 5 and maybe negative 70.
05:24 - just to move the ball down a little like
05:26 - maybe right here negative 70s
05:28 - probably right here and we can glide
05:32 - another
05:33 - 0.5 seconds um
05:36 - maybe negative 150 negative 170
05:41 - so we can like draw the base of the boat
05:43 - so
05:44 - once it draws a triangle go down here
05:46 - and glide here so we can finish the base
05:49 - of the boat
05:50 - so i'm going to duplicate this again
05:55 - and then instead of negative 150 we can
05:58 - do like
05:59 - maybe glide x to negative 100
06:04 - and the y to negative 140.
06:09 - so when i i'm going to play it again it
06:12 - glides somewhere maybe
06:13 - right here yeah we're here
06:17 - um so then we want to make it glide
06:19 - right here
06:21 - maybe we can make it glide oops
06:24 - and duplicate this add a comment so
06:29 - now instead of negative 100 we can make
06:31 - glide to 150 like
06:33 - where this is and then negative 140 keep
06:37 - it at the same y position
06:40 - and then duplicate i'm going to
06:41 - duplicate these two
06:43 - put it down here and then
06:46 - maybe we can go to 170x
06:49 - position like right here somewhere
06:53 - y negative 70. so go back up a little
06:56 - bit
06:58 - the same y position as this go back up
07:01 - here
07:02 - and finally we can close the boat
07:06 - base by moving
07:09 - five x and y negative seventy
07:13 - so as you can see when you play it
07:22 - oops accidentally made the wrong
07:24 - coordinates this was supposed to be
07:26 - negative
07:26 - 70 not negative 140 so
07:29 - let's play it now it should be a pen
07:32 - sailboat
07:35 - there you go this is a simple
07:39 - project you can make with pen not too
07:42 - hard to make
07:43 - so thank you guys for watching if you
07:45 - enjoyed this video

07:50 - and see you guys in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today we'll be doing a pen sailboat we'll be making like a pencil i'll show you guys up close so it will like draw a little sailboat with pen this is a beginner's tutorial on how to use pen so i'll play that one more time i'll show you guys so pretty much a pen sailboat it's pretty cool so let's make a new project first of all we will not need the scratch cap just delete the scratch cat then we want to get the ball ball this one this ball sprite um and then we got one flag clicked go to zero zero the center the origin of the coordinate plane then we can set the size to 20 percent so it isn't too big and oh yeah i forgot renamed your project to pen pen uh i can't spell pen sale boat so pen sailboat just rename your project get a one flat click go to zero zero set the size to 20 and we will need the pen extension so to add the pen extension um just go to your click the extension i already have it right here but all you do is click the extension button and click pen then you have the pen extension right here so in the beginning you want to erase all so it'll erase all the pen uh you guys can set it to any pen color i'm just setting it to green because i like green i'm going to set the color to green you guys can set it to any color you'd like and then i'm going to set the pen size to 20 so it'll be like a little thicker line and then get pen down so pen down is making it draw pen up is the lifting up the pen and erase also erase everything so next you want to like glide to x y positions so we want to draw it in like a sailboat formation so we want to glide 0.5 seconds seconds to about maybe 150 so maybe like 150 you kind of gotta like predict and play with numbers sometimes when you're doing with gliding so we wanted to go to x 150 and the y to zero just keep it the same so as you can see when you play um it will just move to the right 150 like that and then we can get another glide 0.5 seconds and we're just gonna go maybe um 0.5 seconds to x zero so it won't go to any to the right or left and then we want the y to go 150 so let's see see that so x is 0 y to 150 it will go up as you can see um and next we will be getting a another glide you can just duplicate this actually just put it under here um glide 0.5 seconds we can set the um x to negative 150 just playing around with numbers here and y to zero so now we'll make like a little triangle that's not complete um so like make a little triangle incomplete triangle but that's okay we will keep on going um but another one under here this time we'll go to x5 and y0 oops y0 x5 so move to the right a little bit more so it'll close into the triangle like that see that now the triangle is completely finished so we want to make the x5 so if i were to put this to x0 the triangle will not be completely closed up as you can see wait never mind so it actually does close up but i thought that it would not close up but whatever let's continue i'll just keep it at five i think zero would be fine also i thought it didn't close up because before i tried it i put zero zero on it it didn't completely close up so i'll just you guys can keep it at zero or five or whatever but i'm keeping it at 5 so next you want to get another glide you just duplicate this and then we change the x to 5 and maybe negative 70. just to move the ball down a little like maybe right here negative 70s probably right here and we can glide another 0.5 seconds um maybe negative 150 negative 170 so we can like draw the base of the boat so once it draws a triangle go down here and glide here so we can finish the base of the boat so i'm going to duplicate this again and then instead of negative 150 we can do like maybe glide x to negative 100 and the y to negative 140. so when i i'm going to play it again it glides somewhere maybe right here yeah we're here um so then we want to make it glide right here maybe we can make it glide oops and duplicate this add a comment so now instead of negative 100 we can make glide to 150 like where this is and then negative 140 keep it at the same y position and then duplicate i'm going to duplicate these two put it down here and then maybe we can go to 170x position like right here somewhere y negative 70. so go back up a little bit the same y position as this go back up here and finally we can close the boat base by moving five x and y negative seventy so as you can see when you play it oops accidentally made the wrong coordinates this was supposed to be negative 70 not negative 140 so let's play it now it should be a pen sailboat there you go this is a simple project you can make with pen not too hard to make so thank you guys for watching if you enjoyed this video leave it leave a like on this video and please subscribe to your channel and see you guys in the next video you
