00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys kids on playground
00:08 - here and today we're back for another
00:09 - video in scratch and today we'll be
00:11 - making an analog scrap uh clock on
00:14 - scratch so um
00:17 - if you have not heard about our new
00:19 - discord server
00:20 - uh or our new
00:22 - studio just uh join it you should be
00:25 - able to see in our about
00:27 - so uh so let's just jump right in into
00:30 - our analog clock project so
00:32 - let's do this so
00:34 - green flag is clock it picks a random
00:35 - clock so there's three clocks to pick
00:37 - from and i actually got lucky picked all
00:39 - three because like normally
00:42 - it
00:43 - stays the same uh but
00:45 - there's a second time and it tells you
00:46 - the exact time right now in military
00:49 - time so it's 18 49 24
00:52 - so
00:53 - you can also change that to
00:56 - being 6 49 p.m but it's 18 49 30.
01:01 - so that's what we have
01:03 - i'll let you guys i'll show you guys how
01:05 - to do the
01:06 - how to use uh if if you want this to be
01:09 - like six o'clock oh i'll show you guys
01:11 - how to do that later so
01:13 - um
01:16 - let's get started
01:17 - before we begin on our project on the
01:19 - analog clock i would really appreciate
01:21 - if you guys like shared and subscribed
01:24 - and left a comment down in the below in
01:25 - the comment section to help the
01:27 - algorithm to help your channel grow
01:31 - the
01:32 - first thing we want to set up is our
01:34 - sprites so we need to get our sprites so
01:37 - i actually have everything in the
01:38 - backpack
01:41 - oh but
01:43 - uh so the clocks are actually part of
01:44 - the backdrop so
01:49 - delete the scratch cat and let's get
01:50 - some stuff for the backdrop so let's put
01:52 - in the clocks so all you have to do is
01:55 - get a picture of a clock and
01:59 - just uh
02:03 - so um
02:04 - i just put down all three of mine so
02:07 - yeah we have clock one clock two o'clock
02:09 - three so you get a picture of the thing
02:11 - you delete the um little thing the hour
02:14 - the minute and the second
02:17 - thing so
02:18 - yeah just an analog clock image for you
02:20 - this one uh just export this right or
02:24 - just this one uh delete this these so
02:28 - and make your own for the thing so uh
02:31 - let's
02:32 - do this
02:34 - so if you wanted a custom one
02:36 - you can use a galaxy picture so we
02:40 - searched up a galaxy picture
02:42 - galaxy star and round so
02:45 - if i click on this we have the galaxy
02:48 - image or just click on this we have the
02:50 - galaxy image and we just download this
02:52 - export it into your thing and we this
02:54 - could be the background of our clock and
02:56 - we could add the numbers like 12 1 2 3
02:58 - 4. and um
03:01 - yeah like this for example we got
03:02 - handwriting here and we also have the
03:04 - hands so let's just rename this project
03:07 - analog
03:08 - clock
03:10 - this project can come in handy if you
03:11 - are doing an event that occurs
03:14 - happens at a certain time so you want to
03:17 - look closely on your analog clock so
03:20 - um we have to get our second
03:23 - our
03:24 - uh
03:26 - minute and our hour so
03:29 - we have everything set up so i'm gonna
03:32 - do a short drawing of how to draw the
03:35 - hour thing because it might be a little
03:37 - bit hard
03:38 - okay so let's do this
03:41 - let's paint a sprite
03:44 - we have a circle at a kind of light blue
03:47 - color
03:48 - out no outline
03:52 - and
03:53 - make a circle
03:57 - and we have to
03:59 - get a rectangle and
04:03 - put it like that and
04:04 - make
04:05 - uh that's basically how we made our
04:07 - second uh thing but
04:10 - red and
04:14 - that's kind of how
04:16 - so reshape the
04:18 - the rectangle so
04:20 - it
04:21 - looks like kind of like a triangle type
04:22 - of crystal shape
04:24 - and we have our
04:28 - our
04:29 - uh minute or hour
04:31 - key or whatever
04:32 - and you draw a small red rectangle in
04:36 - the middle of it so let's just delete
04:37 - this
04:38 - and you can just reshape it a little bit
04:41 - as you can see it's not as good as my
04:42 - other one so
04:44 - let's just
04:46 - delete this
04:49 - delete this
04:52 - and let's
04:53 - get started on the project be sure to
04:56 - keep it the same location so
04:58 - as you can see i'm going to copy paste
05:00 - this
05:01 - exact same location on the cross so
05:04 - that's what we want to do so
05:06 - be sure to do that um yeah
05:12 - let's get started so let's uh start on
05:14 - the second
05:16 - so
05:17 - when the green flag is clicked
05:20 - as always
05:22 - it'll go to the middle which is zero
05:23 - zero
05:25 - i'll go to the front layer
05:27 - to be in front of everything i'm pretty
05:29 - sure the second supposed to be in front
05:31 - of everything
05:33 - it'll go forever
05:37 - point in direction a um
05:43 - something times six so
05:46 - so the current second times six
05:49 - where's current second
05:54 - times six
05:57 - so yeah
06:00 - so the reason for this time six is
06:02 - because
06:03 - if you're from what you want to go from
06:05 - 12 to three there's actually five ticks
06:08 - the uh the seconds bar takes five times
06:11 - in between
06:13 - uh one number to the other so that means
06:16 - it would take 15 ticks to get to three
06:18 - and that and the 12 to 3 is a 90 degree
06:22 - angle meaning that uh
06:25 - 5 ticks in each that's 15 and how to get
06:28 - 90 15 times 6 equals 90. so that's the
06:32 - reason for that and we have to wait one
06:34 - second because it's one second
06:36 - okay so we are actually finished with
06:38 - the seconds key let's move on to the
06:41 - minute
06:42 - so
06:43 - when the green
06:44 - when the green flag is clicked
06:47 - we have to make a new variable actually
06:48 - and it's angle and we need to make it
06:51 - for this sprite only and when the grid
06:54 -  is clicked let's just zoom in a
06:56 - little bit when the grey fog is clicked
06:57 - it'll go to this position
07:00 - it'll go forever
07:04 - and it'll set the angle
07:09 - to
07:12 - current minute times six because time
07:15 - six as always like that
07:16 - so we have times current angle times six
07:19 - we have the six oopsies
07:21 - six set angle to current minute
07:29 - times six
07:30 - and now we'll change the angle
07:35 - so it's slowly changing
07:37 - uh by current
07:39 - second so it's moving a little bit
07:45 - yes it's moving slowly
07:48 - and we add the division
07:50 - and current second
07:53 - where's that
07:55 - current
07:56 - second
07:57 - divided by ten
08:00 - so it's just moving ever so slightly and
08:02 - then a point in direction of angle
08:10 - and wait one second
08:14 - okay so if you want to
08:17 - make
08:18 - the
08:19 - the
08:21 - the the angle like the minute key move
08:25 - like after 60
08:28 - seconds
08:29 - like just automatically move to the next
08:31 - minute then i got the code for you here
08:34 - so if you want the minute hand to be
08:37 - not smooth like if you're a fan of that
08:40 - all you have to do is put point in
08:43 - direction
08:46 - current minute
08:48 - time six we just have it right here
08:50 - current oopsies
08:53 - current minute times six and it'll wait
08:56 - one second so
08:57 - that's what we have if you don't want it
09:00 - to
09:01 - be as smooth so you just replace
09:04 - these
09:05 - with this
09:06 - so
09:09 - these
09:10 - so i'll show you
09:13 - so this is a different from the one that
09:16 - i had from before
09:17 - so
09:20 - the minute is gonna uh just change
09:25 - after
09:26 - one minute
09:27 - so
09:28 - again
09:30 - so after when it reaches the 12
09:32 - it will change so
09:35 - let's look at the minute hand so it's at
09:37 - the 12 right now
09:43 - see look it just changed right there so
09:46 - that's if you are a fan of that so yeah
09:51 - so let's change that back
09:52 - and now let's work on the hour
09:55 - and
09:57 - we are almost finished here we have to
09:59 - work on the time as well
10:01 - so when the green flag is clicked
10:05 - it will we need a new variable angle
10:09 - and for this sprite only
10:12 - it will go to x00
10:16 - and then it'll go forever
10:21 - set the angle
10:24 - to
10:25 - current hour times 30.
10:30 - so since we learned earlier that this
10:33 - from this is 90 degrees that means every
10:36 - tick between there so every basic
10:39 - every hour
10:40 - is
10:41 - 30. so 30
10:43 - from 12 to 1 is 30 one to two is sixty
10:46 - and two to three is nine
10:49 - so we set angle to the current hour
10:56 - times thirty
11:05 - so there we go and uh we have to change
11:09 - the
11:10 - change angle by
11:11 - current minute
11:13 - divided by two
11:16 - okay
11:18 - right here
11:19 - current minute divided by two we just
11:21 - have to duplicate this
11:29 - and yeah and we have to point in
11:31 - direction angle
11:40 - and finally wait
11:43 - 60 seconds
11:46 - and there we go now we go to make a new
11:49 - paint underneath right and we make a
11:52 - really small white circle
12:03 - let's just say about that big
12:07 - and um
12:10 - uh
12:11 - we have to
12:13 - move this tiny circle
12:15 - i'm just gonna make it
12:17 - go to the back
12:20 - since it has to think the time you have
12:22 - to move this over here so it's going to
12:25 - think the time so when the green flag is
12:27 - clicked
12:29 - it will go forever
12:32 - and it will set a new variable
12:35 - time
12:36 - for this sprite only
12:38 - and it'll set time
12:42 - to
12:43 - join if you
12:45 - join apple banana so you join the
12:48 - current hour
12:53 - with
12:55 - the colon
12:58 - and
12:59 - you just duplicate this and let's
13:01 - you instead of joining all this
13:04 - you join
13:06 - the you need another join
13:10 - you
13:11 - join the time so you put time
13:15 - you join the time with another join and
13:18 - you join the current
13:21 - minute
13:25 - with a colon
13:28 - so yeah
13:31 - you
13:32 - put that in here and now you got to set
13:34 - the time you duplicate that let's just
13:37 - end to join
13:40 - delete this join the time
13:43 - with the
13:45 - current
13:46 - second
13:49 - so we have that finished and
13:51 - we have to think the time so it will
13:53 - tell you what the time is
13:55 - if you don't know how to read it at all
13:56 - clock so it will think the time
14:02 - yeah
14:03 - and we'll close this variable right here
14:05 - and we'll close the other ones too so
14:08 - let's just do that real quick
14:10 - bam
14:12 - oopsie this one
14:14 - bam
14:16 - so um we have the minute here so we just
14:19 - changed the variable yeah and now we go
14:22 - to the sprite one which is our time
14:27 - and
14:28 - um if you want to
14:31 - it's oh it says there's a dot right here
14:33 - oh
14:34 - i found a way to take care of it so you
14:37 - set
14:38 - your ghost effect
14:40 - to 100 and it will no longer show
14:45 - so we have that and if you like if you
14:48 - if it's right now it's 708 pm
14:52 - and if uh it shows military time so it's
14:55 - 19
14:56 - 8 44 but uh if you want it to be 708 pm
15:01 - then you
15:02 - copy down this code um
15:04 - you have a join
15:08 - uh
15:09 - so and then you put a mod
15:12 - so mod is the remainder of so you put
15:14 - the join you put mod you put a 12 right
15:18 - here
15:19 - so um
15:20 - so we have 12 and that's what it's
15:22 - getting divided by so we have current
15:25 - hour where is current hour
15:29 - oopsie
15:32 - current hour
15:34 - so
15:35 - join current hour mod 12 and you put a
15:37 - coil in here
15:39 - so we have that finished and
15:41 - if you want to do that you just have to
15:43 - take this out
15:45 - and replace that to make
15:47 - um
15:49 - like 7 10 p.m or whatever uh so let's
15:53 - see seal it says 7 10
15:56 - uh 27 so you can either keep this time
16:00 - or you can
16:02 - go with the other time so
16:05 - uh so yeah
16:11 - uh yeah um
16:14 - our clock is working
16:16 - uh both ways so you see the second
16:19 - and the minute and we have the hour
16:22 - oh yeah and one last thing
16:24 - before
16:26 - we have to finish so when the green flag
16:29 - is clicked uh if you want to make a
16:31 - random clock for every single time
16:33 - because we do have three clocks here you
16:35 - have to switch
16:36 - the backdrop
16:39 - to
16:40 - a pick random backdrop
16:42 - you pick random one two
16:45 - three
16:46 - and so now
16:48 - it will be a different clock not all the
16:50 - time but
16:52 - uh yeah
16:54 - so you see our clock is working here so
16:57 - please like share subscribe and comment
16:59 - in the comment section below and what
17:01 - else videos you want join our scratch
17:03 - studio and our discord and see you guys
17:06 - next time

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys kids on playground here and today we're back for another video in scratch and today we'll be making an analog scrap uh clock on scratch so um if you have not heard about our new discord server uh or our new studio just uh join it you should be able to see in our about so uh so let's just jump right in into our analog clock project so let's do this so green flag is clock it picks a random clock so there's three clocks to pick from and i actually got lucky picked all three because like normally it stays the same uh but there's a second time and it tells you the exact time right now in military time so it's 18 49 24 so you can also change that to being 6 49 p.m but it's 18 49 30. so that's what we have i'll let you guys i'll show you guys how to do the how to use uh if if you want this to be like six o'clock oh i'll show you guys how to do that later so um let's get started before we begin on our project on the analog clock i would really appreciate if you guys like shared and subscribed and left a comment down in the below in the comment section to help the algorithm to help your channel grow the first thing we want to set up is our sprites so we need to get our sprites so i actually have everything in the backpack oh but uh so the clocks are actually part of the backdrop so delete the scratch cat and let's get some stuff for the backdrop so let's put in the clocks so all you have to do is get a picture of a clock and just uh so um i just put down all three of mine so yeah we have clock one clock two o'clock three so you get a picture of the thing you delete the um little thing the hour the minute and the second thing so yeah just an analog clock image for you this one uh just export this right or just this one uh delete this these so and make your own for the thing so uh let's do this so if you wanted a custom one you can use a galaxy picture so we searched up a galaxy picture galaxy star and round so if i click on this we have the galaxy image or just click on this we have the galaxy image and we just download this export it into your thing and we this could be the background of our clock and we could add the numbers like 12 1 2 3 4. and um yeah like this for example we got handwriting here and we also have the hands so let's just rename this project analog clock this project can come in handy if you are doing an event that occurs happens at a certain time so you want to look closely on your analog clock so um we have to get our second our uh minute and our hour so we have everything set up so i'm gonna do a short drawing of how to draw the hour thing because it might be a little bit hard okay so let's do this let's paint a sprite we have a circle at a kind of light blue color out no outline and make a circle and we have to get a rectangle and put it like that and make uh that's basically how we made our second uh thing but red and that's kind of how so reshape the the rectangle so it looks like kind of like a triangle type of crystal shape and we have our our uh minute or hour key or whatever and you draw a small red rectangle in the middle of it so let's just delete this and you can just reshape it a little bit as you can see it's not as good as my other one so let's just delete this delete this and let's get started on the project be sure to keep it the same location so as you can see i'm going to copy paste this exact same location on the cross so that's what we want to do so be sure to do that um yeah let's get started so let's uh start on the second so when the green flag is clicked as always it'll go to the middle which is zero zero i'll go to the front layer to be in front of everything i'm pretty sure the second supposed to be in front of everything it'll go forever point in direction a um something times six so so the current second times six where's current second times six so yeah so the reason for this time six is because if you're from what you want to go from 12 to three there's actually five ticks the uh the seconds bar takes five times in between uh one number to the other so that means it would take 15 ticks to get to three and that and the 12 to 3 is a 90 degree angle meaning that uh 5 ticks in each that's 15 and how to get 90 15 times 6 equals 90. so that's the reason for that and we have to wait one second because it's one second okay so we are actually finished with the seconds key let's move on to the minute so when the green when the green flag is clicked we have to make a new variable actually and it's angle and we need to make it for this sprite only and when the grid is clicked let's just zoom in a little bit when the grey fog is clicked it'll go to this position it'll go forever and it'll set the angle to current minute times six because time six as always like that so we have times current angle times six we have the six oopsies six set angle to current minute times six and now we'll change the angle so it's slowly changing uh by current second so it's moving a little bit yes it's moving slowly and we add the division and current second where's that current second divided by ten so it's just moving ever so slightly and then a point in direction of angle and wait one second okay so if you want to make the the the the angle like the minute key move like after 60 seconds like just automatically move to the next minute then i got the code for you here so if you want the minute hand to be not smooth like if you're a fan of that all you have to do is put point in direction current minute time six we just have it right here current oopsies current minute times six and it'll wait one second so that's what we have if you don't want it to be as smooth so you just replace these with this so these so i'll show you so this is a different from the one that i had from before so the minute is gonna uh just change after one minute so again so after when it reaches the 12 it will change so let's look at the minute hand so it's at the 12 right now see look it just changed right there so that's if you are a fan of that so yeah so let's change that back and now let's work on the hour and we are almost finished here we have to work on the time as well so when the green flag is clicked it will we need a new variable angle and for this sprite only it will go to x00 and then it'll go forever set the angle to current hour times 30. so since we learned earlier that this from this is 90 degrees that means every tick between there so every basic every hour is 30. so 30 from 12 to 1 is 30 one to two is sixty and two to three is nine so we set angle to the current hour times thirty so there we go and uh we have to change the change angle by current minute divided by two okay right here current minute divided by two we just have to duplicate this and yeah and we have to point in direction angle and finally wait 60 seconds and there we go now we go to make a new paint underneath right and we make a really small white circle let's just say about that big and um uh we have to move this tiny circle i'm just gonna make it go to the back since it has to think the time you have to move this over here so it's going to think the time so when the green flag is clicked it will go forever and it will set a new variable time for this sprite only and it'll set time to join if you join apple banana so you join the current hour with the colon and you just duplicate this and let's you instead of joining all this you join the you need another join you join the time so you put time you join the time with another join and you join the current minute with a colon so yeah you put that in here and now you got to set the time you duplicate that let's just end to join delete this join the time with the current second so we have that finished and we have to think the time so it will tell you what the time is if you don't know how to read it at all clock so it will think the time yeah and we'll close this variable right here and we'll close the other ones too so let's just do that real quick bam oopsie this one bam so um we have the minute here so we just changed the variable yeah and now we go to the sprite one which is our time and um if you want to it's oh it says there's a dot right here oh i found a way to take care of it so you set your ghost effect to 100 and it will no longer show so we have that and if you like if you if it's right now it's 708 pm and if uh it shows military time so it's 19 8 44 but uh if you want it to be 708 pm then you copy down this code um you have a join uh so and then you put a mod so mod is the remainder of so you put the join you put mod you put a 12 right here so um so we have 12 and that's what it's getting divided by so we have current hour where is current hour oopsie current hour so join current hour mod 12 and you put a coil in here so we have that finished and if you want to do that you just have to take this out and replace that to make um like 7 10 p.m or whatever uh so let's see seal it says 7 10 uh 27 so you can either keep this time or you can go with the other time so uh so yeah uh yeah um our clock is working uh both ways so you see the second and the minute and we have the hour oh yeah and one last thing before we have to finish so when the green flag is clicked uh if you want to make a random clock for every single time because we do have three clocks here you have to switch the backdrop to a pick random backdrop you pick random one two three and so now it will be a different clock not all the time but uh yeah so you see our clock is working here so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below and what else videos you want join our scratch studio and our discord
