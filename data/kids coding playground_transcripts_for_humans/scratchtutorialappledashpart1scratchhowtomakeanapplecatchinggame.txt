00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - hello guys it's kids coding playground
00:08 - here
00:09 - today we'll be doing a video on how to
00:11 - make an apple dash game
00:12 - so in our previous video we made about a
00:15 - week ago
00:16 - we demonstrated the game so if you want
00:18 - to check out how the game works
00:20 - you can go into that video and watch it
00:22 - and
00:23 - i demonstrate how the game works so yes
00:26 - today's i'm going to work on the
00:27 - tutorial because
00:28 - you guys gave us 50 likes so thank you
00:30 - guys for 50 likes
00:32 - so we're going to work on tutorials so
00:34 - first rename our project
00:36 - let's name it apple dash so apple dash
00:38 - is the name of the game
00:40 - and then we're going to trash the
00:41 - scratch cat
00:43 - okay let's upload the ghost sprite ghost
00:46 - so we're gonna get the ghost
00:48 - this one um that's gonna be our apple
00:50 - catcher
00:52 - the fruit catcher
00:55 - for the ghost we're going to be using
00:57 - the third costume
00:58 - but you can actually get some legs so
01:01 - like you can
01:02 - duplicate these legs onto the go
01:05 - see so then again looks like he has legs
01:10 - okay so this is optional but
01:14 - it'll make your game a little bit better
01:15 - i think okay let's
01:17 - duplicate one more what
01:21 - there you go can we make it go
01:24 - backwards
01:28 - backwards okay so there we go we got the
01:32 - two legs
01:32 - make them go to the back layer um
01:36 - so another ghost is there goes let's uh
01:39 - group this
01:40 - group okay let's we can trash the other
01:42 - costumes we do not need them
01:45 - needing this let's rename this costume
01:47 - to
01:48 - fruit catcher so this is going to be a
01:52 - fruit catcher
01:53 - so inside the fruit catcher we're going
01:55 - to have to when green fly clicked
01:58 - um let's zoom in i think i'm going to
02:02 - move the fruit catcher like about here
02:04 - okay and i think i set the fruit catcher
02:10 - to i think 90 percent uh
02:14 - yeah 90 i think that's what i did so i'm
02:17 - gonna make it go about right here
02:19 - okay so i'm gonna make it go to let's
02:22 - put
02:22 - x zero y negative one
02:25 - negative one fifteen let's make an even
02:28 - number
02:29 - so we're gonna go to that position gonna
02:31 - make a couple variables let's make
02:33 - let's delete this variable and name make
02:36 - another variable called money so
02:38 - with money you can buy other upgrades
02:41 - for your
02:42 - apple catcher so we're going to set the
02:44 - money to zero in the beginning
02:46 - and we're going to make a new variable
02:48 - called characters so you can buy a skin
02:50 - in this game which is the pig
02:52 - skin so in the beginning we're going to
02:54 - set the character to the ghost so
02:56 - care director oops character
02:59 - you know that's nice yes character okay
03:03 - so
03:04 - for all sprites we're going to set the
03:06 - character to ghost in the beginning
03:09 - ghost and then we're going to make
03:11 - another variable called run so this is
03:13 - to control the speed of the
03:14 - player so we need a variable to make it
03:17 - move left and right because
03:19 - um there's an upgrade that makes the
03:21 - ghost quicker so that's why we're gonna
03:22 - need a variable so run we're gonna set
03:26 - run to eight which is gonna be eight
03:27 - speed basically so
03:29 - run to eight and then we're gonna switch
03:31 - the costume
03:32 - to the fruit catcher fruit casher
03:36 - i'm gonna name a fruit catcher one
03:38 - because we're gonna have to pig and all
03:39 - that stuff so we're gonna have this
03:41 - all right now we can get a backdrop
03:44 - so let's look here so i got the jungle
03:48 - i think not the jungle
03:52 - it was something else
03:55 - i mean you guys oh yeah force you guys
03:57 - can pick any backdrop you would like i'm
03:58 - just going to pick this one
04:00 - okay um
04:03 - and for the backdrop i got some trees
04:07 - just delete this one i got some trees
04:09 - from here so i'm gonna
04:12 - not choose a backdrop i want to upload
04:13 - some sprites into here
04:15 - so i got some trees so let's get a tree
04:19 - so tree you can remember you can always
04:22 - just copy paste in here so just select
04:24 - your tree group it copy ctrl c
04:28 - go into the backdrop let's go to vector
04:30 - control v
04:32 - boom you got your tree right here so
04:34 - it's pretty cool
04:35 - i'm gonna make it a little bit smaller
04:40 - okay select this one more time ctrl c
04:42 - ctrl v i'll put two trees i guess
04:46 - oh like that right okay
04:49 - and then because we're not gonna eat
04:52 - that and then we're gonna get the apple
04:53 - and put some apples on the tree i guess
04:56 - so let's go inside we're going to make
04:58 - the apples a bit smaller so we're going
05:00 - to
05:00 - group that which we'll see ctrl v
05:04 - and then we're going to make it a little
05:05 - bit smaller
05:07 - like about that big maybe a little bit
05:09 - smaller okay
05:12 - and let's copy paste this ctrl v
05:16 - put one like right here we'll copy about
05:19 - two more let's put one right here
05:21 - and let's put one right here let's put
05:23 - one
05:24 - right here okay so now we have like two
05:27 - apple trees
05:30 - okay now we're gonna make a fruit sprite
05:32 - and we'll have a bunch of costumes
05:34 - inside
05:35 - so we're gonna need the apple okay so
05:37 - inside the apple
05:38 - with the costumes we are going to get
05:41 - the orange
05:42 - banana and all those stuff so orange
05:48 - orange we're going to be using this
05:50 - orange
05:52 - we also have the banana
05:56 - bananas put those inside
05:59 - and we're also going to get the
06:02 - watermelon watermelon
06:07 - watermelon and we're also gonna get the
06:10 - strawberry i believe they have a
06:12 - strawberry as you can see they do
06:14 - so we're gonna be using the strawberry
06:16 - watermelon let's
06:17 - just take that out watermelon okay
06:22 - so for we're gonna rename the sprite to
06:25 - fruits
06:26 - fruit one because we want more fruits so
06:28 - we're gonna have multiple sprites for
06:30 - fruits
06:31 - i'm gonna set the size of 75 right here
06:34 - yeah so the fruit's a bit smaller as you
06:35 - can see
06:37 - okay so for the fruits we're going to
06:39 - add some code in it later so first let's
06:41 - go back to our ghost
06:43 - or let's rename this player so let's
06:46 - rename this sprite to player okay now
06:48 - we're gonna
06:49 - make the movement of the player so
06:55 - so we're going to create a begin button
06:58 - sprite so before the ghost will show up
07:02 - we're gonna have to have a begin button
07:04 - sprite so
07:05 - we're gonna get the uh green button
07:09 - this thing so in the beginning
07:12 - we're going to get some text let's make
07:15 - it white
07:17 - so i'm gonna write begin
07:22 - okay put that like right here
07:31 - okay that thing i should do and then
07:33 - we're gonna copy paste it
07:35 - flip it over
07:39 - and hold down shift if you want it to be
07:40 - perfect
07:42 - all right now we have the begin button
07:45 - okay
07:47 - let's group all this okay for the begin
07:49 - button
07:50 - let's name it beacon okay so this is the
07:53 - begin button
07:54 - so for the begin button so before we get
07:58 - into the code in the begin button we
08:00 - actually have to broadcast a message
08:01 - from the backdrop so from the backdrop
08:03 - we're going to get a one green flag
08:04 - clicked
08:06 - we're going to set uh we're going to
08:09 - hide the variable uh
08:12 - let's make a new variable i forgot to
08:14 - make score
08:15 - score and we're also going to make a
08:17 - variable called high score
08:19 - and it's going to be a cloud variable um
08:24 - so what's high school
08:27 - so we're going to be using high score
08:29 - and score
08:30 - so in the beginning we're going to hide
08:32 - high score and hide the score variable
08:35 - and after that we're going to broadcast
08:36 - a message called start screen so this is
08:39 - going to be broadcast
08:40 - to the begin button start screen
08:44 - start screen so let's go to the begin
08:46 - button now
08:47 - so in the begin button we're going to
08:50 - want to receive start screen
08:53 - um let's hide this oh yeah actually in
08:56 - the uh goose we're gonna hide it in the
08:59 - beginning
09:00 - when i clicked hi and now we can go back
09:03 - to the begin button
09:05 - when we start screen let's put the begin
09:08 - button
09:08 - about right here i think that should be
09:11 - fine get this okay let's make it
09:14 - zero so it's more perfect and then we're
09:17 - going to set the brightness to zero in
09:19 - the beginning
09:20 - set brightness to zero
09:24 - and then after that we're gonna show and
09:27 - broadcast a message called spin button
09:29 - so we're gonna make the button spin
09:31 - like we do in other tutorials
09:37 - and then for the spin button when i
09:39 - receive spin button
09:40 - inside the button we are going to get a
09:43 - forever loop
09:45 - forever turn two degrees to the right
09:50 - um and if it's touching
09:55 - we're gonna need to and so if the mouse
09:58 - is on the
09:59 - begin button and it's clicking on it
10:01 - then it'll run something
10:02 - so if touching mouse pointer and mouse
10:06 - down
10:07 - so i want to make sure that you're
10:08 - clicking one thing we're going to set
10:10 - the brightness
10:11 - negative 10 to add a little bit more
10:12 - effect to it and set
10:15 - brightness to negative 10.
10:18 - and then we're going to wait until not
10:20 - mouse down
10:23 - wait until not done
10:28 - okay and then once it's clicked on
10:32 - we're going to play the sound pop
10:35 - and we're going to hide the button once
10:37 - it's clicked okay
10:39 - and then we're going to broadcast the
10:40 - message and wait
10:42 - called start game which will broadcast
10:44 - to the ghost and apple
10:47 - start the game and we're going to stop
10:49 - the script once
10:51 - this is done running so we're going to
10:52 - stop this
10:54 - skirt now let's go to our apple
10:59 - i mean our fruits okay so inside our
11:02 - fruit we are going to get a one green
11:03 - flag clicked
11:05 - so when the green flag is clicked we are
11:07 - going to hide the fruits in the
11:09 - beginning
11:11 - and when i receive start game
11:15 - when i receive start game we are going
11:18 - to set the fruit speed
11:20 - which is a new variable so we're going
11:21 - to name it fruit speed
11:24 - so this is the speed of the fruit so
11:26 - sometimes we'll have armageddons where
11:27 - the fruits will fall faster so that's
11:29 - why we're gonna use the fruit speed
11:31 - so we're gonna set the fruit speed to
11:33 - negative six
11:35 - and in the beginning we're going to show
11:40 - let's go to looks and show
11:43 - and we're going to go to a position so
11:46 - we're going to make it go to a pick
11:47 - random position
11:49 - to make it pick random negative 210 to
11:51 - 210 for the x
11:55 - 210 and for the y i think i'm gonna do
11:57 - 180 which is the top
12:00 - and we're gonna set the y to 180
12:04 - actually i don't think this is necessary
12:05 - because we're already going to this
12:08 - actually i'll add it just in case so
12:10 - we're going to set
12:11 - y to 180 and then forever
12:16 - forever we're going to make it turn
12:18 - degree so we're just going to make a
12:19 - turn
12:20 - turn left 5 degrees and we're gonna
12:23 - change the y
12:25 - by the fruit speed which is negative six
12:28 - so it'll fall down
12:29 - by negative six and then
12:33 - we're going to do we're gonna make a new
12:36 - sprite
12:37 - so this is going to be a hit box so if
12:40 - it touches it then it will make it go
12:42 - back to the top
12:44 - so we're going to be painting it so
12:46 - let's get the line tool
12:47 - let's make it about five thickness okay
12:51 - and hold down shift then you get a
12:53 - perfect line across
12:55 - okay i can use the select tool
12:59 - and center it and then you can move the
13:02 - sprite
13:03 - this hit box right like down here
13:08 - maybe about right here yeah
13:11 - okay so for the hitbox sprite we're
13:14 - going to
13:14 - get the code later actually we can do it
13:17 - right now
13:18 - let's name it box hit box
13:21 - and then one green flag click go to this
13:23 - position
13:26 - go to and we're going to be using it to
13:28 - set we're going to set the
13:30 - ghost effect to 100 because if you hide
13:33 - it
13:34 - then it will not detect anything so if
13:36 - you send it to ghost effect which means
13:38 - it's disappears
13:39 - it will still detect stuff so for the
13:42 - fruit
13:43 - we're going to when after this
13:47 - we're going to get an if-then statement
13:50 - so i'm going to import my basket sprite
13:54 - basket so we're going to be using a
13:55 - basket from the cashmere
13:57 - fruit so for the basket i basically did
14:01 - a circle as you can see we might put
14:03 - this into the google drive so you guys
14:05 - can get it from there or you can draw
14:06 - your own
14:07 - or there's a um bowl sprite
14:10 - so basically we just drew a circle with
14:12 - outline right here so as you can see
14:14 - it's just a circle's outline
14:16 - and then right here we just drew a
14:18 - rectangle with outline and then we just
14:20 - used
14:21 - the reshape tool to make it look more
14:23 - like a bowl
14:24 - i mean a basket and then we used the
14:26 - lines we just drew a couple lines to
14:28 - make it look like a basket
14:29 - and then right here we just made it
14:30 - bigger so we have this one upgrade where
14:32 - it makes the basket bigger so
14:34 - we just made a bigger version we just
14:36 - stretched out so
14:37 - yeah so this is the basket so we're
14:40 - gonna go to the code
14:41 - so player i mean not player fruit okay
14:45 - if touching
14:51 - if it's touching the basket
14:54 - then we are going to start the sound pop
14:59 - or chomp whatever doesn't matter what
15:01 - sound
15:02 - and then we're gonna actually i think
15:04 - pop sounds a bit better than chong
15:06 - because it
15:06 - might be quite annoying
15:12 - one pop is the most simple sound ever
15:15 - i'm gonna start the sound pop and then
15:17 - in the variables we have the change
15:19 - score by one
15:23 - okay and then after this we're going to
15:25 - go to
15:26 - a random position once it touches it
15:28 - we're going to go make it go back
15:30 - up so we're going to make it go to
15:34 - pick random 210 negative 210 to 210 same
15:37 - right there
15:37 - and 180.
15:40 - okay and we're going to set the y back
15:43 - to 180
15:47 - um and we're going to switch the costume
15:49 - to pick random one to five
15:51 - so what this does is so random fruits
15:53 - will be falling down so we have five
15:55 - costumes so we're gonna make it
15:56 - swish costume to pick random one to five
16:01 - i'm gonna use the random put it right
16:04 - here five
16:06 - depends how many costumes you have and
16:08 - then we're gonna get another if-then
16:10 - statement so
16:10 - if it's touching the hitbox which is the
16:12 - thing in the bottom
16:14 - if touching hit box
16:18 - then we're going to go to
16:23 - um i can just duplicate this
16:27 - this whole chunk and put it in here okay
16:30 - so this is the fruit
16:32 - that's gonna be the fruit falling
16:36 - again as you can see the fruit falls and
16:38 - of course the player
16:40 - is not done yet so we're going to work
16:42 - on the player
16:43 - and when it touches the basket it will
16:45 - gain
16:46 - one score so let's go back to the player
16:49 - the fruit catcher
16:51 - so when i receive start game in here
16:55 - when i receive start game
16:59 - we're going to um
17:02 - make a new variable let's name it hit
17:05 - bomb so later in the game we're gonna
17:06 - add bomb so if you hit the bomb then
17:08 - you'll
17:08 - lose one life so we're gonna name it hit
17:11 - bomb so
17:11 - in the beginning we're gonna set it to
17:14 - no
17:15 - because you have not touched the bomb so
17:17 - let's go
17:20 - okay and we're gonna show it when the
17:23 - game starts
17:24 - the player and forever
17:29 - if left arrow is being pressed
17:34 - key left arrow
17:37 - key left is being pressed and we're
17:39 - going to point direction of negative 90.
17:44 - 90 and we are going to move the amount
17:47 - of run steps which is eight so
17:51 - like that just duplicate this put it
17:54 - under
17:54 - if the right arrow is pressed i'm going
17:57 - to point direction of 90 obviously
17:59 - facing the right side okay
18:02 - and for the basket let's go to the
18:04 - basket
18:06 - so for the basket when fly clicked you
18:09 - want to
18:10 - switch costume to basket one which is
18:12 - the smaller basket
18:14 - and we're going to hide in the beginning
18:18 - and once i receive start game on the
18:20 - basket
18:22 - then we're going to show go to the front
18:26 - layer
18:28 - go to front layer and
18:31 - forever control forever go to the fruit
18:34 - catcher from the player
18:37 - go to the player so
18:42 - and we want to show the player at this
18:44 - point and we want to adjust it
18:46 - to where the basket is on top so when
18:49 - you
18:49 - click play it the basket will just go
18:53 - right there so the basket does not have
18:55 - to be centered
18:56 - now because you want it to be on top of
18:58 - him so we're going to do that
19:01 - kind of like that okay
19:06 - for the big basket tube we're going to
19:08 - have to do that as well so you wanna
19:10 - just go into the costume and find where
19:12 - you want to put the basket
19:16 - all right let's go back to the basket
19:21 - and okay
19:28 - i made one little mistake in the
19:32 - project so right here inside the player
19:34 - i set this to fruit speed to no instead
19:36 - so that's why you saw it was only
19:40 - rotating in one place so i should have
19:43 - set this to hit bomb so i
19:44 - actually didn't set that
19:47 - and one more thing you want to set the
19:50 - player
19:52 - you know this thing right here click
19:54 - that so that it will not flip upside
19:56 - down
19:56 - so as you can see if you don't then
20:00 - you'll flip upside down every time so
20:02 - you don't want that so we're going to
20:04 - obviously do that okay
20:08 - so save it i'm gonna demonstrate the
20:10 - game now so let's
20:11 - begin so when you hit every single
20:15 - uh fruit you get points and let me show
20:18 - the variable score
20:21 - uh where's this one here okay right
20:23 - there as you can see we're getting score
20:28 - and as you can see
20:32 - when the fruit hit the bottom they just
20:34 - disappear
20:37 - okay and i think i hid the variable
20:39 - score right here so
20:40 - when i receive start game we're probably
20:43 - gonna have to
20:44 - show it again so receive start game
20:49 - or you just set yeah we can just show it
20:51 - right here actually
20:53 - show variable score
20:58 - okay so when you begin the score will
21:01 - show automatically
21:02 - and we have to set the score to zero as
21:04 - well so let's set
21:05 - the score zero okay
21:10 - score
21:13 - and let's hide these variables
21:17 - here and only keep the money score and
21:20 - the swiping on this one
21:21 - okay
21:24 - let's go full screen all right so in the
21:28 - beginning
21:29 - begin button you catch the fruit you get
21:33 - one score
21:34 - the basket follows the main character
21:39 - yes we have the basic mechanics done
21:42 - you can now you can catch the fruits but
21:45 - we have some more mechanics we'll get
21:47 - into
21:47 - a shop in the future all right
21:50 - i think that should be it for the first
21:53 - episode of this series
21:55 - so thank you guys for watching don't
21:56 - forget to like share
21:58 - and subscribe and to our channel and
22:01 - i'll see you guys in the next tutorial
22:14 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys it's kids coding playground here today we'll be doing a video on how to make an apple dash game so in our previous video we made about a week ago we demonstrated the game so if you want to check out how the game works you can go into that video and watch it and i demonstrate how the game works so yes today's i'm going to work on the tutorial because you guys gave us 50 likes so thank you guys for 50 likes so we're going to work on tutorials so first rename our project let's name it apple dash so apple dash is the name of the game and then we're going to trash the scratch cat okay let's upload the ghost sprite ghost so we're gonna get the ghost this one um that's gonna be our apple catcher the fruit catcher for the ghost we're going to be using the third costume but you can actually get some legs so like you can duplicate these legs onto the go see so then again looks like he has legs okay so this is optional but it'll make your game a little bit better i think okay let's duplicate one more what there you go can we make it go backwards backwards okay so there we go we got the two legs make them go to the back layer um so another ghost is there goes let's uh group this group okay let's we can trash the other costumes we do not need them needing this let's rename this costume to fruit catcher so this is going to be a fruit catcher so inside the fruit catcher we're going to have to when green fly clicked um let's zoom in i think i'm going to move the fruit catcher like about here okay and i think i set the fruit catcher to i think 90 percent uh yeah 90 i think that's what i did so i'm gonna make it go about right here okay so i'm gonna make it go to let's put x zero y negative one negative one fifteen let's make an even number so we're gonna go to that position gonna make a couple variables let's make let's delete this variable and name make another variable called money so with money you can buy other upgrades for your apple catcher so we're going to set the money to zero in the beginning and we're going to make a new variable called characters so you can buy a skin in this game which is the pig skin so in the beginning we're going to set the character to the ghost so care director oops character you know that's nice yes character okay so for all sprites we're going to set the character to ghost in the beginning ghost and then we're going to make another variable called run so this is to control the speed of the player so we need a variable to make it move left and right because um there's an upgrade that makes the ghost quicker so that's why we're gonna need a variable so run we're gonna set run to eight which is gonna be eight speed basically so run to eight and then we're gonna switch the costume to the fruit catcher fruit casher i'm gonna name a fruit catcher one because we're gonna have to pig and all that stuff so we're gonna have this all right now we can get a backdrop so let's look here so i got the jungle i think not the jungle it was something else i mean you guys oh yeah force you guys can pick any backdrop you would like i'm just going to pick this one okay um and for the backdrop i got some trees just delete this one i got some trees from here so i'm gonna not choose a backdrop i want to upload some sprites into here so i got some trees so let's get a tree so tree you can remember you can always just copy paste in here so just select your tree group it copy ctrl c go into the backdrop let's go to vector control v boom you got your tree right here so it's pretty cool i'm gonna make it a little bit smaller okay select this one more time ctrl c ctrl v i'll put two trees i guess oh like that right okay and then because we're not gonna eat that and then we're gonna get the apple and put some apples on the tree i guess so let's go inside we're going to make the apples a bit smaller so we're going to group that which we'll see ctrl v and then we're going to make it a little bit smaller like about that big maybe a little bit smaller okay and let's copy paste this ctrl v put one like right here we'll copy about two more let's put one right here and let's put one right here let's put one right here okay so now we have like two apple trees okay now we're gonna make a fruit sprite and we'll have a bunch of costumes inside so we're gonna need the apple okay so inside the apple with the costumes we are going to get the orange banana and all those stuff so orange orange we're going to be using this orange we also have the banana bananas put those inside and we're also going to get the watermelon watermelon watermelon and we're also gonna get the strawberry i believe they have a strawberry as you can see they do so we're gonna be using the strawberry watermelon let's just take that out watermelon okay so for we're gonna rename the sprite to fruits fruit one because we want more fruits so we're gonna have multiple sprites for fruits i'm gonna set the size of 75 right here yeah so the fruit's a bit smaller as you can see okay so for the fruits we're going to add some code in it later so first let's go back to our ghost or let's rename this player so let's rename this sprite to player okay now we're gonna make the movement of the player so so we're going to create a begin button sprite so before the ghost will show up we're gonna have to have a begin button sprite so we're gonna get the uh green button this thing so in the beginning we're going to get some text let's make it white so i'm gonna write begin okay put that like right here okay that thing i should do and then we're gonna copy paste it flip it over and hold down shift if you want it to be perfect all right now we have the begin button okay let's group all this okay for the begin button let's name it beacon okay so this is the begin button so for the begin button so before we get into the code in the begin button we actually have to broadcast a message from the backdrop so from the backdrop we're going to get a one green flag clicked we're going to set uh we're going to hide the variable uh let's make a new variable i forgot to make score score and we're also going to make a variable called high score and it's going to be a cloud variable um so what's high school so we're going to be using high score and score so in the beginning we're going to hide high score and hide the score variable and after that we're going to broadcast a message called start screen so this is going to be broadcast to the begin button start screen start screen so let's go to the begin button now so in the begin button we're going to want to receive start screen um let's hide this oh yeah actually in the uh goose we're gonna hide it in the beginning when i clicked hi and now we can go back to the begin button when we start screen let's put the begin button about right here i think that should be fine get this okay let's make it zero so it's more perfect and then we're going to set the brightness to zero in the beginning set brightness to zero and then after that we're gonna show and broadcast a message called spin button so we're gonna make the button spin like we do in other tutorials and then for the spin button when i receive spin button inside the button we are going to get a forever loop forever turn two degrees to the right um and if it's touching we're gonna need to and so if the mouse is on the begin button and it's clicking on it then it'll run something so if touching mouse pointer and mouse down so i want to make sure that you're clicking one thing we're going to set the brightness negative 10 to add a little bit more effect to it and set brightness to negative 10. and then we're going to wait until not mouse down wait until not done okay and then once it's clicked on we're going to play the sound pop and we're going to hide the button once it's clicked okay and then we're going to broadcast the message and wait called start game which will broadcast to the ghost and apple start the game and we're going to stop the script once this is done running so we're going to stop this skirt now let's go to our apple i mean our fruits okay so inside our fruit we are going to get a one green flag clicked so when the green flag is clicked we are going to hide the fruits in the beginning and when i receive start game when i receive start game we are going to set the fruit speed which is a new variable so we're going to name it fruit speed so this is the speed of the fruit so sometimes we'll have armageddons where the fruits will fall faster so that's why we're gonna use the fruit speed so we're gonna set the fruit speed to negative six and in the beginning we're going to show let's go to looks and show and we're going to go to a position so we're going to make it go to a pick random position to make it pick random negative 210 to 210 for the x 210 and for the y i think i'm gonna do 180 which is the top and we're gonna set the y to 180 actually i don't think this is necessary because we're already going to this actually i'll add it just in case so we're going to set y to 180 and then forever forever we're going to make it turn degree so we're just going to make a turn turn left 5 degrees and we're gonna change the y by the fruit speed which is negative six so it'll fall down by negative six and then we're going to do we're gonna make a new sprite so this is going to be a hit box so if it touches it then it will make it go back to the top so we're going to be painting it so let's get the line tool let's make it about five thickness okay and hold down shift then you get a perfect line across okay i can use the select tool and center it and then you can move the sprite this hit box right like down here maybe about right here yeah okay so for the hitbox sprite we're going to get the code later actually we can do it right now let's name it box hit box and then one green flag click go to this position go to and we're going to be using it to set we're going to set the ghost effect to 100 because if you hide it then it will not detect anything so if you send it to ghost effect which means it's disappears it will still detect stuff so for the fruit we're going to when after this we're going to get an ifthen statement so i'm going to import my basket sprite basket so we're going to be using a basket from the cashmere fruit so for the basket i basically did a circle as you can see we might put this into the google drive so you guys can get it from there or you can draw your own or there's a um bowl sprite so basically we just drew a circle with outline right here so as you can see it's just a circle's outline and then right here we just drew a rectangle with outline and then we just used the reshape tool to make it look more like a bowl i mean a basket and then we used the lines we just drew a couple lines to make it look like a basket and then right here we just made it bigger so we have this one upgrade where it makes the basket bigger so we just made a bigger version we just stretched out so yeah so this is the basket so we're gonna go to the code so player i mean not player fruit okay if touching if it's touching the basket then we are going to start the sound pop or chomp whatever doesn't matter what sound and then we're gonna actually i think pop sounds a bit better than chong because it might be quite annoying one pop is the most simple sound ever i'm gonna start the sound pop and then in the variables we have the change score by one okay and then after this we're going to go to a random position once it touches it we're going to go make it go back up so we're going to make it go to pick random 210 negative 210 to 210 same right there and 180. okay and we're going to set the y back to 180 um and we're going to switch the costume to pick random one to five so what this does is so random fruits will be falling down so we have five costumes so we're gonna make it swish costume to pick random one to five i'm gonna use the random put it right here five depends how many costumes you have and then we're gonna get another ifthen statement so if it's touching the hitbox which is the thing in the bottom if touching hit box then we're going to go to um i can just duplicate this this whole chunk and put it in here okay so this is the fruit that's gonna be the fruit falling again as you can see the fruit falls and of course the player is not done yet so we're going to work on the player and when it touches the basket it will gain one score so let's go back to the player the fruit catcher so when i receive start game in here when i receive start game we're going to um make a new variable let's name it hit bomb so later in the game we're gonna add bomb so if you hit the bomb then you'll lose one life so we're gonna name it hit bomb so in the beginning we're gonna set it to no because you have not touched the bomb so let's go okay and we're gonna show it when the game starts the player and forever if left arrow is being pressed key left arrow key left is being pressed and we're going to point direction of negative 90. 90 and we are going to move the amount of run steps which is eight so like that just duplicate this put it under if the right arrow is pressed i'm going to point direction of 90 obviously facing the right side okay and for the basket let's go to the basket so for the basket when fly clicked you want to switch costume to basket one which is the smaller basket and we're going to hide in the beginning and once i receive start game on the basket then we're going to show go to the front layer go to front layer and forever control forever go to the fruit catcher from the player go to the player so and we want to show the player at this point and we want to adjust it to where the basket is on top so when you click play it the basket will just go right there so the basket does not have to be centered now because you want it to be on top of him so we're going to do that kind of like that okay for the big basket tube we're going to have to do that as well so you wanna just go into the costume and find where you want to put the basket all right let's go back to the basket and okay i made one little mistake in the project so right here inside the player i set this to fruit speed to no instead so that's why you saw it was only rotating in one place so i should have set this to hit bomb so i actually didn't set that and one more thing you want to set the player you know this thing right here click that so that it will not flip upside down so as you can see if you don't then you'll flip upside down every time so you don't want that so we're going to obviously do that okay so save it i'm gonna demonstrate the game now so let's begin so when you hit every single uh fruit you get points and let me show the variable score uh where's this one here okay right there as you can see we're getting score and as you can see when the fruit hit the bottom they just disappear okay and i think i hid the variable score right here so when i receive start game we're probably gonna have to show it again so receive start game or you just set yeah we can just show it right here actually show variable score okay so when you begin the score will show automatically and we have to set the score to zero as well so let's set the score zero okay score and let's hide these variables here and only keep the money score and the swiping on this one okay let's go full screen all right so in the beginning begin button you catch the fruit you get one score the basket follows the main character yes we have the basic mechanics done you can now you can catch the fruits but we have some more mechanics we'll get into a shop in the future all right i think that should be it for the first episode of this series so thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe and to our channel and i'll see you guys in the next tutorial you
