00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:09 - kids going to playground today we'll be
00:10 - making a game called save the turkey
00:12 - since thanksgiving is coming up at the
00:14 - end of the month so we might
00:16 - we thought we might make a thanksgiving
00:18 - themed game
00:20 - uh we had many requests on um making a
00:23 - shooting game on our channel so
00:26 - um so i hope you like it guys so we're
00:28 - gonna be making a game called save the
00:30 - turkey
00:32 - and then we're going to be learning
00:33 - these fallen concepts in scratch
00:35 - using variables to control an action
00:37 - loops
00:38 - broadcasting messages controlling sprite
00:41 - with the mouse
00:42 - and sensing blocks so let's go on to
00:44 - demo the game
00:46 - so let's make a full screen
00:49 - so the point of the game is to get 20
00:51 - score um
00:53 - without losing all of your bullets so
00:55 - you're supposed to shoot the bats before
00:57 - not letting them touch the turkey
01:00 - so
01:00 - [Music]
01:04 - um and shooting a coin will give you
01:06 - score as well
01:08 - killing a bat will also give you score
01:10 - as well one one point
01:13 - um shooting a bat will give you one
01:14 - point so when you get to 20 score then
01:17 - you win
01:18 - without losing all your bullets so
01:21 - this is pretty much the game um and you
01:23 - don't want to let them touch your turkey
01:25 - because if the bats touch your turkey
01:27 - then you will lose three lives
01:30 - on three points sorry three points so um
01:34 - and if you have less than three points
01:36 - then just go to zero score
01:37 - so yeah let's uh start a new project
01:42 - so new projects um
01:46 - so we're gonna rename it to uh save the
01:49 - turkey
01:52 - save the turkey and we're going to
01:54 - delete the scratch cap we don't need it
01:56 - and um we have some stuff in our
01:59 - backpack
02:00 - so right now i'm going to go to the
02:02 - backdrop
02:03 - and then i'm going to put that this
02:06 - thing in
02:07 - so i got this backdrop from online and
02:10 - oh yeah one more thing
02:11 - so we will be uploading all of these
02:13 - sprites that you will need
02:14 - in um our kids coding playground google
02:17 - drive
02:18 - so you can just download them and we are
02:19 - still having a lot of people asking for
02:21 - access
02:22 - in our email um you guys do not need
02:25 - access you guys can access it
02:27 - just don't use your school account
02:29 - because the school blocks it from
02:30 - letting you use it so you have to use
02:32 - your own personal gmail
02:34 - and also if you want to learn how to do
02:35 - that just watch our video
02:37 - on how to accessing the google drive so
02:41 - yeah and by the way this this coin looks
02:44 - a little bit bad because i made this
02:46 - game back in 2.0
02:48 - so um it converted everything to bitmap
02:51 - that's why it's a little bit pixelated
02:53 - so we have the the target uh
02:56 - aimer i guess the cursor with the bat
03:00 - this bat you cannot get it from the
03:01 - sprite library anymore
03:03 - so we'll be putting this in the google
03:04 - drive um it wasn't 2.0 but it's not in
03:08 - 3.0 anymore
03:09 - um and then we have the ground sprite so
03:11 - this is just to detect
03:13 - so when the bat when you shoot a bat
03:15 - it'll flip over and fall onto the
03:18 - ground so it will detect if it's
03:20 - touching the ground
03:21 - then it will um disappear and then we
03:24 - have
03:25 - the uin and you lose sprites
03:28 - and then these two this is just a score
03:30 - just put the score right here
03:32 - and the bullet and then we have the
03:35 - turkey
03:36 - as well so yeah these are all of our
03:39 - sprites we'll be using
03:40 - so first let's start out on the target
03:43 - i'm gonna name it target
03:44 - first so target what i did was just draw
03:48 - a circle right here
03:50 - draw a thinner circle right here and
03:52 - then draw four lines like that
03:53 - to make it look like a target you guys
03:55 - can draw it any way you'd like
03:57 - but this is how we drew it um so
04:00 - let's go to the code it's gotta go to
04:02 - events when green flag is clicked
04:04 - let me zoom in when the green flag is
04:07 - clicked
04:08 - we want to make the target or cursor go
04:10 - to
04:11 - the middle go to zero zero
04:14 - and wait 0.5 seconds so you cannot move
04:17 - it for 0.5 seconds just like
04:20 - um to wait a little bit just give a
04:22 - slight pause
04:23 - and then put a forever loop um so we're
04:25 - going to set the x
04:27 - to the mouse x and set the map y to the
04:30 - mouse y
04:31 - so set x and y
04:36 - so go to sensing set the
04:39 - mouse x to mouse x set the y
04:43 - to mouse y so then i'll follow your
04:44 - mouse and then we want to make it to go
04:47 - to the front layer
04:48 - go to front layer and then if it's got
04:52 - an if-then statement
04:53 - if there's mouse down so like when you
04:56 - click down
04:57 - and the mouse is down then i have a
05:00 - sound called 9mm it's just like the gun
05:02 - sound
05:03 - so i'm just going to put that right here
05:05 - um and then we're going to make another
05:07 - broadcast so we're going to make a
05:08 - broadcast message down here so we're
05:10 - gonna broadcast a message called shot
05:13 - shot fired so
05:16 - this will signal um the uh
05:20 - target to fire i mean the bullet to fire
05:23 - and we have two sounds right here you
05:25 - can either use the blast or the 9mm
05:27 - so and so we have a blast at 9mm
05:31 - you can use either of them so shots
05:33 - fired then that means
05:35 - they'll broadcast the gun to shoot the
05:38 - bat
05:40 - okay and then we're going to make some
05:42 - variables
05:43 - we're going to make two new variables
05:45 - called bullet
05:47 - oops bullet and we then make another
05:51 - variable called score
05:52 - i'm actually going to show this so what
05:55 - we're going to do
05:56 - is double click right here so then it'll
05:58 - be like that
05:59 - and then so this is bullet and this is
06:03 - score
06:04 - as you can see now you can just double
06:06 - so just double click and then it'll just
06:08 - become small okay so now
06:11 - we put these inside the boxes okay so
06:14 - now let's continue let's go back to the
06:15 - target
06:17 - um after this we want to change the
06:19 - bullets by negative one after a shot is
06:21 - fired
06:22 - change the bullet by negative one
06:25 - and then uh we're gonna wait 0.2 seconds
06:28 - [Music]
06:32 - okay so this is the code for the target
06:34 - so now you can
06:35 - actually kind of move around like this
06:38 - and when you click down it'll make the
06:39 - fire sound but
06:40 - you cannot do kill anything with it
06:42 - because we have not added the code yet
06:45 - so next let's go on to add
06:48 - the bat for the bat we'll need many
06:51 - variables
06:52 - so we're going to make a not a variable
06:56 - called bat shot so this is to detect if
06:59 - the bat
07:00 - is being shot with the badge shot yet
07:04 - and then we're going to make another one
07:06 - called bullet shot
07:09 - [Music]
07:10 - let's make another one a coin shot so
07:14 - to check if the coin is being shot and
07:17 - then
07:17 - we have to make the offset x and offset
07:20 - y for the bat so
07:22 - set x so this is just to detect if the
07:25 - bat
07:26 - this is just a pick random x position
07:29 - for the bat
07:30 - and we'll make another one from off set
07:33 - one for the pick random for the bat as
07:35 - well okay so now we have all our
07:37 - variables
07:38 - let's continue on the back so in the
07:41 - back we're gonna
07:42 - start by getting a one green flag
07:43 - clicked zoom in a little bit
07:46 - and then we're gonna set the bat shot by
07:49 - to zero
07:50 - meaning that bat is not shot not being
07:52 - shot at and then we're gonna set the
07:53 - score to zero in the beginning
07:56 - and then we're gonna set the amount of
07:58 - bullets to 25. you guys can pick
08:00 - whatever number you
08:01 - like but we're going to do 25 bolts and
08:04 - then we're going to get a forever loop
08:06 - forever
08:10 - forever loop if but if then statement
08:14 - if the bat shot is equal to zero
08:17 - that means if the bat is still alive
08:21 - equal to zero bat shot
08:26 - then we want to point in direction of 90
08:31 - point in direction 90 to the right side
08:34 - and then we're going to switch the
08:35 - costume to bat 2a
08:37 - which is the first one because we're
08:39 - going to make the bat flap at the swings
08:40 - that's why we want to set it back to the
08:42 - normal bat 2a
08:46 - and then we're going to set the offset x
08:48 - to pick random
08:50 - so this is just going to be pick random
08:51 - of where the bat is going to be
08:53 - pick random negative 160 to 160 so it'll
08:56 - be like somewhere from this side
08:57 - to this side negative 160
09:02 - oops negative 160
09:06 - to positive 160 and then
09:09 - we're going to set the offset y i'm just
09:12 - going to
09:12 - complete this and set the offset y
09:16 - to pick random negative 50 to 150
09:22 - 105 sorry not 150 150 would be too high
09:25 - so 105 is like about right here
09:29 - and then after that we're gonna get a go
09:30 - to so it'll go to the offset x in y
09:34 - it'll go to the corresponding numbers
09:38 - and then we're going to show we're going
09:39 - to show the bat after it's
09:41 - at the right spot and then we're going
09:44 - to do something right here to make it
09:45 - even more random so let's get an if else
09:47 - statement
09:48 - um so if the offset
09:52 - x mod 2 that means if the offset x
09:56 - is equal to zero so we're going to get a
09:57 - mod we use
09:59 - mod in like another video so if you
10:01 - don't remember what mod is
10:02 - it means um it means the two numbers
10:06 - divided the um the remainder so
10:09 - if the mod is zero that means there's no
10:12 - remainder
10:13 - so when the offset x and the mod two
10:18 - is equal to zero which means there's no
10:19 - remainder then we're gonna
10:21 - um if it's a that means if it's an even
10:23 - number we're gonna
10:24 - um go positive and if it's an odd number
10:27 - we're gonna go negative so we're gonna
10:29 - glide one second
10:32 - and pick random we're gonna get an
10:35 - addition sign so we're gonna add
10:38 - offset x plus the pick random
10:42 - 30 to 100 so this makes it even more
10:45 - random so if the number
10:46 - is even it would make it
10:49 - offset x plus 30 to 100 and then we're
10:52 - going to duplicate this
10:53 - plus the offset y pick random 30 to 100
10:58 - as well
10:59 - so um and then if the number is odd
11:02 - then we're gonna do this so
11:05 - um glide one second instead of adding
11:08 - we're gonna do a subtraction okay
11:10 - so let me take this out we're gonna use
11:13 - subtraction instead of addition
11:15 - if the number is odd so subtraction sign
11:18 - subtraction sign offset
11:22 - x minus 30 to 100
11:26 - offset y minus pick random 30 to 100
11:30 - all right so now we have finished the
11:33 - placement for the bat now we're going to
11:35 - make the bat flap between
11:37 - so we have two costumes for the bat one
11:39 - and two to make it
11:41 - look like it's flapping its wings so for
11:43 - the bat
11:44 - we're gonna do when flag clicked
11:47 - um forever
11:51 - if bat shot is equal to zero
11:55 - meaning that if it's not dead
11:58 - bat shot uh over here
12:01 - then we're gonna next costume and wait
12:05 - 0.1 seconds
12:08 - so that it'll switch the costumes okay
12:13 - and we do not want to put this inside
12:14 - because we don't want to block the
12:16 - forever loop we don't want to mess up
12:17 - this
12:18 - area so we put this in a separate um
12:20 - forever loop
12:22 - okay so we're gonna so remember we
12:25 - broadcast the message from here shot
12:27 - fired
12:28 - so we're gonna have to broad uh receive
12:31 - it right here so let's go to the bat
12:34 - so okay so when i receive let's go to
12:36 - events
12:38 - when i receive a shot fired
12:41 - we're gonna do an if to detect if the
12:44 - mouse pointer is touching the bat
12:47 - if touching mouse pointer the bat's
12:49 - touching the mouse pointer
12:51 - then we're going to set the bat shot to
12:52 - one meaning it is dead
12:55 - and then we're going to broadcast
12:56 - another message called
12:58 - bat dead so the bat is dead
13:02 - bad dead
13:05 - that dead and then in the back we're
13:08 - going to
13:09 - say when i receive bat dead
13:12 - we're going to do change the score by
13:15 - one so every bat you kill
13:17 - you will get one score
13:20 - uh score by one and we're gonna
13:24 - broadcast
13:24 - another message called check score we
13:26 - will need later
13:28 - uh we won't need it right now but we'll
13:31 - need it
13:31 - later so broadcast check score
13:38 - check score and then we're going to
13:39 - switch the costume to bat
13:41 - 2b which is this one
13:45 - uh switch costume to bat 2b and then
13:48 - we're going to make it flip
13:49 - over by pointing in direction of
13:52 - negative 90
13:54 - and we're gonna make it repeat until
13:56 - touching round
13:58 - so a point direction of negative 90.
14:01 - and then we're going to make it repeat
14:04 - um
14:05 - repeat until touching ground
14:08 - [Music]
14:09 - touching the ground the sprite
14:14 - and we're going to change the y by
14:16 - negative four
14:17 - so we'll keep on going down by negative
14:19 - four until touching the ground
14:22 - changing the y by negative four and then
14:24 - we're gonna start a sound
14:25 - called drum bass we had this sound you
14:28 - guys can pick whatever sound you want
14:31 - we're just going to use this one sounds
14:32 - like this
14:34 - [Music]
14:35 - so we're going to use this one and then
14:37 - we're going to hide it once it touches
14:38 - the ground
14:40 - and then we're going to broadcast
14:41 - another message called start again
14:43 - [Music]
14:47 - start
14:51 - starting again and then down here we
14:53 - want to get uh when i receive
14:56 - start again
14:59 - we have to wait one second and then set
15:01 - the bat shot back to zero
15:04 - so it is going to start a new bat
15:08 - that is alive so now let's test out the
15:11 - game of what we have right now
15:13 - oh yeah and sorry i accidentally set the
15:15 - bullet shot
15:16 - not the bullets so right here to set the
15:18 - bullet sorry about that
15:20 - so that's why i was going negative bolts
15:22 - so now let's see
15:23 - 25 bullets and now when you click it the
15:26 - bat will die and disappear and you get
15:28 - one score for every bat to kill
15:30 - [Music]
15:33 - like that and the bullets will
15:36 - constantly go down every bullet you use
15:38 - so
15:40 - much shooting your skin from losing
15:41 - bullets so
15:43 - that's what we're gonna do today we're
15:46 - gonna finish the rest in the next video
15:48 - so we just finished the target and the
15:50 - bat
15:51 - so tomorrow we might as well finish
15:55 - the baby turkey and the coins and then
15:58 - you win
15:58 - so that's it for this video hope you
16:01 - enjoyed
16:02 - please like share and subscribe and ring
16:05 - the notification bell as well
16:06 - see you guys in the next video
16:10 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys to another video on kids going to playground today we'll be making a game called save the turkey since thanksgiving is coming up at the end of the month so we might we thought we might make a thanksgiving themed game uh we had many requests on um making a shooting game on our channel so um so i hope you like it guys so we're gonna be making a game called save the turkey and then we're going to be learning these fallen concepts in scratch using variables to control an action loops broadcasting messages controlling sprite with the mouse and sensing blocks so let's go on to demo the game so let's make a full screen so the point of the game is to get 20 score um without losing all of your bullets so you're supposed to shoot the bats before not letting them touch the turkey so um and shooting a coin will give you score as well killing a bat will also give you score as well one one point um shooting a bat will give you one point so when you get to 20 score then you win without losing all your bullets so this is pretty much the game um and you don't want to let them touch your turkey because if the bats touch your turkey then you will lose three lives on three points sorry three points so um and if you have less than three points then just go to zero score so yeah let's uh start a new project so new projects um so we're gonna rename it to uh save the turkey save the turkey and we're going to delete the scratch cap we don't need it and um we have some stuff in our backpack so right now i'm going to go to the backdrop and then i'm going to put that this thing in so i got this backdrop from online and oh yeah one more thing so we will be uploading all of these sprites that you will need in um our kids coding playground google drive so you can just download them and we are still having a lot of people asking for access in our email um you guys do not need access you guys can access it just don't use your school account because the school blocks it from letting you use it so you have to use your own personal gmail and also if you want to learn how to do that just watch our video on how to accessing the google drive so yeah and by the way this this coin looks a little bit bad because i made this game back in 2.0 so um it converted everything to bitmap that's why it's a little bit pixelated so we have the the target uh aimer i guess the cursor with the bat this bat you cannot get it from the sprite library anymore so we'll be putting this in the google drive um it wasn't 2.0 but it's not in 3.0 anymore um and then we have the ground sprite so this is just to detect so when the bat when you shoot a bat it'll flip over and fall onto the ground so it will detect if it's touching the ground then it will um disappear and then we have the uin and you lose sprites and then these two this is just a score just put the score right here and the bullet and then we have the turkey as well so yeah these are all of our sprites we'll be using so first let's start out on the target i'm gonna name it target first so target what i did was just draw a circle right here draw a thinner circle right here and then draw four lines like that to make it look like a target you guys can draw it any way you'd like but this is how we drew it um so let's go to the code it's gotta go to events when green flag is clicked let me zoom in when the green flag is clicked we want to make the target or cursor go to the middle go to zero zero and wait 0.5 seconds so you cannot move it for 0.5 seconds just like um to wait a little bit just give a slight pause and then put a forever loop um so we're going to set the x to the mouse x and set the map y to the mouse y so set x and y so go to sensing set the mouse x to mouse x set the y to mouse y so then i'll follow your mouse and then we want to make it to go to the front layer go to front layer and then if it's got an ifthen statement if there's mouse down so like when you click down and the mouse is down then i have a sound called 9mm it's just like the gun sound so i'm just going to put that right here um and then we're going to make another broadcast so we're going to make a broadcast message down here so we're gonna broadcast a message called shot shot fired so this will signal um the uh target to fire i mean the bullet to fire and we have two sounds right here you can either use the blast or the 9mm so and so we have a blast at 9mm you can use either of them so shots fired then that means they'll broadcast the gun to shoot the bat okay and then we're going to make some variables we're going to make two new variables called bullet oops bullet and we then make another variable called score i'm actually going to show this so what we're going to do is double click right here so then it'll be like that and then so this is bullet and this is score as you can see now you can just double so just double click and then it'll just become small okay so now we put these inside the boxes okay so now let's continue let's go back to the target um after this we want to change the bullets by negative one after a shot is fired change the bullet by negative one and then uh we're gonna wait 0.2 seconds okay so this is the code for the target so now you can actually kind of move around like this and when you click down it'll make the fire sound but you cannot do kill anything with it because we have not added the code yet so next let's go on to add the bat for the bat we'll need many variables so we're going to make a not a variable called bat shot so this is to detect if the bat is being shot with the badge shot yet and then we're going to make another one called bullet shot let's make another one a coin shot so to check if the coin is being shot and then we have to make the offset x and offset y for the bat so set x so this is just to detect if the bat this is just a pick random x position for the bat and we'll make another one from off set one for the pick random for the bat as well okay so now we have all our variables let's continue on the back so in the back we're gonna start by getting a one green flag clicked zoom in a little bit and then we're gonna set the bat shot by to zero meaning that bat is not shot not being shot at and then we're gonna set the score to zero in the beginning and then we're gonna set the amount of bullets to 25. you guys can pick whatever number you like but we're going to do 25 bolts and then we're going to get a forever loop forever forever loop if but if then statement if the bat shot is equal to zero that means if the bat is still alive equal to zero bat shot then we want to point in direction of 90 point in direction 90 to the right side and then we're going to switch the costume to bat 2a which is the first one because we're going to make the bat flap at the swings that's why we want to set it back to the normal bat 2a and then we're going to set the offset x to pick random so this is just going to be pick random of where the bat is going to be pick random negative 160 to 160 so it'll be like somewhere from this side to this side negative 160 oops negative 160 to positive 160 and then we're going to set the offset y i'm just going to complete this and set the offset y to pick random negative 50 to 150 105 sorry not 150 150 would be too high so 105 is like about right here and then after that we're gonna get a go to so it'll go to the offset x in y it'll go to the corresponding numbers and then we're going to show we're going to show the bat after it's at the right spot and then we're going to do something right here to make it even more random so let's get an if else statement um so if the offset x mod 2 that means if the offset x is equal to zero so we're going to get a mod we use mod in like another video so if you don't remember what mod is it means um it means the two numbers divided the um the remainder so if the mod is zero that means there's no remainder so when the offset x and the mod two is equal to zero which means there's no remainder then we're gonna um if it's a that means if it's an even number we're gonna um go positive and if it's an odd number we're gonna go negative so we're gonna glide one second and pick random we're gonna get an addition sign so we're gonna add offset x plus the pick random 30 to 100 so this makes it even more random so if the number is even it would make it offset x plus 30 to 100 and then we're going to duplicate this plus the offset y pick random 30 to 100 as well so um and then if the number is odd then we're gonna do this so um glide one second instead of adding we're gonna do a subtraction okay so let me take this out we're gonna use subtraction instead of addition if the number is odd so subtraction sign subtraction sign offset x minus 30 to 100 offset y minus pick random 30 to 100 all right so now we have finished the placement for the bat now we're going to make the bat flap between so we have two costumes for the bat one and two to make it look like it's flapping its wings so for the bat we're gonna do when flag clicked um forever if bat shot is equal to zero meaning that if it's not dead bat shot uh over here then we're gonna next costume and wait 0.1 seconds so that it'll switch the costumes okay and we do not want to put this inside because we don't want to block the forever loop we don't want to mess up this area so we put this in a separate um forever loop okay so we're gonna so remember we broadcast the message from here shot fired so we're gonna have to broad uh receive it right here so let's go to the bat so okay so when i receive let's go to events when i receive a shot fired we're gonna do an if to detect if the mouse pointer is touching the bat if touching mouse pointer the bat's touching the mouse pointer then we're going to set the bat shot to one meaning it is dead and then we're going to broadcast another message called bat dead so the bat is dead bad dead that dead and then in the back we're going to say when i receive bat dead we're going to do change the score by one so every bat you kill you will get one score uh score by one and we're gonna broadcast another message called check score we will need later uh we won't need it right now but we'll need it later so broadcast check score check score and then we're going to switch the costume to bat 2b which is this one uh switch costume to bat 2b and then we're going to make it flip over by pointing in direction of negative 90 and we're gonna make it repeat until touching round so a point direction of negative 90. and then we're going to make it repeat um repeat until touching ground touching the ground the sprite and we're going to change the y by negative four so we'll keep on going down by negative four until touching the ground changing the y by negative four and then we're gonna start a sound called drum bass we had this sound you guys can pick whatever sound you want we're just going to use this one sounds like this so we're going to use this one and then we're going to hide it once it touches the ground and then we're going to broadcast another message called start again start starting again and then down here we want to get uh when i receive start again we have to wait one second and then set the bat shot back to zero so it is going to start a new bat that is alive so now let's test out the game of what we have right now oh yeah and sorry i accidentally set the bullet shot not the bullets so right here to set the bullet sorry about that so that's why i was going negative bolts so now let's see 25 bullets and now when you click it the bat will die and disappear and you get one score for every bat to kill like that and the bullets will constantly go down every bullet you use so much shooting your skin from losing bullets so that's what we're gonna do today we're gonna finish the rest in the next video so we just finished the target and the bat so tomorrow we might as well finish the baby turkey and the coins and then you win so that's it for this video hope you enjoyed please like share and subscribe and ring the notification bell as well see you guys in the next video
