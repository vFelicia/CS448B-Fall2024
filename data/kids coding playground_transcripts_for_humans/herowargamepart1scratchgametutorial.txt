00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids playground
00:09 - here and today we're back with another
00:10 - video in scratch and today we'll be
00:12 - coding the first part of hero War so we
00:15 - already made the demo of this game um
00:17 - yesterday so uh please check that out on
00:20 - our Channel if you haven't already uh
00:22 - it's going to be on our Channel hero War
00:24 - demo this is going to be the first part
00:26 - in the making of the game there's
00:27 - probably going to be multiple Parts in
00:30 - this making of the
00:32 - [Music]
00:34 - game so I made my new project here of
00:37 - course first thing we're going to do is
00:38 - delete the scratch cat and let's find
00:41 - the backdrops so the backdrop I'm using
00:44 - for the hero selection menu is the
00:47 - Galaxy backdrop so that's just the hero
00:50 - selection and then for the second
00:52 - backdrop I do have it exported my
00:54 - backpack because I actually drew it
00:56 - myself
00:57 - so I have all the Sprites in my backpack
01:00 - but I'll give you a small tutorial on
01:02 - how to draw each of them so the backdrop
01:06 - I think it's back here
01:08 - somewhere yeah the backdrop right here
01:10 - so this is the backdrop which is when
01:12 - you're fighting the enemies so it's
01:15 - pretty
01:16 - simple um
01:19 - yeah uh it's just it's just this is a
01:25 - grass part you just put like a square
01:28 - you can reshape it all that good stuff
01:31 - and then these are flowers I just took
01:34 - those from my um spring games that I
01:36 - made it's pretty it's yeah you just put
01:39 - some petals like a circle and then you
01:42 - color it and then you have a little like
01:45 - re line you use a line or a rectangle
01:48 - and then you just reshape it same with
01:49 - these but flowers are kind of optional
01:51 - just for decoration and I just have a
01:53 - sand Square over here that's just behind
01:55 - the grass to a little sand patch which
01:58 - looks pretty cool in my opinion so I'm
02:00 - going to get all the Sprites in but I'll
02:02 - show you like a small representation and
02:04 - how to draw them so our first Sprite is
02:07 - the elf Warrior portrait which is in the
02:09 - selection menu when it's in the
02:12 - galaxy and there's also the Mage
02:16 - portrait there's also the fairy
02:20 - portrait and we have to use Sprite one
02:23 - to shoot the arrows and then so let's
02:27 - just put all the Sprites in first that's
02:28 - the first thing we're going to do
02:31 - and so we have a weight
02:33 - Sprite Which we'll make that later and
02:37 - then I'll export everything in my
02:38 - backpack then we have the player which I
02:42 - think is somewhere
02:43 - here so I just added it back in my
02:45 - backpack sorry for that it's going to
02:47 - load
02:49 - up and we have the
02:51 - player um then we have the projectile
02:55 - that goes with it so of course the
02:57 - projectile has the three for each three
02:59 - players
03:00 - [Music]
03:21 - so let's just finish up the Sprites here
03:25 - we have the weight
03:26 - Sprite wait oop wait
03:32 - so in
03:33 - blue or any color you want so we're
03:36 - going to
03:38 - have the weight
03:40 - Sprite Which it says wait wait before
03:46 - using this
03:51 - item that's the so this this um script
03:55 - uses the weight before using this item
03:57 - and the this item is in progress ress
04:01 - messages so this item is in
04:14 - progress so that's basically the weight
04:17 - one then we have so let's just rename
04:21 - this as
04:22 - weight wait oh
04:25 - wait and I'll put
04:28 - it I'll put it right here
04:31 - here or well it is part of that so I put
04:34 - here and then we have all the confirm
04:36 - buttons so button
04:40 - three I think this is more simpler than
04:42 - making a clone button like for all three
04:45 - so we're going to put a confirm
04:48 - button
04:51 - black
04:58 - confirm
05:00 - that's the confirm button so there's
05:02 - going to be confirm button for each of
05:04 - them because the Clone seems a little
05:05 - bit more harder uh so we have the
05:09 - confirm button for the elf which I'll
05:11 - I'll change all the sizes later but the
05:13 - confirm button and we'll put that over
05:20 - here
05:21 - confirm
05:24 - button I'll just confirm
05:27 - L and then we have the other confirm
05:31 - button oh No Just duplicate this other
05:35 - confirm
05:36 - button confirm
05:44 - Mage we have another one put that over
05:47 - there
05:48 - confirm
05:52 - Queen oh parentheses
05:56 - Queen so yeah we had that done and then
06:00 - after that we also have to add the
06:01 - apprentices star because the Grand
06:03 - Master M's third ability is a turret
06:05 - which is really strong against armored
06:06 - enemies so we have to draw an
06:08 - apprentices star which I'll just take
06:10 - from here but I'll show you how to draw
06:12 - everything um feel free to skip that if
06:14 - you do not want to learn and you in say
06:15 - you can come to my project Gumball 098
06:18 - and I have a hero War shared so you can
06:21 - take my Sprite up and put it in your
06:24 - backpack and use it for your
06:26 - own so we
06:28 - have the apprentices
06:32 - star it's Blue by the way
06:35 - so after
06:39 - that
06:41 - apprentices
06:43 - star star
06:46 - star I'm going to turn it some light
06:54 - blue zoom in a little bit there we go
06:58 - that's the apprentices star we also have
07:00 - to add first ability we already have
07:02 - that the enemy then we have the Speedy
07:03 - enemy the armored enemy The Siege
07:05 - monster the peons the old one the a Vine
07:10 - ball the vineer the zombie King the bomb
07:12 - but now we also need the icons cuz we
07:14 - need to see which ones which
07:16 - so let's put the icons up there which is
07:19 - just a duplicate of
07:22 - the um first abilities so let's just
07:26 - duplicate
07:27 - that and then the second abilities third
07:31 - abilities and then we'll name it icon
07:34 - one so this is just the icon on top
07:37 - one icon
07:41 - one icon
07:43 - 2 second ability and then the Thor
07:45 - ability icon
07:49 - three and then we also have the you win
07:52 - game over you win you lose so let's do
07:55 - that
07:56 - too game over you win you lose so plain
08:02 - red big
08:04 - words game
08:13 - over and then the you wi you lose so
08:16 - duplicate
08:18 - that you
08:22 - win of course it has to be
08:26 - green and then we also have
08:30 - the death
08:32 - ray the death ray so the death ray is
08:35 - actually just the the life steal if you
08:39 - watched our a
08:41 - our uh demo CU we do have a life steel
08:46 - mechanic for
08:48 - the uh zombie
08:50 - King I want more
08:53 - thicker there we go yeah that's just the
08:57 - death
08:58 - ray that he'll Steal Our Lives from and
09:00 - gain it for himself so that's all the
09:02 - Sprites but I'll show you like a small
09:05 - nib on how to draw each of them so the
09:07 - elf Warrior we have two parts we have
09:10 - the regular elf Warrior if we didn't
09:12 - select it and then this is the selected
09:13 - one with the yellow outline you just put
09:15 - a yellow Square the elf Warrior it's
09:18 - pretty simple you see this is a
09:19 - rectangle you can just put a rectangle
09:21 - just like that rotate it you can put
09:24 - another rectangle and then um reshape it
09:26 - from the sides to make a hat then same
09:28 - with the Circle kind of reshape that in
09:31 - add the circle so and paint it well I'm
09:34 - sure you guys are great artists so you
09:36 - guys can also draw this and then this is
09:37 - just a line a really thick line that
09:39 - just goes through as it's bow I tried
09:41 - draw a little arrow there and then so we
09:45 - have the deselect version and the
09:46 - selected version so the Grand Master
09:48 - Mage we have the stars and I'll show you
09:51 - how to draw one of these Stars cuz the
09:52 - parenthesis also use it so it's just
09:55 - basically like this you use the reshape
10:00 - and you get a star well that looks
10:03 - really bad cuz I was kind of doing it
10:04 - quick and same with the Grand Master
10:07 - Mage just draw a little circle have put
10:10 - some little eyes use reshape tool
10:12 - reshape is your biggest friend here make
10:15 - a little staff so make a little mustache
10:19 - and then for the fairy queen we have so
10:22 - I actually use lines for it hair like um
10:26 - for her hair instead of like the alw I
10:28 - used to paint tool but this one's just
10:30 - lines like that and then the crown is
10:32 - just a you know it's just a square and
10:37 - then you can kind of like reshape it
10:38 - like that to make a crown type of shape
10:41 - and that's the crown you just put a
10:44 - little design in the middle same with
10:45 - the fairy queen just put a little um
10:48 - square and then reshape it Square then
10:51 - Circle reshape it and then make it into
10:53 - the fairy queen and then just right on
10:55 - top for each of them um elf Warrior mage
10:59 - a Grandmaster Mage and fairy que well
11:01 - you can name them anything you want but
11:02 - that's what I Nam them and each of
11:05 - course each of them have the selected
11:06 - version
11:07 - too Sprite one is where determines where
11:10 - like the arrows are going to go so just
11:12 - make a green square just like that wait
11:16 - so you just saw me write it pretty
11:18 - straightforward confirm buttons the
11:20 - player so it's basically just a circle
11:24 - with the hat and some I just put a paint
11:27 - tool and I just painted some hair I
11:29 - added a rectangle and then this is
11:31 - another rectangle but reshaped and I
11:33 - have the little triangle so if you don't
11:36 - know how to make a triangle just like
11:37 - this you take one of the corners and Bam
11:40 - click backspace so take a square click
11:44 - the reshape tool click one of these
11:46 - corners and backspace and then you have
11:49 - the
11:50 - triangles and that's for the elf Warrior
11:53 - and then the grandmas Mage same
11:55 - basically same thing we have the
11:57 - rectangle oh yeah and the Stars take it
12:00 - from your portrait here and put it here
12:03 - here and then you can also have the hair
12:05 - and the hat which is just kind of just
12:08 - like a circle like this you can reshape
12:09 - it like just like that so and then we
12:13 - have the fairy queen so you can take
12:15 - your crown from the thing or make a new
12:16 - one like I think I also did that and
12:18 - just put it on and then she throws a a
12:22 - strong wooden ship so draw this wooden
12:25 - ship and have her hair and then we have
12:28 - the teleport beam which is just you know
12:32 - I might have also used the star for this
12:34 - one and kind of expanded it changed it
12:36 - all blue you see has a star texture and
12:38 - then we have like a um rectangle just
12:42 - like that or Circle uh and then that's
12:45 - just the teleport beam when the fery
12:48 - changes teleports to somewhere else and
12:51 - that's where where it is the
12:54 - projectile um
12:56 - rectangle triangle and then
12:59 - three rectangles and then just go curve
13:01 - in the
13:02 - insides the projectile Mage attack
13:06 - use um the stars from the portrait this
13:10 - uh the wood chip you can use it from her
13:14 - poer portrait so yeah and the placement
13:18 - of these are pretty important so place
13:20 - your arrow over around here so it
13:23 - doesn't like get stuck in the edge or
13:25 - anything so keep it like that same with
13:27 - this you can put it out here just about
13:31 - like that much don't put it in the
13:32 - middle or else it might like spawn on
13:34 - the player and that's not what we want
13:37 - here same with the wood
13:39 - chip and then we have the apprentices
13:41 - star which is just the star color blue
13:44 - the first ability yeah also put it like
13:47 - that um cuz this is the elf Warrior
13:49 - verce
13:50 - ability this is the major verce ability
13:53 - also put it like that so it doesn't
13:54 - spawn on the Mage it doesn't look bad
13:56 - the third ability can go anywhere
13:57 - because this is just on the fairy queen
13:59 - so the second ability we have the death
14:02 - arrow that goes up there the
14:05 - lightning uh put it more closer to that
14:08 - side but it really doesn't can't just be
14:10 - in the middle or like back here then we
14:13 - have the teleport
14:15 - arrow and not Arrow but wood chip and
14:18 - then put it up here same with the third
14:21 - ability well with third ability I
14:22 - actually got a Griffin and I have the
14:25 - Griffin a b c costumes so it can rotate
14:29 - between those three and then I have The
14:33 - Apprentice um just a circle two little
14:36 - tiny circles take the star from the
14:38 - thing from the portrait and then add the
14:40 - little turret mouth and a little hat the
14:43 - defender chip which is the fairy Queen's
14:46 - thirdd is just the long uh Circle
14:51 - reshape it put the crown on it then the
14:54 - enemy pretty
14:55 - straightforward we have the circle arm
14:58 - arm circle circle and we have three
15:00 - variations for the enemy so this is when
15:02 - the enemy gets teleported back by the
15:05 - mag's power the first ability and this
15:08 - is when it gets teleported back by the
15:09 - fairy Queen's um shield and then this
15:13 - is uh the Speedy enemy and then we have
15:16 - the three variations as well this is
15:18 - just um what I was testing the with
15:21 - different concepts on how to make the
15:23 - zombie King but these three are just
15:26 - what we're
15:27 - using
15:29 - uh the regular the teleport back and the
15:31 - fairy
15:32 - queen teleport then we have the armored
15:36 - enemy this one has the most costumes we
15:38 - also don't need that or that but so this
15:40 - one we have the regular armored enemy
15:42 - and then this is when the lightning
15:44 - dismantles its armor and then this is
15:46 - when the fairy queen teleports it back
15:49 - with the uh fairy shield and this is
15:51 - when it gets teleported back by the Mage
15:53 - shield and this is if it get teleported
15:55 - back without any armor on so five
15:58 - costumes
15:59 - and The Siege monster we have here uh we
16:01 - just take the armored enemy and then we
16:04 - keep that turn one of their eyes uh
16:07 - black put the arm over there and I just
16:10 - made it like a little knife and the
16:15 - flags just rectangle put the enemy on it
16:19 - little uh rectangle with curved
16:23 - insides then the peons just the Speedy
16:27 - enemy and they have more Health than
16:29 - speed en butut and then just
16:33 - the the the Mage teleport because it
16:36 - gets killed by The Shield
16:38 - anyway and then the old one which is
16:42 - just this one which Circle and then the
16:47 - Hat the mustache and then the wand and
16:49 - then the dead emo the Dead version I
16:52 - think I need show you that for The Siege
16:53 - monster too Siege monster it has this
16:55 - one where it summons peons and then this
16:57 - one when it dies and the Old One's
16:59 - Vineyard this one is just random circles
17:03 - kind of like like this and like this and
17:05 - you can reshape them and make them
17:07 - different color and have like different
17:09 - outlines which is just how I made the
17:10 - vineard and then I used a variety of
17:14 - triangles like that and I just made them
17:18 - into a ball the vineard I just took the
17:21 - regular Vine ball and I just duplicate
17:22 - it three times change the outline color
17:24 - change the color so you can tell the
17:26 - difference and then the zombie came
17:29 - um it will
17:30 - have it will have three costumes this
17:33 - one was just when I setting Concepts
17:35 - again but we have these costumes we have
17:39 - the regular one the Dead one and then
17:41 - the healing one once that steals your
17:42 - life and it also summons peons but
17:45 - there's no costume for that then the
17:47 - bomb we have bomb the one costume one
17:51 - it's just a bunch of these circles wait
17:53 - I'll just take the color just a bunch of
17:55 - these circles and I just reshaped it
17:57 - like that
17:58 - to make the fire and then I added
18:01 - different color variations and then
18:04 - since I want to show the bomb fading
18:05 - away we have this one this one and then
18:07 - this one finally then we have the
18:09 - mysterious man um I put a circle and
18:15 - then the hat and I made these knives but
18:17 - they were not that hard to make you just
18:19 - need a rectangle another rectangle a
18:21 - circle see rectangle here Circle a
18:24 - circle and then I have a rectangle here
18:27 - and a triangle up here here with the
18:29 - line in the middle so that's just not
18:30 - that hard and I duplicated it twice and
18:32 - then we have that then we have the poof
18:34 - costume where it comes up and goes away
18:37 - where we have just the rectangle curving
18:40 - the insides and have the circles the
18:43 - healing one where he's giving you health
18:45 - is this one where just put the rectangle
18:48 - curved in and then took the fairy
18:49 - Queen's heels and then the icons are
18:52 - just the exact same as the uh first
18:55 - second third ability that you win you
18:57 - lose and then you saw me draw the death
18:58 - ray um death ray
19:02 - be yeah oh you win you lose so you win
19:08 - you lose all right so those are all this
19:11 - rights that just took a while but let's
19:13 - get started on the
19:15 - project so yeah so that's it for the
19:20 - first part of the series it was just
19:24 - just demonstrating all the Sprites and
19:26 - also on the Speedy enemy I was testing
19:29 - Concepts again thinking this thing would
19:31 - make it teleport the fairy Shield make
19:33 - it teleport but we only need these two
19:34 - I'm sorry because the fairy Shield does
19:37 - not teleport the Speedy enemy instead it
19:39 - kills it
19:40 - so that's it for this video I was just
19:44 - showing you how to draw all the Sprites
19:46 - just a quick explanation brief
19:48 - explanation on the Sprite drawing and if
19:51 - you do not want to draw it you can go to
19:53 - my project I think I will have this
19:58 - shared I have my hero War shared but you
20:01 - can take it take the Sprites and delete
20:03 - the code or you can just um draw it
20:07 - yourself because it's just mainly just
20:10 - circles with arms so it's not that hard
20:13 - and you should be creative you know
20:14 - drawing is
20:16 - great anyway please like share oh one
20:20 - last thing we have to rename this hero
20:23 - war or anything you want to name it but
20:25 - and this is my teaching version I
20:26 - already have my regular version I
20:27 - already shared so go check that out on
20:29 - gum ball
20:30 - 098 and I'll just name this teaching
20:33 - because I'm teaching you guys this one

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's kids playground here and today we're back with another video in scratch and today we'll be coding the first part of hero War so we already made the demo of this game um yesterday so uh please check that out on our Channel if you haven't already uh it's going to be on our Channel hero War demo this is going to be the first part in the making of the game there's probably going to be multiple Parts in this making of the game so I made my new project here of course first thing we're going to do is delete the scratch cat and let's find the backdrops so the backdrop I'm using for the hero selection menu is the Galaxy backdrop so that's just the hero selection and then for the second backdrop I do have it exported my backpack because I actually drew it myself so I have all the Sprites in my backpack but I'll give you a small tutorial on how to draw each of them so the backdrop I think it's back here somewhere yeah the backdrop right here so this is the backdrop which is when you're fighting the enemies so it's pretty simple um yeah uh it's just it's just this is a grass part you just put like a square you can reshape it all that good stuff and then these are flowers I just took those from my um spring games that I made it's pretty it's yeah you just put some petals like a circle and then you color it and then you have a little like re line you use a line or a rectangle and then you just reshape it same with these but flowers are kind of optional just for decoration and I just have a sand Square over here that's just behind the grass to a little sand patch which looks pretty cool in my opinion so I'm going to get all the Sprites in but I'll show you like a small representation and how to draw them so our first Sprite is the elf Warrior portrait which is in the selection menu when it's in the galaxy and there's also the Mage portrait there's also the fairy portrait and we have to use Sprite one to shoot the arrows and then so let's just put all the Sprites in first that's the first thing we're going to do and so we have a weight Sprite Which we'll make that later and then I'll export everything in my backpack then we have the player which I think is somewhere here so I just added it back in my backpack sorry for that it's going to load up and we have the player um then we have the projectile that goes with it so of course the projectile has the three for each three players so let's just finish up the Sprites here we have the weight Sprite wait oop wait so in blue or any color you want so we're going to have the weight Sprite Which it says wait wait before using this item that's the so this this um script uses the weight before using this item and the this item is in progress ress messages so this item is in progress so that's basically the weight one then we have so let's just rename this as weight wait oh wait and I'll put it I'll put it right here here or well it is part of that so I put here and then we have all the confirm buttons so button three I think this is more simpler than making a clone button like for all three so we're going to put a confirm button black confirm that's the confirm button so there's going to be confirm button for each of them because the Clone seems a little bit more harder uh so we have the confirm button for the elf which I'll I'll change all the sizes later but the confirm button and we'll put that over here confirm button I'll just confirm L and then we have the other confirm button oh No Just duplicate this other confirm button confirm Mage we have another one put that over there confirm Queen oh parentheses Queen so yeah we had that done and then after that we also have to add the apprentices star because the Grand Master M's third ability is a turret which is really strong against armored enemies so we have to draw an apprentices star which I'll just take from here but I'll show you how to draw everything um feel free to skip that if you do not want to learn and you in say you can come to my project Gumball 098 and I have a hero War shared so you can take my Sprite up and put it in your backpack and use it for your own so we have the apprentices star it's Blue by the way so after that apprentices star star star I'm going to turn it some light blue zoom in a little bit there we go that's the apprentices star we also have to add first ability we already have that the enemy then we have the Speedy enemy the armored enemy The Siege monster the peons the old one the a Vine ball the vineer the zombie King the bomb but now we also need the icons cuz we need to see which ones which so let's put the icons up there which is just a duplicate of the um first abilities so let's just duplicate that and then the second abilities third abilities and then we'll name it icon one so this is just the icon on top one icon one icon 2 second ability and then the Thor ability icon three and then we also have the you win game over you win you lose so let's do that too game over you win you lose so plain red big words game over and then the you wi you lose so duplicate that you win of course it has to be green and then we also have the death ray the death ray so the death ray is actually just the the life steal if you watched our a our uh demo CU we do have a life steel mechanic for the uh zombie King I want more thicker there we go yeah that's just the death ray that he'll Steal Our Lives from and gain it for himself so that's all the Sprites but I'll show you like a small nib on how to draw each of them so the elf Warrior we have two parts we have the regular elf Warrior if we didn't select it and then this is the selected one with the yellow outline you just put a yellow Square the elf Warrior it's pretty simple you see this is a rectangle you can just put a rectangle just like that rotate it you can put another rectangle and then um reshape it from the sides to make a hat then same with the Circle kind of reshape that in add the circle so and paint it well I'm sure you guys are great artists so you guys can also draw this and then this is just a line a really thick line that just goes through as it's bow I tried draw a little arrow there and then so we have the deselect version and the selected version so the Grand Master Mage we have the stars and I'll show you how to draw one of these Stars cuz the parenthesis also use it so it's just basically like this you use the reshape and you get a star well that looks really bad cuz I was kind of doing it quick and same with the Grand Master Mage just draw a little circle have put some little eyes use reshape tool reshape is your biggest friend here make a little staff so make a little mustache and then for the fairy queen we have so I actually use lines for it hair like um for her hair instead of like the alw I used to paint tool but this one's just lines like that and then the crown is just a you know it's just a square and then you can kind of like reshape it like that to make a crown type of shape and that's the crown you just put a little design in the middle same with the fairy queen just put a little um square and then reshape it Square then Circle reshape it and then make it into the fairy queen and then just right on top for each of them um elf Warrior mage a Grandmaster Mage and fairy que well you can name them anything you want but that's what I Nam them and each of course each of them have the selected version too Sprite one is where determines where like the arrows are going to go so just make a green square just like that wait so you just saw me write it pretty straightforward confirm buttons the player so it's basically just a circle with the hat and some I just put a paint tool and I just painted some hair I added a rectangle and then this is another rectangle but reshaped and I have the little triangle so if you don't know how to make a triangle just like this you take one of the corners and Bam click backspace so take a square click the reshape tool click one of these corners and backspace and then you have the triangles and that's for the elf Warrior and then the grandmas Mage same basically same thing we have the rectangle oh yeah and the Stars take it from your portrait here and put it here here and then you can also have the hair and the hat which is just kind of just like a circle like this you can reshape it like just like that so and then we have the fairy queen so you can take your crown from the thing or make a new one like I think I also did that and just put it on and then she throws a a strong wooden ship so draw this wooden ship and have her hair and then we have the teleport beam which is just you know I might have also used the star for this one and kind of expanded it changed it all blue you see has a star texture and then we have like a um rectangle just like that or Circle uh and then that's just the teleport beam when the fery changes teleports to somewhere else and that's where where it is the projectile um rectangle triangle and then three rectangles and then just go curve in the insides the projectile Mage attack use um the stars from the portrait this uh the wood chip you can use it from her poer portrait so yeah and the placement of these are pretty important so place your arrow over around here so it doesn't like get stuck in the edge or anything so keep it like that same with this you can put it out here just about like that much don't put it in the middle or else it might like spawn on the player and that's not what we want here same with the wood chip and then we have the apprentices star which is just the star color blue the first ability yeah also put it like that um cuz this is the elf Warrior verce ability this is the major verce ability also put it like that so it doesn't spawn on the Mage it doesn't look bad the third ability can go anywhere because this is just on the fairy queen so the second ability we have the death arrow that goes up there the lightning uh put it more closer to that side but it really doesn't can't just be in the middle or like back here then we have the teleport arrow and not Arrow but wood chip and then put it up here same with the third ability well with third ability I actually got a Griffin and I have the Griffin a b c costumes so it can rotate between those three and then I have The Apprentice um just a circle two little tiny circles take the star from the thing from the portrait and then add the little turret mouth and a little hat the defender chip which is the fairy Queen's thirdd is just the long uh Circle reshape it put the crown on it then the enemy pretty straightforward we have the circle arm arm circle circle and we have three variations for the enemy so this is when the enemy gets teleported back by the mag's power the first ability and this is when it gets teleported back by the fairy Queen's um shield and then this is uh the Speedy enemy and then we have the three variations as well this is just um what I was testing the with different concepts on how to make the zombie King but these three are just what we're using uh the regular the teleport back and the fairy queen teleport then we have the armored enemy this one has the most costumes we also don't need that or that but so this one we have the regular armored enemy and then this is when the lightning dismantles its armor and then this is when the fairy queen teleports it back with the uh fairy shield and this is when it gets teleported back by the Mage shield and this is if it get teleported back without any armor on so five costumes and The Siege monster we have here uh we just take the armored enemy and then we keep that turn one of their eyes uh black put the arm over there and I just made it like a little knife and the flags just rectangle put the enemy on it little uh rectangle with curved insides then the peons just the Speedy enemy and they have more Health than speed en butut and then just the the the Mage teleport because it gets killed by The Shield anyway and then the old one which is just this one which Circle and then the Hat the mustache and then the wand and then the dead emo the Dead version I think I need show you that for The Siege monster too Siege monster it has this one where it summons peons and then this one when it dies and the Old One's Vineyard this one is just random circles kind of like like this and like this and you can reshape them and make them different color and have like different outlines which is just how I made the vineard and then I used a variety of triangles like that and I just made them into a ball the vineard I just took the regular Vine ball and I just duplicate it three times change the outline color change the color so you can tell the difference and then the zombie came um it will have it will have three costumes this one was just when I setting Concepts again but we have these costumes we have the regular one the Dead one and then the healing one once that steals your life and it also summons peons but there's no costume for that then the bomb we have bomb the one costume one it's just a bunch of these circles wait I'll just take the color just a bunch of these circles and I just reshaped it like that to make the fire and then I added different color variations and then since I want to show the bomb fading away we have this one this one and then this one finally then we have the mysterious man um I put a circle and then the hat and I made these knives but they were not that hard to make you just need a rectangle another rectangle a circle see rectangle here Circle a circle and then I have a rectangle here and a triangle up here here with the line in the middle so that's just not that hard and I duplicated it twice and then we have that then we have the poof costume where it comes up and goes away where we have just the rectangle curving the insides and have the circles the healing one where he's giving you health is this one where just put the rectangle curved in and then took the fairy Queen's heels and then the icons are just the exact same as the uh first second third ability that you win you lose and then you saw me draw the death ray um death ray be yeah oh you win you lose so you win you lose all right so those are all this rights that just took a while but let's get started on the project so yeah so that's it for the first part of the series it was just just demonstrating all the Sprites and also on the Speedy enemy I was testing Concepts again thinking this thing would make it teleport the fairy Shield make it teleport but we only need these two I'm sorry because the fairy Shield does not teleport the Speedy enemy instead it kills it so that's it for this video I was just showing you how to draw all the Sprites just a quick explanation brief explanation on the Sprite drawing and if you do not want to draw it you can go to my project I think I will have this shared I have my hero War shared but you can take it take the Sprites and delete the code or you can just um draw it yourself because it's just mainly just circles with arms so it's not that hard and you should be creative you know drawing is great anyway please like share oh one last thing we have to rename this hero war or anything you want to name it but and this is my teaching version I already have my regular version I already shared so go check that out on gum ball 098 and I'll just name this teaching because I'm teaching you guys this one so I don't get confused so anyway please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below what else games you want and I'll see you guys next time
